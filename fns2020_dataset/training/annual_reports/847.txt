Report of the directors
The directors have pleasure in presenting the  
annual report and accounts for the year ended  
31 December 2009. 
Principal activities and business review 
The principal activities of the group can be found on 
pages 8 to 25.
Information fulfilling the requirements of the business 
review is contained in the business and financial  
review on pages 8 to 35, which includes details of 
AMEC’s development and performance during the  
year including business acquisitions and disposals,  
its position at the year end and the outlook for the 
future, and is included in this report by reference. 
Key events 
On 4 December 2009, AMEC communicated its Vision 
2015 and its target to achieve earnings per share of 
greater than 100 pence per share in 2015. Vision 2015 
is described elsewhere in this document, including on 
pages 8 and 9 and further details are available on 
amec.com.
To support the implementation of Vision 2015 and 
achieve greater collaboration and efficiencies, the 
Natural Resources and Power & Process divisions 
were brought together under the leadership of  
Neil Bruce, with effect from the same date.
A number of new contracts were won in 2009, evidence 
of the strength of AMEC’s customer relationships and 
support of AMEC’s future growth. Details can be found 
on pages 11, 16 and 22.
During the year, the group made five acquisitions 
including GRD Limited, an Australian listed company, 
and divested two small businesses. All these events 
are described further on page 26.
Dividends 
The directors have proposed a final ordinary dividend  
in respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 of  
11.6 pence per share. This final dividend will be payable 
on 1 July 2010 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 28 May 2010.
Dividends paid during the year comprised an interim 
dividend of 5.3 pence per share, and a final dividend of 
10.1 pence per share, both in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2008.
Share capital 
The issued share capital of the company as at 
31 December 2009, movements during the year and 
the rights attaching to the shares are set out in note 22 
on page 94 and the rights and obligations attaching to 
the shares are more fully set out in the articles of 
association of the company. Each share carries the 
right to one vote at general meetings of the company 
and no right to a fixed income. There are no restrictions 
on voting rights.
Between 10 January 2007 and 31 December 2009, 
AMEC had purchased 7.8 million shares in the market 
to be held in treasury at a total cost of £53.5 million. 
During the year, 0.86 million shares were purchased 
and 0.35 million shares were utilised in satisfying 
awards made under the UK and International SAYE 
share option plans. As at 31 December 2009, 6.1 million 
shares remained in treasury, all of which have been 
allocated to the group’s SAYE scheme awards to date. 
Given the likelihood of further share schemes in 2010 
and in the future, AMEC intends to purchase in the 
market sufficient shares to meet the needs of the 
schemes in anticipation of future payouts. The 
purchases will be made throughout the year outside 
close periods and any shares purchased will be held  
as treasury shares.
A resolution will be proposed at the annual general 
meeting to extend the authority of the directors to 
make market purchases of up to 10 per cent of the 
company’s shares within prescribed limits. 
Authority was granted to the directors at the 2009 
annual general meeting to allot up to £55,432,854  
of ordinary share capital of which up to £8,314,928 
could be allotted for cash other than by way of a rights 
issue. At the forthcoming annual general meeting,  
it is proposed that the article relating to the directors’ 
powers to allot securities will be amended so that  
it refers to the relevant sections of the Companies  
Act 2006. In addition, an ordinary resolution will be  AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 39 
Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 
proposed to grant the directors authority pursuant to 
Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot shares 
or grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any 
security into shares up to a nominal amount of 
£55,330,800 (the “Section 551 Amount”), such authority 
to apply in substitution for all previous authorities 
pursuant to Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985.  
A special resolution will also be proposed, to empower 
the directors to allot equity securities wholly for cash as 
if Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 did not 
apply to any such allotment: (i) up to an aggregate 
nominal amount equal to the Section 551 Amount  
in connection with a pre-emptive offer; and (ii) up to  
an aggregate nominal amount of £8,299,620 (the 
“Section 561 Amount”) otherwise than in connection 
with a pre-emptive offer, with such authority to be  
in substitution for all previous powers pursuant to  
Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985. 
The directors have no present intention of issuing any 
shares other than in respect of the exercise of share 
options. No issue will be made which will effectively 
alter the control of the company without the prior 
approval of shareholders in general meeting.

Report of the directors continued
It is of key importance to AMEC that it engages with 
employees to ensure they understand the direction in 
which the company is going, are committed to AMEC’s 
values, and are empowered to propose and make 
changes to improve how AMEC operates. AMEC 
employees embody its knowledge, brand and 
reputation and it is through their activities, day by day, 
that AMEC delivers on its business objectives and 
commitments to shareholders, customers and the 
wider community. An annual survey of employee 
opinion is conducted and AMEC is committed to 
sharing and acting on the outcomes (see page 6). 
AMEC provides a wide range of mechanisms for 
employees to share knowledge, to be kept informed  
of developments within AMEC and to raise issues and 
discuss matters of concern, whether face to face or 
using electronic means.
Respect for cultural diversity and commitment to equal 
opportunities are included among AMEC’s Guiding 
Principles which are incorporated into management 
policies and processes worldwide. AMEC policy is to 
recruit from the widest labour market, to determine 
the careers of all employees solely on merit and to 
make judgements about employees free from the 
effects of bias and prejudice. 
As part of AMEC’s equal opportunities policy, 
procedures are in place that are designed to provide for 
fair consideration and selection of disabled applicants, 
to ensure they are properly trained to perform safely 
and effectively, and to provide career opportunities 
which allow them to fulfil their potential. When an 
employee becomes disabled in the course of their 
employment, AMEC will actively seek to retain them 
wherever possible by making adjustments to their 
work content and environment or by retraining them  
to undertake new roles.
AMEC operates a savings related share option plan 
that allows employees to participate in AMEC’s share 
price growth. This is open to employees in all major 
countries of operation who meet a minimum service 
qualification. Offers to participate are currently being 
made on an annual basis. 
Except for interests under share option schemes,  
the Performance Share Plan and the Transformation 
Incentive Plan, details of which are contained in the 
directors’ remuneration report on pages 47 to 57,  
no director as at 31 December 2009 had any other 
interests, beneficial or otherwise, in the share capital  
of the company or any of its subsidiaries. 
On 4 January 2010, Mr Bruce acquired 546 ordinary 
shares pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan  
in lieu of the interim dividend paid on that date.
There were no other changes in the directors’  
interests in the share capital of the company between 
31 December 2009 and 4 March 2010. 
No director was materially interested in any contract  
of significance to AMEC’ s businesses.
As at the date of this report, individual indemnities  
have been provided to the directors, under which the 
company has agreed to indemnify the directors to the 
extent permitted by law in respect of all liabilities to 
third parties arising out of, or in connection with, the 
execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities  
as directors of the company, any of its associated 
companies or any other company of which the director 
serves as a director at the request of the company. 
These indemnities are Qualifying Third Party Indemnity 
Provisions as defined in Sections 232-234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and copies are available for 
inspection at the registered office of the company 
during business hours on any weekday except  
public holidays. 
Employees 
In 2009 AMEC employed on average 21,193 people 
worldwide (including agency staff). 
AMEC gives high priority to the development of 
employees to ensure that it has the necessary skills 
and behaviours to deliver its strategic business 
objectives and to provide for management succession. 
Processes are in place across the group for the regular 
and consistent review of employee performance, 
development and management succession. Common 
training needs are delivered through the AMEC 
Academy (see page 6 for further information). AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 41 
Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 
AMEC uses a risk management process which is 
incorporated into the AMEC Mandatory Procedures 
described below. The process involves the identification 
of risks at the gross and current level by projects and 
businesses. The risks are recorded in risk registers to 
enable the net positions to be pro-actively managed. 
Quarterly risk review meetings comprising 
representatives from the businesses and functions 
discuss business and functional risks. The highest 
risks in terms of probability and impact are then 
elevated to the AMEC plc risk register . The plans for 
mitigation of such risks are also reviewed. 
The risk management and internal control processes 
are complemented by an annual control risk self-
assessment exercise carried out by the principal 
businesses. This covers major risks, particularly safety, 
health and environment, legal, commercial and 
contractual, financial, information technology and 
human resources. The results are reviewed by the 
board, through both the audit committee and the 
executive directors, and as part of the ongoing  
internal audit process. 
AMEC Mandatory Procedures and 
Delegated Authorities
AMEC’s businesses are managed on a decentralised 
basis. While the board has retained reserve powers,  
the day-to-day management has been passed to the 
business leaders within defined authority limits. The 
management philosophy is to empower the business 
leaders to take the actions necessary to deliver the 
company’s operational business objectives within  
the defined Mandatory Procedures and Delegated 
Authorities, which set out the standards AMEC 
employees and agency staff are to achieve and  
adhere to. 
This framework provides for an effective control 
structure and following changes to the delegated 
authorities in October 2007, there continues to be  
a clear link between the levels of risk associated  
with tenders and the delegated authority limits.
Corporate governance
The board is responsible to shareholders for the 
management of AMEC and for the protection of its 
assets. As such, it is ultimately responsible for 
implementing AMEC’s systems of internal control and 
for reviewing their effectiveness. These systems are 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and consequently 
can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material mis-statement or loss. 
The board, through the committees described on 
pages 43 to 45 and at its regular meetings, has a 
continuous process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing significant risks faced by AMEC, including 
strategy, major projects to be undertaken, significant 
acquisitions and disposals, as well as entry to and exit 
from different markets. Where appropriate, business 
decisions are reached following a structured and 
documented review of potential opportunities and 
threats, taking steps designed to manage or mitigate 
any residual risk exposure. Principal business risks  
are set out in the business and financial review on 
pages 31 to 35. 
The threats and opportunities associated with major 
tender submissions are reviewed by the risk review 
committee. Following changes in October 2007 to the 
delegated authorities referred to below, 2008 and 2009 
have seen a significant increase in the number of 
tenders reviewed by this committee.
As part of Operational Excellence, a set of AMEC 
Contracting Principles have been introduced in order  
to provide greater control over operational activities. 
Under these principles, specified key contractual  
risks are required to be referred to the risk review 
committee, representing a general strengthening  
of corporate governance in this area. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 42
Report of the directors continued
The company does not combine the role of Chairman 
and Chief Executive. The Chairman is responsible for 
the running of the board, with the Chief Executive being 
responsible for running the group and implementing 
board strategy and policy. This ensures a clear division 
of responsibilities at the head of the company,  
so that no individual has unfettered powers of decision. 
The independent non-executive directors review  
the relationship between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive each year to ensure that the relationship  
is working effectively. 
The non-executive directors are all considered to be 
independent by the board. They are not employed by 
the company in any capacity, nor have they been in  
the past. Mr Faithfull has acted as the board’s senior 
independent director since 13 May 2009.
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring 
that board procedures are followed and all directors 
have access to his advice and services. 
The board has a schedule of matters reserved for  
its approval covering areas such as company strategy, 
the appointment of key executives, approval of group 
accounts, approval of the business plan, budget and 
financial policies, review of operating results, risk 
management strategy, ensuring the effectiveness  
of governance practices, succession planning and 
significant capital expenditure. The board is supplied  
in a timely manner with information which enables  
it to discharge its duties. 
An internal review of the effectiveness of the board  
and its committees was carried out during the year  
by the Chairman by way of a review of questionnaires 
completed at his request by individual directors. 
Findings were considered by the board as part of its 
review of both collective and individual board member 
performance. No material changes were identified  
as being necessary as a result of this exercise. The 
independent non-executive directors also met privately 
without the Chairman present and also with either  
or both of the Chairman and Chief Executive being 
present to consider management performance and 
succession issues. A formal process exists for the 
directors to take independent professional advice  
and receive appropriate training in the course of their 
duties, at the company’s expense, organised by the 
Company Secretary. 
AMEC has interests in a number of joint ventures  
and joint arrangements. Controls within these entities 
may not be reviewed as part of AMEC’ s formal 
corporate governance process because of the joint 
management responsibilities but are reviewed by the 
joint venture boards and as part of AMEC’s normal 
internal audit process. 
Consequently, AMEC complied with the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance throughout 2009.
Printed copies of the Combined Code on  
Corporate Governance can be obtained free of  
charge from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC 
Publications), by email customer .services@cch.co.uk  
or telephone +44 (0)20 8247 1264 or online at  
www.frcpublications.com. Further details of  
AMEC’s Mandatory Procedures can be obtained by 
contacting the Company Secretary at the Company’s 
registered office.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders 
Mr Green-Armytage, Chairman, wrote to all major 
shareholders in April 2009 reminding them that  
he and the senior independent director, Mr Faithfull, 
were available for meetings or telephone calls with 
them if required. The Chairman attends preliminary 
results presentations. The Chairman and Mr Faithfull 
are available to attend, if requested, one-on-one 
meetings with major shareholders. The Chairman had 
a number of such meetings with major shareholders 
during 2009. Mr Faithfull has also met with major 
shareholders in his capacity as chairman of the 
remuneration committee.
An in-depth annual perception study of investors’ 
views, prepared by an independent third party, is 
presented to all board members, who also receive 
unexpurgated feedback reports following shareholder 
meetings or events together with all material brokers’ 
research notes on the company .
The board 
The board comprises the non-executive Chairman, 
three executive directors and four independent 
non-executive directors. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 43 
Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 
  The committee considers the appointment, 
re-appointment, removal, remuneration and terms 
of engagement of the external auditor and makes 
recommendations to the board. It discusses the 
scope and planning of the external audit and reviews 
the outcome of the external audit and any formal 
communications from the external auditor, including 
internal control reports.
  The committee also formally reviews and monitors 
the external auditor’s independence and objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements and makes recommendations to the 
board. During 2009, a review, co-ordinated on behalf 
of the committee by the Head of Internal Audit,  
was carried out. The audit committee also monitors 
the implementation of the policy on the engagement 
of the external auditor to supply non-audit services. 
This policy follows the guidelines set out by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England  
and Wales and clearly defines what work can  
and cannot be performed by any group company’s 
statutory auditor . It also sets out the necessary 
approval process for those non-audit services  
that are acceptable. 
  All non-statutory audit or non-compliance tax 
services provided by the auditor are reported to  
the audit committee. During 2009, the fees paid  
to the company’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc and its 
associates, for non-audit work were £0.6 million 
(2008: £0.7 million), which comprised £0.6 million 
relating to taxation and £nil for other work (2008: 
£0.7 million and £nil). In addition, KPMG also 
received fees of £0.1 million in 2008 in relation  
to corporate finance transactions.
  All additional KPMG fees were approved in 
accordance with AMEC’s policy covering non-audit 
services. As a result of the application of this  
policy and additional discussions with the external 
auditor, the directors do not believe that KPMG’s 
independence has been compromised because  
of their additional work on behalf of the company. 
Board committees 
The board has formally delegated specific responsibilities 
to various board committees, all of which have written 
terms of reference.
The remit of each committee is set out below. The 
quorum is three directors, save for the audit and 
remuneration committees where the quorum is two 
directors. Full details of the constitution and remit of 
the audit, nominations, remuneration and compliance 
and ethics committees can be found at amec.com/
aboutus/culture/corporategovernance.htm.
The committees chaired by non-executive directors  
are as follows:
 Audit committee – Reviews the integrity, including 
O O
the material financial reporting judgements, of  
the group and company’s accounts, including the 
preliminary and interim results, related report  
and accounts and Stock Exchange announcements 
and any other formal announcements in connection 
with the company’ s financial performance, and 
recommends their approval to the board.
  It also reviews the group’s internal financial controls 
and, in conjunction with the board, the internal 
control and risk management systems.
  The committee has unrestricted access to company 
documents and meets with the internal and external 
auditors, and any other relevant member of staff, 
without the executive directors being present, as 
necessary. The Head of Internal Audit formally 
reports to the committee chairman.
  It reviews the Head of Internal Audit’s regular  
reports and carries out an annual assessment of the 
internal audit function’s effectiveness. In 2009, this 
exercise was carried out on behalf of the committee 
by the Head of Internal Audit. No material changes 
were identified as being necessary as a result of  
this exercise. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 44
Report of the directors continued
 Compliance and ethics committee – Considers, 
O O
approves and reviews AMEC’ s Code of Business 
Conduct (“the Code”) at least annually and authorises 
its implementation. The Code covers any member of 
AMEC’s staff or management, particularly those who 
have or could have any influence over contractual 
relationships of any kind.
  The committee considers all matters relating to the 
appointment of AMEC’s Chief Compliance Officer and 
reviews the Officer’s regular reports on compliance 
and ethics matters to the committee. It also 
considers the scope and planning of all compliance 
activity within AMEC.
  In the event of an actual or suspected breach of  
the Code, a member of the committee would take 
responsibility for and manage any investigation  
into the relevant matters. The committee may use 
internal resources and is also authorised to employ 
external consultants on AMEC’s behalf to carry out 
any such investigation.
  As announced on 26 October 2009, AMEC has paid  
a sum of £4.9 million (plus associated costs) in 
respect of a Civil Recovery Order following the 
identification by the company of certain irregular 
payments received between November 2005 and 
early 2007. External advisers were immediately 
appointed and AMEC self-reported its findings to  
the Serious Fraud Office in March 2008. As part of 
AMEC’s commitment to maintain the highest ethical 
standards, an independent consultant has been 
appointed to review and report on AMEC’s ethics  
and compliance programme.
 Nominations committee — Makes recommendations 
O O
to the board concerning the appointment or 
termination of a director or the Company Secretary 
and, in the case of a non-executive director and the 
Chairman, the extension of an existing appointment.
  The committee also regularly reviews board 
succession planning, in conjunction with reports from 
the Chief Executive and Group Human Resources 
Director on senior management succession planning, 
so as to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills 
is maintained both within AMEC and on the board. 
 Remuneration committee — Sets, and reviews as 
O O
necessary, the overall contractual and remuneration 
framework for the Chairman and for the executive 
directors, Persons Discharging Managerial 
Responsibility and the Company Secretary, (together 
the “designated executives”), including pension 
rights and annual bonus incentives. 
  It considers and determines such other matters 
relating to the engagement of the Chief Executive 
and the designated executives, including matters 
relating to the enforcement of their service contracts 
and payments on termination, as the Chairman and 
Chief Executive respectively refer to the committee. 
  It agrees the terms to be offered to a proposed new 
Chairman or executive director . 
  It reviews the salaries of the designated executives 
annually and the Chairman biennially, or more 
frequently as is deemed necessary by the committee 
chairman. It agrees the performance targets of 
designated executives and the levels of bonus  
to be paid to them under the annual bonus  
incentive scheme.
  It determines and agrees with the Chief Executive 
the remuneration policy and structure, including 
annual bonus, for other functional executives and 
senior operational executives immediately below 
board level. 
  It approves performance targets, participation and 
level of awards for any executive share-based 
incentive scheme.  AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 45

Disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who held office at the date of approval  
of this directors’ report confirm that, so far as they  
are each aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and each

to have taken as a director to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the company’ s auditor is aware of that information.
The above statement is made in accordance with 
Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Auditors
The board will be recommending the appointment  
of Ernst & Y oung as AMEC’s auditors to shareholders 
at the forthcoming AGM. The recommendation

Directors’ remuneration report
The purpose of this report is to inform shareholders 
regarding the company’s policy and practice on 
executive remuneration and the associated governance 
arrangements. As well as the required statutory 
disclosures, we aim to give a forward-looking statement 
of approach within the bounds of commercial 
confidentiality. During the year, there were no 
significant changes to remuneration structures. There 
were several important changes to the governance 
arrangements as detailed below.
Remuneration committee structure  
and processes
During the year, the members of the remuneration 
committee comprised Mr T W Faithfull (chairman), 
Ms E P Airey (up to May), Mr J Green-Armytage, 
Ms M O Hesse and Mr S R Thompson (since June). In 
considering the matters within its remit, the committee 
takes account of recommendations from the Chairman 
in respect of the Chief Executive and from the Chief 
Executive in respect of other executive directors. It is 
advised both by the company’s Human Resources 
department and independently by Hewitt New Bridge 
Street (HNBS). The terms of engagement between the 
company and HNBS are available from the Company 
Secretary. Neither HNBS nor its parent, Hewitt 
Associates, undertakes any material additional work 
for the company .
At the committee’s instigation, a review of its terms of 
reference was carried out during the year and several 
changes were agreed by the Board, the most notable  
of which was to extend the remit of the committee to 
cover, in addition to Executive Directors, all Persons 
Discharging Managerial Responsibility and the 
Company Secretary. The committee’s terms of 
reference can be found at amec.com/aboutus/culture/
corporategovernance.htm or on request from the 
Company Secretary. 
The committee has an established annual agenda of 
items that it considers at regular meetings normally 
held in March, August and November . In addition the 
committee meets as required to deal with specific 
items. During 2009, the committee had one such 
additional meeting in June, primarily to discuss 
communication with shareholders and the changes to 
terms of reference referred to above. The Chairman of 
the board and the Chairman of the committee also held 
a series of meetings in September and October 2009 
with major shareholders to discuss both remuneration 
matters and general governance. 
Risk review
During the year, the committee established a process 
to conduct on an annual basis a formal risk review of 
its remuneration policy and practice and carried out 
the first such review. The committee has received input 
from its independent remuneration consultant. 
Risks have been broken down into the following four 
categories:
1 . Strategic risk The risk arising from the 
misalignment of reward strategy 
to the company’s short and 
long-term goals
2. Behavioural risk The risk arising from the 
misalignment of the reward policy 
to desired behaviours
3. Financial risk The risk surrounding financial 
controls
4. Governance risk The risk surrounding the 
oversight of policy and practices
Overall, the committee was satisfied that the 
remuneration policy and practice is well-aligned  
with the needs of the business, that incentives are 
appropriately targeted, and that the structure and 
quantum of individual packages, in aggregate, are 
achieving a reasonable balance between near- and 
longer-term objectives. There is a strong focus on 
share ownership by executives supported by the 
company’s share ownership guidelines, the matching 
provisions of the Performance Share Plan, and the 
requirement under the Transformation Incentive Plan 
for participants to put up a significant stake of  
their own shares. The committee believes these  
measures help to build consistent alignment with 
shareholder value. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 48
Remuneration policy 
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect  
of the executive directors and other senior executives, 
is to offer remuneration packages that are competitive 
in the markets in which the executives are based  
and which: 
 allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives  
O O
of high calibre; and
 incentivise senior executives to achieve superior 
O O
short-term performance and increase the medium 
and long-term value of AMEC for its shareholders 
and encourage executives to build and retain a 
significant shareholding in AMEC. 
More specifically the policy is to set: 
 base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-
O O
market salary practices of a relevant group of oil 
equipment and services and other engineering and 
business support services companies and other 
companies regarded as comparable by virtue of, 
amongst other factors, revenue, employee numbers, 
market capitalisation and/or geographic coverage
 annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement 
O O
of stretching business and individual performance 
targets and offer the opportunity to achieve upper 
quartile annual cash earnings if these targets  
are achieved
 longer-term incentives which align the interests of 
O O
shareholders and senior executives by offering the 
latter the opportunity to accumulate significant 
capital over a period but only if stretching financial 
and shareholder value targets are met
whilst accepting that within this policy there will be 
occasions when higher and/or lower levels of 
remuneration will be appropriate in particular 
circumstances. 
The policy means that a substantial proportion of 
executive directors’ remuneration is performance 
related. The chart opposite shows the balance between 
fixed and incentive based payments for the Chief 
Executive at threshold and maximum performance 
levels. Threshold values are 25 per cent of maximum 
annual bonus and 25 per cent vesting of the 
Performance Share Plan award. Maximum assumes 
achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting  
The committee concluded that there is a satisfactory 
balance between reward and retention, whilst 
recognising the existence of some risk at the expiry of 
the one-off Transformation Incentive Plan in 2011. 
However, the committee believes that this is acceptable 
given the parallel and continuing annual awards under 
the Performance Share Plan.
Setting of performance targets by the committee in 
connection with incentive plans is integrated with the 
company’s overall processes for budget approval and 
broader risk assessment. Whilst the committee itself 
does not exercise any oversight of financial statements 
and controls, procedures are in place for verification  
of the financial measures on which incentives are 
awarded by both the audit committee of the board,  
and the external auditors. The committee believes that 
these arrangements are satisfactory .
The committee considered whether the company is 
exposed to significant risk given that the Executive 
Annual Bonus Plan and the Performance Share Plan 
do not currently provide for an explicit deferral of award 
or claw-back. (The rules of the Transformation 
Incentive Plan do provide for claw-back in the event  
of a restatement of the accounts.) The committee 
concluded that the current arrangements are 
satisfactory: the weighting of the annual bonus relative 
to the performance share plan is not excessive; the 
committee has wide discretion to adjust targets and/or 
determine achievement; and there is an implicit 
deferred aspect in the investment/matched shares 
element of the Performance Share Plan. The 
committee will review these questions as part of any 
future proposals to change incentive arrangements.

Relationship between remuneration 
practice and strategic objectives
In applying the above policy each year, particularly in 
relation to setting targets under the annual and 
longer-term incentive arrangements, the committee 
has regard to the need to ensure alignment with the 
company’s strategic objectives. 
In 2009, the key objectives which informed this and the 
results achieved were:
 Achieving further significant profit growth beyond 
O O
the level of our record results in 2008 even against  
a background of global economic downturn – EBITA 
increased by 13 per cent to a new record level (see 
page 3) on reduced revenue
 Continuing progress towards our increased margin 
O O
objective of at least 8.5 per cent by 2010 – actual 
margin 8.2 per cent (see page 3)
 Realising the benefits of the Operational Excellence 
O O
programme – implemented ahead of schedule with 
annual benefits of £18 million in 2009 (see page 9)
 Cash generation from ongoing operations – actual 
O O
operating cash inflow of £257.0 million (see page 3).
For 2010, priority will be given to:
 Delivering 2010 margin of at least 8.5 per cent 
O O
 Enhancing our capabilities and geographic footprint 
O O
 Making progress towards the delivery of Vision 2015

 Through assured revenue growth, margin 
improvements, tax efficiencies and a more 
efficient capital structure, achieving earnings per 
share of greater than 100 pence in 2015 
 See page 8 for further details.
Annual bonuses 
The executive directors and other senior executives 
participate in the AMEC Executive Annual Bonus Plan 
which generates bonus payments calculated by 
reference to a mix of targets that varies from year to 
year and between individuals to reflect the business 
priorities associated with each role.

Executive directors’ base salaries 
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed 
annually, having regard to personal performance, 
company performance, competitive market practice as 
determined by external research and pay levels more 
broadly within the company. The following annual 
salaries have been approved from 1 January 2010: 
S Y Brikho £875,500 +3.0%
I P McHoul £486,675 +3.0%
N A Bruce £340,000 + 1 7.2%
The increases for Messrs Brikho and McHoul, taking 
account of their continued excellent personal 
performance, are in line with those for staff elsewhere 
in the company. Mr Bruce’s increase additionally 
reflects both his appointment to the board in January 
2009 (he received no increase in his salary at that time) 
and the major increase in his responsibilities (to 
include Power & Process as well as Natural 
Resources) towards the end of 2009.
In the senior management group, no executive has  
a base salary higher than any executive director .  AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 50
Awards are also made to a wider group of executives, 
with lower levels of face value to reflect seniority and 
contribution. Awards are normally made in April 
following the publication of the annual result.
These restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined 
performance conditions are met. 50 per cent of the 
award is based on total shareholder return and 50 per 
cent on growth in earnings per share both measured 
over three years. 
For the total shareholder return portion, the 
requirement for full vesting is for AMEC to be ranked  
in the top quartile of the chosen comparator group.  
No awards will vest if AMEC’s performance is below 
median. If AMEC’s performance is at the median,  
25 per cent of the award will vest. Between the median 
and the upper quartile, the award will vest on a 
straight-line basis. In addition, to ensure that AMEC’s 
underlying performance is properly reflected, no 
awards will vest unless there has been sustained 
financial growth of the company. 
The composition of the comparator group is reviewed 
at the time of each set of awards. For those made in 
2009, it comprised 30 companies, including AMEC, 
that, at the time of grant, were in the FTSE Business 
Support Services, Industrial Machinery and Oil 
Equipment and Services sub-sectors, and whose 
market capitalisations in February 2009 lay broadly  
in the range £400 million to £4,500 million. Lists of  
the comparator companies for the awards that  
vested during the year and those awards currently 
outstanding can be obtained on request from the 
Company Secretary. 
For the earnings per share growth portion of the 
awards made in 2009, the vesting range is RPI* plus  
3 per cent per annum (25 per cent of that part of  
the award vests) to RPI plus 10 per cent per annum 
(100 per cent of that award vests). This is determined 
by comparing the earnings per share achieved in the 
final year of the three year period with that in the year 
immediately before the start of the period e.g. for the 
awards made in 2009, the final year will be 2011 and 
the base year is 2008. 
Further information on 2009 bonus payments is set  
out in the notes to the table of directors’ remuneration 
on page 55. Although there was good overall 
performance, with record levels of profit, as described 
in the previous section on page 49, this did not reach 
the very demanding stretch targets set at the start of 
the year . Accordingly, overall bonus payments for 2009  
are lower than 2008.
For 2010, the breakdown of bonus potential (as a 
percentage of base salary) against targets for each 
executive director is as follows:
S Y Brikho I P McHoul N A Bruce
AMEC plc EBIT A 70% 55% 25%
AMEC plc cash flow 25% 20% –
Divisional EBIT A – – 30%
Divisional cash flow – – 20%
Other strategic 
objectives 30% 25% 25%
Maximum potential 
bonus (if all targets 
were fully met) 1 25% 100% 100%
For both EBITA and cash targets, the proportion of 
maximum payable for achieving budget is two-thirds 
and at threshold is one quarter . The 2010 threshold 
EBITA target has been set to require further growth 
over 2009 achieved EBITA, with the higher targets 
representing an even greater stretch. 
Executive directors’ long-term incentives 
AMEC’s principal long-term incentive arrangement is 
the Performance Share Plan. AMEC’s policy is to make 
annual awards to executive directors, and to a small 
number of other senior executives just below board 
level, of restricted shares with a value at the time of 
award of up to 175 per cent of base salary. In addition, 
participants are offered a further award, up to a 
maximum of 25 per cent of base salary, of five 
restricted shares for every three purchased by the 
executive, which are held on their behalf as investment 
shares for the three year performance period. To the 
extent that investment shares are withdrawn before 
the end of the performance period, the matching 
shares lapse.

Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 
Transformation Incentive Plan
A one-off incentive plan, designed to give additional 
impetus to the transformation of the company and to 
aid the retention of selected key top executives through 
this critical period, was approved by shareholders in 
2008. The plan requires participants to invest and hold 
AMEC shares for a three year period. These investment 
shares are then matched on an up to four-to-one basis. 
Vesting of matched shares is on a sliding scale based 
on achievement in 2010 of operating margins in excess 
of previous targets. Matching begins at nil for a margin 
of 8 per cent and increases on a straight line basis to 
full vesting for a margin of 10 per cent. In addition, 
awards will not vest at all if 2010 earnings per share 
are less than 53 pence and the remuneration 
committee will expect to see earnings per share of at 
least 60 pence for full vesting to occur . It will assess  
the earnings per share growth between these levels 
and the quality of the operating margin achieved when 
deciding whether to scale back awards from the 
vesting level created by the operating margin. There  
is a claw-back provision if the 2010 accounts had to  
be restated because of inaccuracy .
Mr Brikho and Mr Bruce participate in the plan with 
investment shares equal to 150 per cent and 100 per 
cent respectively of their base salaries at the time of 
initial invitation in May 2008. Mr McHoul participates in 
the plan with investment shares equal to 100 per cent 
of base salary at the time of his later invitation as part 
of his joining terms. Eleven other executives participate 
with investment shares ranging from 14 to 100 per cent 
of their salaries at the times of invitation. 
For the 2007 and 2008 awards absolute targets were 
set that required higher levels of growth over the 
relevant three year periods. This portion of the 2007 
awards was set to vest in full if 2009 earnings per share 
were at least 38 pence (which has been achieved).  
This portion of the 2008 awards will vest if 2010 
earnings per share are at least 53 pence.
Earnings per share are adjusted for certain defined 
items and calculated on a consistent basis between 
base and final years. The remuneration committee 
takes appropriate external advice on the method of 
calculation and any adjusting and potentially adjusting 
items. Performance against the total shareholder 
return targets is calculated independently and reviewed 
by the remuneration committee. 
Awards made prior to 2007 were subject to a primary 
total shareholder return performance condition with  
an earnings per share underpin. For the awards made 
in 2006, the total shareholder return achieved over the 
relevant three year period was 138.7 per cent which 
resulted in full vesting during 2009.
In the event of a change of control, awards will 
normally vest to the extent that the performance 
conditions have been met at the date the change of 
control takes place.
Shares held by the trustee of the Performance Share 
Plan, BWCI Trust Company Limited, may be voted at 
their discretion.
The company has a second scheme in place – the 
Executive Share Option Scheme. No awards have been 
made under this scheme since 2004. 
In addition, executive directors may participate in 
relevant all-employee share plans which provide 
options, without performance conditions, related to 
savings contracts with an aggregate limit of £250 
savings per month.  AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 52
Executive directors are able to opt-out of further 
pension accrual, particularly if this would provide 
benefits in excess of the Life Time Allowance, in  
which case they will receive a non-bonusable salary 
supplement of 20 per cent of basic salary in lieu of 
further pension accrual. If individuals do accrue 
benefits in excess of the Life Time Allowance, the 
payment of the associated tax liability will be the 
responsibility of the individual and not AMEC. 
Mr Brikho is a member of both pension schemes with 
a normal pension age of 60 and also has the benefit of 
additional life assurance in respect of earnings above 
the cap. Mr Bruce also participates and has a normal 
pension age of 62 with a historic right to draw accrued 
pension from age 57 onwards without actuarial 
reduction for early payment. Mr McHoul has not joined 
the schemes and therefore receives the 20 per cent 
supplement on his full salary and also has the benefit 
of life assurance of four times his basic salary .
Employment related benefits, principally the provision 
of a company car or car allowance, long-term disability 
and private medical expenses insurance, are also 
provided to executive directors. Mr Brikho also received 
a temporary relocation allowance for the first three 
years of his employment up to September 2009.  
Mr Bruce, who is based in Aberdeen, receives an 
accommodation allowance in respect of nights spent  
in London and therefore does not claim associated 
costs as business expenses.
Executive directors’ employment contracts 
AMEC’s policy is that on appointment, executive 
directors will normally be employed with a notice 
period of one year . In the event of employment being 
terminated with less notice than this, damages will be 
determined at the time taking account of the 
circumstances leading up to the termination and the 
individual’s duty to mitigate his loss. Executive directors 
are required to give six months’ notice of resignation. 
This policy is followed for all current executive 
directors. Executive directors have a contractual 
retirement age of 65.
Share Ownership Guidelines
Guidelines are in place requiring executive directors 
and other senior executives (which include all such 
participants in the Transformation Incentive Plan) to 
build up over a three year period and retain a holding  
of AMEC shares received from incentive plans or 
purchased by them. The level of targeted shareholding 
is two times salary for executive directors and one 
times salary for other senior executives. Details of 
directors’ interests at the end of 2009 are listed on  
page 39. Based on the average share price during 
December 2009, these shareholdings represented 
825 per cent of base salary for Mr Brikho and 197 per 
cent for Mr Bruce. Mr Bruce has until the end of 2011 
to meet the two times target and is well ahead of his 
previous requirement as a non-board member . 
Mr McHoul’s position against the guideline will be 
reported at the end of 2010.
Up to date details of the interests and transactions of 
current directors are available on AMEC’s website. 
Executive directors’ pension arrangements
Executive directors are eligible for membership of the 
AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and to have top-up 
benefits provided through the AMEC Executive Pension 
Scheme. The schemes are both defined benefit 
schemes registered with HMRC* and also provide for 
life assurance cover and dependants’ pensions. 
Executive directors who participate in the pension 
schemes accrue pension rights which are linked to  
the length of pensionable service and to pensionable 
salary. Executive directors who remain in employment 
beyond normal pension age are able to continue to 
accrue further pension rights. Pensionable salary in 
respect of scheme membership up to the end of 2007 
is based on final salary and in respect of membership 
from 2008 onwards is based on career average 
revalued earnings. Benefits are restricted to a scheme 
earnings cap which was set at £131,250 for the 2009/10 
tax year (£135,000 for 2010/11). In recognition of this 
restriction of pension benefits, participating executive 
directors also receive a taxable supplement of 20 per 
cent of their base salaries above the cap. There are no 
unregistered pension arrangements.

Service contracts for executive directors do not provide 
for extended notice periods, other enhancements or

the remuneration committee’s intention to introduce 
such provisions.
The service contracts of the executive directors are 
available for review at the Company’s registered office 
in accordance with relevant legislation.
External directorships 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external 
directorships without the prior approval of the board. 
Mr McHoul is a director and Chairman of the audit 
committee of Premier Foods plc for which he received 
remuneration of £70,000 during the year .
Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for 
determining the remuneration and other terms of 
appointment of the chairman of the board. The 
agreement with the chairman, Mr Green-Armytage, 
runs to 20 January 2011. It may be terminated earlier 
than this on six months’ written notice of resignation or 
with payment of six months’ fees if the board withdraw 
their agreement to his continuing to serve as chairman, 
other than for gross misconduct. The chairman’s fee 
was increased to £245,000 per annum from 1 January 
2010, having been last reviewed in January 2008: an 
increase of 8.9 per cent over the two years. He is 
provided with life assurance cover of four times the 
AMEC pensions scheme earnings cap. He does not 
participate in other benefit schemes or in any of the 
incentive schemes of the group.
Non-executive directors 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is 
determined by the chairman and the executive 
directors under delegated authority from the board. 
The non-executive directors receive fees for their 
services and do not participate in any of the incentive or 
benefit schemes of the group. Fees were reviewed with 
effect from 1 January 2010, having been last reviewed 
in January 2008, and increased by 5 per cent.
The current fee is £52,500 per annum. There is an 
additional fee of £7,875 per annum paid to the senior 
independent director . The policy with regard to fee 
structure is to reflect time commitment and 
responsibility of the various roles.
Additional fees are paid for chairing committees of the 
board as follows:
Audit committee £13,125 
Remuneration committee £7,875 
Compliance and ethics committee £5,250
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional 
fees for other duties undertaken on behalf of the 
company . No such fees were paid in 2009. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 54

Performance graph 
The committee believes that the index for the FTSE All 
Share Oil Equipment and Services sub-sector, in which 
AMEC is classified, is the most appropriate comparison 
for relative share price performance. However since 
that index is only available from 2006 onwards, it is not 
currently possible to present a five year comparison. 
Accordingly the graph below shows the value, by 31 
December 2009, of £100 invested in AMEC plc on 31

maximum for the cash flow component and a strong but below maximum score for his personal targets, covering leadership in improving 
health, safety and environmental performance, implementation of the Operational Excellence programme, senior management succession 
and the development of Vision 2015. 
  The bonus for Mr McHoul represented 56 per cent of base salary (2008 – 98.5 per cent). He also received just over threshold for the profit and 
maximum for the cash flow components and a strong but below maximum score for his personal targets which related primarily to the 
implementation of specific Operational Excellence objectives.
  The bonus for Mr Bruce represented 70 per cent of his base salary for the period after appointment as a director . His financial measures for  
the year were based partly on the group results, for which he received payments to the same levels as Messrs Brikho and McHoul, and partly 
on the performance of the Natural Resources division for which he received above target but below maximum for the profit component and

(i)  For the PSP awards made in 2006, AMEC met the performance conditions for maximum vesting. The share prices at the respective dates  
of vesting were 755.0 pence for Mr Brikho and 735.0 pence for Mr Bruce. 
(ii)  The awards made to Mr Brikho in October 2006 under the RP replaced share awards in his former employer which were forfeit on joining 
AMEC and were not subject to performance conditions. The share price at the date of vesting was 542.5 pence.
(iii)  The terms and conditions of the PSP and TIP awards have not been varied during the year .
(iv)  The vesting date for awards under the TIP is three years from the date the individuals lodged their investment shares. The maximum number 
of shares that individuals could invest was based on salary and share price at the time of invitation. The award indicated represents the 
maximum four times match. 
(v)  The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2009 was 792.0 pence (2008: 492.75 pence). Had the outstanding restricted shares detailed 
above vested in full on that date the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been:  
Mr Brikho £10,460,000, Mr Bruce £3,212,000 and Mr McHoul £3,983,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all relevant performance 
conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.
(vi)  The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 492.25 pence to 866.0 pence.
(vii)  The register of directors’ interests, which is open to inspection at the company’ s registered office, contains full details of directors’ 
shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans.

Notes 
(i)  Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year . 
(ii)  Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Trustee’ s transfer value basis.
(iii)  The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption  
service terminated at the year-end. It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the director’ s contribution.
(iv)  The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company  
and directors, such as stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting the director’s contribution. 
(v)  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
(vi)  Mr Bruce was appointed a director on 21 January 2009. The pension figures shown include his service with the company before he was

dividend declared each year in August, and payable early 
in the January following the year to which it relates, is no 
longer recognised as a liability at 31 December and is only 
accounted for when paid. The comparative balance sheets 
as at 31 December 2008 and 1 January 2008 have been 
restated for this change, resulting in an increase in net 
assets of £17.3 million (1 January 2008: £15.1 million).  
This change has no impact on reported cash flow or 
income statement for the years then ended.
IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (revised 
September 2007) was adopted during the year . This results  
in a number of terminology changes and changes in 
presentation and disclosure, including presenting a 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income to 
replace the consolidated statement of recognised income 
and expense, and the inclusion of a consolidated 
statement of changes in equity. IAS 1 also requires the 
inclusion of a balance sheet as at 1 January 2008, and 
related notes, following the reclassification of the tax on 
the retirement benefit asset, and restatement in respect  
of interim dividends, referred to above.
The consolidated income statement for the year ended 
31 December 2008 has been restated to adjust the reported 
results of the Nuclear businesses from a full absorption 
costing basis under which all overheads were included in 
cost of sales to a basis consistent with the rest of the group 
whereby fixed overheads are reported as administrative 
expenses. Cost of sales for the year ended 31 December 
2008 has been reduced by £25.1 million and administrative 
expenses increased by the same amount. These 
restatements have no impact on the group’ s reported profit.
Basis 	 of 	 pr epar ation
The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the 
nearest hundred thousand. They are prepared on the 
historical cost basis except that derivative financial 
instruments and retirement benefit assets and liabilities 
are stated at fair value.
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect  
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making the judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is

In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), 
the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared

IFRIC 14 “IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, 
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction” 
was adopted during the year . Adoption of this 
interpretation has no impact on the group’ s reported 
results or net financial position. On adoption, tax on the 
retirement benefit asset has been reclassified as deferred 
tax on the balance sheet. This deferred tax liability had 
previously been taken into account in measuring the 
retirement benefit asset. The impact of restating the 
balance sheet for this change in presentation is to increase 
the retirement benefit asset as at 31 December 2008 by 
£58.0 million (1 January 2008: £86.7 million), decrease the 
deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2008 by £26.7 million 
(1 January 2008: £38.1 million), and increase the deferred 
tax liability as at 31 December 2008 by £31.3 million 
(1 January 2008: £48.6 million).

The non-core Built Environment businesses were sold 
during 2007 and are treated as discontinued operations. 
Other discontinued operations include pipeline 
construction businesses which were sold during 2006 and 
2007, and SPIE, which was sold in 2006. The cash flows  
of discontinued operations are fully consolidated within 
AMEC up to the date of sale and the assets and liabilities 
of discontinued operations that had not been sold at 
31 December 2007 were shown separately on the 
consolidated balance sheet as at that date. The results  
and other disclosures in respect of discontinued 
operations are shown in note 9.
During 2006 IFRIC 12 on service concession arrangements 
was issued. This interpretation has been adopted for use 
in the EU in respect of accounting periods beginning on or 
after 29 March 2009. In view of this, the directors consider 
that it remains appropriate to apply the approach set out in 
Appendix Note F of the UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 
“Reporting the substance of transactions” in determining  
the accounting model to be applied to AMEC’ s PPP 
activities. This involves applying a “risks and rewards” test 
to determine whether a non-current asset or finance 
debtor model should be followed. The directors do not 
expect this accounting policy to be significantly different to 
that under IFRIC 12. 
Going 	 c onc ern
The directors are satisfied that the group has adequate 
resources to operate for the foreseeable future.  
At 31 December 2009 the group held net cash of 
£742.7 million and forecasts for the business indicate 
average weekly net cash for 2010 of £700 million.
The group will finance operations and growth from its 
significant existing cash resources. The group’ s policy 
aims to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate 
amount of funding to meet both current and future 
forecast requirements consistent with the group’ s budget 
and strategic plans. The group had committed facilities of 
£315 million available as at 31 December 2008, of which 
£122 million lapsed on 27 February 2009 and £193 million 
on 9 July 2009. 
Given the group’ s significant cash resources the decision 
was made during 2008 not to renew the facilities.  
This decision has been kept under review during 2009. 
However, appropriate facilities will be maintained to  
meet ongoing requirements for performance related 
bonding and letters of credit.
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit 
risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform under  
the contract. AMEC manages these risks by ensuring that 
surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25-30  
mainstream banks and with each counterparty up to a  
pre-approved limit. These limits are set at prudent levels 
1 	 Signific ant 	 ac c ounting 	 policies 	continued
revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, 
and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting 
policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation 
arise from the accounting for defined benefit pension 
schemes under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’, for long-term 
contracts under IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and for 
provisions under IAS 37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities 
and contingent assets’.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for  
in accordance with the advice of independent qualified 
actuaries but significant judgements are required in 
relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension 
increases, discount rate, inflation, investment returns and 
member life expectancy that underpin their valuations.  
For AMEC, these assumptions are important given the 
relative size of the schemes that remain open.
A significant amount of the group’ s activities is undertaken 
via long-term contracts. These contracts are accounted for 
in accordance with IAS 11 which requires estimates to be 
made for contract costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and 
revenues on the latest available information, which includes 
detailed contract valuations. In many cases the results 
reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual 
obligations which span more than one reporting period. 
Contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of 
uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events 
and often need to be revised as events unfold and 
uncertainties are resolved. The estimates of contract costs 
and revenues are updated regularly and significant changes 
are highlighted through established internal review 
procedures. In particular, the internal reviews focus on the 
timing and recognition of incentive payments and the age 
and recoverability of any unagreed income from variations to 
the contract scope or claims. The impact of the changes in 
accounting estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
When accounting for provisions for litigation and other items 
the group has taken internal and external advice in 
considering known legal claims and actions made by or 
against the group. It carefully assesses the likelihood of 
success of a claim or action. Appropriate provisions are 
made for legal claims or actions against the group on the 
basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for those 
which in the view of management are unlikely to succeed. 
In accordance with IFRS 5, the post-tax results of discontinued 
operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated 
income statement.  AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 66

The purchase method is used to account for all business 
combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the 
purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 is 
capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both 
annually and when there are indications that its carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is not amortised.
Cash 	 and 	 c ash 	 equiv al ents 	 and 	 short-t erm 	 inv es tments
Cash comprises cash balances and deposits repayable

Cash equivalents are other deposits with a maturity  
period of three months or less from date of acquisition; 
convertible without an undue period of notice and not 
subject to a significant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of AMEC’ s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Deposits with a maturity period of more than three 
months from the date of acquisition are classified as 
short-term investments.
Disc ontinued 	 oper ations 	 and 	 as sets 	 and 	 liabilities

A discontinued operation is a separate major line of 
business or geographic area of operations that has either 
been disposed of or is held for sale, is a subsidiary acquired 
exclusively with a view to resale or is part of a plan to 
dispose of a major line of business or geographical area. 
An operation is classified as a discontinued operation in the 
year that the above criteria are met. The comparative 
income statement is restated to show the operation as 
discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
Non-current assets (or disposal groups comprising assets 
and liabilities) that are expected to be recovered primarily 
through sale rather than through continuing use are 
classified as held for sale. Immediately before 
classification as held for sale, the assets (or components 
of a disposal group) are remeasured in accordance with 
the group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the 
assets (or disposal group) are measured at the lower of 
their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any 
impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to 
goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on 
pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to 
inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, and 
retirement benefit assets, which continue to be measured 
in accordance with the group’s accounting policies.

Moody’ s, Standard & Poors and Fitch and have been 
reviewed in light of the recent market turbulence.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless 
otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated accounts.
Basis 	 of 	 c onsolidation
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by AMEC. Control is 
achieved where AMEC has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated accounts from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
A joint venture entity is an entity over whose activities 
AMEC has joint control, established by contractual 
agreement. An associate is an entity in which AMEC has 
significant influence, but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. The consolidated accounts include the 
group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of 
associates and joint venture entities on an equity 
accounted basis. The results of joint venture entities and 
associates are included in the consolidated accounts from 
the date that joint control or significant influence 
commences until the date that it ceases.
Losses of a joint venture or an associate are recognised 
only to the extent of the group’s interest in the joint venture 
or associate, unless the group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the joint venture or associate.
Jointly controlled operations and assets where each party 
has its own separate interest in particular risks and 
rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable 
share of the assets it controls, liabilities and cash flows it 
incurs and its share of the income measured according to 
the terms of the arrangement.
Bid 	 c os ts
Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group is 
appointed as the preferred bidder . Subsequent to 
appointment as preferred bidder, bid costs are 
capitalised and held on the balance sheet provided the 
award of the contract is virtually certain and it is expected 
to generate sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the 
bid costs. Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial 
close, the proceeds are applied first against the balance of 
costs included in the balance sheet, with any additional 
amounts treated as deferred income and released to 
profit over the period of the contract. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 67 
Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised. 
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in  
the hedging reserve remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs. Where the hedged item is a non-
financial asset, the cumulative gain or loss in the hedging 
reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset 
when the asset is recognised. In other cases the 
cumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve is 
transferred to profit or loss in the same period that  
the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as  
a hedge against the variability in fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised 
immediately in the income statement. The carrying value 
of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value 
that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is 
normally carried at amortised cost) and any gains or 
losses on re-measurement are recognised immediately  
in the income statement. 
When hedge accounting ceases, any adjustment made  
to the carrying amount of the hedged item as a 
consequence of the fair value hedge relationship, is 
recognised in the income statement over the remaining 
life of the hedged item.
F or eign 	 curr encies
At an individual entity level, transactions in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the entity are 
translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate 
ruling at the day of the transaction. Entities which have 
multiple foreign currency transactions apply the average 
rate for the month as an approximation of the exchange 
rate on the day of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date and any foreign exchange differences arising 
are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities are measured in terms of historical 
cost and are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction.
On consolidation, the results of entities with a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated into sterling 
using a monthly average exchange rate. The net assets  
of such entities are translated into sterling at the closing 
exchange rate with any gain or loss also reported in the 
translation reserve.
1 	 Signific ant 	 ac c ounting 	 policies 	continued
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale 
and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are 
recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised  
in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Empl o y ee 	 benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The group’ s net obligation in respect of defined benefit 
pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid 
price) is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at 
the balance sheet date on AA rated corporate bonds that 
have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the 
group’ s obligations. The calculation is performed by a 
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity 
in the year in which they arise.
Financial 	 ins truments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. 
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the 
instrument.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at 
amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially 
and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on 
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge 
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss 
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is 
determined by reference to market values for similar 
financial instruments or by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The sale and purchase of derivative financial instruments 
are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a 
hedge against the variability in cash flows of a recognised 
asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, 
any gain or loss on the effective part of the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging 
reserve. The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the 
hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 68

Leases	
Operating lease costs are charged to the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Long-t erm 	 c ontr acts
As soon as the outcome of a long-term contract can be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are 
recognised in the income statement in proportion to the 
stage of completion of the contract. The stage of 
completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work 
performed. When the outcome of a contract cannot be 
estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent 
of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be 
recoverable, and contract costs are expensed as incurred. 
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
Revenue in respect of variations to the contract scope and 
claims is recognised when it is probable that it will be 
received and is capable of being reliably measured. 
Incentive payments are recognised when a contract is 
sufficiently far advanced that it is probable that the 
required conditions will be met and the amount of the 
payment can be reliably measured.
The gross amounts due from customers under long-term 
contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits, less 
provision for recognised losses and progress billings. These 
amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due 
from customers are included in trade and other payables.
Net 	 financing 	 inc ome
Net financing income comprises interest receivable on 
funds invested, interest payable, the unwinding of 
discounted balances and foreign exchange gains and 
losses. Interest income and interest payable are 
recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using the 
effective interest method.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the 
cost of purchased and constructed property, plant and 
equipment, until the relevant assets are brought into 
operational use. The only material projects where this  
has occurred are those held in the group’ s investments  
in joint ventures which are involved in PPP projects to 
finance, design and build assets and operate them on 
behalf of the customer .
1 	 Signific ant 	 ac c ounting 	 policies 	continued
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign 
currency net investments and any foreign currency 
borrowings, or forward contracts used to hedge those 
investments, are taken to a translation reserve. They are 
recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the disposal 
or closure of a business. The cumulative translation 
difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero 
as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS.
Impairment
The carrying values of all of the group’ s assets other than 
inventories, balances on long-term contracts and deferred 
tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  
If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying 
value then the recoverable amount is estimated and 
compared to the carrying amount. For goodwill and assets 
not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is 
estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the 
carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Int angibl e 	 as sets 	 other 	 than 	 goodwill
Intangible assets acquired by the group, which include 
software, customer relationships, trademarks and order 
backlogs are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. The cost of an intangible asset 
acquired in a business combination is fair value at date  
of acquisition.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated lives of intangible assets held at 
31 December 2009 are as follows:
Software Three to five years 
Customer relationships Two to ten years 
Brand/trademarks Up to five years 
Other Up to six years
Inv ent ories
Inventories, including land held for and in the course  
of development, are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Development land and work in progress is included at cost 
less any losses foreseen in completing and disposing of 
the development. Cost includes cost of acquisition and 
development to date, including directly attributable fees 
and expenses net of rental and other income attributable 
to the development. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 69

which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the award. The fair value of the award is measured using  
a valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the awards were granted. The 
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of shares that vest except where 
non-vesting is due to share prices or total shareholder 
return not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
T axation
Income tax expense comprises the sum of current tax 
charge and the movement in deferred tax. 
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable 
profit for the year using tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years. T ax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in 
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity .
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences with deferred tax assets being 
recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed  
at each balance sheet date and adjustments made to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient profits 
will be available.
Assets and liabilities are not recognised if the  
temporary differences arise from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where 
the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted to apply when 
the deferred tax asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and it is intended that they will be settled on  
a net basis.

Pr operty, 	 plant 	 and 	 equipment
Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost 
of property, plant and equipment as at 1 January 2004, the 
date of transition to adopted IFRS, was determined by 
reference to its fair value at that date.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and 
equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual 
value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its 
estimated useful life. Reviews are made annually of  
the estimated remaining lives and residual values of 
individual assets.
The estimated lives used are:
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Leasehold land and buildings The shorter of the lease

success of a claim or action. Appropriate provisions are 
made for legal claims or actions against the group on the  
basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for 
those, which in the view of management are unlikely  
to succeed.
Re v enue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for 
goods and services supplied to external customers. It 
includes the group’ s share of revenue from work carried 
out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion  
of the contract, as set out in the accounting policy for 
long-term contracts.
Revenue from developments activities is recognised on 
completion of a signed sale agreement after all material 
conditions have been met.
Shar e-based 	 payments
There are various share-based payment arrangements 
which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares; 
these awards are granted by AMEC. The fair value of 
awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment

Goodwill is not directly attributable to business segments and the group does not monitor goodwill by segment in its 
internal management reporting. The most significant elements of unamortised goodwill arose on the acquisition of 
AGRA Inc. in April 2000. The ongoing operations of AGRA Inc. fall into each of the current business segments. Due to the 
time elapsed since this acquisition and the restructuring of the Group and its reported business segments over the last 
few years, it is not possible to allocate this goodwill on a reasonable basis between the current operating segments. 
Unallocated net assets/(liabilities) principally comprise assets and liabilities relating to the pension schemes, dividends, 
derivative financial instruments and taxation and are not directly related to the activities of the segments. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 72

The group is required to test its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if 
indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of GRD Limited has not been tested in 2009 due to the 
proximity of the acquisition to 31 December 2009.
The group has six acquired cash generating units (‘CGUs’) with material unamortised goodwill as set out in the table 
below. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by management. Unamortised goodwill in the table below 
may differ from that disclosed in note 24 due to exchange movements between the date of acquisition and 31 December 
2009. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow 
projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and pre-tax discount 
rates as set out in the table below. Given the current market conditions, management believe that the discount rates 
chosen are conservative. For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond 
the two year period include two per cent growth per annum (2008: two per cent), which is in line with long-term average 
growth rate for the regions in which the CGUs operate. The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for 
each CGU and an impairment charge of £1.3 million was identified and charged in the year in respect of Bower Damberger 
Rolseth Engineering Limited. No impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of the other acquisitions.
The financial budgets are developed using an assumed workload and margin for the following year . Workload is 
underpinned by a secured order book for each CGU, and order book remains strong at £3.2 billion as at 31 December 
2009. The margin selected is based on management’ s review of the margins on orders received and from the results  
of Operational Excellence. The group remains firmly on track to deliver its margin target of 8.5 per cent for 2010.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key 
assumptions. For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a one per cent 
decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant did not identify any further material impairments. 
Similarly, zero growth after the initial two year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a one per cent 
increase in discount rate did not identify any further material impairments.

The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees. Substantially all UK members  
are in funded defined benefit schemes, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC 
Executive Pension Scheme. The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes. Contributions by 
the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined 	 benefit 	 schemes
The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 1 April 2008  
and updated by the schemes’ actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes 
as at 31 December 2009. The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December .
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows:

Equities 7.9 7.3 8.1
Bonds 5.7 6.0 5.7
Gilts 4.4 3.8 4.6
Property 6.4 5.8 6.6
For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy is as follows:
	 Male
	 years
	 Female
	 years
Member aged 65 (current life expectancy) 21.3 23.6
Member aged 45 (life expectancy at 65) 23.2 25.5
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, 
which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
T o develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of 
expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated 
with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. 
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected 
long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 6.16 per cent assumption as at 
31 December 2009. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 85

The other tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax 
legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets.

No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of £336.0 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries,

difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be

19 	 Financial 	 ins truments
Details of the group’ s financial risk management objectives and policies, together with its policies for hedging are 
provided in the business and financial review on pages 33 and 34.
Hedging 	 of 	 int er es t 	 r at e 	 risk
The group remained in a net cash position throughout the year . As a result, long-term interest rate hedging (for periods 
beyond three to six months) is not considered appropriate.
Hedging 	 of 	 f or eign 	 curr ency 	 risk 	 – 	 c ash 	 flo w 	 hedges
The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs,  
in non-local currency . Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and 
are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts  
and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows:

A net foreign exchange gain for the year of £11.6 million (2008: loss of £38.6 million) was recognised in the translation 
reserve in respect of these forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps.
The investment hedging policy was changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business. As a 
result of this change in policy, existing hedging contracts will not be replaced as they mature. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 92

Curr ency 	 risk
The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling. It conducts business in a range of currencies, including 
Canadian and US dollars and currencies linked to the US dollar . As a result, the group is exposed to foreign exchange 
risks, which will affect transaction costs and the translation results and value of underlying assets of its foreign 
subsidiaries.
The group hedges its material transaction related exposures. With respect to translation exposure, the group does not 
hedge the profits generated in non-Sterling currencies but does hedge a proportion of assets denominated in foreign 
currencies.
The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the average Sterling/Canadian dollar and Sterling/US dollar rates on post-tax 
profit for 2009 is £13.0 million (2008: £10.0 million). The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the closing rates on 
equity for 2009 is £40.1 million (2008: £22.8 million).
Cr edit 	 risk
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative 
financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.

receivables as at 31 December 2009 include £7.6 million (2008: £1.2 million) in respect of amounts overdue by more  
than one year . The group believes there is no material exposure in respect of these balances. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 93

	 2009
	 £ 	 million
 2008
 £ million
As at 1 January (26.6) (20.0)
Exchange movements 0.4 (4.9)
Additional impairment allowance charged 6.3 (1.7)
As at 31 December (19.9) (26.6)
Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade 
receivables not past due.
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government backed organisations, and the credit 
ratings of these organisations are monitored. Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent 
company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The group’ s most significant customer is ExxonMobil, which in 2009 accounted for around 15 per cent of continuing 
revenues.
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform under  
the contract. AMEC manages these risks by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25-30 
mainstream banks and with each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit. These limits are set at prudent levels by the 
board, are based primarily on credit ratings set by Moody’ s, Standard & Poors and Fitch and have been reviewed in light 
of the recent market turbulence.
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid over concentration of 
exposure to any one counterparty.

Fair values are determined as follows:
Trade and other receivables and payables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are valued at their 
amortised cost, which are deemed to reflect fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual 
forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
Bank loans and bonds are valued based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 94

Provision was made during 2006 and prior for the estimated litigation, settlement and future legal costs in connection 
with the group’ s ongoing major litigation – major contingent liabilities are discussed in more detail in note 27.
The provision for indemnities relates to the indemnification of the purchasers of SPIE in 2006, purchasers of the Built 
Environment businesses and other peripheral businesses in 2007, and to the Wind Developments business which was 
sold in 2008.
The insurance provision relates to the potential liabilities in the group’ s captive insurance entity and provisions in relation 
to risks associated with insurance claims. 
Future outflows in respect of the onerous property contracts are expected to occur over the next several years. Due to the 
nature of the other liabilities, the timing of any potential future outflows is uncertain.

Reserv es
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging 
instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign 
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities and the cumulative net change in the fair value of instruments 
that hedge the company’ s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The group has acquired 855,349 shares (2008: 3,200,000) during the year which are held in treasury . During the year 
350,228 shares (2008: 1,347,048) were transferred to share scheme participants leaving a balance held in treasury as

equity in respect of these shares.
A qualifying share ownership trust (‘the Quest’) was established on 26 August 1999. The Quest holds shares issued by the

Shar e-based 	 payments
Offers are made periodically in certain countries under the UK and International Savings Related Share Option Schemes 
which are open to all employees in those countries who meet minimum service criteria. Grants of share options are 
made to participating employees that entitle them to buy shares in the company normally after three years at up to 20 
per cent discount to the market price of the shares at the time of offer . In the US, to conform with the relevant tax rules, 
options are granted at a maximum discount of 15 per cent to the share price at the time of grant and are normally 
exercisable after two years. In certain countries, awards take the form of cash-settled stock appreciation rights.
Under the Performance Share Plan, annual awards are made to directors and selected senior employees of restricted 
shares that are subject to both market and non-market based conditions calculated over a three-year period. During 
2008, one-off awards were made under the Transformation Incentive Plan that are subject to non-market based 
conditions related to 2010 performance. Detailed terms of these plans are included in the remuneration report on pages 
50 and 51.
The Company has a second scheme in place, the Executive Share Option Scheme. AMEC’ s policy is to grant share 
options under this scheme only selectively and in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment. No awards have been 
made under this scheme since 2004.
The share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are predominantly equity-settled and, other than in 
defined good leaver circumstances, require participants to be still in employment with the group at the time of vesting.

The expected share price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’ s share price.
The performance conditions attaching to the Performance Share Plan involve a comparison of the total shareholder 
return of the company with that of its comparators and achievement of targeted earnings per share growth. The former 
is a market based test and as such is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award.
Dividends
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2009 of 11.6 pence  
per share, which will absorb an estimated £37.9 million of equity. Subject to approval, it will be paid on 1 July 2010  
to shareholders on the register of members on 28 May 2010. The dividend has not been provided for and there are  
no income tax consequences for the company . This final dividend together with the interim dividend of 6.1 pence  
(2008: 5.3 pence) per share results in a total dividend of 17.7 pence per share (2008: 15.4 pence).

On 17 November 2009, the group acquired all of the shares in GRD. GRD is an engineering and project development 
company based in Perth, Australia, which employs 850 people globally .

Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of GRD because of synergies expected to be obtained through the complementary 
fit of existing AMEC and GRD operations in Australasia, and GRD’ s skilled workforce and intellectual property which did 
not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as at the date of acquisition.
The contribution of these two acquisitions to revenue and profit in the period from their acquisition dates to 31 December 
2009 was not material to the group. In respect of the year to 31 December 2009, including the period prior to acquisition 
by AMEC, the revenue of these businesses was £91.4 million and their losses before net financing income, tax, intangible 
amortisation and exceptional items were £3.9 million.
Other 	 acquisitions
A number of other smaller acquisitions were made in the year for £5.5 million in cash paid on completion. A further 
£1.6 million of conditional consideration may be paid in respect of these acquisitions. The aggregate fair value of 
identifiable net assets was £1.7 million (including cash acquired of £0.2 million) and goodwill arising on acquisitions  
was £5.4 million. The aggregate book value of net assets acquired was £0.4 million. This initial accounting for these 
acquisitions has been determined only provisionally .
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of their skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria 
for recognition as intangible assets as at the dates of acquisition.
A further £10.0 million was paid in the period in respect of 2008 acquisitions, and the aggregate goodwill on these 
acquisitions was reduced by £7.9 million as the conditions for payment of elements of the deferred consideration were 
not met.
Disposals 	 in 	 2009
During the year, two small businesses were sold. In addition there were various cash payments in respect of businesses 
sold in prior years and adjustments to provisions held in respect of prior year disposals resulting in a net gain of 
£3.5 million and a net cash outflow of £6.2 million. AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 100

Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Geomatrix primarily as a result of the skilled workforce which did not meet the 
criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition. 
These three material acquisitions contributed £69 million to revenue and £8 million to profit before tax in the periods 
from their acquisition dates to 31 December 2008. In respect of the year to 31 December 2008, the revenue of these 
businesses was £106 million and their profit before tax £13 million.
Other 	 acquisitions
A number of other immaterial acquisitions were made in the year ended 31 December 2008 for £16.4 million in cash and 
£6.9 million deferred consideration, with the assumption of cash of £1.7 million. The aggregate fair value of the identifiable 
net liabilities was £0.8 million excluding cash assumed and the aggregate goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 
£15.5 million. There was no difference between book value and fair value to the group of the assets and liabilities acquired.
The contribution of these acquired businesses to revenue and profit was not material to the results of the group.
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria for 
recognition as intangible assets at the dates of acquisition.

27 	 Contingent 	 liabilities
Guar ant ees 	 and 	 indemnities
The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC. 
In the normal course of business, the company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of 
performance bonds issued on behalf of group companies and parental guarantees have been given in support of the 
contractual obligations of group companies and joint ventures on both a joint and a several basis. 
Legal 	 claims 	 and 	 actions
AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the 
company . Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified 
in this note. AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of 
the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed. Provisions of £53.8 million 
(2008: £65.3 million) are shown in note 21 in respect of these claims. It is not practicable to quantify the remaining 
contingent liability because of the range of possible outcomes and the progress of the litigation.
The information below indicates the quantum of claims against AMEC or where AMEC is unable to quantify the claim,  
an indication of the gross contract value or the amount in dispute. As the matters below involve actions by third parties 
against AMEC, the timing of settlement cannot be determined although AMEC is endeavouring to settle as soon as 
practicable. Due to the litigation, there is no work in progress or other receivable recognised in respect of these 
contracts. Whilst AMEC believes that certain claims may be covered by insurance, it is not currently practicable to assess 
the extent to which AMEC’ s insurance policies will respond in the event of a settlement.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, AMEC Construction Management Inc. (‘ ACMI’) was one of four construction 
managers hired by the City of New Y ork to carry out the clean-up and debris removal work at the World Trade Center 
site. The customer was responsible for procuring insurance to protect the construction managers and various 
contractors from lawsuits arising out of the work. The World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company (the ‘WTC 
Captive’) was formed and was funded with US$1 billion in Federal money to provide coverage for the City, the 
construction managers and the contractors who performed the work on site. Pursuant to the insurance policy that was 
issued, the WTC Captive is providing a minimum of US$1 billion in insurance coverage. This amount can increase 
depending upon investment returns on the US$1 billion but is also being reduced by legal fees incurred. The WTC 
Captive is providing a defence and indemnification for claims against ACMI arising out of this work and has recently 
entered into a contingent settlement agreement with plaintiffs’ counsel, representing over 10,000 plaintiffs, for between 
US$575 million and US$657 million provided at least 95 per cent of plaintiffs “opt in” to this settlement.
AMEC Group Limited (‘ AGL ’) is currently the subject of certain ongoing Health and Safety Executive investigations, in 
respect of separate incidents involving two separate fatalities to subcontractors at the Leftbank Apartments project in 
Manchester in April 2004 and April 2005. Two summons have been received with respect to the second fatality and this 
case will go to trial in September 2010. If AGL is to be prosecuted in the Crown Court for these cases, it could be liable  
to unlimited fines. A prosecution for AGL in relation to fatal accidents in relatively quick succession (such as those at the 
Leftbank Apartments) could have an impact on the amount of any penalty .  AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 104
Not es 	 t o 	 the 	 c onsolidat ed 	 ac c ounts 	continued

AGL has also received two summons with regard to an incident involving a fatality at the Aberthaw Power Station. This 
accident occurred during work which was outside of AMEC’ s undertaking and control and which involved the death of a 
subcontractor of the client. AMEC are still considering their plea, but it is anticipated that this case will go to full trial 
during 2010. If found guilty AGL would be liable to unlimited fines.

As at 31 December 2009 AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 106
1 	 Ac c ounting 	 policies
Basis 	 of 	 ac c ounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain 
land and buildings and in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss 
account, as permitted by section 408 of the Companies  
Act 2006. 
Following amendments to FRS21 “Events after the 
balance sheet date” effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009, it is no longer 
appropriate to record interim dividends payable based on 
the constructive obligation created by the announcement 
of such dividends by the Board. Accordingly our interim 
dividend declared each year in August, and payable early 
in the January following the year to which it relates, is no 
longer recognised as a liability at 31 December and is only 
accounted for when paid. The comparative balance sheet 
at 31 December 2008 has been restated for this, resulting 
in an increase in net assets of £17.3 million. This change 
has no impact on the profit and loss account for the year 
then ended.
Cash 	 flo w 	 s t at ement
The company is exempt from the requirement of FRS 1 
‘Cash flow statements’ to prepare a cash flow statement 
as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash 
flow of the group.
Depr eciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than 
freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost or 
valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a 
straight line basis over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years 
Leasehold land and buildings the shorter of the lease  
 term or 50 years 
Plant and equipment mainly three to five years
Financial 	 ins truments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. 
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the 
instruments. Cash, deposits and short-term investments 
are held at amortised cost. Derivative financial 
instruments are accounted for as described in note 1 to 
the consolidated accounts.
The company is exempt from the disclosure requirements 
of FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ as the 
financial instruments disclosures of IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: disclosure’ are included in the notes to the 
consolidated accounts.
Financial 	 guar ant ee 	 c ontr acts
Where the company enters into financial guarantee 
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other 
companies within the group, the company considers these 
to be indemnity arrangements, and accounts for them as 
such. In this respect the company treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it 
becomes probable that the company will be required to 
make a payment under the guarantee.
F or eign 	 curr encies
Transactions in a currency other than sterling are 
translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the  
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured  
in terms of historical cost and are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign 
currency net investments and foreign currency 
borrowings, or forward exchange contracts used to hedge 
those investments, are taken directly to reserves. Other 
exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss 
account in the year .
I n t e r e s t	
Interest income and payable is recognised in profit or loss 
on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Inv es tments	
Investments are stated at cost less provision for permanent 
diminution in value.
Leases	
Operating lease costs are charged to the profit and loss 
account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
P ensions
Contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in 
respect of employees of AMEC plc are charged in the profit 
and loss account as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes are operated by the 
group but the company is unable to separately identify its 
share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes or any 
details of the surplus or deficit in the scheme and the 
implications of that surplus or deficit for the company .
Details of the disclosures required under FRS 17 
‘Retirement Benefits’ can be found in the accounts of 
AMEC Group Limited, a subsidiary company.
Pr o visions 	 f or 	 liabilities 	 and 	 char ges

basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for those, which in the view of management are unlikely to succeed. 
Shar e-based 	 payments
There are share-based payment arrangements which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares; these awards 
are granted by AMEC. The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding 
increase in equity . The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the award. The fair value of the award is measured using a valuation model, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted. The amount recognised as an expense  
is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due only to share prices not 
achieving the threshold for vesting. 
T axation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as 
otherwise required by FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’.

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the consolidated and parent company accounts, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
consolidated and parent company accounts for each 
financial year . Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the consolidated accounts in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company accounts in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable 
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
consolidated and parent company accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the consolidated and parent company 
accounts, the directors are required to: 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
O O
consistently 
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
O O
and prudent
for the consolidated accounts, state whether they  
O O
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU
for the parent company accounts, state whether 
O O
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company accounts and 
prepare the consolidated and parent company accounts 
O O
on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the consolidated and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’ s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the parent company and enable them to ensure that its 
accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.  AMEC pl c  annual r eport and accounts 2009 113

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 112, the directors are

Shar eholder 	 inf ormation
Latest company law allows AMEC to use its website to 
communicate with shareholders. Around 80 per cent of 
shareholders are now receiving AMEC annual reports and 
notices of meetings electronically. This is helping to make 
AMEC a more sustainable company, cutting production 
and distribution costs and reducing waste and pollution. 
Shareholders receiving shareholder information in this 
way receive a letter every time any new shareholder 
information is published by AMEC. Such communications 
will refer to AMEC annual reports, documents relating to 
the annual general meeting and any other shareholder 
communications. They will contain links to the website 
where the documents can be viewed. However, 
shareholders may elect to receive such notifications by 
email, which would normally be sent by AMEC’ s registrar, 
Capita Registrars. For more information, see below.
Copies of annual reports and accounts are also available 
by writing to AMEC at its registered office.
AMEC’ s website contains useful information about  
the company and also provides a number of email  
alerting services, which notify shareholders of  
latest announcements and events. T o register, visit  
amec.com/emailalerts. 
This page sets out the key dates of the financial calendar 
and other summary information. Further information is

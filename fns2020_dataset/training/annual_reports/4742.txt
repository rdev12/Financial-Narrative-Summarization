Chairman’s statement
Section 1 | Overview
Dear Shareholders,
I am delighted to announce a very impressive set of results
for 2008; more so given the current economic climate. This is
testament to the passion of the Management Team to ensure
the successful turnaround in the fortunes of the Company.
As I write, the year ahead is uncertain for most businesses
but we are cautiously optimistic of making further progress.
I am acutely aware however that this continued improved
performance has not been reflected in our share price. In the
recent past the Board has tried to support the Management in
delivering the financial turnaround of the Company. Over the
coming year there will also be increased focus on improving the
liquidity of our shares in an effort to ensure Shareholders benefit
from the improvement in financial performance.
I am concerned also to ensure that appropriate remuneration
plans are in place to provide incentives for employees and which
will act as retention tools. This should lead to the objectives
of the employees and the Shareholders being better harmonised.
Last year, the Board put in place the Long Term Incentive Plan
for senior executives and issued further options under the
Employee Share Option Scheme. However, with the current
share price, the Board believes it is necessary to re-evaluate
their effectiveness. These are matters the Board will seek
to address over the coming months.

Dialog Semiconductor shares in 2008
Investment case
Dialog Semiconductor has a proven and established history in the
development and supply of state-of-the-art power management,
audio and display driver integrated circuits. It has built a stellar
reputation as a quality supplier of superior products to the high
volume cellular, portable media and automotive industries.
The Company’s core competency is its ability to develop and
bring quickly to production in a fabless model, complex mixed
signal integrated circuits containing an extremely high level
of integration for power management, audio and control
functionality on a single monolithic chip.
Dialog supports customers with both Application Specific
Standard products and customised ASIC solutions. Dialog is
engaged with industry leading global customers in its respective
segments, deriving revenue from a number of established and
emerging high-growth markets.
Dialog Semiconductor’s share price development
The following graphs chart the cumulative Shareholder return of
the Company for the past 12 months and for the past five years,
compared with selected technical benchmark indices – Germany’s
TECdax index, Prime Semiconductor index (“SemiC”) and the
Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (“SOX”).
In 2008, Dialog Semiconductor’s share price decreased by 59%,
from €1.70 at the beginning of the year to €0.70 at the end of
the year. It underperformed the benchmark indices throughout
2008. This was primarily driven by the global financial crisis which
added tremendous pressure to the mid and small cap companies,
especially Semiconductor companies who typically have high
cyclical exposure to a global recession. Concerns around the
automotive end market in Germany caused additional pressure
on the stock.

Chief Executive’s review
Section 2 | Business review
Nothing succeeds like success and we are convinced about
Dialog’s potential to pursue a number of higher-growth
opportunities in the mobile phone, consumer electronics and
automotive systems markets. Our excellence in engineering
mixed-signal chips and established relationships with a number
of world-class customers led to an 86% growth in our top line.
Equally encouraging, Dialog achieved full year profitability for
the first time since the year 2000 and has now recorded five
consecutive quarters of profitability. This growth was fully
funded by our own resources while growing our cash balance.
Clearly we have a lot more work to do to achieve our medium
range growth and profitability targets, but our 2008 results
demonstrate the Company’s progress in executing to its chosen
strategy. With improved gross margins in every quarter of 2008,
we finished up over five percentage points for the full year at
38.7% and attained 42.1% in the fourth quarter. This is a
particularly impressive achievement given the tougher economic
climate during the year and the ever increasing pricing pressure
we see from customers.
I am not satisfied with the development of our share price in a
year where we had high growth and performed ahead of our
competitors. My gratitude goes to our Shareholders who have
remained faithful to us despite this less than pleasant share price
development. I am sure that our consistent orientation towards
profitable growth is going to increase the Shareholder value in
the longer run.
We made significant progress in addressing the challenges
highlighted in the past year’s report:
 Improving our cost platform;
 Diversifying our revenue;
 Focusing our products and sales on higher-growth markets; and
 Strengthening our management and skill base.
With the completed transition to a fabless semiconductor
model for fabrication, packaging and test operations using
manufacturing partners in Asia, our cost platform was significantly
improved. We now have a truly scalable business platform to build
further growth without major capital expenditure and at the
same time protecting ourselves in this economic downturn
against “under utilisation” costs of such equipment.
Additionally, we have set up a manufacturing support centre
in Taiwan with Dialog engineers embedded within our
manufacturing partners facilities. We believe that maintaining
a tight working relationship with our subcontractors will help
achieve high yields and maintain high levels of production quality
during the steep volume ramps experienced with new products
developed for our largest customers.
We took steps in simplifying and improving our supply chain
logistics. With further upgrading of our IT systems to improve our
planning and inventory management, we can continue to scale
the revenue, while maintaining our operational cost ratios at best
in class industry benchmarks
The year 2008 was one of rapid growth and improving financial
performance. During the first half, we experienced the seasonally
lower revenue – as we had forecasted. In the second half, we saw
increasing revenue from our wireless products. This was driven by
the success of our 3G/HSPA integrated power management and
audio products. We have been successful in diversifying our
revenue and expanded our cellular customer base to six customers,
as the trend for higher data rates in cell phones accelerated.
Additionally, the second half of the year saw the adoption of
our solutions by leading Smartphone manufacturers, with volume
production already in a popular model sold today. Despite the
forecasted contraction of the cellular industry, we are encouraged
as 3G/HSPA and Smartphones are the highest forecasted growth
sectors of the cellular industry for 2009.
Despite strong economic
headwinds, 2008 was an excellent
year for growth in sales and
proﬁtability for Dialog. Our Board
and the executive team focused on
delivering on the long-term strategy
of leveraging Power Management
as our core expertise in the growing
personal mobile products market.
The Company has a stronger
balance sheet and we are now
moving forward with conﬁdence
for continued proﬁtable growth
in the years ahead. Dialog’s low power, highly integrated, mixed-
signal CMOS ICs for personal mobile devices,
including wireless handsets, extend battery
life, create high quality audio and produce
brighter, crisper image displays.Today, over
700 million 2.5G, 3G, GPRS and CDMA
handsets contain Dialog devices.
By matching our own
innovation to the needs
of another, we produced
an award winner and
could have a signiﬁcant
impact in one of the
world’ s largest
global markets

Chief Executive’s review
Section 2 | Business review
Our rapid development of highly integrated power management
devices for hand-held consumer multimedia applications, helped
expand revenue in what is a growth market for Dialog. We expect
to see more designs in this market to enter into production in
2009 and thereby further diversify the number of platforms we
derive revenue from.
We have made good progress transitioning to a more balanced
portfolio of Application Specific Standard Products versus
customised ASIC products – with 33% standard products by year
end. This allows us to sell the same product to multiple customers
which should further increase our profitability. It also provides us
access to emerging high growth markets, for example netbooks
and other personal portable devices, further expanding the
addressable market for Dialog technology. Through a focused
R&D approach, in 2008 we have seen the first results of our
investments in advanced low power audio and highly
configurable system power management technology and we
plan to launch additional market beating products in 2009.
We recently introduced our highly innovative SmartXtend™
technology for passive matrix OLED displays, with our first
production products scheduled for the second half of 2009.
This technology is continuing to gain good attention with major
cell phone manufacturers. In combination with solutions for
other ultra low power display technologies such as MEMS and
electronic paper displays, this new range of products will provide
Dialog with additional areas for revenue generation in the
important cell phone market.
Whilst the economic and market conditions in the second half of
2008 meant that we saw a reduction in our automotive revenues,
we are confident in our potential for growth in this segment over
the longer term as the automotive market recovers. Our portfolio
of automotive and industrial products, which covers highly
integrated smart motor controllers and intelligent lighting control
products, has continued to expand as we develop new products
through customer funded engagements.
We attracted leading industry talent and expertise to the Company
in 2008, particularly in our design, application engineering,
product marketing, sales and global manufacturing teams.
We firmly believe that this will improve our ability to deliver further
profitable growth. In the second half of the year, we opened
Dialog’s new sales and engineering support office in Korea as we
anticipate an increased revenue stream from this region.
Additionally, we expanded our executive team with the creation
of a new position for global strategy and business development.
In 2008 we relaunched our corporate website in line with our
new corporate identity, introduced with last year’s report. This
has helped align our appearance and business values with the
confident position we hold in the markets we serve.
My sincere thanks to all Dialog employees who have shown
innovation, great resilience as well as dedication and loyalty
throughout a very challenging yet satisfying year.
In 2009 we aim to:
 Continue to develop and market an expanded portfolio of
Application Specific Standard Products to address a broader
customer base in high growth markets;
 Leverage our competitive advantage in power management,
advanced audio and high voltage mixed-signal capabilities
through focused R&D, to develop best in class products;
 Increase our sales, marketing and technical support to
customers worldwide, particularly in North America and
Asia; and
 Optimise our operating platform and increase efficiencies by
taking advantage of advanced Information Management
Systems for planning, logistics and sales operations.
Amidst a time of great uncertainty for our industry and
customers, we will continue to strive to create sustainable
Shareholder value for Dialog – your Company. We expect that
Dialog will buck industry trends in 2009 and achieve growth and
perform in excess of our competitors.
In conclusion, let me once again affirm that I remain confident
in our future.

Chief Executive Officer Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 
Our products and solutions meet
the needs of Original Equipment
Manufacturers (“OEMs”). We
design, develop and deliver mixed
signal components and system-
level solutions in areas such as
power management, audio
CODECs, and System-on-Chip
(“SoC”) integration.
Our solutions
Our solutions address two major markets: mobile handset
and portable electronic devices, and automotive and
industrial electronics.
The continuing decrease in size – and increase in capabilities –
of electronic devices, is a major driver in the development of
our solutions. High-speed data, video and high-quality audio
on mobile telephones and other hand-held products, make huge
demands on battery energy management, as well as on the
technology which controls the quality of images and displays.
Our skill in developing highly integrated silicon solutions enables
our customers to design products which deliver excellent
performance as well as market-leading talk and standby times.
In the automotive market customers use our products in the
comfort and safety systems, as well as in the management and
control of the electronic systems they design for cars; and in the
industrial market customers use our products in highly integrated
smart-power management systems, such as intelligent electronic
ballasts for fluorescent lighting.
Design, development and production
We are justifiably recognised for the quality and feature-rich
functionality of our mixed signal standard Integrated Circuit
(“IC”) and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”)
solutions. We nevertheless continually work to increase our digital
and analog design expertise, and to develop our software. During
2008, we invested US$36.7 million in research and development.
Our ability to develop mixed signal ASIC and Application Specific
Standard Product (“ASSP”) designs rapidly, enables us to respond
to customers’ needs for new solutions that increase performance,
while at the same time reducing cost. Our strategy of modifying
and re-using a wide set of specialised analog building blocks
speeds up the design process; in addition, our use of industry
standard design tools increases the level of automation and the
quality of verification in our products. Our commitment to
continuously deepening our expertise has resulted in increased
levels of integration and product innovation in all business
sectors. We continue to focus our research and development
on state-of-the-art technology to meet the demands of next-
generation products.
Our products
Broadly speaking, we produce two ranges of products which
are both built around similar technology “building blocks”.
For high-volume customers, we engineer and fine-tune system
solutions to their precise specifications; for those market
segments which consist of lower-volume customers, we provide
a range of flexible application specific standard products designed
to cover a broader set of requirements. Our overriding philosophy
is to provide flexibility without degrading performance. This
approach gives a diverse set of customers access to the highly
integrated power management, audio and display technologies
developed by Dialog.
Now that the majority of semiconductor manufacturers are
“fabless” (they outsource the fabrication, or manufacture,
of their chips to silicon foundries) the electronics industry is
becoming more specialised. For example, our system platform
partners often enter into agreements with us to design exclusive
custom chips to form part of their systems and, in turn, license
their system platform to a number of manufacturers of end-user
equipment. Those OEM manufacturers complete the circle by
buying the chips from us.
Power management and audio ICs. Effective power
management – in which the design of chips used in hundreds
of millions of mobile phones and other portable devices has
given us a great deal of experience – is increasingly one of the
fundamentals of system design. However, power management
constantly presents new challenges with the introduction of
multi-core processors, increased peak currents due to lower
geometry technologies and multiple sleep modes. Lithium
batteries need to charge faster, safer and from a wider variety
of sources such as USB ports demanding powerpath control for
example. These trends impact the power management IC directly
and we constantly evolve our core technology and intellectual
property to extend our market-leading status.

Solutions, products and key customers
Section 2 | Business review
With a legacy of over 50 different power management designs
for the world’s leading mobile phone manufacturers and portable
consumer OEM’s we optimise all aspects of the design including
electrical, thermal and mechanical (packaging) considerations.
These designs offer unprecedented integration with multiple power
management and analogue functions on the chip, including
programmable high-performance LDOs (low drop-out voltage
regulators), high-efficiency DC-DC voltage converters, intelligent
battery charging circuits, software programmable LED drivers,
sensor ADCs, USB interfaces, and multichannel audio capabilities.
By capitalising on our experience in integrating high and low
voltage circuits on CMOS – the most widely-used semiconductor
technology – and combining it with our experience in developing
and integrating high-performance CODECs and other analog
functions, we are able to offer a selection of unique power
management and audio solutions. The integration of more than
30 different functions on a single chip delivers significant space,
power and cost savings to our customers.
Display drivers and related-system ICs. The demands from
the market for the next generation of portable displays to
be “always on”, with longer battery life and better front of
screen performance even in bright sunlight means the current
technology based on Liquid Crystals (LCD) will struggle.
To address these important market needs a number of new
display technologies, such as e-paper, MEMs and OLEDs have
been launched. Dialog has not only worked closely with the
key innovators of these display technologies but also key users
to develop and introduce a range of truly innovative low power
silicon driver solutions.
During 2008 TDK demonstrated the first three-inch WQVGA
passive matrix OLED panel which was driven by Dialog’s drivers
based on our new SmartXtend technology. The technology uses
a number of innovative techniques, including a unique addressing
scheme, accurate dynamic current matching and state-of-the-art
power management to outperform LCD displays.
SmartXtend
TM
will form the basis of a new family of PMOLED
drivers which will be launched during the second half of 2009.
Automotive and industrial system ICs. The ICs we supply
to leading Tier 1 customers who in turn deliver Dialog-based
products to nearly all leading car manufacturers, capitalise on
our expertise and knowledge of technology, ranging from power
management systems and mixed signal design, to high voltage
circuits and embedded microprocessors on a single chip in a
standard CMOS process. We provide technology for windscreen
wipers, electric windows and motorised seat belts, and our
partnership with leading car sub suppliers has resulted in chips
which can be connected direct to a car battery without external
protection circuits. In addition, we are pursuing the Systems-on-
Chip integration of advanced 32-bit microprocessors for products
that require sophisticated signal processing for automotive
sensing applications.
Our single-chip solutions for industrial systems integrate
microprocessors with high-voltage, low-power circuits which
allow dimming and power factor correction used for fluorescent
and high intensity lamps.
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”). Our ASICs
form the basis for highly integrated control chips for smart power
electronic systems, in applications such as computer and mobile
communications systems. They are ideal for situations in which
chips have to be highly integrated and also have the ability to
control high voltages intelligently using digital circuits on the
same chip.
We work in partnership with the silicon foundries which
manufacture our ASIC solutions, to ensure that our customers
have access to the latest CMOS processes, as well as to the
foundries’ capacity. This, combined with our own in-house
engineering capability, ensures that our customers are able
to meet their cost and time-to-market objectives Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 
Manufacture, assembly and testing
Wafer manufacture. We outsource our wafer production to
selected foundries, principally in Singapore and Taiwan, which
provide high-quality products and have the ability to meet both
our stringent qualification requirements and tight deadlines.
Our choice of CMOS, rather than bipolar, technology enables
more transistors to be integrated on a single chip – a necessary
requirement for our target markets – and the end products are
less power hungry.
Assembly and testing. The final assembly of our chips is
outsourced to a number of qualified subcontractors in Asia.
Our test programmes, based on our own and individual
customers’ specifications, are developed by our test engineers
in parallel with the design process.
All test development is undertaken at our Nabern facility using
the same type of test equipment and handling interfaces that are
used in our offshore test sub-contractors in order to speed up the
volume ramp and production transfer process. All production
testing and warehousing of final product is outsourced to our
Asian test sub-contract partners enabling direct drop shipments
to our end customers.
We have also created a specialist offshore operations and support
centre in Taiwan. We have our own manufacturing and technical
engineers close to foundries, and assembly and test
subcontractors in Asia. By being “on the spot” to resolve any
potential engineering issues quickly, they can forestall potential
delays in production.
Quality and environment control
We have an uncompromising approach to quality assurance
in every area of our operations and an uncompromising goal
to deliver “zero fail” products. Active employee participation in
error prevention approaches has enabled us to win the approval
of all our major customers and to exceed their ppm failure rate
expectations. The overall objective of our quality management
system is to provide all our customers with the assurance that
our products and services not only fulfill their current contractual
requirements, but will also meet their future needs.
We are committed to minimising our impact on the environment
by developing and promoting environmentally-compatible
products, and operate in accordance with the ISO 14001
international environmental quality standard.
We continuously promote awareness and knowledge of
environmental issues throughout the organisation to ensure
that they become a natural part of the decision-making process.
As we demand the same standards from our suppliers we only
form supply-partnerships with those who are accredited to the
same international quality standards.
For more detailed information on specific products, please see
our Website: www.dialog-semiconductor.com.
Our principal customers
Our principal customers are recognised wireless communications,
consumer electronics, industrial and automotive equipment
manufacturers. These include customers for both our standard
products introduced over recent years and for application specific
(ASIC) products.
The rapidly-evolving technology in all our target market sectors
means that a partnership approach with our customers is essential
– whether for standard products or for custom solutions. As a
result, our customers look to Dialog as an outside source of
expertise, while the close working relationship provides us with
an opportunity continually to develop and fine-tune market
leading technological expertise with recognised industry leaders.
We strive to form long-term relationships with all our major
customers. In 2008, major revenue contributions came from
customers such as Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication, Apple,
RIM, Asus, Sharp, Motorola, Bosch, Tridonic, Siemens, Continental,
Adtran and Qualcomm.

Segment reporting
Revenues in the wireless communications sector were
US$126.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2008
(2007: US$51.7 million) comprising 78.2% of our total revenues
(2007: 59.6%). The significant increase in this sector resulted
from higher sales volumes in 2008 as a result of successfully
introducing new products for consumer portable multimedia
players and 3G/HSDPA mobile phones in the second half of 2007.
2008 operating profit in the wireless communications sector
was US$10.9 million compared to an operating loss of US$12.4
million in 2007. This was achieved through a significant increase
in revenue coupled with a richer product mix and higher margins
derived from new products introduced in 2008.
Revenues from our automotive/industrial applications sector
were US$35.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2008,
almost flat to 2007 (2007: US$35.3 million) representing 21.7%
of our total revenues (2007: 40.7%). However, operating losses
in the sector were reduced from US$1.3 million in 2007 to
US$875,000 for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The corporate sector includes sales discounts for early
payments, the costs of the holding company, stock option
expenses, bonus payments for employees and management and
restructuring expenses. The operating loss in the corporate sector
was US$4.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007:
US$3.5 million). In 2008 the corporate sector also included
expenses related to the introduction of a Management Long-Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP US$0.4 million – for further information
please refer to note 22b). Further charges were booked for one-
time costs for legal obligations in connection with two rented
offices that the Company will vacate in 2009 (US$0.8 million).
Revenues
Total revenues for the year
ended 31 December 2008
were US$161.8 million (2007:
US$86.8 million). The increase
of 86.5% in revenues results
from higher sales volumes in our
wireless communication sector,
as described above.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of material
costs, the costs of outsourced
production and assembly, related
personnel costs and applicable
overheads and depreciation of
test and other equipment. For
the year ended 31 December
2008, cost of sales increased by

Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 9
71.6% to US$99.2 million (2007: US$57.8 million) reflecting
the increased revenues during the year. However, as a percentage
of total revenues, cost of sales in the same periods decreased
from 66.6% to 61.3%, demonstrating the gains made possible
by our ongoing efforts to improve the Company’s product mix
and the efficiency of the previously announced restructuring
measures taken since 2006.
Gross profit
Gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2008 was US$62.6
million (2007: US$29.0 million). Our gross margin increased from
33.4% of revenues in 2007 to 38.7% of revenues for the year
ended 31 December 2008, driven by lower cost of sales as a
percentage of revenue and the accelerated introduction of new
products as prescribed above.
Selling and marketing expenses
Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries,
travel expenses, sales commissions and advertising and other
marketing costs. In 2008, selling and marketing expenses increased
to US$11.0 million in line with increased revenues and as a result
of the Company’s investment in creating value by increasing staff
in strategic marketing functions (2007: US$7.3 million). However,
given the increased revenues, selling expenses decreased from
8.3% of total revenues in 2007 to 6.8% of total revenues in the
year ended 31 December 2008.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel
and support costs for our finance, human resources and other
management departments. In 2008, general and administrative
expenses increased to US$9.9 million (2007: US$7.9 million).
Our fourth quarter 2008 expenses include one-time costs for
legal obligations in connection with two rented offices that the
Company will vacate in 2009 for an amount of US$0.8 million.
Despite that increase, as a result of a higher revenue base and
effective cost control measures, general and administrative
expenses decreased from 9.2% of total revenues in 2007 to
6.1% of total revenues in the year ended 31 December 2008.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist principally of design
and engineering-related costs associated with the development
of new Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and
Application Specific Standard Products (ASSPs). Research and
development expenses increased to US$36.7 million in 2008
(2007: US$31.1 million). This increase was primarily driven
by our continuous and strategic investments in research and
development. However, as a percentage of total revenues,
research and development expenses decreased from 35.8% in
2007 to 22.7% in the year ended 31 December 2008, resulting
from a higher revenue base in the latter period.
Section 2 | Business review
Revenues Other operating income
Other operating income in 2008 includes the unexpected
settlement of US$0.3 million against a receivable which had been
written down in 2006 as a result of the insolvency of BenQ
Mobile GmbH. Other operating income also includes the release
of a liability of US$0.2 million which the Company had booked
in 2007 to account for a potential warranty claim of one of its
customers. In Q1 2008, the Company was able to successfully
close this issue to the satisfaction of both parties. Other operating
income in 2008 also includes the release of a reserve in the
amount of US$0.2 million that the Company had booked in
Q1 2006 in conjunction with the spin-off of our digital imaging
business (DIS). In Q2 2008, the Company was able to release
this reserve after having been informed by DIS that the potential
liability was no longer justified.
Operating profit (loss)
We reported an operating profit
of US$6.0 million (2007: loss
of US$17.3 million) for the year
ended 31 December 2008.
The improvement primarily
resulted from higher gross profits.
Interest income and
other financial income
Interest income and other financial income includes income
from the Company‘s investment (primarily short-term deposits
and securities). Interest income and other financial income
in 2008 was US$874,000 (2007: US$1.1 million). The net
decrease is primarily driven by a planned reduction in short-
term investments (securities) and reduced interest rates.
Interest expense and other financial expense
Interest expense and other financial expense consist primarily
of expenses from the Company’s factoring agreement and losses
from the sale of securities. Interest expense and other financial
expense in 2008 was US$919,000 (2007: US$531,000).
The net increase is primarily driven by an increase in trade
receivables financing and a loss from the sale of securities.
Net income (loss)
For the reasons described
above, in 2008, we reported a
net income of US$6.8 million.
This compares to a net loss of
US$19.0 million in the previous
year. Income per share was
US$0.15 for the year ended
31 December 2008 (2007:
loss per share: US$0.42).

Liquidity and capital resources
Cash flows
Cash provided by operating activities was US$9.3 million
for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: cash outflow
of US$10.2 million). The cash inflow in 2008 relates primarily
to the operating income (adjusted by non-cash effective expenses).
This cash inflow was partially offset by cash used to finance the
increase in working capital. The cash outflow in the year ended
31 December 2007 mainly resulted from operating expenses
as well as an overall increase in working capital.
Cash provided by investing activities in 2008 was US$12.1 million
(2007: cash outflow US$6.1 million). The cash inflow resulted
primarily from the net sale of securities of US$19.7 million. This
cash inflow was partially offset by cash outflows in connection
with the purchase of tooling (masks), laboratory equipment,
probe cards, load boards and other advanced test equipment
for a grand total of US$3.5 million (2007: US$4.1 million),
the purchase of software and licences of US$2.8 million
(2007: US$1.1 million) and payments related to capitalised
development costs of US$1.4 million (2007: US$0.7 million).
Liquidity
At year ended 31 December 2008 we had cash and cash
equivalents of US$36.9 million (31 December 2007: US$15.9
million) and zero marketable securities (31 December 2007:
US$19.9 million). The working capital (defined as current assets
minus current liabilities) was increased to US$47.2million
(31 December 2007: US$36.1 million).
As at 31 December 2008 we had no long-term debt
(31 December 2007: nil).
A reduction in customer demand for our products, caused by
unfavourable industry conditions or an inability to develop new
products in response to technological changes, could materially
reduce the amount of cash generated from operations.
If necessary, we have available for use a short-term credit facility
of US$8.9 million (€6.4 million) that bears interest at a rate of
EURIBOR + 0.75% per annum. At 31 December 2008 we had
no amounts outstanding under this facility. In addition, we have
a factoring agreement, which provides the Company with up
to US$30 million of readily available cash (up US$17 million
compared 31 December 2007). Accordingly, we believe the
funding available from these and other sources will be sufficient
to satisfy our working capital requirements in the near to medium
term if required.

non-current assets remained stable
Current liabilities in 2008 were US$2.6 million above the previous
year’s level, and relate primarily to higher trade accounts payable
in the course of our increased business volume.
We had no non-current liabilities at 31 December 2008.
Shareholders’ equity increased to US$60.2 million (US$53.7
million at 31 December 2007), mainly as a result of increased net
profit (adjusted by expenses for share-based payments). At the

(75.4% at 31 December 2007). Off-balance-sheet arrangements and other commitments
We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements involving
variable interest entities. We lease all our office facilities,
office equipment and vehicles under operating leases. In addition,
we have contracted consulting services related to computer aided

The market
The market in which we compete is intensely competitive and
highly cyclical, and is characterised by continuous development
and technological improvement. Our future success depends on
our ability to anticipate and respond to new market trends, to
implement new designs rapidly to meet customers’ needs, and to
keep abreast of the technological changes. As a result, we invest
in research and development to enable us to create innovative
designs and products on a cost-effective, timely basis.
Revenue and profitability
We were profitable in 2008 but had not been profitable for the
previous seven financial years. We therefore cannot guarantee
that we will be profitable in the future. But we constantly seek to
improve profitability by launching new products and acquiring new
customers. Since we continue to rely on a relatively small number of
customers for a substantial proportion of our revenue, the loss of
one or more of these customers would be likely to have a material
affect. Our goal is to spread this risk by acquiring more customers. In
the past year, we have made considerable progress in this objective.
We are attempting to reduce the risk of our revenues, profitability
and growth being affected by a slow-down in the wireless
communications market by winning customers in other sectors.
Third-party costs
During 2007, we outsourced our manufacturing and testing
to lower-cost environments, where there is excellent capacity,
to overcome the potential problem of an inability to access
manufacturing capacity which would result in increased costs
and, therefore, decreased revenue.
Supplier risk
The financial crisis and its potential impact on the economy
will result in a global economic slowdown which could have
a negative impact on the Company’s suppliers. If any of the
Company’s suppliers were to become insolvent, there could be
a risk of the Company’s production being interrupted. For this
reason, the Company tries to source its components from at least
two different suppliers and from different sites. In addition, the
Company takes the necessary precautions for supplier insolvency
with its risk management system in which information on the
creditworthiness of suppliers is kept. This allows the Company
to identify suppliers at risk at an early stage.
Intellectual property
We make strenuous efforts to protect our intellectual property
from being copied or used by others.
Interest rate risk
The Group earns interest from bank deposits and uses money
market deposits with highly rated financial institutions. During the
year, the Group has held cash on deposit with a range of maturities
from one week to one month. This can vary in view of changes
in the underlying currency’s interest rates and the Group’s cash
requirements. Furthermore, during the year the Group also held
liquid “investment grade” rated debt-based funds classified as
available for sale or held to maturity. These funds incorporated
floating interest rates that were reset as market rates changed.
By the end of 2008, all securities were sold for cash. The Group has
no long-term debt and no amounts outstanding under short-term
credit facilities as at 31 December 2008 (2007: US$nil).
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest income using a mix
of fixed and variable interest rate debts. In order to achieve this
policy, the Group invests in highly liquid funds having a matching
investment strategy. Once the operating business has been
financed, short-term excess funds are invested in floating interest
rate securities. Only short-term deposits bear fixed interest rates.
Currency risk
The Company’s functional – and presentational – currency
is the US dollar, and the majority of its revenue and expenses
are in that currency.
There are, however, foreign exchange risks associated with
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities in other
currencies, primarily the euro and the pound sterling.
Transaction currency exposures arise from sales or purchases
in currencies other than the US dollar. We use forward currency
contracts to eliminate our exposure associated with the payment
of salaries and wages in other currencies. We maximise the
effectiveness of our hedge derivatives by matching the terms
and conditions of the hedge to those of the underlying obligation
(see note 26 on page 72 for further information).
Other price risks
IFRS 7 requires us to disclose how hypothetical changes in risk
variables, such as stock exchange prices, would affect the price
of financial instruments. As part of our cash management, in 2007
we invested in available-for-sale securities with defined maturities
and repayments of 100% of their nominal amounts. Fluctuations
could occur during their maturity, however, and have an impact on
the Company’s profit or loss. In 2008, the Group sold all securities
for cash, eliminating all price risk associated with such instruments.
Credit risk
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating
activities and certain of its financing activities. We ensure that
our exposure to bad debt is minimised by constantly monitoring
all customers who trade on credit terms, and receivable balances.
In August 2007, we entered into a factoring agreement with a
reputable German financial institution for a total of €10 million
to finance our growth. In 2008, the amount was increased to
US$30.0 million. Since the financial institution assumes all risks
associated with the collection of receivables from selected
customers, the agreement significantly reduces our risks
associated with their collection.
Our exposure to credit risks arising from other financial assets,
such as cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale and held-to-
maturity financial investments, would arise from the default
of a counterparty and is limited to the carrying amount of the
particular instruments.
Liquidity risk
We monitor our liquidity on a quarterly basis with the objective
of avoiding interest on short-term bank liabilities or overdrafts. Our
policy is to structure the maturity of our current financial assets in
the Group to meet 100% of the respective maturities and liabilities.
Risks and their management
Section 2 | Business review  Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Corporate social responsibility
Section 2 | Business review
Corporate social responsibility
Dialog considers that the social challenges of corporate
responsibility should be based on fair wages, healthy and
safe working conditions, respect for human rights, honest
relationships and commitment to community development.
With regard to these challenges Dialog is committed to the
adoption of the Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (EICC)
standard as the model for ensuring that working conditions
for internal and external suppliers are safe and that all workers
are treated with respect and dignity. In addition, the Company
complies with the ISO 14001 environmental standard – and
expects its suppliers to do the same – in order to ensure that
all manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.
Management systems
Dialog’s management system complies with the EICC code.
It is certified to the TS16949 international standard as a formal
implementation of the code and is committed to implementing
and facilitating continuous improvements, and to mitigating
operations-related risks. To enable us to comply with all applicable
laws, regulations and customer requirements, as required by
the code, we also ensure that all our major supply-chain partners
are accredited at least to the same standard. To ensure that we
constantly improve our management systems, we regularly review
and audit internal and supply-chain management systems.
The environment and environmental protection
The environmental agenda at Dialog considers climate change
environmental protection aspects (air, land and water quality),
effective resource management (eco-efficiency) and sustainability.
Our commitment to the environment is evidenced by our ISO14001
certification. Since we firmly believe that sustainable development
can be secured only if we safeguard our valuable resources, we
deal only with suppliers which have similar environmental goals
and are also accredited to the ISO14001 standard.
Within our supply chain, we continually emphasise that
environmental issues should be an instinctive part of any
decision-making process, and that suppliers should use
environmentally-friendly technology to:
 reduce and eliminate emissions of ozone-depleting, and other,
chemicals;
 manage, reduce and dispose of hazardous substances safely;
 monitor and control waste water and solid waste emissions;
 reduce and eliminate all types of waste, including water
and energy;
 reduce waste by maximising product yields; and
 ensure all environmental permits are obtained, maintained
and kept current.
Health and safety
Dialog considers a safe and healthy working environment to
be essential in the maintenance of employees’ morale and in the
production of high-quality and innovative products. As a result,
we require our major suppliers also to be committed to ensuring
the creation of healthy and safe working conditions. We expect
them to provide evidence of suitable controls, safe working
procedures, preventative maintenance and general protective
measures in their working environments.
When hazards cannot be adequately controlled by these means
alone, suitable protective clothing or equipment is supplied, and
evacuation procedures and facilities are in place at Dialog’s and
suppliers’ premises.
Connecting with employees
Dialog aims to attract and retain the best people by ensuring that
all employees receive comprehensive on-the-job formal training,
coaching and mentoring. Clear and regular communication is
achieved through regular company-wide information sessions,
led by the CEO, and every effort is made to keep employees fully
aware of Company matters that affect them.
We encourage employee feedback at all levels for new ideas
to improve business efficiency and performance. We support
initiatives and fund raising in the local communities in which
we work. In 2007, for example, we made a contribution to
a cancer hospice charity.
Ethics
Dialog believes that continued success in the semiconductor
market can be achieved only by adopting continuously high
standards of ethical behaviour when dealing with customers,
suppliers and workers. It is particularly important to protect
Intellectual Property (“IP”), which is the key to ensuring the
development of innovative solutions to complex problems.
Any transfer of technology or know-how is always done in a
manner that protects IP rights; effective protection also means
that products can be discussed openly with our business partners.
The disclosure of information which is related to business activities,
structure, our financial situation and performance is always carried
out in accordance with applicable regulations and prevailing
industry practices. We expect the highest standards of integrity
from all Dialog stakeholders; any malpractice is strictly prohibited
and may result in immediate termination and legal action.
Neither we nor our suppliers offer or accept inducements or
any other means of obtaining undue or improper advantage.
We have a “whistleblower” policy in place to protect employees’
confidentiality and encourage our suppliers to do the same.
Human rights
Dialog’s suppliers must demonstrate a commitment to upholding
workers’ human rights and to treating them with dignity and
respect. Standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Social Accountability International and the Ethical Trading
Initiative have been used as a basis for these requirements.
All labour must be given voluntarily and workers must be free to
leave their employment on reasonable notice. Child labour must
not be used at any stage of manufacturing. Working hours must
not exceed the maximum set by local laws, and wages must
comply with all applicable laws.
Suppliers must ensure that workers are not threatened or subjected
to inhumane or harsh treatment, harassment or any form of
unlawful discrimination. Communication and direct engagement
between workers and management is encouraged, even in those
countries where there is no meaningful legal protection. Executive management

Directors’ report
The Directors of Dialog Semiconductor Plc (“Dialog” or “the Company”) present their annual report and audited financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2008. These accounts have been prepared under IFRS for UK reporting purposes and available on the
Company’s Website, www.dialog-semiconductor.com.
Principal activities and review of the business
Dialog Semiconductor creates some of the world’s most energy-efficient, highly integrated, mixed-signal integrated circuits. These are
optimised for personal mobile and automotive applications. The Company provides flexible and dynamic support, world-class innovation,
and the assurance of dealing with an established business partner. Customers with a significant contribution to revenue include
Sony Ericsson, Apple, Bosch and Tridonic. With its unique focus and expertise in system power management, Dialog brings decades of
experience to the rapid development of integrated circuits for power and motor control, audio and display processing. Dialog’s processor
companion chips are essential for enhancing both the performance of hand-held products and the consumers’ multimedia experience.
Automotive applications include intelligent motor control for comfort and safety systems. Over one billion parts have been shipped
to date. With world-class manufacturing partners, Dialog operates a fabless business model. Dialog Semiconductor Plc is headquartered
near Stuttgart, Germany with operations in Austria, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. The Company employs
approximately 280 worldwide, and is listed on the Frankfurt (FWB: DLG) stock exchange.
More information about the business is set out in the Chairman’s statement, on page 6, and in the Business review, on pages 10 to 24.
Future developments
The Group’s stated objective is to be the leading global supplier of lowest-power, highest-quality mixed signal components and system
level solutions to the wireless and automotive markets.
Research and development (R&D)
The Group believes that its future competitive position will depend on its ability to respond to the rapidly-changing needs of its
customers by developing new designs in a timely and cost-effective manner. To this end, the Company’s management is committed
to investing in researching and developing new products and customising existing products.
To date, R&D projects have been in response to key customers’ requests to assist in the development of new products, and for the
development of application-specific standard products (ASSPs). The Company does not expect any material change to this approach
in the foreseeable future.

Corporate Governance
Governance standards
Dialog Semiconductor Plc is committed to implementing high levels of governance. Accordingly, Dialog Semiconductor (as a foreign
company listed on the German stock exchange) has established and published its own Corporate Governance principles corresponding
in substance to the provision of the “German Declaration on Corporate Governance”.
Dialog’s Corporate Governance principles are published on its Website (www.dialog-semiconductor.com). The Website also contains
a full version of the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This details Dialog’s expectations regarding the ethical standards
that each Director, officer and employee should follow while acting on the Company’s behalf.
Corporate Governance information relating to the past financial year is set out below.
Shareholders and the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The AGM, at which the annual financial statements and audit reports are presented, is the main forum for Shareholders to exercise
their voting rights. Directors appointed by the Board during any given year are subject to Shareholder approval at the AGM.
In addition, one-third of the Directors must resign each year and may put themselves forward for re-election. Changes to the
constitution of the Company are decided by Shareholders’ resolution. Similarly, the AGM is the forum at which Shareholders can
authorise the Directors to issue new shares.
Dialog does not have any shares in issue which have multiple voting rights, preferential voting rights or maximum voting rights.
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for determining Dialog’s business strategy and ensuring that an executive is appointed to implement it.
It is also responsible for overseeing the financial aspects of the business.
The Board, which met five times during the year, currently consists of eight non-executive Directors and one executive Director.
The compensation provided to each Director is detailed in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 32 and 33. The executive
Director’s remuneration is performance related and is connected to a set of goals and Dialog’s profitability.
Audit Committee, and Remuneration and Nomination Committee
During the year, Dialog’s Audit Committee comprised the following Directors: Aidan Hughes (Chairman), Michael Glover, Peter Weber
and Peter Tan. The Committee is responsible for monitoring financial statements and reviewing the performance of the external
auditors. It also assesses the efficiency of the audit process and (among other things) considers compliance with accounting standards.
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary and representatives of the external auditors usually attend
Audit Committee meetings.
During the year, the Audit, and Remuneration and Nomination Committees met frequently to analyse issues under their jurisdiction,
usually on the day before each Board meeting.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is chaired by Russ Shaw who is assisted by Michael Glover and Chris Burke.
The responsibility of the Committee, among other things, is to determine subject to Board approval, the salaries and incentives
of Dialog’s senior executives and decides on the size and composition of the Board. Corporate Governance is monitored at Board
level – a reflection of the importance it is given by the Board.
Section 3 | Management and governance 30 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Section 3 | Management and governance
Transparency
Under UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules, significant Shareholders are required to notify Dialog of a shareholding of 3% or more.
Dialog must then notify BaFin and the Stock Exchange. Under S. 15a of the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz)
transactions in the Company’s shares carried out by members of the Board of Directors and their family members are reported and
published without delay.
The Company operates a Code of Dealing in its shares which is designed to prevent insider trading and the abuse of price
sensitive information.
The Board appreciates the value of keeping Shareholders informed of Dialog’s performance throughout the year. As a result it publishes
quarterly financial reports, together with key information on the AGM, on its Website.
Business conduct and ethics
Dialog seeks to comply with all laws and regulations that have an impact on its business. In addition, the Company expects its
employees and Directors to act with honesty, integrity and fairness in the conduct of its business. Dialog’s Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics is published on the Company’s Website.
Dialog is committed to taking account of interests outside the Company, including those of employees, business partners, the
environment and the local communities on which it has an impact. The Board values, and has developed, a culture of corporate social
responsibility that takes the above factors into consideration.
Audit and auditors
The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Dialog’s auditors, Ernst and Young (“E&Y”). E&Y were appointed in
October 2006 following a tender process.
The remuneration given to the auditors over the past two financial years is detailed in notes 4 and 31 to the consolidated financial
statements on pages 55 and 80.
The Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007, and the reports from the Directors and auditors
thereon, were presented to, and approved by, the Shareholders at the AGM of the Company held on 30 April 2008. E&Y, the
Company’s independent auditor, was reappointed until the following AGM.

Policy on Directors’ remuneration
The Board is responsible for setting the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration; the Remuneration and Nomination Committee
agrees the remuneration for each executive Director.
The primary objectives of the Company’s policy on executive Directors’ remuneration are first, that it should be structured so as to
attract and retain executives of a high calibre, with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company successfully and,
second, to reward them in a way which encourages the creation of value for the Company’s Shareholders.
The performance measurement of each executive Director and the determination of his annual remuneration package are undertaken
by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.
No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee comprises non-
executive Directors and its role is, inter alia, to apply the Board’s policy on remuneration. The current members of the Committee are
Russ Shaw (Chairman), Michael Glover and Chris Burke.
The Company has one executive Director, Dr Jalal Bagherli, who was appointed on 12 September 2005. The executive Director’s
remuneration consists of three components:
1. Salary – reflects the executive’s experience, responsibilities and market value;
2. Bonus – as part of his remuneration Dr Bagherli receives bonuses based on objectives set by the Remuneration and Nomination
Committee relative to the performance of the Group, as an incentive to Dr Bagherli to achieve relevant and demanding targets,
in relation to revenue growth, operating profit, design wins; and
3. Share options – details are set out in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Compensation of non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors, for example, are paid quarterly for their roles as Directors. Additional fees are paid to the Chairman of the
Company’s Board committees, the Audit Committee, and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.
Our Directors are all reimbursed for any reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at Board meetings
or Board committees; they are also eligible to receive share options.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the IFRS report and accounts 2008 and the Group and parent company financial statements
in accordance with the applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under the law
the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and have elected
to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
The Group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRS as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial
position of the Group and the parent company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation
to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of the Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are
references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going-concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration
report that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s Website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislations in other jurisdictions.
To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the consolidated financial statements give
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Group, and the Group management report
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description
of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group.

Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Dialog Semiconductor Plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Dialog Semiconductor Plc for
the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets,
the Group Company Cash Flow Statement, the Group and Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and,
as regards the group financial information, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Director’s report includes that specific
information presented in the Operating and Financial review that is cross referred from the Business review section of the Director’s report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions are not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
The other information comprises only the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Operating
and Financial Review and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by
the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state
of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
 the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

1. General 
The consolidated financial statements of Dialog Semiconductor Plc (“Dialog or the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2008 were authorised for 
issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 19 February 2009. Dialog Semiconductor Plc is a company incorporated in the UK, whose 
shares are publicly traded. The principal activities of the Group are set out in the segment reporting (note 25).  
Company Name and registered office 
Dialog Semiconductor Plc 
Tower Bridge House  
St Katharine’s Way 
London E1W 1AA 
United Kingdom 
Basis of presentation 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments classified as available-for-sale and de-
rivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value. Since 1 January 2007 when the main operating group entity, Dialog Semiconductor GmbH, 
changed its functional currency from Euro to US dollars, the consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars (“US$”) and all values are 
rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise stated.  
Statement of compliance 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement requirements of Interna-
tional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and its interpretation as adopted by the EU. Based on these standards, management has applied the account-
ing policies as provided in note 2. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Principles of consolidation and investments in affiliated companies 
As in 2007, the consolidated financial statements include Dialog Semiconductor Plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year: 
   
Name Registered office Participation
Dialog Semiconductor GmbH Kirchheim/Teck, Germany 100%
Dialog Semiconductor (UK) Limited  Swindon, UK 100%
Dialog Semiconductor, Inc. Wilmington, Delaware, USA 100%
Dialog Semiconductor KK Tokyo, Japan 100%
   
 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which Dialog obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until 
the date such control ceases. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. 
All intra-group balances, income and expenses, and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions are fully eliminated.
Foreign exchange 
The functional currency for the Group entities is generally the currency in which they primarily generate and expend cash. Each entity in the Group 
determines its own functional currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of companies whose functional currency is other than the US dollar are 
included in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities into the presentation currency (US$) at the exchange rates applicable at the end of 
the reporting period. Equity accounts are measured at historical rates. The statements of income and cash flows are translated at the average exchange 
rates during the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation are directly recognised in equity (other reserves). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken 
to profit and loss with the exception of differences on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation as well as differences on 
foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity.

These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment at which time they are recognised in profit or loss. Tax charges and credits 
attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items and borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items meas-
ured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. Foreign currency transac-
tion gains and losses are disclosed separately in the income statement, at each reporting period. Key exchange rates against US dollars used in prepar-
ing the consolidated financial statements were:

Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument in another. Financial 
assets include, in particular, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and derivative 
and non-derivative financial assets accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, as well as investments available-for-sale.  
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset. In particular, this includes trade payables, liabilities to 
banks and derivative financial liabilities.  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the entity currently has a 
legal right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as being at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments 
or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are first recognised, they are measured at fair value, plus, in case of invest-
ments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.  
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on first recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at 
each financial year end.  
All regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date that the Group receives the asset. Regular 
purchases or sales are classified as purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regula-
tion or convention of the market place.  
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. 
Financial assets held-to-maturity 
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held to maturity when the Group has the 
positive intention and ability to do so. After initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective inter-
est method. The effective interest method takes into account any premium or discount on acquisition and includes transaction costs and fees that are 
an integral part of the effective interest rate. 
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the investments are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
The carrying amount of financial assets held-to-maturity are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective, material evidence of 
impairment as outlined in IAS 39.59. Any impairment losses caused by the fair value being lower than the carrying amount are recognised in profit or 
loss. The Group does not use allowance accounts in order to record the impairment in the balance sheet but credits the impairment loss directly against 
the book value of the financial assets.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
If in a subsequent period the fair value increases and this increase can be related objectively to events occurring after the impairment was recognised, 
the impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. The fair value 
which is required for impairment testing corresponds to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective 
interest rate. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market, such as trade 
account receivables. Loans and receivables are recorded initially at fair value and do not bear interest. As of 31 December 2008 as well as 31 December 
2007, loans and receivables of the Group comprise mostly trade accounts receivables from customers. The Group also classified cash and cash equiva-
lents as loans and receivables. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less any allowance for impairment, if necessary. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired. Interest effects on the applica-
tion of the effective interest method are also recognised in profit or loss.  
The Group continuously reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts. Management considers the collectability of a trade account receivable to be im-
paired when it is probable that the Group will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the sales terms, based on current information and 
events regarding the customers’ ability to meet their obligations. The amount of the impairment loss on loans and receivables is measured as the differ-
ence between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate of 
the financial asset. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
If, in a subsequent reporting period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can objectively be related to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed and recognised in profit or loss. 
When a trade receivable is considered to be impaired, any credit losses are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to bad 
debt expenses. Account balances are set off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is 
considered remote. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written-off are recorded as other income when received. Reversals of impairment losses 
are recognised in profit and loss. The Group does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 
Receivables from work in process for customer specific development projects according to IAS 11 are recorded in the balance sheet line “trade account 
receivables and other receivables” and are disclosed in the notes respectively. 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified as loans and 
receivables, held-to-maturity investments or as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. These financial assets are generally measured at fair 
value. 
After initial measurement available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on 
available-for-sale financial assets are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of other reserves until realised, or the investment is 
determined as being impaired. 
At each reporting date, the carrying amounts of available-for-sale assets are assessed to determine whether there is objective, significant evidence of 
impairment as outlined in IAS 39.59. Any impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are charged to earnings. The Group does not use 
allowance accounts in order to record the impairment in the balance sheet but credits the impairment loss directly against the book value of the finan-
cial assets. If this impairment relates to losses previously recognised in equity then the impairment loss is transferred from equity to the income state-
ment. Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments or investment funds that are classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in 
profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be 
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss. 
The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices 
at the close of business on the balance sheet date.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
For investments in which there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques, including recent arm’s length market transac-
tions; reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis; or other valuation 
models. If the fair value of unquoted equity instruments cannot be measured with sufficient reliability, these instruments are measured at cost (less any 
impairment losses, if applicable). 
De-recognition of financial assets 
A financial asset is de-recognised when: 
 
the right to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; 
 
the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third 
party under a “pass through agreement”; or 
 
the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in it. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities primarily include trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, derivative financial liabilities and other liabilities. 
Financial liabilities measured at amortised costs 
After initial recognition at fair value, less directly attributable transaction costs, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at 
fair value through profit or loss. Gains and losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss. 
During the financial years 2008 and 2007 the Group did not classify any financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
De-recognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward contracts, mainly for the purposes of hedging currency risks that arise from its operat-
ing activities. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value on each subsequent reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabili-
ties when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to 
profit or loss. 
The fair value of quoted derivatives is equal to their positive or negative market value. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
The Group assesses whether embedded derivatives are required to be separated from host contracts when the Group first becomes party to the con-
tract. Reassessment occurs only if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modify the cash flows that would otherwise be re-
quired.    
 
 
  
Section 4 | Consolidated financial statements and notes  
 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008  45 
   
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
If the requirements for hedge accounting set out in IAS 39 are met, the Group designates and documents the hedge relationship from the date a de-
rivative contract is entered into, either as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. 
The Group did not enter into fair value hedges in 2008 and 2007. 
In a cash flow hedge, the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transac-
tion, or a firm commitment (in case of currency risks) is hedged. To hedge a currency risk of an unrecognised firm commitment, the Group makes use of 
the option to recognise this as a cash flow hedge. The documentation of the hedge relationship includes identification of the hedging instrument, the 
hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the 
exposure to changes in the hedged cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting 
changes in cash flows, and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial report-
ing periods for which they were designated. 
For cash flow hedges, fair value changes of the effective portion of the hedging instrument are recognised in other reserves, net of applicable taxes, 
while any ineffective portion of the fair value changes are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the 
income statement when the hedged transaction affects the income statement, such as when the forecast or committed expenses occur. If the forecast 
transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. 
If the derivative instrument does not, or no longer, qualifies for hedge accounting because the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are not, or are no 
longer, met the derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading. Amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts 
previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or the firm commitment occurs. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less and are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value. 
Inventories 
Inventories include assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods), in the process of production (work in process) or in the form 
of materials to be consumed in the production process (raw materials). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost, which 
includes direct materials, labour and overhead, plus indirect overhead, is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs to make the sale. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. These include the cost of replacing 
part of the plant and equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 
  
Equipment Useful life 
Test equipment Three to eight years 
Leasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or lease term 
Office and other equipment 18 months to 13 years 
  
 
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end. 
Intangible assets 
Purchased intangible assets with definite useful lives primarily consist of licences, software and patents, and are recorded at acquisition cost less accu-
mulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
three to five years. For a particular software licence a useful life of ten years was estimated. Amortisation expenses are allocated to the cost of goods 
sold, selling expenses, research and development expenses, or general administration expenses. The Group has no intangible assets with an indefinite 
useful life.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
Self-developed intangible assets are recorded on a cost basis. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated usefulness of 18-24 months. 
The costs of internally generated intangible assets comprise all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capa-
ble of operating in a manner intended by management, e.g. costs of materials and services used or consumed in generating the intangible asset, costs 
of employee benefits or fees to register a legal right. Reference is also made to the accounting policy regarding research and development costs in this 
section. 
Patents have been granted by the relevant government agency for a certain period, depending on the specific country, with the option of renewal at 
the end of this period. In most cases the maximum lifetime of the patents is 20 years. They are amortised over the shorter period of expected future 
benefit, which is principally ten years. Acquisition costs for patents are based on the cost of patent registration. 
Impairment of non-monetary assets 
In accordance with IAS 36, at each reporting date an assessment is made as to whether there is an indication that a non-monetary asset, such as prop-
erty, plant and equipment or purchased intangibles, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, an estimate is made of the asset’s recoverable 
amount: the higher of an asset’s fair value, less cost to sell and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining the fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. For assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date as 
to whether any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, an estima-
tion of the recoverable amount is made. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased 
to its recoverable amount. That increased amount, however, cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date of whether the 
fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
For arrangements entered into before 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2005 in accordance with the transitional re-
quirements of IFRIC 4. 
Where the Group is lessee, finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, 
are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in profit and loss.  
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty. The following specific 
recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: 
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of goods is derived from the sale of products, application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) and application specific standard 
product (“ASSP”) to end customers. These products are manufactured and tested in accordance with customers’ technical specifications prior to delivery. 
Revenue is recognised when title passes, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the fee is fixed or determinable, 
and collection of the related receivable is probable. Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes and customer discounts, if any. 
The Group has insurance for product claims and also records a provision for warranty costs as a charge in cost of sales, based on historical trends of 
warranty costs incurred as a percentage of sales, which management has determined to be a reasonable estimate of the probable costs to be incurred 
for warranty claims in a period.    
 
 
  
Section 4 | Consolidated financial statements and notes  
 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008  47 
   
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
Customer returns are permitted only for quality-related reasons within the applicable warranty period and any potential warranty claims are subject to 
the Group’s determination that it is at fault for damages. Such claims must usually be submitted within a short period of the date of sale. 
Research and development 
Revenue from customer-specific research and development contracts involving the development of new customer-specific technology is recognised on 
the percentage of completion basis when the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably. A contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably when 
total contract revenue can equally be estimated, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the Group, and the stage 
of contract completion can be measured reliably. When the Group is not able to meet those conditions, the policy is to recognise revenues only to the 
extent the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered. Completion is measured by reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated 
total project costs. The percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs, as well as the dependable 
measurement of the progress made towards completing the particular project. Losses on projects in progress are recognised in the period they become 
likely and can be estimated. 
Government grants 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied 
with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the 
costs that it is intended to compensate. Grants are deducted in reporting the related expense. The Group does not receive grants that relate to assets.  
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales consists of the costs of outsourced production, assembly and test, personnel costs and applicable overheads and depreciation of equip-
ment. Provisions for estimated product warranties are recorded in cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognised. 
Sales and marketing expenses 
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, travel expenses, sales commissions, bad debt expenses and costs associated with advertising 
and other marketing activities. 
General and administrative expenses 
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs for finance, human resources, information systems and other 
management departments which are not attributable to development, production or sales functions.  
Research and development costs 
Costs identified as research costs are expensed as incurred, whereas development costs on an individual project are capitalised as an intangible asset 
and amortised over the period of expected future benefit if the Group can demonstrate the following: 
 
 
the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; 
 
its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 
 
its ability to use or sell the intangible asset; 
 
how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the Group can demonstrate the existence of a 
market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset; 
 
the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and use or sell the intangible asset; and 
 
its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 
 
Interest income/expense 
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues. Interest income includes interest income from investments in securities, cash and cash equivalents. 
Income and expense resulting from the allocation of premiums and discounts is also included. Interest expense is expensed as incurred. 
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
The foreign currency exchange gains and losses mainly result from foreign currency cash transactions and period end revaluation of foreign currency 
denominated cash into US dollars. It is the Group’s view that these gains and losses are driven by the financing activities of the Group and are therefore 
shown as non-operating results.

Other financial income/expense 
Other financial income/expense includes all remaining miscellaneous income and expense from financial transactions which are not included in interest 
income/expense. 
Employee benefits – defined contribution plans 
Contributions to defined contribution and state-funded pension plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred. 
Income taxes 
Current income taxes for current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The 
tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for using the liability method and are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to differ-
ences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, and their respective tax bases, as well as on the carry-forward of un-
used tax losses that can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date and which 
are expected to apply to taxable income in the years, in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a 
change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent, that it has become prob-
able that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists, to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Share-based payments 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense in the period. 
Stock options 
The Group has established an equity-settled share option scheme under which employees and Directors may be granted stock options to acquire shares 
of Dialog. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the service period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which 
the options were granted. Expectations of early exercise are accounted for within the average life of the options. The Group applies IFRS 2 to all options 
granted after 7 November 2002 that had not been vested as of 1 January 2005. 
Executives’ Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Group operates an equity settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Under this plan, key executives are eligible to share in a percentage of the value 
created for shareholders in excess of an annual return hurdle measured over a three year performance period.  
Each participant in the LTIP is awarded a number of units which convert into Company shares according to the level of outperformance of the Com-
pany’s share price over the annual return hurdle. If this hurdle is not reached no units convert into Company shares.  
The fair value of the awards is recognised as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date, 
using a Monte Carlo Model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which awards are granted and is spread over the service period during 
which the key executives become unconditionally entitled to the awards.

Employee share trust 
The Group has established an employee share trust. The share trust is separately administrated and is funded by the Group, which consolidates the 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses in its own accounts. The shares held by the trust are recorded at cost and are shown under “Employee stock 
purchase plan shares” in the statement of changes in Shareholders’ equity. 
Earnings per share/Loss per share 
Basic earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit (loss) for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of Dialog by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of Dialog by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued if all the securities or 
other contracts to issue ordinary shares were exercised. 
The weighted average number of shares outstanding is as follows: 
   
 2008
000
2007
000
Basic number of shares

 45,125 44,938
Effect of dilutive options outstanding 283 2,015
Dilutive number of shares 45,408 46,953
   
1) Because the Group reported a net loss in 2007, only basic per share amounts have been presented for this period 
 
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of 
these financial statements. 
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of reve-
nues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Subject to such estimates and judgements is the following: 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. In case of such an indicator, an 
impairment test is made. This requires the determination of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell respectively of the assets. Estimating the 
value in use requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the asset and also to choose a suitable discount rate in 
order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of such assets at 31 December 2008 was US$12,374,000 (2007: 
US$12,895,000). Further information regarding impairment charges is provided in notes 4 and 12. 
Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets and investments 
The Group classifies certain assets as available-for-sale and recognises movements in the fair value in equity. When the fair value declines, management 
makes assumptions about the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss. 
The Group did not record any impairment losses on its available-for-sale financial assets accounted for at fair value in 2008 and 2007. 
In respect of available-for-sale investments accounted for at cost, the Group recognised an impairment amounting to US$2,662,000 in 2007. With the 
impairment recognised in 2007 the carrying value of the investment was impaired to US$ nil. Further information regarding this investment is provided 
in note 14. 
Deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses 
can be utilised.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing of 
future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies. At year end 2008 and 2007, no deferred tax assets were recognised. The unrecog-
nised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2008 were US$51,552,000 (2007: US$58,675,000). Further information regarding the assessment of future 
taxable income is disclosed in note 5. 
Share-based employee compensation awards 
Stock options 
Share-based payment transactions for stock options are measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value of 
share-based payments is determined using the Black-Scholes model, which involves making assumptions about interest rates, volatilities, market condi-
tions and fluctuation. Due to the nature of these assumptions, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In 2008, the expense related to 
stock options was US$940,000 (2007: US$905,000). 
Executives’ Long Term Incentive Plan 
The fair value of the awards is recognised as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date, 
using a Monte Carlo Model, based on standard inputs such as the Company’s share price, interest rate, volatility of the Company’s share price, dividend 
yield and expected life.  
In 2008 an expense of US$385,000 was booked for the eight months the LTIP was in place (2007: nil). Further information regarding LTIP is provided in 
note 22b. 
Customer-specific research and development 
For the determination of revenue and costs for customer specific research and development contracts, management judgement is required. It is, there-
fore, necessary to determine the stage of completion based on the progress made towards completing the particular project, as well as the contract 
revenue and the contract costs. At 31 December 2008 no receivables or liabilities from constructions contracts were outstanding (2007: US$nil). 
Self-developed intangible assets 
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy mentioned above, i.e. they are recorded on a cost basis. However, initial 
capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product devel-
opment project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. In determining the probable future economic 
benefits of the self-developed intangible asset, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, discount 
rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits. At 31 December 2008, the carrying amount of capitalised development costs was 
US$1,271,000 (2007: US$597,000). 
Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
Changes in accounting policies 
The accounting policies are consistent with those of the previous financial year.  
The Group has adopted the following amendments to Standards and new IFRIC interpretations during the year. 
Interpretation/ Standard  Title Effective date
IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their 
Interaction 
1 January 2008
IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 “Reclassification of Financial Assets”  1 July 2008
   
 
The above-listed amendments to standards and new interpretations did not result in a change of accounting policies.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
Recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted (Standards and Interpretations are endorsed by the EU except as noted otherwise) 
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IAS 27 Consolidated Separate Financial Statements 
The amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial State-
ments were issued in May 2008 and are effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amendment allows first-time adopters to 
use a deemed cost of either fair value or the carrying amount under previous accounting practice to measure the initial cost of investments in subsidiar-
ies, jointly controlled entities and associates in the separate financial statements and removes the definition of the cost method from IAS 27 and re-
places it with a requirement to present dividends as income in separate financial statements of the investor. As these amendments are only relevant for 
separate financial statements they will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.  
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (Revised) 
The IASB has released a restructured version of IFRS 1 First-time-Adoption of International Reporting Standards in November 2008 (updated in respect 
of the effective date in December 2008) which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The restructuring of IFRS 1 was aimed to make 
IFRS 1 easier for the reader to understand and to design it to better accommodate future changes. The new version of IFRS 1 retains the substance of 
the previous version, but within a changed structure. The revised standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments 
This amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payments was published in January 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 
January 2009. The Standard restricts the definition of “vesting condition” to a condition that includes an explicit or implicit requirement to provide 
services. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions, which have to be taken into account to determine the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted. In the case that the award does not vest as the result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the control of either the entity 
or the counterparty, this must be accounted for as a cancellation. The Group does not expect material changes in its accounting due to this amended 
IFRS. 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised) and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amended) 
The revised IFRS 3 and the amended IAS 27 were issued in January 2008 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The 
changes made to the existing standards are comprehensive and mainly address the accounting for acquisition costs, contingent considerations, goodwill 
and non-controlling interests, step acquisitions, partial disposal of an investment while a controlling interest is retained or control is lost, and acquisition 
of additional shares after control is obtained. The revised and amended standards have not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments which replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting was issued in November 2006 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2009. The IFRS requires an entity to adopt the “management approach” to reporting on the financial performance of its operating 
segments. Generally, the information to be reported would be what management uses internally for evaluating segmental performance and deciding 
how to allocate resources to operating segments. The Group does not expect that the operating segments would significantly differ from the business 
segments identified under IAS 14 Segment Reporting. The management expects changes to the structure in respect of financial information shown in 
the segment reporting.  
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Revised 
The revised IAS 1 was issued in September 2007 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The changes made are to require 
information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and to introduce a statement of comprehensive income. The 
revised standard gives preparers of financial statements the option of presenting items of income and expense and components of other comprehensive 
income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate statements. The Group has not yet finally assessed the 
impact of the adoption of the revised IAS 1 on its financial statements presentation. 
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs 
The revised IAS 23 Borrowing Costs was issued in March 2007 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The revised standard 
removes the option of immediately recognising borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale, 
as an expense. Following this revised standard, the Group will change its currently adopted policy of immediately expensing borrowing costs.

IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 
The amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements were issued in February 2008 and are 
effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. IAS 32 requires a financial instrument to be classified as a liability if the holder of that in-
strument can require the issuer to redeem it for cash. Many financial instruments that would usually be considered equity, including some ordinary 
shares and partnership interests, allow the holder to require the issuer to redeem it for cash with the consequence that these financial instruments are 
considered liabilities rather than equity. The amendments to IAS 32 address this issue and require entities to classify the following types of financial 
instruments as equity, provided they have particular features and meet specific conditions: 
 
puttable financial instruments (for example, some shares issued by co-operative entities) 
 
instruments, or components of instruments, that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of 
the entity only on liquidation (for example, some partnership interests and some shares issued by limited life entities). 
Additional disclosures are required about the instruments affected by the amendments. The Group does not expect any changes of its financial state-
ments presentation, as Dialog did not issue financial instruments in the scope of the amendments.  
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
The amended IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement was issued in July 2008 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 
July 2009. The amended standard clarifies how the existing principles underlying hedge accounting should be applied in two particular situations. The 
Group does not expect material changes of its hedge accounting. The revised standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures 
The amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures were issued in October 
2008, updated in November 2008 and are effective from 1 July 2008 onwards. The amended standard permits reclassification of some financial instru-
ments out of the fair-value-through-profit-or-loss category and out of the available-for-sale category. The amended standards have been endorsed by 
the EU, except for amendments made in November 2008 in respect of the effective date and transition. 
Improvements to IFRSs – a collection of amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards (annual improvements project) 
The IASB has also issued a collection of amendments to various IFRSs (“Improvements to IFRSs”) in May 2008. This includes amendments to various 
existing IFRSs. The amendments to IFRSs are presented in two parts: Part I contains amendments that result in accounting changes for presentation, 
recognition or measurement purposes. Part II contains amendments that are terminology or editorial changes with no or minimal effect on accounting. 
The Group does not expect material changes on its accounting due to the changes.

3. Gains and losses from restructuring  
In the third quarter of 2006 the Group decided to transfer its “Wafer Test”, “Final Test” and “Tape & Reel” operations from Kirchheim/Teck, Germany 
to dedicated outsourced assembly and test organisations in Asia. This transfer was completed in the second quarter of 2007 and, as a result, in the 
fourth quarter of 2007, the Group announced a further reduction of its workforce in Germany. 
Unused amounts of US$159,000 of the restructuring accrual were released in 2008. The released amounts were recorded as income which was netted 
with other restructuring expenses of US$14,000. In respect of the development of the restructuring provision please refer to note 18. The 2007 restruc-
turing expenses mainly comprise employee termination costs (net of US$421,000), impairment charges and other losses (US$687,000) in relation to 
obsolete assets resulting from the transfer, other costs (US$367,000) and gains from the sale of excess assets (US$355,000).

Deferred taxes:

Income tax benefit (expense) 728 (136)
   
 
The deferred tax benefit in 2008 mainly relates to the realisation of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards.   
Although Dialog is a UK company, its principal operations are located in Germany and its operating subsidiaries are all owned by its German subsidiary. 
Accordingly, the following information is based on German corporate tax law.  
The Company tax reform 2008 (Unternehmensteuerreform 2008) was enacted in Germany on 14 August 2007. Among other things, this new legisla-
tion reduces the statutory tax rate for its German subsidiary from 25% to 15%, effective 1 January 2008. When including the impact of the solidarity 
surcharge of 5.5%, the federal corporate tax rate amounts to 15.825%. Combining the federal corporate tax rate with the trade tax rate of 12.551%, 
the combined statutory tax rate of the German subsidiary is 28.376%.  
For 2007 the statutory tax rate for Dialog’s German subsidiary was 25%. When including the impact of the solidarity surcharge of 5.5%, the federal 
corporate tax rate amounted to 26.375%. Combining the federal corporate tax rate with the trade tax rate of 11.225%, the combined statutory tax 
rate of the German subsidiary is 37.600%. 
A reconciliation of income taxes determined using the combined German income tax rate of 28.376% (2007: 37.600%), is as follows:

In assessing whether the deferred tax assets can be used, management considers the likelihood that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be 
realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods, in which those 
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, benefits that 
could be realised from available tax planning strategies and other positive and negative factors in making this assessment. Although the Group  was 
profitable in 2008 and plans to be profitable in 2009 and beyond, management has to consider the weight given to cumulative losses incurred in Ger-
many over the seven-year period ended 31 December 2007, the inherent uncertainties in projecting future taxable income and be mindful of the cur-
rent recessionary environment. Given these, the Group has concluded that tax losses may not ultimately be realised. Consequently, the Group did not 
recognise deferred tax assets of US$51,552,000 as of 31 December 2008 (US$58,675,000 as of 31 December 2007). 
The tax loss carry-forwards in the US will expire between 2009 and 2022; other tax loss carry-forwards have no expiration date. 
Included in unrecognised deferred tax assets is an amount of US$1,049,000 (2007: US$1,443,000) (the decrease results from foreign currency adjust-
ments) in relation to tax credits in the UK. This asset may be recovered against future taxable profits derived from certain overseas dividends for the 
company concerned. 
The amount shown under “income tax receivables” in the balance sheet includes a corporation tax refund claim of the Group’s German subsidiary. The 
total amount the German subsidiary is entitled to receive amounts to US$610,000 to be paid out in ten equal amounts during 2008 to 2017. The 
amount shown within the non-current assets represents the discounted part of the claim that is due after 2009. The amount that will be paid in 2009 is 
shown within the current assets

6. Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank (2008: US$14,222,000; 2007: US$15,187,000) and short-term deposits (2008: US$22,693,000; 2007: 
US$736,000). Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements 
of the Group. Cash and cash equivalents earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates. The fair value of the cash and cash equivalents ap-
proximates its book value. As prescribed in note 26, in 2007 the Group entered into a selective factoring agreement. Included in cash at bank is an 
amount of US$9,545,000 (2007: US$8,913,000) held at the factoring bank which represents the cash value of selected receivables sold to the factoring 
bank. This amount is non-interest bearing until the related receivables have been entirely settled. The factoring bank charges interest on amounts drawn 
from the account. 
7. Available-for-sale financial assets 
The Group has invested in highly liquid “investment grade” rated debt, equity and currency-based funds, classified as available-for-sale. The aggregate 
costs, fair values and unrealised gains (losses) per security class are shown in the table below.

In 2008, the Group sold all of its available-for-sale securities. The net realised gains of US$10,000 from those sales that had been previously (Q3 2008) 
recognised directly in equity were recycled into profit and loss (2007: US$333,000).

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-60-day terms. 
As described in note 26, in 2007 the Group entered into a selective factoring agreement. The amount shown as receivables from the factoring agree-
ment represents a 15% retainer kept by the factoring bank against sold receivables. The retainer is released only once the receivable is fully paid by the 
customer, at the latest, 120 days after the receivable becomes due or if the insurance event occurs. The amounts are non-interest bearing and are 
generally on 30-60-day terms. 
The recorded trade accounts receivable for which an impairment has been recognised, was US$1,656,000 and US$1,624,000 at 31 December 2008 
and 2007, respectively. The related allowance for doubtful accounts was US$1,656,000 and US$1,624,000 at 31 December 2008 and 2007, respec-
tively.

With respect to the receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, there are no indications as at the reporting date that the debtors will not meet 
their payment obligations. 
Receivables from construction contracts 
As at 31 December 2008 and 2007, all incurred external costs for customer related research and development projects had been charged to and paid 
by the customers in accordance with agreed milestones. Consequently, as at 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group had no receivables from con-
struction contracts.

Deposits for hedging contracts 1,079 –
Hedging instruments 453 89

The deposits for hedging contracts are an advance settlement for hedging instruments with a negative fair value. The deposits are interest bearing with 
1% below the current base rate and are offset with amounts due when the hedge is settled.  
The hedging instruments include the fair value of derivative financial instruments used for cash flow hedges. The Group is exposed to currency risks in 
the course of its operating activities. These risks are reduced by the use of forward currency exchange contracts. 
Embedded derivatives in 2007 represent the book value of the Group’s investment in a currency index-linked derivative instrument which has been 
separated from its host contract. For further details regarding the risk associated to this investment please see note 26. 
The Group has clear guidelines as to the use of those derivatives, and compliance is constantly monitored. For further information on the Group’s hedg-
ing policy please see note 26.

1) For further information see note 3 – Restructuring and related impairment charges. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
Impairment charges in 2008 relate to the write-down of display test equipment to reduce the carrying amount to the value in use following an under-
utilisation of this equipment.  To determine the value in use, an analysis of the discounted future cash flows was prepared. In determining value in use 
for test equipment the cash flows were discounted at a rate of 10.5% on a pre-tax basis.  In the income statement this impairment charge was recog-
nised in the line item “cost of sales” and it is allocated to the wireless business segment. Impairment charges on leasehold improvements in 2008 relate 
to installed equipment in a rented office that the Group will vacate in 2009. The lease contract for this office was cancelled in December 2008. In the 
income statement this impairment charge was recognised in the line item “general and administrative expenses” and it is allocated to the corporate 
segment.   
Impairment charges in 2007 relate to obsolete test equipment resulting from the transfer of the Group’s test operations to outsourced test operations in 
Asia, see note 3 – Restructuring and related impairment charges. In the income statement this was recognised in the line item “Net restructuring and 
related impairment charges”.

tions during the year were US$481,000 (2007: nil). As of balance sheet date future minimum lease payments under those finance lease contracts were 
US$353,000 (2007: US$nil). The present value of the net minimum lease payments was US$326,000 (2007: US$nil).

Acquisitions to purchased software, licenses and other intangible assets in 2008 and 2007 mainly comprise software. 
14.  Investments 
The Group holds a 7.66% interest in Digital Imaging Systems GmbH (DIS), a private entity that is not listed on a public stock exchange. As the fair value 
cannot be reliably determined, the investment in DIS is accounted for at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment charges. The total investment in 
DIS was US$2,662,000. In 2007, based on business and cash flow projections, the Group recognised a 100% impairment loss. Accordingly the book 
value for DIS at 31 December 2008 and 2007 was nil.  
15.  Held-to-maturity securities 
In the third quarter of 2007, securities totalling US$4.0 million were reclassified from “available-for-sale” to “held to maturity”. Whilst the Group inten-
tion was always to hold those securities to maturity (12 August 2010), the rapidly worsening economic environment forced management to review this 
position.

15. Held-to-maturity securities continued 
After careful consideration, the management concluded in the fourth quarter 2008 that it was more prudent to convert these securities into cash. As a 
result of this, the entire US$4 million worth of securities were sold for cash. Management sees this as an isolated event that was beyond its control, one 
that could not have been reasonably anticipated back in 2007.  
16.  Trade and other payables

trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30-60-day terms; and 
 
other payables are non-interest bearing and have an average term of five months. 
 
17.  Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities include the fair value of derivative financial instruments used for cash flow hedges. The Group is exposed to currency risks in 
the course of its operating activities. These risks are reduced by the use of forward currency exchange contracts. 
18.  Provisions 
The Group issues various types of contractual product warranties under which it guarantees the performance of products delivered for a certain period 
or term. The estimated provision is based on historical warranty data. The provision for rental obligations and dilapidation relates to two offices that the 
Group will vacate in 2009 as it relocates to larger premises. One office will be vacated before the end of the contractual lease term. As the likelihood of 
the Group being able to sublet this office is low the Group has accounted for the rental obligations for the period the building is not used. In addition 
the provision includes costs of dismantling and restoring the sites to their original condition.  Regarding the provision for restructuring please see note 3. 
The Group expects all provisions to mature within the next 12 months.  
The changes in the provision are summarised as follows:

20.  Shareholders’ equity and other reserves 
Ordinary shares 
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, Dialog had authorised 104,311,860 Ordinary shares with a par value of £0.10 per share, of which 46,068,930 shares 
were issued and outstanding. The Dialog’s stock is all issued in the form of bearer shares, and all shares are fully paid. 
On 24 September 2004, the Group completed an offering of 2,000,000 previously unissued Ordinary shares at £0.10 per share to its employee share 
option trust (“Trust”), to make such shares available for the exercise of stock option rights that had previously been granted to employees. At 31 De-
cember 2008 and 31 December 2007 the Trust continued to hold 641,259 and 1,046,387 shares respectively. These shares are legally issued and out-
standing, but are not considered issued and outstanding for accounting purposes and accordingly have been reported under “employee stock purchase 
plan shares” as a reduction of Shareholders’ equity. 
Share premium 
The account comprises additional paid-in capital in connection with the issue of shares. 
Accumulated deficit 
The accumulated deficit comprises losses and non-distributed earnings of consolidated Group companies. Because of the accumulated deficit, the 
Group cannot pay a dividend and does not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. 
Other reserves 
Currency translation reserve 
The currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries whose 
functional currency is not the US$. 
Cash flow hedge reserve 
The cash flow hedge reserve is used to record the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective cash flow 
hedge. 
Available-for-sale securities reserve 
The available-for-sale securities reserve is used to record fair value changes on available-for-sale investments. 
The related tax effects allocated to each component of other reserves for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

21.  Pension scheme 
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The pension cost charge for the year represents contributions payable by the Group to the 
funds and amounted to US$1,163,000 (2007: US$958,000). At 31 December 2008, contributions amounting to US$69,000 (2007: US$80,000) were 
payable to the funds and are included in other current liabilities. Pension costs also include payments to the state funded pension plan in Germany in 
the amount of US$1,158,000 (2007: US$1,058,000).

22.  Share-based payments 
a) Stock option plans 
On 7 August 1998, the Group adopted a stock option plan (the “Plan”) under which employees, the executive management and the Executive Direc-
tors may be granted from time to time, at the discretion of the Board, stock options to acquire up to 3,840,990 shares of the Group’s authorised but 
unissued Ordinary shares. On 16 May 2002 the Shareholders of the Group approved a resolution increasing the maximum amount of stock options 
which may be granted by the Group at any time, to 15% of Dialog’s issued share capital on a diluted basis. At 31 December 2008, 8,129,811 shares 
could be issued. 
With the exception of those granted to the Chief Executive Officer, stock options granted to employees are granted with an exercise price not less than 
the quoted price at the date of grant, and vest during the service period of the employee without any further vesting conditions. Stock options granted 
before 31 October 2006 have terms of ten years and vest over periods of one to five years from the grant date. On 19 June 2006 the Group adopted a 
revised stock option plan under which stock options now have a seven-year life and vest monthly over a period of one to 48 months. The new stock 
options may not be exercised until they have been held for one calendar year from the grant date. The new rules were implemented on grants made on 
or after 31 October 2006. 
At the 2006 Annual General Meeting, Shareholders approved a stock option plan for Non-executive Directors. Each Non-executive Director is entitled to 
an initial grant of 50,000 options vesting over four years and each year thereafter, soon after each Annual Shareholder Meeting, a further 20,000 
options vesting over 12 months are granted. Options are exercisable at the market price prevailing at the date of grant.  
The fair value of all grants in the two-year period ended 31 December 2008 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expectations 
of early exercise are considered in the determination of the expected life of the options. The Group does not have adequate historical development of 
the share price, particularly as a result of material unusual effects in the stock market in recent years. Furthermore, implicit volatility cannot be deter-
mined since none of the Group’s options are actively traded. The Group has therefore based its calculation of expected volatility on an average of its 
own volatility and the historical development of other companies in its business segment. 
The following assumptions were used for stock option grants for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007: 
   
 2008 2007
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
Expected volatility 40%  –  48% 33%  –  54%
Risk free interest rate 4.2% 4.0%
Expected life (in years) 2.0  –  6.0 2.0  –  6.0

b) Executives’ Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The Group also operates the Dialog Semiconductor Plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in April 2008. Under the LTIP , key executives are eligible to share in a percentage of the value created for shareholders in excess of an annual 
return hurdle measured over a three year performance period. This value is delivered to a participant in the form of a series of nil-cost options which can 
be exercised within five years of the date of grant. The first award under the LTIP was made on 8 May 2008. 
The fair value of the LTIP , where the number of nil-cost options granted to an individual is contingent upon the returns to shareholders, was calculated 
using a Monte Carlo simulation model. As a portion of each award is capable of vesting at three separate measurement dates each tranche has been 
valued separately in accordance with IFRS2. 
The fair values used in the calculations are as follows:- 
    
Inputs Tranche 1  Tranche 2 Tranche 3
Share price at grant date 1,40€ 1,40€ 1,40€
Exercise price € nil € nil € nil
Expected life 0.64 yrs 1.64 yrs 2.64 yrs
Expected volatility 40% 40% 40%
Risk-free-interest-rate 4.8202% 4.8202% 4.8202%
    
 
Expected volatility has been determined on the same basis as the input into the fair value calculation for share options granted during the year.  
Measurement date 31 January 2009 
The measurement share price at 31 January 2009 (average share price over the prior 30 days) was €0.63. As this price was below the return hurdle for 
January 2009 of €1.62 (initial price of €1.44+12.5%), no share options were granted.  
c) ESOP Trust 
The Group established an employee share option trust (the “Trust”). The Trust purchases shares in the Group for the benefit of employees under the 
Group’s share option scheme. At 31 December 2008 the Trust held 641,259 shares.

The fair values of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets are determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at the 
close of business on the balance sheet date. Market values have therefore, been used to determine the fair value of listed available-for-sale and held-to-
maturity financial assets. The fair value of derivatives has been determined with reference to available market information. The carrying amounts of the 
loans and receivables and financial liabilities approximate their fair values due to short-term maturities. 
24.  Commitments

26.  Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Vulnerability due to certain significant risk concentrations 
The Group’s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Group’s future operating results and 
cause actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not limited to, the highly cyclical nature of both the semiconductor and 
wireless communications industries, dependence on certain customers and the ability to obtain adequate supply of sub-micron wafers. 
The Group's products are generally utilised in the wireless and automotive industries. The Group generates a substantial portion of its revenue from the 
wireless communications market, which accounted for 78% and 59% of its total revenue for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007, respec-
tively. 
The Group’s revenue base is diversified by geographic region and by individual customer. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates influence the 
Group’s results of operations. The Group’s sales, purchases of raw materials and manufacturing services are primarily denominated in US$. The Group 
also has foreign currency exchange risks with respect to its net investments in foreign subsidiaries and branches in the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong and Korea. Fluctuations in these currencies could have a significant impact on the Group’s reported results from operations. 
The Group depends on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues, and the loss of one or more of these customers 
may result in a significant decline in future revenue. During 2008 two customers individually accounted for more than 10% of the Group's revenues.    
 
 
  
Section 4 | Consolidated financial statements and notes  
 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008  73 
   
26. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
Total revenues from these two customers were US$104,227,000 or 64%. Net receivables from these two customers were US$344,000 at 31 December 
2008. During 2007 four customers individually accounted for more than 10% of the Group's revenues. Total revenues from these four customers were 
US$65,620,000 or 76%. Net receivables from these four customers were US$562,000 at 31 December 2007. The Group performs ongoing credit 
evaluations of its customers' financial condition. 
Financial risk management objectives and policies 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits and securities. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments which mainly comprise 
trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations. 
The Group also entered into derivative transactions (forward currency contracts). The purpose is to manage the currency risks arising from the Group’s 
operations. 
It is, and has been throughout 2008 and 2007, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken. 
Exposure to currency, interest rate and credit risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies 
for managing each of these risks which are summarised below: 
Interest risk 
The Group earns interest from bank deposits and uses money market deposits with highly rated financial institutions. During the year, the Group has 
held cash on deposit with a range of maturities from one week to one month. This can vary in view of changes in the underlying currency’s interest 
rates and the Group’s cash requirements. Furthermore during the year the Group also held liquid “investment grade” rated debt-based funds classified 
as available-for-sale or held to maturity.  These funds incorporated floating interest rates that were reset as market rates changed. By the end of 2008, 
all securities were sold.  
The Group spends interest on amounts received in connection with the factoring agreement as prescribed below.  
The Group has no long-term debt and no amounts outstanding under short-term credit facilities as at 31 December 2008 (2007: US$nil). 
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest income using a mix of fixed and variable interest rate debts. In order to achieve this policy, the Group invests 
in highly liquid funds having a matching investment strategy. Once the operating business has been financed, short-term excess funds are invested in 
floating interest rate securities. Only short-term deposits bear fixed interest rates. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s 
profit before tax as well as the Group’s equity:

Currency risk 
The main functional currency within the Group and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements is the US$. Accordingly, foreign 
exchange risks arise from transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities, the functional currency of which is not the US$. The currencies giving rise to 
these exposure risks are primarily the euro and pound sterling. The majority of the Group’s revenue and material expenses are denominated in US$. The 
majority of other operating expenses are denominated in euros and pounds sterling. The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure 
arises from the sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. In 2008 and 2007 nearly all the Group’s 
sales were denominated in US$.

26. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
The Group uses forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposure of recurring expected payments, such as salaries, wages and office rents 
non-US$ denominated. The forward currency contracts must be the same currency as the hedged item. It is the Group’s policy not to enter into forward 
contracts until a firm commitment is in place. 
It is the Group’s policy to maximise hedge effectiveness by negotiating the terms of hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, 
of the Group’s profit before tax (resulting from changes in the fair value of monetary assets, excluding securities, and liabilities) and the Group’s equity 
(resulting from changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts).

1) For 2008 the volatility was kept at the 2007 level as the management does not believe that the extreme high volatility of 2008 is representative for a reasonably possible future change in the US$ 
exchange rates.  
 
The above analysis does not include the available-for-sale securities. A risk analysis for the Group’s securities was done separately, based on the inherent 
historic volatility of the specific securities, see below. 
Other price risks 
IFRS 7 also requires disclosures on how hypothetical changes in risk variables affect the price of financial instruments. Important risk variables are stock 
exchange prices. 
As part of its cash management the Group invested in available-for-sale securities. Price fluctuations would have an impact on the equity of the Group. 
In 2008 the Group sold all securities therefore at the end of 2008 no price risk did exist from available for sale securities.  
Furthermore the group hold an investment made in 2007 into a structured US dollar note linked to a Currency Harvest Index. This investment which 
included an embedded derivative was sold in February 2008. The carrying amount of the investment at 31 December 2007 (including the host contract, 
the embedded derivative and accrued interest) amounted to US$3,023,000. The net cash proceeds from the sale were US$3,047,000. For further in-
formation regarding this investment please see below, “Embedded derivatives”. 
Credit risk 
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and certain financing activities. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy 
third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receiv-
able balances are monitored on an ongoing basis, with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is 
the carrying amount as disclosed in note 8. Regarding the risk concentration please see above, “vulnerability due to certain significant considerations”. 
In order to finance its growth, in August 2007 the Group entered into a factoring agreement with a reputable German financial institution.    
 
 
  
Section 4 | Consolidated financial statements and notes  
 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008  75 
   
26. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
The maximum amount of cash that can be received under this agreement was €10.0 million (or US$ equivalent). In 2008 the amount was increased to 
US$30.0 million. The agreement, which comprises receivables from selective customers, significantly reduces the underlying credit risk because the 
financial institution assumes all credit risks associated with the collection of the receivables financed under the programme. 
As part of the factoring agreements, in 2007 the Group has pledged US$6.5 million of securities to the financial institution. In 2008 the securities were 
sold.  
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale and 
held-to-maturity financial investments would arise from default by a counterparty. The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying amount of the in-
struments. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group uses quarterly cash flow forecasts to monitor its liquidity risk. It takes financial investments and financial assets (e.g. trade accounts receiv-
ables and other financial assets) into consideration, as well as projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s objective is to minimise interest ex-
pense by avoiding the use of short-term bank liabilities or bank overdrafts within the Group. 
At 31 December 2008, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$36,915,000 (2007: US$15,923,000) and marketable securities of US$nil (2007: 
US$15,921,000). Furthermore as of 31 December 2007, the Group held held-to-maturity investments, disclosed as non-current, in the amount of 
US$4,000,000, those securities were also sold in 2008.  
The Group’s policy is to structure its maturities of current financial assets within the Group to meet 100% of the respective maturities of the liabilities.

At 31 December 2008, the Group had unused short-term credit lines of US$8,945,000 (€6.4 million) (2007: US$9,418,000 (€6.4 million)). There were 
no amounts outstanding under these credit lines at 31 December 2008 (2007:nil). 
Capital management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and strate-
gies for growth. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust its capital 
structure, the Group may generally issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ending 31 Decem-
ber 2008 and 31 December 2007. 
The Group monitors capital using an equity ratio (total equity divided by total assets). The equity ratio as of 31 December 2008 was 75.0% (2007: 
75.4%). Capital includes net Shareholders’ equity. The Group’s policy is to finance business development and growth with equity rather than long-term 
liabilities. It is, therefore, also its policy to keep a strong equity ratio. This policy will be reconsidered as soon as sustainable profits are earned in order to 
achieve leverage.

Hedging activities 
At 31 December 2008, the Group held several forward exchange contracts designated as hedges of firm commitments and forecast transactions in 
euros and pounds sterling. The forward exchange contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of contractual cash flows, principally 
resulting from wages and salaries, and rental payments with the aim of eliminating the currency risk by transforming these cash flows from euros or 
pounds sterling into US dollars. The fair values which equal the book values are as follows:

Forward exchange contracts  
Fair values 453 646 89 –
     
 
The critical terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the hedged cash flows. 
The cash flow hedges of the expected future cash flows in each month from January 2009 to May 2009 and January 2008 to May 2008 respectively 
were assessed to be highly effective and, at 31 December 2008, a net unrealised loss of US$193,000 was included in equity in respect of these cash 
flows (2007: gain of US$89,000). During the financial year 2008 a loss of US$2,026,000 (2007: gain of US$313,000) was recognised in equity and a 
loss of US$1,744,000 (2007: gain of US$224,000) was removed from equity and recognised in profit and loss. The months of occurrence of the cash 
flows are the same as the month when the income statement is affected. 
The following tables show the contractual maturities of the payments, i.e., when the hedged item will be recognised in profit or loss:

Embedded derivatives 
In 2008 the Group did not have any embedded derivatives. In 2007, the Group acquired a structured US$ note linked to a Currency Harvest Index. This 
100% capital repayment-guaranteed structured note was issued by Deutsche Bank AG. This note was separated into an available-for-sale financial 
instrument with a fair value of US$2,711,000 and an embedded derivative with a fair value of US$247,000 at 31 December 2007, which is recognised 
under other financial assets. In February 2008 the Group decided to sell this structured US$ note. The net cash proceeds from this transaction were 
US$3,047,000.

CAGR Compound Annual Growth Rate: a method of assessing the
average growth of a value over time.
Cash flow The primary purpose of a statement of cash ﬂow is to provide
relevant information about the cash receipts and cash payments of an
enterprise during a period. It helps to assess the enterprise’s ability to
generate positive future net cash ﬂows. A statement of cash ﬂows shall
explain the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period by
classifying cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem
from operating, investing, or ﬁnancing activities.
Cash flow from operating activities includes all transactions and
other events that are not deﬁned as investing or ﬁnancing activities
in paragraphs. Operating activities generally involve producing and
delivering goods and providing services. Cash ﬂows from operating
activities are generally the cash effects of transactions and other events
that enter into the determination of net income.
Comprehensive Income The purpose of reporting comprehensive
income is to report a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise
that result from recognised transactions and other economic events of
the period other than transactions with owners such as capital increases
or dividends. An example of items effecting comprehensive income
is foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the process
of translating an entity’s ﬁnancial statements in a foreign currency into
the reporting currency.
Corporate governance is the system by which business corporations are
directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure speciﬁes the
distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants
in the corporation, such as the Board, managers, shareholders and other
stakeholders, and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions
on corporate affairs. By doing this, it also provides the structure through
which the company’s objectives are set, and the means of attaining those
objectives and monitoring performance.
Deferred taxes Deferred tax assets or liabilities are temporary differences
between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in
the ﬁnancial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts
in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is
recovered or settled, respectively.
Derivative financial instruments A ﬁnancial instrument that derives
its value from the price or expected price of an underlying asset
(e.g. a security, currency or bond).
Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders. When
a company earns a proﬁt, that money can be put to two uses: it can
either be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings), or it can
be paid to the shareholders of the company as a dividend.
EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) is the rate at which euro
interbank term deposits within the euro zone are offered by one prime
bank to another prime bank.
Freefloat the proportion of an issuer’s share capital that is available
for purchase in the public equity markets by investors.
Gross margin equals the difference between revenues and cost of sales
as presented in the statement of operations.
Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a
long-lived asset exceeds its fair value (the sum of the undiscounted cash
ﬂows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset).
IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) accounting standards
generally to be used for ﬁnancial years commencing on or after 1 January
2005 by all publicly-listed European Union companies in compliance with
the European Parliament and Council Regulation adopted in July 2002.
Prime Standard The new segmentation of the equity market of the
German Stock Exchange comprises a Prime Standard segment in addition
to the General Standard segment that applies the statutory minimum
requirements. The Prime Standard segment addresses companies that
wish to target international investors. These companies are required to
meet high international transparency criteria, over and above those set
out by the General Standard.
Restructuring charges Costs associated with an exit or disposal
activity, e.g. termination beneﬁts provided to employees that are
involuntarily terminated.
Securities Debt securities are instruments representing a creditor
relationship with an enterprise and include government securities,
corporate bonds, commercial paper, and all securitised debt instruments.
Available-for-sale securities are debt securities not classiﬁed as held
to maturity or trading securities.
Shareholders’ equity reﬂects the investment of shareholders in a
company. Shareholders’ equity comprises ordinary shares, additional paid-in
capital, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.
Stock option plans include all agreements by an entity to issue shares
of stock or other equity instruments to employees. Stock option plans
provide employees the opportunity to receive stock resulting in an
additional compensation based on future share price performance.
The purpose of stock option plans is to motivate employees to increase
Shareholder value on a long-term basis.
Total assets include all current and non-current assets. Total assets equal
total liabilities and shareholders’ equity.
Working capital is represented by the excess of current assets over
current liabilities and identiﬁes the relatively liquid portion of total
enterprise capital that constitutes a margin or buffer for meeting
obligations within the ordinary operating cycle of the business.

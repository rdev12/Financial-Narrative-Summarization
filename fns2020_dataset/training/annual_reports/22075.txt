Sale of Adult Services business
On 28 December 2016, three days before the end of the financial year, Cambian made a substantial 
disposal with the sale of the Adult Services business for a cash consideration of £373.7m. Prior to the 
disposal, Cambian provided behavioural health services to both adults and children. The disposal means 
that going forward Cambian is now wholly focused on its Children’s Services business. For financial 
reporting purposes in this Annual Report, the Adult Services business has been treated as a ‘discontinued 
operation’ such that ‘continuing operations’ relates to the Children’s Services business only.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 3
Strategic report Strategic report As set out in last year’s Annual Report,  
we have undertaken significant remedial 
action to rectify the issues of the previous 
year. Under our Chief Executive Officer, 
Saleem Asaria, and Chief Financial Officer, 
Martin Hopcroft, we have implemented 
improvements in our financial processes 
and systems, including cost control, and  
we are managing the business on a much 
tighter basis. We are continuing to focus on 
further improving our systems and we have 
continued to invest in our HR function and 
the recruitment and training of staff.
Financial results
We are commenting on both Children’s 
Services and Adult Services on a combined 
basis, as we completed the sale of the latter 
on 28 December 2016. On a combined basis, 
revenue increased by 12% to £324.1 million 
(2015: £290.1 million), while Adjusted EBITDA 
of £45.0 million was an increase of 6% over 
the prior year’s number of £42.5 million.
On a statutory basis where Adult Services are 
treated as discontinued operations, we are 
reporting that revenue in Children’s Services 
increased by 13% to £182.1 million (2015: 
£160.7 million), while Adjusted EBITDA was 
£16.2 million (2015: £18.4 million). Operating 
loss before exceptional items was £0.2 million 
(2015: £2.0 million profit), while operating  
loss was £7 .6 million (2015: £2.0 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing 
operations was 2.4 pence (2015: 1.8 pence), 
while loss per share from continuing 
operations was 17 .2 pence (2015: 8.1 pence).
The Group’s closing capacity in Children’s 
Services has remained flat at 1,744 places 
with average utilisation of 74% (2015: 72%).
Sale of Adult Services
On 5 December 2016, after a competitive 
process, we announced the sale of the 
Adult Services business for consideration  
of £379 million to a subsidiary of Universal 
Health Services, Inc. which is a major NYSE 
listed acute care and behavioural health 
services provider. The transaction, which 
was not conditional on approval by the 
Competition and Markets Authority, 
completed on 28 December 2016.
As part of the transaction, we have entered 
into a Transitional Services Agreement with  
a term of not less than six months and not 
more than nine months. On an agreed 
compensation basis, Cambian will provide 
specific services relating to IT, finance, 
procurement and estates to ensure a 
smooth transition of the services and  
the patients for which it cares.
Repayment of bank debt
The net cash inflow after transaction costs  
of £374 million from the sale of the Adult 
Services business was used to repay the 
whole of the outstanding bank debt, which 
amounted to £286 million, on completion  
of the sale. The Group had net cash of  
£116 million on 31 December 2016.
Return of capital
Further to our announcement on 5 December 
2016, the Group now intends to increase the 
return of capital to shareholders from £40 
million to £50 million from the net proceeds 
of the disposal. Having taken advice and 
consulted with major shareholders, the 
Board has determined that the best way  
of effecting the return of capital is by way  
of a special dividend. This is still subject to  
a number of conditions, including creation  
of sufficient distributable reserves and final 
Board approval, which is expected to be 
announced by the end of the first half of 2017 
and paid thereafter.
The net cash balances of the Group after 
implementing the return of capital will be 
used to invest in and grow our Children’s 
Services business. 
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 4
Chairman’s statement
A year of 
improvements
“The sale of the Adult Services 
business will allow the Cambian 
Group to focus on being a market 
leading provider of Children’s 
Services, where the Board 
sees significant opportunities 
for growth, development and 
shareholder value.”
Christopher Kemball
Chairman Future dividend policy
The Board intends to resume its progressive 
dividend policy this year and expects to pay 
an interim dividend for the first six months of 
the financial year, the amount of which will 
be determined by the performance of the 
business during this period. The interim 
dividend will be declared with the interim 
results announcement.
Senior management changes
On 28 December 2016, we appointed  
Anne Marie Carrie as Chief Operating Officer 
and a member of the Board. Anne Marie has 
run the Children’s Services division for the last 
two years. She has extensive experience in 
the care services sector, having been 
previously Chief Executive Officer of 
Barnardo’s (the UK’s largest children’s charity) 
and director of children’s services at The 
Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
We are also delighted that, as announced 
on 15 February 2017 , Anoop Kang will be 
joining as Chief Financial Officer in July 2017 . 
Anoop was previously Group Financial 
Controller at Kier Group plc and, prior to 
that, held senior financial positions in the 
construction industry. He is a qualified ACA 
and graduate of Birmingham University. 
Anoop has very relevant experience in the 
improvement of financial systems and 
processes, investor relations and M&A.
Our current Chief Financial Officer, Martin 
Hopcroft, will provide a handover to his 
successor. Martin joined us in late 2015  
and has been instrumental in reaching  
a negotiated settlement with our lending 
banks and in significantly improving our 
financial systems and controls. He leaves  
to pursue his independent career with the 
best wishes and thanks of the Board and 
management for an excellent job done.
Other Board changes
As previously announced, Alison Halsey, 
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, and 
Christopher Brinsmead, Senior Independent 
Director and Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, have indicated their wish to 
step down from the Board at the conclusion 
of the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
which will be held on 5 June 2017 . On behalf 
of the entire Board and staff of Cambian, I 
would like to thank them for their unstinting 
support and commitment.
As disclosed in the Class 1 Circular relating  
to the sale of the Adult division published  
on 9 December 2016, we have decided  
to establish a separate Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee which is chaired 
by Dr Graham Rich. Graham is currently a 
senior adviser to Boston Consulting Group, 
having previously been its director of health 
services. He is a qualified doctor and has 
held senior positions in the National Health 
Service, including Chief Executive and  
Chief Operating Officer of two healthcare 
organisations. The quality of our care for 
children and young people is paramount 
and the establishment of this committee 
provides additional oversight and control  
of our systems and processes.
At the same time, Mike Butterworth  
was appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee. Mike is an experienced public 
company financial executive, having been 
Chief Financial Officer of Cookson Group  
plc from 2005 to 2013, and is now a 
non-executive director of several publicly 
listed companies. I am sure that he will be  
a good mentor for our new Chief Financial 
Officer, while ensuring rigorous oversight  
of our financial team and risk management.
Future strategy and outlook
Cambian is now a pure children’s 
behavioural services and specialist 
education business, offering a full range of 
essential services from therapeutic fostering 
through to specialist schools and residential 
care, covering autism, mental health, and 
sexual abuse and exploitation. As at the 
end of 2016, we managed 224 facilities and 
employed over 4,400 staff, looking after 
1,270 children and young people.
We are currently one of the largest specialist 
children’s services providers, and we operate 
in a highly fragmented market. Our Board 
believes that we have a significant opportunity 
to grow the business through a combination 
of organic growth and prudent bolt-on 
acquisitions. In addition to our cash balances, 
we have secured, subject to documentation, a 
medium-term revolving credit facility of £30m 
to support our measured growth plans, and 
the Board’s current intention is that, in the 
medium term, net debt will not exceed 1.5 
times Adjusted EBITDA.
The year has started overall in line with  
the Board’s expectations as we continue  
to grow our occupancy levels. Our focus will  
be on managing the Transitional Services 
Agreement, continuing to build out our 
existing portfolio, further improving our 
financial systems and processes, and 
rightsizing our cost base, bearing in mind 
that we are contractually bound under the 
Transitional Services Agreement to continue 
to provide specified services until at least 
the middle of the year.
Our staff
We have continued to make improvements  
in our pay scales and career training and 
qualifications for our staff, taking in to account 
the phased introduction of the Government’s 
National Living Wage. We have managed to 
recover the increased cost of our overall 
wages bill through selective price increases.
As always, our aim of achieving the best 
possible outcomes for the children and 
young people placed in our care depends 
on the skill and dedication of our staff. The 
Board thanks all our staff for their hard work 
and tremendous dedication to those placed 
in our care throughout the year.

Strategic report Strategic report Overview
We began 2016 with a clear agenda: 
continue to implement our remedial action 
programme; meet our obligations under  
the amended bank facilities; and deliver  
the highest quality specialist services our 
customers demand.
I am pleased to report that we  
made significant progress across  
all three objectives.
• Following the disposal of the Adult 
Services division at the end of the year  
for consideration of £379 million, we 
were able to pay down fully the Group’s 
bank debt and announce the intention  
to return capital to shareholders.
• Our remedial actions have delivered 
improvements across our systems and 
the business is now managed more 
rigorously, in particular on cost control. 
Ongoing remedial work, especially with 
our management information systems, 
will remain a priority during 2017.
• Our focus on delivering higher severity 
services and to the highest quality to meet 
our customers’ demands saw occupancy 
increase across our existing capacity. 
Business Performance
Following the disposal of the Adult Services 
business at the end of the year, these results 
“ Our vision is clear and 
deliverable: to become the 
highest quality provider 
of specialist education 
and behavioural health 
services for children.”
Saleem Asaria 
Chief Executive Officer
will be the last time we report on the 
combined Children’s Services and Adult 
Services businesses.
On a combined basis, revenue increased  
by 12% to £324.1 million (2015: £290.1 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6% to 
£45.0 million (2015: £42.5 million), giving an 
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14% (2015: 15%). 
Operating profit was £3.3 million (2015:  
£7 .6 million loss). After the profit on sale of 
discontinued operations, earnings per share 
from continuing and discontinued operations 
was 68.4 pence (2015: 5.4 pence loss).
On a combined basis, the Group’s average 
utilisation was 81% (2015: 78%), while total 
capacity finished the year at 1,744 places 
(2015: 1,762 places) after the sale of the  
Adult Services business.
Children’s Services
Revenue increased by 13% to £182.1 million 
(2015: £160.7 million) reflecting an increase  
in average capacity to 1,751 places (2015: 1,621 
places) and average utilisation improved  
to 74% (2015: 72%). Adjusted EBITDA was 
£16.2 million (2015: £18.4 million) reflecting 
increased revenue offset by additional  
costs from extended negotiations on  
fee increases, provision for sleep-ins  
and repositioning of some services.
In 2015, we took the strategic decision  
to develop an integrated recovery model 
incorporating care, education and therapy 
focused on children and young people with 
the highest needs. Following a restructuring 
of our services in 2016, including our 
fostering offering, and investment in 
upskilling our staff capabilities, we have 
repositioned the majority of our services  
to a differentiated high severity offering.
With increasing demand for our services and 
closing utilisation at 73%, we see significant 
potential to increase occupancy levels.
Adult Services
Revenue for the period increased by 10% to 
£142.0 million (2015: £129.5 million). Average 
capacity was 1,206 places (2015: 1,208 
places) while average utilisation was 92% 
(2015: 87%). Adjusted EBITDA was £28.8 
million (2015: £24.1 million) reflecting 
increased revenue.
2017: a year of transition
The disposal of the Adult Services business 
followed a strategic review of options to pay 
down the Group’s bank debt in full and to 
best position the business for the future.  
The review concluded that the increasing 
demand for specialist children’s services 
and the shortage of specialist provision 
provided a major opportunity for Cambian.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 6
Chief Executive’s strategic review
Opportunities  
for growth education and behavioural health services  
for children. To this end, last year we took the 
strategic decision to develop our Children’s 
Services business around a differentiated 
integrated recovery model incorporating care, 
education and therapy for children with the 
highest needs. In addition, our continued 
investment and work in outcome development 
will enable us to demonstrate our progress 
and achievements to our customers.
We start from a strong market leading 
position. Cambian is one of the largest 
independent providers of residential 
facilities, special education schools and 
therapeutic fostering services for children.
We also have the right components in place 
to further develop our offering:
• A well-invested estate of specialist care 
homes, day and residential schools, and 
foster families, which is unique in the UK.
• A bespoke delivery model comprising 
five core elements (safety, stabilisation, 
education, therapeutic intervention and 
parenting experience) designed to take 
the child in care through to adulthood 
“with a future”.
• A high quality and highly skilled 
workforce led by an experienced 
management team.
Our focus through the transitional period  
will be to fill existing capacity and increase 
margins. Thereafter, within strict parameters 
including a commitment over the medium 
term that net debt will not exceed 1.5 times 
Adjusted EBITDA, we will develop the 
business through a combination of  
organic and acquisitive growth.
It is our aspiration to significantly increase 
the size of our business and the number of 
children we positively support over the next 
five years.
Fees
We support the phased introduction of the 
National Living Wage, and we continue to 
seek to cover the cost to Cambian of its 
progressive application through selective 
increases to service fees for all new and 
some existing users.
Quality and Regulatory
We are committed to providing the highest 
quality behavioural health services for 
children. The quality of our care for children 
and young people is paramount.
Meanwhile, the sector continues to see  
an increasingly stringent regulatory 
environment with an enhanced rigour of 
inspections, which we both welcome and 
are well-positioned to benefit from, in this 
drive to improve the focus on quality of care.
It is pleasing to report that our regulatory 
scores remain strong, with 83% of Children’s 
Services rated good or outstanding with 
Ofsted or Care Quality Commission as at 
31 December 2016, notwithstanding the 
continuing raising of quality standards.
We announced at the end of last year that 
we would establish a separate Quality & 
Safeguarding Committee. This is now up 
and running and is chaired by Dr Graham 
Rich, who joined the Board in 2015.
Summary and Outlook
We have an established reputation  
as a high-quality and valued service 
provider. With a well-invested estate,  
sound finances and improved systems,  
we have the opportunity to take the  
Group to its next stage of development  
as a focused and market leading Children’s 
Services business with attractive margins 
and good growth prospects. 
We remain confident for the medium-term 
outlook and the Group’s longer-term 
potential, while in the short-term we are 
focused on completing the separation of  
the Adult Services business from the Group.

The Company intends to become the market 
leading provider of specialist children’s 
services where there are significant 
opportunities for growth, development  
and creation of shareholder value. It is our 
intention to start growing the business in  
a measured way through organic growth, 
and bolt-on acquisitions next year.
Before we can fully realise the opportunities 
we have identified, we have first to complete 
the complex separation of the Adult Services 
business from the Group, and we are 
carrying some additional overheads to 
meet our obligations under the Transitional 
Services Agreement. Once these have  
been addressed, the business will have  
the opportunity to significantly improve 
margins from next year.
We will also be able to fully focus our 
resources on the strategic development and 
roll-out of the Children’s Services business at 
a time of significant and growing demand 
for its critical services.
The opportunity for the Children’s 
Services business
There is a recognised shortage of high 
quality specialist education and behavioural 
health services for children in the UK. The 
higher the severity of need, the more 
significant the shortage.
There are over 1.9 million children in the UK 
(approximately 16% of the total number of 
children in the country) with developmental 
disabilities of whom just under 200,000 
would be classed as high severity and of 
which 88,000 would fall into Cambian’s core 
target market. Cambian is one of the UK’s 
major providers of specialist services and 
currently has a total capacity of 1,744 places 
and over 600 fostering places.
These requirements will continue to 
increase in the near term as advances  
in diagnostics and processes are likely  
to increase the formal identification of the 
number of children in need faster than the 
supply of additional capacity year-on-year.
Our vision is clear and deliverable: to become 
the highest quality provider of specialist 1 In respect of continuing operations only.

The separate results for Children’s Services

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 9
Strategic report Strategic report On a combined basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6% to £45.0 million (2015: £42.5 million), being a decrease of 12% to £16.2 million  
in continuing Children’s Services and an increase of 19% to £28.8 million in discontinued Adult Services. These reflect increased revenue  
and operating efficiencies, offset by extended negotiations on fee increases, provision for sleep-ins and repositioning of some services.
Profit forecast
On 9 December 2016, the Group published a profit forecast in the Circular relating to the recommended proposals for the disposal of the Adult 
Services business, which confirmed that Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ending 31 December 2016 would be not less than £42.5 million. 
On a combined basis, Adjusted EBITDA of £45.0 million is consistent with the published profit forecast.
M&A costs
On a combined basis, M&A costs of £nil (2015: £2.3 million) represent advisory fees, stamp duty and other direct costs in respect of acquisitions 
completed in the previous year.
IPO share option charges
On a combined basis, the charge on IPO option plans of £2.2 million (2015: £2.3 million) arises on Continuation Option Plan shares awarded 
as part of the IPO, the impact of which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Charges on future share-based awards are included within 
Adjusted EBITDA.
Exceptional items
On a combined basis, exceptional items were £17 .1 million (2015: £24.9 million) relating largely to the financial restructuring and operational 
changes, of which £7 .4 million (2015: £3.9 million) relate to one-off charges in the continuing Children’s Services and £9.7 million (2015: 
£21.0 million) relate to one-off charges in the discontinued Adult Services business.

On a combined basis, operating profit before exceptional items increased by 18% to £20.4 million (2015: £17 .2 million), being an operating 
loss of £0.2 million (2015: £2.0 million profit) in continuing Children’s Services and an operating profit of £20.6 million (2015: £15.2 million) in 
discontinued Adult Services, which reflect the benefits of the operational efficiencies and the remediation programme.
After exceptional items, the combined operating profit was £3.3 million (2015: £7 .6 million loss), being an operating loss of £7 .6 million (2015: 
£2.0 million) in continuing Children’s Services and an operating profit of £10.9 million (2015: £5.6 million loss) in discontinued Adult Services.
Finance charges
On a combined basis, net finance charges increased to £29.8 million (2015: £8.8 million), which reflect eight months at the new funding 
rates as a result of the financial restructuring in April 2016, of which £29.8 million (2015: £8.7 million) relate to continuing Children’s Services 
and £nil million (2015: £0.1 million) relate to discontinued Adult Services.
Extinguished items
All bank debt was settled on sale of the Adult Services business, so all costs of the financing facilities are reported as extinguished items within 
continuing operations.
Taxation
On a combined basis, there is a tax credit of £6.1 million (2015: £6.8 million), being a tax credit of £6.2 million (2015: £3.8 million charge) in 
continuing Children’s Services and a tax charge of £0.1 million (2015: £10.6 million credit) in discontinued Adult Services. The difference between 
the current statutory rate and the effective tax rate is principally due to non-deductible expenditure and non-qualifying depreciation.
Cambian Group plc

Finance review continued Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was 2.4 pence (2015: 1.8 pence). After the profit on sale of discontinued operations, 
earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations was 68.4 pence (2015: 5.4 pence loss).
Discontinued operations
On 5 December 2016, the Group entered into an agreement to sell Cambian Healthcare Limited and its subsidiaries, Care Aspirations 
Developments Limited and its subsidiaries, and Cambian Care Services Limited (“Adult Services”). The disposal was effected to allow the Group  
to focus on being a market leading provider of Children’s Services, where the Board sees significant opportunities for growth, development and 
shareholder value. The disposal was completed on 28 December 2016, on which date control of Adult Services passed to the acquirer.

Post-completion transfer sites
At completion, it had not been possible to complete the transfer of all business contracts for a small number of sites between continuing 
Children’s Services and discontinued Adult Services, as the requisite regulatory approval had not been received. Mechanics are agreed  
to govern this situation, which will not materially change the economics, although they may impact some reported figures until finalised.
Migration of services
The process of separating the Adult Services business involves the complex separation of significant business systems and support 
services. The time and resource to achieve this, together with the continuing maturing of occupancy, may result in a positive split of trading 
performance in 2017 .
Capital expenditure
For continuing and discontinued operations, capital expenditure was £12.5 million in the year, of which £6.4 million was spent on continuing 
operations with £4.5 million on development of new capacity and £1.9 million on the maintenance of existing units. Going forward, capital 
expenditure in the continuing Children’s Services will moderately increase given the new capital structure and strategy, together with 
investment in systems.
Cash flow
For continuing operations, net cash from operating activities was an inflow of £3.4 million (2015: £15.4 million), with working capital 
movements reflecting the growth in activity together with extended negotiations on fee increases. With the disposal proceeds from the sale 
of Adult Services and the financing costs of the amended bank facilities, but before payment of all transaction related costs, net cash was 
£116.1 million (2015: £239.3 million net debt). In view of the timing of the sale of Adult Services, some transaction related costs were settled 
after the year end.
Debt facilities
On 18 May 2016, the Group entered into an amended £290 million financing facilities agreement, the principal provisions of which were 
increased margins, additional fees, amended covenants and information undertakings, as well as restrictions on dividends and capital 
expenditure. With completion of the sale of Adult Services on 28 December 2016, bank facilities and swap contracts were settled in full.
The Group has agreed, subject to documentation, a new medium-term £30 million revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes 
with a margin of 2% over LIBOR on amounts drawn under the facility, together with customary fees, covenants, baskets and undertakings.

Market potential
Market context
In England there are estimated to be 
approximately 88,000 individuals who 
require high severity services within the 
areas that Cambian serves, with the 
annual spend on these individuals being 
approximately £7 .2bn (based on Company 
estimates). Approximately half of this 
population’s needs are met by independent 
providers, the remainder being public sector 
provision. We continue to see demand 
increasing in our addressable market due to 
a number of drivers; as well as population 
growth, the underlying rates of incidence 
of certain conditions are increasing, with 
a greater awareness and improving 
diagnosis of conditions.
Regulation
The market that Cambian serves is 
regulated primarily by Ofsted and the CQC. 
These bodies control and administer the 
registration, inspection and complaints 
procedures set out under applicable laws 
and regulations. In order to open a service, 
it needs to be registered with Ofsted or the 
CQC, and must pass regular inspections 
to ensure it meets the minimum standards 
and requirements prescribed under laws 
and regulations.
Legal and political environment
The independent sector’s role in the market 
has increased in recent years following a 
reduction in public sector capacity as well 
as the benefits specialist providers can 
offer. We believe that the trend towards 
outsourcing specialist education and 
behavioural health services to specialist 
independent providers will continue.

Description 
Total capacity is the number of places 
available for the service users. Places 
are only included in capacity once they 
are handed over from our property 
development team to our operations team. 
Capacity is important as it measures the 
potential size of the business as it currently 
stands, whether or not the places are filled.
Performance 
Capacity decreased by 1.0% in the year. 
The marginal decrease is due to the focus 
on filling existing capacity rather than 
increasing capacity.
Description 
Revenue measures how we have filled 
our capacity, the fees we have charged, 
together with the impact of acquisitions.
 Continuing operations (Children’s Services)
 Discontinued operations (Adult Services)
Performance 
Revenue increased by 13% in the year. 
Total revenue was £182.1m, an increase of 
£21.4m, which was attributable to the full 
year impact of 2015 acquisitions.
Description 
Average utilisation is the average number 
of occupants in the year divided by the 
average capacity. This measures the degree 
to which our units were full in the year.

Description 
Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before 
net finance costs, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation, profit or loss on disposal of 
assets, exceptional items, costs related to 
acquisitions completed in the period, and 
the charge relating to Cambian Group IPO 
Continuation Option plans 1 and 2. For a 
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating 
profit please see pages 84 and 85.
Performance 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 12% in the 
year as a result of a focus on the Adult 
Services business. The focus will shift to  
the continuing operations in 2017 .
Description 
Adjusted EPS is defined as statutory EPS, 
adding back the impact of amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, exceptional items, 
M&A costs, profit on sale of investments, and 
the charge relating to Continuation Option 
Plan shares awarded as part of the IPO, net of 
the tax effect of these items, where such items

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 23
Strategic report Strategic report In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (the “Code”), the 
Audit and Risk Committee (as operated 
throughout 2016) (the “Committee”) 
designed and implemented a risk 
management system to allow the Board to 
assess the main risks facing the business. 
This process involves: 
• Identifying and assessing the principal 
risks that threaten the achievement of 
our strategic objectives; 
• Putting in place appropriate mitigating 
controls to manage identified risks to  
an acceptable level;
• Escalation and reporting of principal  
risk and control information to  
support management decision  
making and oversight;
• Assigning responsibility and defining 
accountabilities for risk management;
• Having in place an appropriate risk 
management framework aligned to and 
supporting the delivery of our strategy; and
• Continuously monitoring the changing 
risk environment, the principal risks,  
and the application of the framework.
“ Our business involves  
the care of vulnerable 
people with complex 
needs, involving it in 
significant risks. The 
effective management of 
risk is a core competence 
and operational focus  
of Cambian.”
Alison Halsey
Independent non-executive director
The Board has continued to work closely 
with the senior management team to 
monitor strategic risks. Strategic risks can be 
defined as the uncertainties and untapped 
opportunities inherent in Cambian’s 
strategic plans and how well they are 
executed in the long term. As such, strategic 
risks are key matters for the Board as they 
impinge on delivering the objectives, rather 
than just having an isolated impact on a 
site, region or function. 
The Committee has acted as a single 
point of reference for the monitoring of 
operational, clinical and commercial risk 
and reporting to the Board. The Committee 
has been required to consider the nature 
and extent of the risks facing Cambian and 
keep them under review. In addition, the 
Committee reviews the risk management 
framework to mitigate such risk, monitors 
the effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and notifies the Board of 
changes in the status and control of risks. 
Further information regarding financial 
risk management objectives and policies 
and exposure to price, credit, liquidity and 
cash flow risk is contained in note 33 to the 
financial statements. 
Improving our risk management 
systems and approach
Risk management
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 24 In preparation for the sale of the Adult 
Services business, the Board reviewed 
its management of strategic risks and 
established, with effect from 1 January 
2017 , a new committee – the Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee – to sit alongside 
the newly named Audit Committee (which 
now primarily focuses on financial risks) to 
ensure effective monitoring of risks arising 
from the safeguarding of children and 
young people. 
Ongoing process for risk identification, 
reporting and management
The Board is ultimately responsible for 
maintaining sound risk management, 
internal control and quality systems across 
the Group and monitoring these systems, 
although responsibility for risk and control 
oversight is principally delegated to the 
committees, as described above. The 
Board ensures that there are robust risk 
management and internal control systems 
and, at least annually, carries out a review 
of their effectiveness and reports on that 
review to shareholders and the executive 
management team. 
The executive management team  
is responsible for defining, debating  
and challenging the nature of the  
principal risks and for sponsoring risk 
management activity across the Group.  
It is also responsible for implementing the 
framework and providing challenge on 
risk issues and their mitigation. In parallel 
with the development of the strategic 
risk register, the Group has developed 
an enhanced risk reporting framework 
intended to draw together day to day 
business risks and those risks specifically 
associated with clinical and care quality 
issues. A clear framework and cycle of 
reporting on risk is essential in building, 
implementing and developing strategic  
and operational risk management  
practices across Cambian.
While the Group’s focus on the quality of the 
services it delivers acts as its principal tool 
for the management of operational risks, 
the risk management framework supports 
the delivery of its risk management 
objectives and outlines policy, application 
principles, risk oversight structures, key 
accountabilities and requirements for 
identifying, assessing, reporting and 
monitoring risk. However, effective risk 
management is not just about meeting 
regulatory requirements. Understanding 
the risks Cambian faces and managing 
them appropriately will enhance its ability 
to make more informed decisions, deliver 
on objectives and subsequently improve 
its performance. In addition, managing 
risk effectively will protect and enhance 
the benefits and commitments the Group 
has made to our service users and 
shareholders, and it is this overarching 
principle that is the backbone of our 
approach to risk and control management.
Responsibility for risk and quality rests with 
each and every person in the business and 
is monitored by each facility manager on 
a daily basis. Both the Adult Services and 
Children’s Services businesses in 2016 were 
supported by a dedicated quality team, 
which includes former regulatory inspectors, 
who assist with regular site visits, auditing 
quality assurance, compliance and 
performance improvement.
At an operational level in the Adult Services 
business in 2016, each hospital held a 
monthly clinical governance meeting to 
review matters such as medication, staffing 
levels and care plans. The output from these 
meetings was reviewed on a quarterly 
basis by the regional clinical governance 
meetings and the Adult Services clinical 
board, which was attended by senior 
operational managers, the quality team, 
and the health & safety manager.
The Children’s Services leadership teams 
meet fortnightly to review safeguarding and 
operational risk matters and matters arising 
are considered monthly at the Children’s 
Services Safeguarding Board, attended 
by all members of the Children’s Services 
leadership team. Any issues of immediate 
concern are raised either at the weekly 
Group executive management meeting 
or escalated further to the Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee.
Once a month, the executive management 
team considers whether, in the light of 
incidents reported from site managers, the 
risks identified in the strategic risk register 
have moved. The meeting also considers 
the effectiveness of existing controls against 
the strategic risks and any mitigating actions 
identified in response to specific incidents.
The output of the monthly review is a risk 
heat map that identifies the likelihood 
of the risk occurring and the financial 
and reputational impact of the risk on 
the Group, as well as the steps that are 
being taken to reduce any risks identified 
as having increased in either impact or 
likelihood. This map and an explanation 
of the reasons why any risks are identified 
as being high or very high, together with 
plans in place or being formulated to 
reduce the risk, is tabled at each Board 
meeting for consideration by the directors.
In this way we believe that we have  
been able to bring together consideration 
of medical, clinical, safeguarding and 
regulatory risks with other commercial  
risks, and monitor during the year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 25
Strategic report Strategic report Principal risks & uncertainties
The risks and uncertainties described on 
pages 28 and 29 are considered, at this 
point in time, to have the greatest effect 
on Cambian’s strategic objectives. This 
list is not intended to be comprehensive 
or exhaustive. While the Company can 
monitor risks and prepare for adverse 
scenarios, the ability to affect the core 
drivers of some risks is not within 
its control, for example changes in 
government regulation, policy or Brexit.
During 2016, the principal risks identified 
through this process were in respect 
of the Group’s systems and process, in 
particular finance, HR and payroll systems. 
In response to these identified risks, the 
Group implemented a number of improved 
processes, and scaled back the plans 
for organic growth. The other principal 
risks identified through the framework 
related to our Children’s Services which 
experienced some challenges in achieving 
occupancy targets, operational fragility in 
our Residential Schools portfolio caused by 
underperforming leadership, and a difficulty 
in attracting the right calibre of support staff 
to work in an often challenging environment. 
This risk was manifested in some service 
lines failing to deliver occupancy targets 
and a number of regulatory downgradings. 
To mitigate these risks, management has 
taken steps to reorganise and strengthen 
service line leadership and share and 
incentivise best practice and has reviewed 
operational weaknesses, identifying key 
work streams to improve quality. 
Lines of defence Function Activity
First line
Company’s individual site 
managers
•  Apply the Group’s policies and procedures, such as safeguarding and  
health & safety 
• Report incidents up to regional or divisional management
Second line
Executive management team
• Considers any serious incidents, new whistleblowing reports and potential risks  
on a weekly basis and agrees any actions in response
• Reviews the risk register on a monthly basis and agrees any changes in practice  
or procedures
Regular monthly and quarterly 
meetings of executives and risk and 
quality function
• Consider issues raised at hospital clinical governance meetings (Adult Services prior 
to the disposal) or from safeguarding meetings (Children’s Services)
• Review findings from site visits and regulatory inspections, such as inspection of 
children’s facilities under Regulation 44 and NMS20
Third line
Internal audit
• Tests existing controls on a programme agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee 
(now the Audit Committee)
Clinical governance committee
(chaired by Group Clinical Director) 
(prior to the disposal of the Adult 
Services business)
• Considers issues raised at clinical governance meetings
• Reviews findings from site visits by the quality team and Regulation 44 visits
The Group’s risk management framework in 2016 was based on three lines of defence, as outlined below.
At the current point in time, the principal 
risks faced by the Group are:
• Migration – the separation of the 
Adult Services business from the 
Cambian Group is complex (involving 
the separation of significant business 
systems and support services) and could 
result in unexpected costs. A Transitional 
Services Agreement is currently in place 
between Cambian and the buyer of 
the Adult Services business in order to 
assist the separation. Also, Migration 
and Services Committee meetings are 
held weekly. The Group’s management 
is required to allocate time and resources 
to the separation and to ensure that 
the Group’s obligations under the 
Transitional Services Agreement are 
fulfilled. This may limit the management 
and financial resources available for the 
retained Cambian Group.

Risk management
continued Viability statement
The directors have assessed the prospects 
of the Group over a three year period to  
31 December 2019 , and have considered this 
to be the most appropriate time period since 
it conforms with the Group’s strategic plan. 
In making their assessment, the directors 
considered Cambian’s availability of 
cash following the disposal of the Adult 
Services business and the planned return 
of capital; considered the current financial 
and operational position; considered 
the contracted and forecast capital 
expenditure of the Group; and assessed 
the potential impacts of the identified risks 
and uncertainties. 
Based on this assessment, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet their 
liabilities as they fall due through to  
31 December 2019.
Going concern statement
The directors have considered the Group’s 
financial resources including a review of 
the medium-term financial plan, which 
includes a review of the Group’s cash flow 
forecasts for the period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of these financial 
statements. The directors have reviewed 
the assumptions that underlie the cash flow 
forecasts produced by management and 
considered the availability of cash following 
the disposal of the Adult Services business 
and the planned return of capital. Based on 
these considerations, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for at 
least 12 months from the date of approval of 
these financial statements. For this reason, 
the directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Going concern  
and viability statement
• Systems – the immaturity of financial 
and operations systems and processes 
prevents effective business operations 
and sustainable future growth. However, 
the Group is developing a mapping 
of systems to improve visibility and to 
enable the Group to understand the 
overall systems landscape. The Group 
has also improved processes as part  
of a finance remediation plan.
• National Living Wage/sleep-ins – 
additional costs of National Living Wage 
on “sleep-ins” could be material. The 
Group operates a number of units 
where individuals “sleep-in” overnight 
and are paid an allowance for doing so. 
The Group’s view is that this practice is 
not in breach of the National Minimum 
Wage Act 1998 or the National Minimum 
Wage Regulations 2015 (as amended 
and in force). However, HMRC has made 
enquiries of Cambian and, the Board 
believes, other care service providers, 
regarding payments for individuals who 
are engaged in a “sleep-in”. HMRC’s 
enquiries are at a preliminary stage and 
it is not possible to say when HMRC may 
conclude their enquiries in this area or 
what the result of those enquiries may 
be. However, if it is ultimately judicially 
determined that Cambian had to pay 
each individual engaged in a “sleep-in” 
an amount calculated by reference to  
the National Living Wage, the additional 
cost could be material. 
• Staffing – the reduction in size and 
diversification of the Cambian Group 
post the disposal of the Adult Services 
business may make it more difficult to 
attract and retain talented employees 
which could adversely affect the Group’s 
business, financial condition, results of 
operations and prospects. The difficulty 
in attracting and retaining staff may then 
directly lead to challenges in achieving 
occupancy targets.

Our strategic risks evolve over time. We have identified that the risk profile of certain risks has changed over the past year. For example, 
the strategic risk of integration on acquisition has decreased (as 2017 will be a year of transition for Cambian with further growth delayed 
until 2018), whereas the risk profile of Government Action has increased (due to the potential risks in healthcare from Brexit). New principal 
risks have also been highlighted including the risk of the National Living Wage as well as risks linked to the disposal of the Adult Services 
business, namely the separation of services and the potential implications of warranties and indemnities in the acquisition documentation. 
As set out below, Cambian is taking steps to mitigate each of these risks where possible.

in modern, high quality facilities or within 
well supported, outstanding foster families 
that deliver outcomes leading to a better 
quality of life for our service users. 
For every person in our care, these 
achievements are of significant benefit to 
society. To highlight a few of these: this year 
we celebrated the achievements of service 
users including an ex-pupil of Wisbech

Our Code of Conduct provides the 
framework for our policies, programmes 
and procedures for a range of issues 
relating to corporate responsibility. It sets  
out broad principles based on the common 
values of responsibility, accountability, 
integrity, honesty, fairness and transparency.
This gives us a clear understanding of how 
we do business and how we work with 
each other and those in our care, as well as 
with other stakeholders. It applies to every 
Cambian employee and it applies to every 
interaction we make.
In 2016, we continued to review our core 
values and Code of Conduct to make sure 
they reflect our diverse business. More work 
is being done in 2017 to bring together a 
Cambian culture with shared values and 
common goals, whilst being aligned to our 
core purpose to be a high quality provider  
of specialist education and behavioural 
health services for children in the UK. 
Social and community involvement
Cambian focuses on developing strong ties 
with the local communities in which we are 
situated. It helps foster an understanding  
in the community of the work that we do 
and also has therapeutic and educational 
benefits for those in our care. There are 
numerous examples of community 
participation in 2016, such as:
• Forming partnerships with a number of 
local schools, colleges and universities 
across the country to champion career 
opportunities and working in the  
care industry.
• Three sixth form students from Hill House 
School have work experience placements 
at the local shop, where they attend each 
week. Students also make items in design 
technology workshops and then take 
these to the shop to go on sale. 
• Staff at some of the children’s homes 
in Hereford & Worcester took part in 
hosting tea mornings in our homes so 
that neighbours could better understand 
the role that Cambian plays in supporting 
vulnerable children. 
• Bletchley Park School helped St Mary’s 
Church to set up a sensory garden 
for community use and also hosted a 
Harvest Festival and Christmas Carol 
Service at a local church. 
• Last year, as part of the annual Hill 
House careers week, the local police 
spent the day with the students. 
Being a successful and sustainable business requires 
Cambian to do more than generate a financial return 
for our shareholders. We believe our continued success 
depends on acknowledging and fulfilling our responsibilities 
to those individuals who are entrusted to our care, to our 
employees and our other stakeholders.

Strategic report Strategic report Cambian has also been involved in various 
environmentally conscious projects within 
the community, including:
• Launching a ‘free tree pack’ for schools, 
whereby schools could apply for a 
number of tree saplings to be planted  
in the school grounds. 
• Bletchley Park School students supported 
the Millennium Garden in Solbury by 
assisting with gardening. 
We actively encourage everyone within the 
Group to support both local and national 
charities and participate in all manner of 
fundraising activities. Some examples  
of these during 2016 are:
• Cambian’s first charity ball was hosted 
in Northampton, raising money for ‘Who 
Cares Trust’, which is a London based 
advocacy and support charity for young 
people who are care leavers. 
• A number of our staff and young people 
took part in Cancer Research races to 
raise money for charity. 
• Hill House School regularly raises money 
for the ‘Music for Autism’ charity, which 
comes each year to host a day of music 
for all students to attend. 
• Abbeyfield staff and young people sent 
Christmas present shoe boxes to an 
African orphanage.
In 2016, Cambian continued to fund a full 
time placement for one young person in 
one of our autism schools.
In addition, one young person came to  
a Cambian care home with jaded views 
about how the country is run and how 
decisions about children in care are made. 
At the same time, the community in the 
locality of the home was having issues  
with youths; the local residents and  
parish council (including an MP) made an 
assumption that Cambian’s service users 
were involved even though this was not the 
case. Feeling strongly about this and after 
discussion with our service users on their 
views about people’s perceptions, we 
decided that we would like to meet with  
the MP to provide him with an understanding  
of the difficulties that young people in care 
face around out of area placements and  
the stigma they face.
We met the MP at Portcullis House and the 
young people were able to discuss their 
thoughts in a constructive and professional 
manner. The young people were given a 
guided tour of Parliament. It was fantastic 
for the young people (particularly given 
historic views they might have had) to see 
democracy in action and to also get their 
voices heard at the highest levels.
A key component of our corporate 
responsibility programme relates to 
ensuring that our business activities are 
conducted in such a way that we are not 
complicit in the abuse of fundamental 
human rights and labour rights. This is  
a particular issue with the services that 
Cambian provides to our service users  
who may have mental health issues or 
intellectual difficulties that make the issues 
of consent to treatment particularly 
sensitive. The Group places particular 
emphasis, through training and policies, 
that before any service users receive any 
care or treatment they are asked for their 
consent and the provider acts in accordance 
with their wishes, or where people do not 
have the capacity to consent, the provider 
acts in accordance with legal requirements.
Employees
Our people are at the heart of our business; 
they are central to the quality of care and 
support we offer to those entrusted to us. 
The pursuit of talent in the care sector 
remains a challenge, so the recruitment, 
retention and development of our people 
continues to be a key priority for the Group.
Following a comprehensive review of the 
Group’s HR and talent strategy, we have 
been building upon existing initiatives and 
evolving to help build the best talent pool 
and lay solid foundations for a working 
culture across the business:
We identified what good looks like
• We have standardised role profiles 
across the Group with a clear outline  
of accountabilities, required experience 
and skills.
We are proactively sourcing candidates
• Along with enhancing our direct sourcing 
channels (reducing our reliance on 
costly recruitment agencies), we are 
undertaking proactive searches for 
passive candidates with greater use  
of referrals.
We are attracting the right people
• We have put together a strong employer 
brand and are attracting people who 
want meaningful work and are trusted  
to do a good job.
We are forward thinking with our  
selection criteria
• We are looking to recruit people with 
motivation and passion for a career in 
care, not just looking at their experience.
We have a strong induction programme
• We communicate with candidates prior 
to them joining to fully engage them with 
the organisation.
The Group’s policy is that it will not tolerate 
discrimination, directly or indirectly, in 
recruitment or employment because of  
age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, 
pregnancy, maternity, race, sexual 
orientation, religion or belief, or because 
someone is married or in a civil partnership. 
We demonstrate our commitment by:
• Promoting equal opportunity for our 
current and potential team members
• Reflecting the communities in which  
we work
• Aiming to build teams which reflect the 
diversity of our customers and treating 
our customers, partners and team 
members fairly and with respect
• Promoting an environment free from 
discrimination, bullying and harassment, 
and tackling behaviour which may 
breach this intent

Environmental
This section includes our mandatory 
reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
(“GHG emissions”) pursuant to the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report  
and Directors’ Report Regulations 2013)  
(the “Regulations”). We include this reporting 
data in this section in order to provide a 
complete corporate responsibility picture.
GHG emissions reporting
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008  
as amended in August 2013.
Reporting boundary
The reporting boundary used for collation of 
the above data is consistent with that used 
for consolidation purposes in the financial 
statements. We report our emissions data 
using an operational control approach to 
define our organisational boundary, which 
meets the definitional requirements of the 
Regulations in respect of those emissions for 
which we are responsible. We have reported 
on all material emission sources for which 
we deem ourselves to be responsible. These 
sources align with our operational control 
and financial control boundaries. We do not 
have responsibility for any emission sources 
that are beyond the boundary of our 
operational control. For example, business 
travel other than by car (including, for 
example, commercial flights) is not within 
our operational control and, therefore,  
is not considered to be our responsibility.
Methodology
The GHG emissions report has been 
prepared in line with UK mandatory 
reporting requirements, set by the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA). The mandatory requirement 
is for the disclosure of scope 1 and 2 
emissions only. These are direct emissions 
such as heating, vehicle fuel and indirect 
emissions, for example purchased gas and 
electricity. The Group’s total GHG footprint in 
line with DEFRA’s mandatory reporting 
requirements is 21.6m tonnes of CO
2
e.
Intensity ratio
In order to express our annual emissions in 
relation to a quantifiable factor associated 
with our activities, we have used revenue “r” 
in our intensity ratio calculation, as this is the 
most relevant indication of our growth and 
provides for a good comparative measure 
over time.
We continue to make a concerted effort to 
reduce our carbon footprint. For example, 
across our business we continue to focus  
on the reduction of emissions by:
• Implementing vehicle tracking on fleet 
vehicles to promote less aggressive  
and more fuel efficient driving strategies
• Adopting new, more energy efficient 
standards and specifications for 
building new facilities and conversions 
of buildings that we acquire and aim to 
achieve minimum BREEAM standards 
wherever possible
• Implementation of a range of energy 
efficiency projects including the 
introduction of more energy efficient 
condenser boilers into our facilities and 
better insulation specifications at all sites 
unless prohibited by Listed Building or 
Conservation Areas
• Promoting the use of rail travel
Modern Slavery 
This section includes our policy statement  
in relation to anti-slavery and human 
trafficking as required under the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015.
We have a zero tolerance approach to 
modern slavery across all areas of our 
organisation, as well as in our supply 
chains. We are committed to ensuring we 
are not connected to modern slavery in any 
way. We aim to ensure that our business 
operates in an open and transparent way 
and our approach to tackling modern 
slavery throughout our supply chains  
is consistent with our obligations under  
the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We are currently working to put in place an 
Anti-slavery and human trafficking policy.
We aim to work in partnership with all our 
contractors, suppliers and other business 
partners to ensure that they share and work 
towards the same values we hold against 
slavery and human trafficking. Going 
forward, our intention is to put in place 
processes and procedures whereby we ask 
our suppliers to confirm their compliance 
with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

statement can be found on our website.

Strategic report Strategic report Christopher Kemball
Chairman
Dear Shareholder
Introduction
Corporate governance at Cambian is about 
running the business in the right way in 
order to create long-term sustainable value 
for the benefit of all of our stakeholders: 
those placed under our care, their families, 
our commissioners, our regulators and our 
shareholders. I hope that by reading our 
governance reports you will gain a better 
understanding of our culture and  
the effectiveness of our Board.
What good governance means  
to Cambian
Corporate governance at Cambian is 
treated as a core and vital discipline that 
complements our need to improve the 
performance of the business on behalf 
of our service users, commissioners and 
shareholders. Our approach to governance 
is set by the Board. Our executive board 
then ensures that our approach is effectively 
implemented across the entire business, 
and that our employees are aware of, and 
live by, our culture and uphold the highest 
standards of service. We believe that effective 
governance is achieved through leadership 
and collaboration, resulting in consistently 
focused and sensible business decisions.
Board performance in 2016
Non-executive site visits
The independent role of our non-executive 
directors is extremely important to us. We 
are determined to ensure that they can 
play an active role in the development 
and management of our business. We do 
not believe they can develop a complete 
picture of how the Group operates by simply 
reviewing Board papers and attending Board 
and committee meetings.
We are therefore implementing a 
programme of individual site visits for  
each of our non-executive directors. These 
visits give our non-executive directors a 
valuable opportunity to meet and engage 
with our local management teams to 
better understand local operations and 
procedures and to get to know our people 
and those for whom they care.
Performance evaluation
Because of the priorities of negotiating a 
settlement with our lending banks at the 
beginning of the year and the sale process of 
our Adult Services business for the remainder 
of the year, the Board decided exceptionally 
to forego an evaluation during 2016. There 
will, however, be a full evaluation towards  
the end of the current year.
Board experience
To achieve its governance objectives, the 
Board comprises a majority of independent 
non-executive directors who have been 
selected to deliver an appropriate mix 
of diversity, skills and experience. The 
Board is led by an independent Chairman, 
who in turn is well-supported by a Senior 
Independent Director.
Board committees
At the time of our 2015 Annual Report, the 
Board had formed three committees: Audit 
and Risk, Remuneration and Nomination. 
Previously, the Board had also formed a 
Quality and Risk Committee. The remit of 
this Committee was then assumed by the 
Audit & Risk Committee (which provided 
a single point for assisting the Board in its 
obligations pursuant to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code with regard to risk). 
Induction of new NEDs
We were delighted to welcome Mike 
Butterworth and Donald Muir as independent 
non-executive directors in April 2016 and 
June 2016 respectively. In conjunction with 
the Company Secretary, we provided a 
tailored induction programme designed 
to ensure that Mike and Donald obtained 
a comprehensive picture of Cambian’s 
operations and culture.
Disposals Committee
Given the intensive process required 
to prepare for, and oversee, the sale of 
the Adult Services business in 2016, the 
Board formed a new committee called 
the Disposals Committee on 6 June 2016. 
The committee consisted entirely of non-
executive directors, was chaired by Mike 
Butterworth and also comprised Christopher 
Kemball, Donald Muir and Alfred Foglio. The 
committee met at least once a week with 
the executive directors and advisers and 
had a total of 27 meetings. The committee 
was disbanded on 28 December 2016 
following successful completion of the  
sale of the Adult Services business. 
Governance overview
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 34 The Board has now re-considered how 
it could most effectively discharge its 
responsibilities under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code for monitoring risk 
and particularly in relation to quality and 
clinical risk. Following such review and 
consideration, the Board decided that, with 
effect from 1 January 2017 , the Board will be 
assisted in relation to quality and clinical 
risk by a new committee, the Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee. As mentioned 
above, a Disposals Committee was also 
formed in 2016 and was disbanded on 
28 December 2016. The composition and 
terms of reference of the committees of the 
Board are described in more detail in this 
Governance section of this report.
Strategic oversight
I have had regular meetings during the 
year with our Chief Executive, Saleem 
Asaria, and other members of the executive 
management team at Cambian and will 
continue to do so in 2017 . These meetings 
enable me to stay abreast of developments 
in the business between Board meetings 
and to confirm that we are continuing to 
perform against our strategic objectives.
Last October, we held a constructive  
strategy meeting with executive 
management which enabled the Board  
to assist the executive in further defining  
our strategy and to identify areas where  
the Group could develop further.

Section of the Code Further information
Leadership
A company must be headed by an effective board which is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the company. There should be  
clear divisions of responsibility between the running of the board (led by  
the Chairman) and the executive. 
Board leadership, 
pp. 38 and 39
Effectiveness
The established board and its committees will have the relevant level of and 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of 
the company in order to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. Such knowledge is certified by rigorous procedures regarding the 
appointment of new, and the re-appointment of existing, directors. All directors 
should allocate sufficient time to the company.
Evaluation,  
p. 41
Accountability
At all times, the board must present a fair, balanced and understandable 
evaluation of the company’s position and prospects. Such future prospects 
are considered against risks that the company is facing, or may face, moving 
forward; it is the board’s responsibility to ensure that effective and appropriate 
risk management and internal control procedures are in place.
Strategic report  
pp. 1 to 33
Remuneration
While it is necessary for levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate 
directors of sufficient quality, at no point should the company allocate more than 
is necessary. Where possible, remuneration should be designed to promote 
the long-term success of the company, linked to performance and, at all times, 
established through formal and transparent procedures of which no one director 
is involved in his or her own remuneration.
Directors’ 
remuneration

Senior independent

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 37
Governance UK Corporate Governance Compliance statement
In September 2014, the Financial Reporting Council published  
the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the  
“Code”) (a copy of which is available on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk)) which contains broad  
principles and specific provisions to assist with how boards  
operate. Although a new edition of the Code was published  
in 2016, the 2014 edition applied to Cambian during the financial 
year ended 31 December 2016.
As disclosed in the directors’ remuneration report on page 55, 
a nil-cost option award was made to the Chief Executive Officer 
(which was made prior to Admission) which vests as to one-third of 
the award on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the 
date of Admission. This award does not contain any performance-
related vesting conditions as recommended in Schedule A of the 
Code since it was made prior to Admission and in part to reward for 
past performance and to provide a long-term retention mechanism 
for the executive directors and key senior managers.
Also, due to priorities of negotiating a settlement with its lending 
banks and the subsequent sale of the Group’s Adult Services 
business, the annual performance evaluation did not occur in 2016 
and the non-executive directors (led by the senior independent 
director) did not meet in 2016 without the Chairman present to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance. 
As the performance evaluation did not (exceptionally) occur in 2016, 
there was no review of directors’ training and development needs 
in 2016 (as such a review is normally done in the formal annual 
review process). However, it is intended that there will be such a 
performance evaluation towards the end of 2017 , which will include 
such a review of directors’ training and development needs.
The Board decided not to hold any Nomination Committee meetings 
in 2016 due to the intensive negotiations which took place with its 
lending banks at the beginning of 2016 and then the equally intensive 
process preparing and then selling the Group’s Adult Services 
business. The Nomination Committee therefore did not lead the 
process for board appointments and did not prepare a description 
of the roles and capabilities required for appointments. Instead, the 
executive and non-executive appointments were handled as special 
items in the main Board meetings. The Nomination Committee will 
revert to its normal schedule in 2017 . There is therefore no Nomination 
Committee report in the Annual Report. The Nomination Committee’s 
responsibilities are summarised below:
• Review of the structure, size and composition of the Board  
and consideration of succession planning for the directors  
and senior management; 
• Identification and nomination of candidates to Board 
appointments for approval by the Board; and
• Evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge, experience  
and diversity in the Board and preparation of a description  
of the capabilities, required for particular appointment.
The terms of reference of the Nomination Committee are available 
on the Company’s website.
Neither an external search consultancy nor open advertising 
were used in the appointment of Mike Butterworth and Donald 
Muir in 2016; Mike Butterworth was referred to the Board through 
a personal contact of the Chairman and was then subsequently 
interviewed by the senior independent director and other 
non-executive directors and Donald Muir was included on a 
recommended list of persons provided by the Group’s lending 
banks and the appointment was required by the banks in the 
Group’s facility amendment agreement.
The senior independent director has not attended meetings  
with major shareholders, although was available to attend  
such meetings if so requested. Both the Chairman and the  
Chief Executive Officer have attended such meetings.
Save as disclosed above, the Board considers that it has complied 
with the provisions of the Code throughout the year. 
Board leadership
Role of the Board
The Board has collective responsibility for the management, 
direction and performance of the Company. It provides leadership 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls seeking 
to enable risk to be appropriately assessed and managed. The 
Board has established the governance framework (as described 
in the risk management section at pages 24 to 27) to support the 
development of good governance practices throughout the Group.
The Board takes a long-term outlook and sees itself as responsible 
to a wide range of stakeholders including shareholders, customers, 
care commissioning bodies and employees, whilst pursuing its 
objectives in a manner consistent with its statutory duties.
Board composition and balance
As at 31 December 2016, the Board comprised the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, together with 
five independent non-executive directors (including one senior 
independent director) and one further non-executive director.
The list of current directors, their roles and respective dates of 
appointment are set out in the table below.
Director’s name Title Appointed
Christopher Kemball Non-executive director, Chairman March 2014
Saleem Asaria Executive director, CEO March 2014
Anne Marie Carrie Executive director, COO December 
2016
Chris Brinsmead Non-executive, Senior Independent

Donald Muir Independent non-executive director June 2016
Each of Alison Halsey and Chris Brinsmead, CBE will be stepping 
down from the Board with effect from the end of the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”).
Further biographical information on each of the Company’s directors 
can be found on pages 36 and 37 , which shows the breadth 
of strategic and financial management insight brought to the 
Company’s Board. The independent non-executive directors bring 
industry experience from a wide range of backgrounds including 
finance, business services, pharmaceuticals, telecoms, software 
and the NHS.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 38
Corporate governance report The principle of boardroom diversity is strongly supported by the 
Board. It is the Board’s policy that appointments will always be 
based on merit so that the Board has the right individuals in place. 
The Board ensures that diversity is an important consideration and 
part of the selection criteria used to assess candidates to achieve  
a balanced board.
The Board also reviews non-executive directors’ independence 
on an annual basis, taking into account such factors as their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate during meetings. 
All non-executive directors (other than Alfred Foglio) are considered 
by the Board to be independent of management and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of 
their independent judgement, as explained above. Alfred Foglio is 
not considered to be independent for the purposes of the Code as a 
result of his being the director appointed to the Board by GI Partners 
in accordance with the terms of the Relationship Agreement as 
described on page 42.
To safeguard their independence, a director is not entitled to vote  
on any matter in which they have a material personal interest 
unless the rest of the Board unanimously decides otherwise.  
Where necessary, directors are required to absent themselves from 
a meeting of the Board while such matters are being discussed, 
although no such situations arose in 2016. The Board has an annual 
process of formally reviewing conflicts disclosed and governing 
the authorisations given (including such conditions as the Board 
may determine in each case). Any conflicts, or potential conflicts, 
considered by the Board and any authorisations given are recorded 
in the Board minutes and in a register of directors’ conflicts which is 
maintained by the Company Secretary. 
Mike Butterworth and Donald Muir joined the Board in April 
2016 and June 2016 respectively. The Board, in conjunction 
with the Company Secretary, provided a tailored induction 
programme designed to ensure that Mike and Donald obtained 
a comprehensive picture of Cambian’s operations and culture. 
Anne Marie Carrie rejoined the Board as an executive director in 
December 2016. Anne Marie has managed the Children’s Services 
business of the Cambian Group for two years and had previously 
been a non-executive director of the Company and therefore a 
formal induction process was not required. 
How the Board functions
The Board meets regularly, with nine scheduled meetings held 
in 2016. In addition, 13 other meetings were held outside of this 
schedule, principally related to the consideration of the Group’s 
indebtedness and subsequent approval of the disposal of the 
Group’s Adult Services business.
During 2016, one Board meeting was held near to a regional 
management centre of the Group and one Board meeting was held 
at a Cambian operating facility. This enabled all directors to meet 
different management teams to broaden their knowledge of the 
Group’s operations and of the industry in general. It is proposed that 
some Board meetings in 2017 will also be held at Group regional 
management centres for the same reasons. 
During the year, the Chairman met with the other non-executives 
in the absence of the executive directors to re-confirm and take 
account of their views. 
Roles and responsibilities
The roles of the Chairman (Christopher Kemball) and the  
Chief Executive Officer (Saleem Asaria) are separated and  
clearly defined.

Governance In addition to receiving reports from the Board’s committees, reviewing the financial and operational performance of the Group and 
considering reports from the Company’s risk management and care quality functions at the Board meetings, key matters considered by the 
Board during 2016 included the consideration of the Group’s indebtedness and the consideration and subsequent approval of the disposal 
of the Group’s Adult Services business.
Details of the attendance of the directors at meetings of the Board and its committees in 2016, as well as the AGM and general meetings,

Responsibility and delegation
There remains in place a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for Board consideration and approval, which includes  
the matters set out below: 
• Approval of the Group’s long-term objectives and commercial 
strategy;
• Approval of the annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any material changes to them;
• Major acquisitions and disposals;
• The extension of the Group’s activities into any new business  
or geographic areas, or to cease any material operations;
• Changes in the Company’s capital structure or entering into any 
material bank facilities or granting security;
• Approval of treasury policies, including foreign currency 
exposures and use of financial derivatives;
• The entering into of agreements that are not in the ordinary 
course of business or material either strategically or by reason  
of their size;
• Changes to the size, composition or structure of the Board  
and its committees; and
• Corporate governance matters.
In 2016, the Board delegated certain of its responsibilities to a 
number of committees of the Board to assist in the discharge of 
its duties. The principal committees of the Board were: the Audit & 
Risk Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination 
Committee. With effect from 1 January 2017 , the Audit & Risk 
Committee was split to form the Audit Committee (which is, inter 
alia, responsible for reporting to the Board on financial risks) and 
the Quality and Safeguarding Committee (which is responsible 
for reporting to the Board on issues of safeguarding, clinical or 
operational risk). The composition of these committees is set out 
on page 37 and a report on each of the Committees’ activities in 
2016 (as appropriate) is set out on pages 43 to 59. As previously 
explained, as the Nomination Committee did not meet in 2016, a 
report on the activity of this Committee is not included in this Report. 
The minutes of these Committees are circulated and reviewed by 
the Board. The Company Secretary is secretary to each of these 
Committees. The terms of reference for the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination Committee, the Quality and Safeguarding Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee are available to view on the 
Company’s website. On 6 June 2016, a Disposals Committee was 
also formed (which was disbanded on 28 December 2016) to 
consider the disposal of the Adult Services business.
Risk
Under the Code, the Board is responsible for determining the nature 
and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. The Board should maintain a sound system 
of risk management and internal control systems (Main Principle 
C.2). During the year and with the assistance of the Audit & Risk 
Committee (as it then was), the Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The Board also carried out a review of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems. These risks, and the steps taken by Cambian to 
mitigate them, are described more fully on pages 28 and 29. The 
viability statement required to be made under Code provision C.2.2. 
is set out on page 27 .

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 40
Corporate governance report
continued Board balance
The Board comprises individuals with wide business experience 
gained in various industry sectors related to the Group’s business 
and it is the intention of the Board to ensure that the balance of the 
directors reflects the changing needs of the business.
The Chairman and the rest of the Board continue to support Lord 
Davies’ aspiration for female board representation. At the end of 
2016, two of the Group’s Board directors (22%) were women, which 
is only very slightly below the 25% recommended by the Davies 
Report. Further details on the diversity of the workforce of the Group 
generally are set out on page 31.
While not having a specific policy regarding the constitution and 
balance of the Board, potential new directors are considered on 
their own merits with regards to their skills, knowledge, experience 
and credentials.
Evaluation
A performance evaluation (exceptionally) did not occur in 2016 due 
to priorities of negotiating a settlement with the Group’s lending 
banks at the beginning of 2016 and the process to effect the sale  
of the Group’s Adult Services business for the remainder of the year. 
The Board intends, however, for there to be a full evaluation towards 
the end of 2017 of the performance of the Board, its committees and 
the individual directors. It is also proposed that such a review will 
also include a review of the Chairman’s performance.
Board tenure
In accordance with the articles of association of the Company, every 
new director appointed in the year is required to stand for election 
by shareholders at the AGM next following their appointment, and 
at each AGM any director who shall have been a director at each of 
the two preceding AGMs shall retire.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the articles of association, the 
Board has decided to comply with the Code requirements that 
directors of companies in the FTSE 350 Index submit themselves for 
re-election annually. Therefore, all the directors (other than Alison 
Halsey and Chris Brinsmead, who will stepping down from the Board 
at the AGM) are seeking their re-appointment at this year’s AGM.
The Board has collectively agreed that the directors proposed for 
re-election or election (as the case may be) at this year’s AGM 
have made significant contributions to the business since their 
appointment, election or last re-election (as the case may be)  
and each has a key role to play in the formulation of the Group’s 
future strategy.
Time commitment and training
All directors are aware of the need to allocate sufficient time to the 
Company in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The 
Company provides the non-executive directors with appropriate 
support and facilities for the consideration of the Company’s 
strategy and performance, and a dialogue with the Chairman 
is encouraged so that any issues regarding time pressures or 
conflicting commitments are addressed appropriately. The Board 
monitors the extent of directors’ external interests and any conflicts 
on a continuing basis. The letters of appointment for non-executive 
directors set out the time commitment expected to be necessary to 
perform their duties.
During the year, the non-executive directors received a number of 
presentations from the executive directors and senior management 
in relation to the business of the Group, including presentations 
on the services provided by the Group. There will be a continued 
focus during 2017 on ensuring that through a combination of 
presentations, teach-ins and site visits, the non-executive directors 
are provided with sufficient information for them to fully understand 
the challenges and opportunities in the services provided by the 
Group, particularly after the disposal of the Adult Services business.
The Chairman consults with the directors on their respective training 
and development requirements as part of the annual review 
process which exceptionally did not occur in 2016 but which will be 
done towards the end of 2017 . All directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary and a procedure is in place 
for them to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense should this be required.
Information and training provided to directors
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring good 
information flows within the Board and its Committees and 
between the senior management and the non-executive directors 
and for arranging any additional training that the directors may 
require. The Board uses a secure, web-based system which 
provides quick, easy and secure access to Board papers and 
materials. Prior to each Board meeting, the directors receive 
(through this system) the agenda and supporting papers to ensure 
that they have all the latest and relevant information in advance of 
the meeting. After each Board meeting, the Company Secretary 
operates a comprehensive follow-up procedure to ensure that 
actions are completed as agreed by the Board. 
Where a director was unable to attend a meeting, they were 
provided with all the papers and information relating to that 
meeting and were able to discuss issues arising directly with  
the Chair of that meeting.
Directors’ and Officers’ indemnity insurance
The Company recognises that all directors are equally and 
collectively accountable under the law for the proper stewardship 
of the Company’s affairs. The Company maintains a Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policy for the benefit of the Company  
and the directors.
Relationship with shareholders
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company maintains 
a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders. The Chairman and the 
Senior Independent Director are available to major shareholders. 
Formal trading updates are given to the market during the year. 
Following each of these announcements, conference calls are held 
with shareholders and analysts and after the full year and interim 
results a presentation is made to the shareholders and analysts. 
Analyst research is circulated to the Board. A programme of meetings 
and conference calls is also organised at appropriate times during 
the year at which the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer comment on Company performance and respond to any 
issues raised by investors. Members of the Board, and in particular 
non-executive directors, are kept informed of investors’ views in the 
main through distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings.
The major shareholders of the Company are listed in the Directors’ 
Report on page 61.

Governance Relationship Agreement
The Company’s largest shareholder, GI Partners (through Care 
Aspirations II LLC, Advanced Childcare LLC and Cambian Holdings 
LLC) (“GI Partners”) is one of the Group’s founders. In accordance with 
the requirements of the Listing Rules, the Company, GI Partners and 
GI Partners UK Limited entered into a relationship agreement on 
11 April 2014 (the “Relationship Agreement”). The principal purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the Company and 
the Group are capable at all times of carrying on their business 
independently of GI Partners and certain persons deemed to be 
connected with it (together the “Potential Controlling Shareholders”) 
and that agreements and transactions with GI Partners and/or any 
Potential Controlling Shareholders will be at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms. The Relationship Agreement entitles GI 
Partners to nominate one person to be a director of the Company for 
so long as the Potential Controlling Shareholder controls at least 10% 
of the voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company. 
The current nominee is Alfred Foglio.
Under the Relationship Agreement, GI Partners and GI Partners UK 
Limited have agreed (inter alia) that:
(i)  it will vote its shares in such a manner so as to procure that each 
member of the Group is capable of carrying on its business 
independently of the Potential Controlling Shareholders;
(ii)  it will not exercise any of the voting rights attaching to its shares  
in such a manner so as to procure any amendment to the articles 
of association which would be inconsistent with, undermine or 
breach any of the provisions of the Relationship Agreement;
(iii)  it will not take any action which has or would have the effect 
of preventing the Company or any other member of the Group 
from carrying on its business independently of GI Partners or 
any Potential Controlling Shareholders;
(iv)  it will not take any action which has or would have the effect 
of preventing the Company or any other member of the Group 
from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules;
(v)  it will not exercise any of its voting rights with respect to its 
shares in a manner that would require the Company to operate 
or make decisions solely for the benefit of any member of the  
GI Group;
(vi)  it will not propose or procure the proposal of a resolution of 
the shareholders (or any class thereof) which is intended or 
reasonably appears to be intended to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules;
(vii)  it will not exercise any of its voting rights to vary the articles of 
association of the Company which would: (a) be contrary to the 
maintenance of the Company’s independence (including the 
Company’s ability to operate and make decisions independently 
of GI Partners’ Group); (b) prevent the election of independent 
directors; or (c) be inconsistent with, undermine or breach any 
provision of the Relationship Agreement or the Listing Rules; and

(viii)  it will abstain from voting on any resolution: (a) required by 
paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules to approve a transaction 
with a related party involving GI Partners or any Potential 
Controlling Shareholders; and (b) proposed by the Company 
in respect of the election or appointment of an Independent 
Director (whether or not the same is required by the Listing 
Rules) where the Company shall have given GI Partners  
written notice requiring it to abstain.
The Chairman has reviewed the operation of the Relationship 
Agreement and believes that the Company has complied with 
its obligations under the Relationship Agreement and, so far as 
the Company is aware, the independence provisions included in 
the Relationship Agreement have been complied with during the 
period under review by GI Partners and/or any Potential Controlling 
Shareholders. The Board believes that the provisions of the 
Relationship Agreement and of Rule 11 of the Listing Rules provide 
reassurance that GI Partners and GI Partners UK Limited will not 
seek to exercise its shareholding capriciously and re-enforces the 
independence of the Company.
Details of any related party transactions are set out in note 34  
to the financial statements on page 103 of this document.
Constructive use of the AGM
The 2017 AGM will be held on 5 June 2017 at Trowers & Hamlins 
LLP’s offices, 3 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8YZ at 2pm. Formal notice 
of the meeting and details of and an explanation for the reasons 
for the resolutions to be put to shareholders, are contained in the 
separate notice of meeting that accompanies this report.
The Board views the AGM as an opportunity to communicate with 
investors. All directors are expected to attend the Company’s AGM 
and shareholders are invited to ask questions during the meeting 
and to meet directors after the formal proceedings have ended. It is 
intended that, as was the case at the previous AGM of the Company, 
there shall be a poll vote on each resolution at the 2017 AGM. The 
audited, final results of the poll votes will be released to the London 
Stock Exchange and published on the Company’s website, as soon 
as is practicable after the conclusion of the meeting.
Shareholders are encouraged to participate in the AGM.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 42 Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to give you an overview of the operation and scope  
of the Committee and report on our work over the past year.
The 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
has placed greater emphasis on risk and the responsibility of 
boards for an organisation’s overall approach to risk. In particular, 
boards are required to ensure the design and implementation of 
appropriate risk management and internal control systems that 
identify the risks facing a company and enable the board to make  
a robust assessment of the principal risks.
As set out on page 25, the Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the nature of the risk it is willing to take and ensuring that 
risks are managed effectively across the Group. The way in which the 
Company manages risk is set out on pages 24 to 27 with the principal 
risks facing the Group set out on pages 28 to 29. We have reviewed 
the continuing effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
processes as part of our review of the effectiveness of internal controls.
The Committee recognises the paramount importance of the quality 
of care in all our facilities. Reports on care quality and related issues 
were made to each meeting in 2016 (noting that the Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee has now been established from 1 January 
2017). Considerable progress has been made in formalising 
governance processes for these matters up to Board level.
The Committee has a vital role in providing assurance that the 
financial statements provide a true and fair view of the Group’s 
financial affairs. As part of this assurance, we conduct a review of 
any significant financial judgements made during the year and any 
key financial reporting issues. The Committee concluded that we 
are satisfied with the judgements being made on all of these issues. 
More details can be found on pages 44 and 45 of this report.
Having been asked to do so by the Board, we also conducted  
a comprehensive review of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 
and confirmed that they are fair, balanced and capable of being 
understood by shareholders and that they include all the necessary 
information to allow our shareholders to assess Cambian’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy. We have advised the 
Board accordingly.
Following a review of the external auditor’s independence and 
effectiveness, the Committee has made a recommendation to the 
Board that the external auditors are reappointed for the year ending 
31 December 2017 . Further information on this review and our policy 
on non-audit fees can be found on page 46 of this report.
During the year I have met, individually and in private, with 
management in order to understand more fully the context and 
challenges of their business operations and thereby ensure the 
Committee’s time was used most effectively. I also met informally 
with a number of members of management below Board level  
to gain a deeper insight into areas relevant to the role of the 
Committee. The activities of the Committee members during the 
year have enabled it to gain a good understanding of the culture of 
the organisation, the risks and challenges faced and the adequacy 
and timeliness of the remedial actions being taken to address them.

Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal functions are to monitor the integrity 
of the Group’s financial reports; to assist the Board to monitor the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems (including 
those relating to care quality, until 31 December 2016) and to manage 
the Board’s relationship with the Group’s outsourced internal audit 
team and its external auditors. The functions of the Committee are 
summarised on page 43.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference (noting that the Audit 
& Risk Committee was split on 1 January 2017 into the Audit 
Committee and the Quality and Safeguarding Committee) include 
all relevant matters required by Rule 7 .1.3 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Code and are available on the 
Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Committee activities
The Committee met five times during the year. All members of the 
Committee are non-executive directors and all are considered by 
the Board to be independent. Its work included:
• Agreeing a strategic risk register for the Company and a 
framework within which to report on and manage risks within 
the business, which sought to capture both business risks and 
risks arising from the quality of care which Cambian delivers;
• Reviewing the contents of the Company’s strategic risk register, 
including the existing systems and controls that were seen as 
providing mitigations to these risks, and the process by which 
the same was compiled;
• Reviewing amended processes for risk management to monitor 
risk both in relation to care quality and clinical matters as well 
as business risk generally, in which the Company has been 
supported by work from PwC as an outsourced internal audit 
function which resulted in the framework described on page 45;
• Agreeing on the retention of PwC as internal auditors to the 
Company and their scope of work in the year under review; 
• Subjecting the financial control improvement programme to 
periodic review to assess priorities and consider and approve 
the extent of internal audit work in 2016; and 
• Reviewing the final and interim financial statements and matters 
raised by management and the external auditors. This review 
included consideration of the key judgements applied in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which are 
described in the relevant accounting policies and detailed in the 
notes to the financial statements on pages 77 to 103.
The Board considers that both Alison Halsey and Mike Butterworth, 
who replaced Alison as Chair on 1 January 2017 , have sufficient 
recent and relevant financial experience to discharge their duties 
as chair of the Committee. Alison is a Chartered Accountant and 
former partner at KPMG. Alison is also Chair of the audit committee 
at Provident Financial plc. Mike Butterworth is also a Chartered 
Accountant and former Chief Financial Officer of a FTSE250 
business. Mike is also Chairman of the audit committee at St Ives 
plc, Johnston Press plc and Stock Spirits Group Plc 
Significant financial matters
The Committee reviews all significant issues concerning the 
financial statements. The principal matters we considered 
concerning the 2016 financial statements were:
Value of goodwill & intangible assets
The Committee considered the judgements associated with the 
carrying value of goodwill in the Group’s two cash-generating  
units for the interim, and Children’s Services only following the 
disposal of the Adult Services business for the full year results.  
In addition, the Committee also considered the judgements made 
in relation to the valuation methodology adopted by management 
to support the carrying value of other intangible assets and the 
investments in subsidiaries, in particular the appropriateness of the 
discount rate applied. The Committee considered the assumptions, 
estimates and judgements made by management to support 
their models that underpin the valuation of intangible assets in 
the balance sheet. The key assumptions applied in the calculation 
relate to the future performance expectations of the business unit. 
Business plans and cash flow forecasts prepared by management 
supporting the future performance expectations used in the 
valuation were reviewed. The Committee received a report on the 
outcome of the impairment review performed by management. 
The impairment review was also an area of focus for the external 
auditor, who reported its findings to the Committee. The Committee 
satisfied itself that no material impairments were required to the 
carrying value of goodwill.
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
The Committee also considered whether the carrying value of fixed 
assets at loss-making sites could be supported on the basis of a 
comparison of net asset value, value in use or fair value less sale 
cost or whether asset impairments might be required under IAS 36: 
Impairment of assets. The Committee considered management’s 
assumptions and basis of valuation for those assets covered 
by the review. The audit plan agreed with the external auditors 
involved a critical evaluation of the completeness of management’s 
impairment review of fixed assets. The Committee satisfied itself 
that the review was robust and that no impairments to the carrying 
value of property, plant and equipment should be made.
Exceptional items
The Committee has considered the disclosure of exceptional items 
during the financial year, arising predominantly from refinancing 
and the disposal of the Adult Services business. The Committee 
noted that whether a cost is exceptional or not is an area of 
significant judgement and is an area of particular focus. The Audit 
Committee reviewed the one-off items of expense to ensure they 
were appropriately classified and were properly considered non-
recurring and exceptional in nature. The Committee was satisfied 
that material items of non-recurring expense or income were 
appropriately classified.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 44 Disposal of the Adult Services business
The disposal of the Adult Services business results in disclosure 
requirements for discontinued operations in the Annual Report, and 
a resulting gain on the disposal being recognised. The Committee 
has considered the appropriateness of management’s calculations 
in determining the split of activity between continuing and 
discontinued operations, the carrying value of the Adult Services 
business disposed, and the resulting gain recognised. Following 
management’s report of the results, the Committee is satisfied that 
the appropriate disclosure has been made.
Recovery of trade receivables
Given the nature of the Group’s customers, who are typically 
health and social care authorities, debts are often overdue beyond 
the contractual payment date and the Group has a significant 
level of aged debt. The Committee therefore considered the 
appropriateness of the Group’s policy for provision for debts and 
the level of risk that exists around the recoverability of overdue 
debts. The audit plan (agreed with the external auditors) placed 
emphasis on a detailed review of aged receivables, and included an 
assessment of recoverability from a sample of receivables. Following 
this review, the Committee was satisfied that adequate provisions 
were being made for any potentially irrecoverable debtor balances.
Completeness of liabilities
A number of providers in the industry are undergoing a National 
Living Wage (NLW) assessment by HMRC. Cambian could be 
exposed to liabilities depending on the conclusions of these 
investigations. A provision for “sleep-ins” has been calculated by 
management and presented to the Committee. The Committee has 
considered the appropriateness of the assumptions and judgement 
made by management and is satisfied that the amount provided for 
is reasonable.
Review of the 2016 Annual Report
At the request of the Board, the Committee was asked to consider 
whether the 2016 Annual Report was fair, balanced and capable of 
being understood by shareholders. In order to arrive at a position 
where the Committee was satisfied with the overall fairness, 
balance and clarity of the Annual Report, a comprehensive review 
process was followed.
During the course of the Committee’s review, the following 
questions were considered for debate:
• Fairness and balance: Is the Annual Report open and honest? 
Does it report on weaknesses, difficulties and challenges as well 
as successes? Is there consistency between different sections 
of the Annual Report, including between the narrative and the 
financial statements? Does the Annual Report explain our key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and their linkage to strategy?
• Understandable: Does the Annual Report contain simple 
explanations of business models, strategies and accounting 
policies, using precise and clear language? Is the Annual Report 
easy to read; for example, is the narrative broken up by quotes, 
tables, case studies and other graphics? Does the Annual Report 
have a consistent tone across all sections and provide clear 
signposting to where additional information can be found?
After careful review, the Committee was satisfied that, taken as a 
whole, the Annual Report was fair, balanced and capable of being 
understood by shareholders, and advised the Board accordingly.
Internal audit
The internal audit function plays an important role in assessing 
the effectiveness of internal controls by a programme of reviews 
based on a continuous assessment of the strategic risk register. 
It is important that the internal audit function is appropriately 
resourced with the skills and experience relevant to the operations 
of the Group, and is supported by specialist resources where 
required. Given the importance of the internal audit function and 
the resources required, the Board determined to retain PwC as 
internal auditor responsible for reviewing, reporting and monitoring 
improvements in internal control performance across its operations. 
PwC has worked with the Company to review the principal strategic 
risks facing the Group, following which it agreed a programme of 
work with the Committee that was designed to provide assurance 
in the key areas of risk to the business, as well as in the areas of 
core financial and internal control, and where there are regulatory 
or legal requirements. Regular meetings with PwC throughout 
2016 have provided the Committee with advice on the priorities of 
financial control and other risk management improvement projects. 
As a result, certain identified and approved internal audit reviews 
have been deferred to 2017 . 
The system of internal controls and audit is designed to ensure legal 
and regulatory compliance and manage, rather than eliminate, the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can therefore only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Internal control & risk management
The Company has in place internal controls in relation to the 
Company’s financial reporting process and the Group’s process 
for preparation of consolidated accounts. These systems include 
policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail: accurately and fairly reflect transactions 
and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’); require representatives of the businesses 
to certify that their reported information gives a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the business and its results for the period, and 
review and reconcile reported data. The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring these internal control and risk management systems.
The Company’s internal controls are based on the assessment 
of risk and a framework of control procedures to manage risks 
and to monitor compliance with procedures. The procedures 
for accountability and control are split between operational 
and financial matters. Financial controls are reviewed and their 
effectiveness assessed by the Committee and tested by work 
undertaken by the internal auditors. In particular, given the cost 
control issues that impacted the Company’s performance in the 
year, the internal auditors were commissioned at the end of the 
year to undertake a detailed review of key balance sheet controls.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 45
Governance The Group’s activities expose it to significant operational risks, 
principally medical, and health & safety risks. As described on 
pages 24 to 27 , the Group has in place risk management systems 
and protocols in relation to the operational risks facing the Group. 
Cambian’s governance protocols are aimed at ensuring consistently 
high quality care to mitigate these risks. 
In addition, the Group operates a Quality Management System that 
has gained BS EN ISO 9001: 2008 certification, including aspects 
specific to education, social care for people with autism and 
complex needs, healthcare, residential and day services. Through 
these frameworks, the Group monitors its quality performance 
on a continuing basis and aims to implement improvements and 
changes when determined to be appropriate.
In the highly regulated environment in which the Company 
operates, procedures are codified in detailed operating procedures 
and policies and these are reinforced by training programmes. 
These are designed to ensure compliance not only with the 
regulatory requirements but also with general principles of integrity 
and the Group’s philosophy that everyone can achieve their 
personal best.
During the year, the Committee has identified and evaluated the 
key risks and has ensured that controls and procedures are in place 
to manage these risks and to improve these processes where 
weaknesses are identified.
External audit
The Committee manages the relationship with the external auditor 
(currently, Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”)) on behalf of the Board. This 
includes assessing the independence of the external auditor, 
conducting annual evaluations of the external auditor and providing 
final recommendations to the Board on their reappointment, 
remuneration and the level of non-audit fees paid to the auditors.
Auditor’s independence
The Board undertakes a formal assessment of the auditor’s 
independence each year, which includes:
• A review of non-audit related services provided to the Company 
and related fees;
• Discussion with the auditor of a written report detailing all 
relationships with the Company and any other parties which 
could affect independence or the perception of independence;
• A review of the auditor’s own procedures for ensuring 
independence of the audit firm and partners and staff involved 
in the audit, including the rotation of the audit partner;
• Obtaining written confirmation from the auditors that they are 
independent; and
• A review of fees paid to the auditors in respect of audit and non-
audit services.
Non-audit work undertaken
The Company has a formal policy on the use of external auditors for 
non-audit work. This policy is reviewed annually by the Committee. 
The provision of non-audit services by the external auditors is 
subject to pre-approval. Other accounting firms were used for 
larger, non-audit services, including taxation and consultancy 
advice. Details of services provided by the auditor and its associates 
are included in note 7 on page 87 . The focus of the policy is to ensure 
that the independence of the external auditor is not compromised 
and, where possible and appropriate, other accounting firms are 
used. During 2016, the external auditor conducted engagements 
for the provision of non-audit services, principally relating to vendor 
due diligence and reporting accountant work in relation to the 
disposal of the Adult Services business in December 2016, totalling 
£2,985,000 (including VAT), approximately 87% of the total audit 
and non-audit fee. Owing to the exceptional circumstances that 
applied for the period under review, total non-audit fees paid to the 
Group’s auditor were more than the audit fee. The major proportion 
of these fees were incurred in connection with the significant 
amount of work required in relation to the sale of the Adult 
Services business, including vendor due diligence and reporting 
responsibilities relating to the Class 1 Circular sent to shareholders. 
Deloitte was selected to undertake these tasks due to its familiarity 
with the Cambian business and the industry. In order to maintain 
independence and objectivity, Deloitte undertook its standard 
independence procedures in relation to those engagements.
Auditor’s effectiveness
Deloitte was re-appointed as the auditor at the Annual General 
Meeting in June 2016. The firm was appointed auditor when the 
Company was incorporated as it had acted as auditor to all of 
the companies that were brought together to form the Group 
immediately prior to the initial public offer in April 2014 and so had 
extensive knowledge of the business. Continuity and consistency 
of audit quality are important and the Committee has no current 
intention to initiate an audit re-tendering process. Going forward, 
the Committee will consider a formal tender process in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code. The Committee will comply with the 
Competition & Markets Authority order relating to the statutory audit 
market for FTSE 350 companies, as applicable.
The Committee has adopted a formal framework for the review  
and assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process 
and audit quality, which includes the following aspects:
• Assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and 
members of the audit team;
• Audit approach and scope, including clarification of audit  
risk areas;
• Execution of the audit;
• Interaction with management;
• Communication with and support to the Committee;
• Insights, management letter points and reporting; and
• Independence, objectivity and scepticism.
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the management 
of the external audit process by considering timely identification 
and resolution of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and 
timeliness of papers reporting to the Committee on these matters 
and the quality of any other documents provided to the Committee 
during the external audit process. 
Audit & Risk Committee report

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 46 Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our remuneration report for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2016.
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”), the shareholders 
voted by a majority of 90% of the votes cast to approve the directors’ 
remuneration policy as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report contained in the Cambian 2015 Annual Report and Accounts. 
That policy was put forward to create a structure more appropriate 
for both our executives in supporting our business strategy and to 
genuinely reflect the experience of our shareholders, following the 
transitional arrangements put in place as Cambian evolved into a 
listed entity following its IPO in 2014.
As there are no proposed changes to the directors’ remuneration 
policy, there is no requirement for a shareholder vote on this  
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2017 AGM.  
All arrangements operated by the Company during the year  
were in line with the policy.
Business context 
As highlighted in the Strategic Report, during 2016 the Board carried 
out a strategic review of its businesses and concluded that focusing 
on the Children’s Services business represents the best way to 
create value for shareholders. As such, Cambian completed the 
sale of the Adult Services business to Cygnet Health Care Limited 
in December 2016 to enable Cambian to focus all its resources 
on becoming a high quality provider of specialist education and 
behavioural health services for children, whilst at the same time 
repaying all of the Cambian Group’s existing bank debt.
Given that the retained Cambian Group is significantly smaller than 
the Cambian Group prior to the sale of the Adult Services business, 
the Remuneration Committee has considered the appropriateness of 
the current remuneration packages for the executive directors going 
forward, and further details of this review are set out in this report.
The Board has delegated formation of its policy 
for the remuneration of the directors and senior 
management to the Remuneration Committee  
(the “Committee”), which also has oversight over 
the Group’s share plans.
Summary of responsibilities
Responsibility for setting the remuneration framework or policy for all  
executive directors 
Review the on-going appropriateness and relevance of the Company’s 
remuneration policy
Within the terms of the approved policy, determine the total individual  
remuneration package of each executive director and the senior executives 
Review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board  
and shareholders
Ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments made,  
are fair and that failure is not rewarded
Reporting to shareholders on the implementation of the Company’s remuneration 
policy in accordance with relevant statutory and corporate governance requirements

Chris Brinsmead, CBE
Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 47
Governance
Directors’ remuneration report Key activities and decisions made during the year
1. Review of remuneration package following sale  
of Adult Services business
To reflect the reduced size of the retained Cambian Group, the 
Committee has decided to reduce the base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) from £450,000 to £375,000. Annual  
bonus and LTIP opportunities will remain in line with the current 
approved policy.
2. Review of remuneration package for Anne Marie Carrie  
on appointment to the Board
As noted in the Circular relating to the disposal of the Adult Services 
business, Anne Marie Carrie became the Chief Operating Officer 
(“COO”) and an executive director of the retained Cambian Group. 
Following the completion of the sale of the Adult Services business, 
Anne Marie’s base salary will be £225,000, with an annual bonus 
opportunity of 100% of salary, LTIP opportunity of 100% of salary, 15% 
pension contribution and benefits in line with the current policy.
3. Review of annual bonus outcomes
In respect of the 2016 financial year, the financial target that 
underpins the performance targets for the payment of bonus, which 
was the achievement of EBITDA of not less than £50m, was not met. 
As such, no bonus was payable to the executive directors in respect 
of 2016.
4. Long Term Incentive Awards
As a consequence of the preparation for and subsequent sale  
of the Adult Services business, the Company was unable to make 
LTIP awards during 2016 prior to the sale due to share dealing 
restrictions. Therefore, as set out in the Circular published on 
9 December 2016, a 2016 LTIP award has been made to the CEO  
and COO of 100% of the revised base salaries, and was granted in 
early 2017 following completion of the transaction. The Remuneration 
Committee considered the performance conditions set out in last 
year’s report and took the view that in light of the new strategic 
plan and revised shape of the business, it was more appropriate 
to use an absolute shareholder return metric. Full vesting will occur 
if a share price target of 225p is met over the three year period to 
8 December 2019, with nil vesting below this target. The share price 
used to calculate the awards was based on the average of the share 
price for the five trading days following the publication of the Circular. 
No other awards were made in relation to the financial year ended 
31 December 2016.
The Remuneration Committee intends to make the 2017 LTIP award 
following the announcement of the Company’s results for the 
2016 financial year in line with the normal remuneration cycle. It is 
proposed a similar metric will be considered for future awards in line 
with the new strategic plan and its approved remuneration policy.
5. Recruitment of new CFO
As previously noted, Andrew Griffith left the Company on 27 April 
2016. Details of the termination payments for Andrew Griffith are in 
line with the approved policy and are disclosed in the annual report 
on remuneration.
We are delighted to have appointed Anoop Kang to the Board 
as Chief Financial Officer with effect from 12 July 2017 . Anoop’s 
service contract, remuneration and benefits are consistent with the 
director’s remuneration policy as approved by shareholders at the 
2016 AGM and are disclosed in the ‘At a glance’ section of this report.
Conclusion
The report that follows consists of two sections:
• an ‘At a glance’ summary on pages 49 to 53, which includes  
a summary of the approved remuneration policy; and
• an annual report on remuneration, detailing how our directors 
were paid during 2016 and how the remuneration policy will be 
applied in 2017, on pages 54 to 59. 
As a Committee, we work hard to ensure that the executive 
remuneration structure supports the Company’s strategy and aligns 
with the long-term interests of shareholders. We take an active 
interest in your views and hope to receive your support again at the 
AGM, where I will be available to respond to any questions which 
shareholders may have on this report or in relation to any of the 
Committee’s activities.
This is my last statement as Chair of the Committee as I will be 
stepping down as non-executive director following the 2017 
AGM. I would therefore like to thank my colleagues on the Board

Directors’ remuneration report
continued At a glance
Introduction
In this section, we summarise the purpose of our remuneration policy, its linkage to our corporate strategic objectives and we highlight the 
performance and remuneration outcomes for the 2016 financial year. More detail can be found in the annual report on remuneration.
Our principles of remuneration
The Company’s remuneration strategy is to provide remuneration packages that:
• attract, motivate and retain high performing employees;
• encourage and support a strong care and service culture;
• reward the achievement of the overall business objectives of the Company;
• align employees’ interests with those of shareholders; and
• are consistent with the Company’s risk policies and systems.
Consistent with this remuneration strategy, the Committee has agreed a remuneration package for the management team, whereby:
• performance-related pay will form a significant part of remuneration packages;
• there will be an appropriate balance between short and longer-term performance targets linked to delivery of the Group’s 
objectives; and
• in the event of a serious failure in the quality of care provided by the Group, or a failure to achieve threshold financial performance,  
this would act as an override to prevent payment of any bonus that might otherwise be payable in respect of that year.
Summary of remuneration policy
Our policy was approved at the 2016 AGM. The full policy can be found on our website in the 2015 Annual Report. We have provided an 
abridged version of the policy table below: 
Element Policy summary description Maximum opportunity
Executive directors
Base salary Provides a base level of remuneration to support 
recruitment and retention of executive directors with  
the necessary experience and expertise to deliver the 
Group’s strategy.
In general, salary rises for executive directors will be in line 
with the rise to all other employees. Individuals who are 
recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have 
their salaries set below the targeted policy level until they 
become established in role. In such cases subsequent 
increases in salary may be higher than the average until 
the target positioning is increased.
Benefits The executive directors receive family private health  
cover, death in service life assurance, permanent health 
insurance and subsistence expenses. In addition,  
the executive directors may take part in a car  
leasing programme.
The cost of the benefits provided.
Pension May be provided in form of salary supplement. 15% salary p.a.
Annual Bonus Plan The Annual Bonus Plan is based on a mix of financial and 
care quality conditions and is measured over a period of 
one financial year. The financial measures will account for 
no less than 50% of the bonus opportunity. Payment under 
the Annual Bonus Plan is conditional upon achievement of 
the threshold performance of the financial target and there 
being no regulated enforced closure of any of the Group’s 
facilities. Malus and clawback provisions apply.
150% of salary for the CEO.
100% of salary for other executive directors.
Up to 60% of the maximum bonus will be payable  
for on-target performance.
Annual Option Plan (“AOP”) The AOP operates in conjunction with the Annual Bonus 
Plan. The Committee can determine that part of the bonus 
earned under the Annual Bonus Plan is provided in the 
form of an award of nil cost options under the AOP.
Deferred options are exercisable on the third anniversary 
of the date on which the bonus vests.
The annual bonus will be paid in cash and, at the 
discretion of the Committee, deferred in part into share 
options.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 49
Governance Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
Awards are granted annually to executive directors in the 
form of conditional share awards or nil cost options. These 
will vest at the end of a three year period, subject to 
continued employment and the satisfaction of 
performance conditions.
The performance conditions for the 2016 LTIP awards was 
absolute total shareholder return. The Committee retains 
the discretion to subject the LTIP awards to a holding 
period of up to two years post vesting and malus and 
clawback provisions apply.
100% of salary.
Cambian 2016 Sharesave 
Plan
The Company has a Sharesave Plan in which the executive 
directors are eligible to participate (which is HMRC approved 
and is open to all eligible staff). However, awards under this 
plan have yet to be made to any employee.
UK scheme in line with HMRC limits as amended from time 
to time.
Minimum shareholding 
requirement
Executives have five years to accumulate the required 
shareholding. 200% of base salary for the CEO. 150%  
of base salary for other executive directors.
Non-executive directors
Fees Non-executive directors are paid a base fee and additional 
fees for chairmanship of committees. The Chairman does not 
receive any additional fees for membership of committees. 
Fees are set at broadly the median of the comparator group. 
Non-executive directors do not participate in any variable 
remuneration or benefits arrangements.
In general, the level of fee increase for the non-executive 
directors will be set taking account of any change in 
responsibility and will take into account the general rise in 
salaries across the UK workforce.

Sign-on compensation The Committee’s policy is not to provide sign-on 
compensation.
However, in exceptional circumstances where  
the Committee decides to provide this type of 
compensation it will endeavour to provide the 
compensation in equity, subject to a holding period 
during which cessation of employment will generally 
result in forfeiture and subject to the satisfaction of 
performance targets. The maximum value of this 
one-off compensation will be proportionate to the 
overall remuneration offered by the Company and  
in all circumstances is limited to 150% of salary.
No sign-on compensation was 
provided.
Maximum – 150% of salary to be 
awarded in shares subject to

additional LTIP award to be made 
in 2017.
“Buy out” of incentives 
forfeited on cessation 
of employment 
The Committee’s policy is not to provide buy outs  
as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee determine that  
the provision of a buy out is justified, the equivalent 
value of any incentives that will be forfeited on 
cessation of a director’s previous employment will 
be calculated taking into account the following:
•  the proportion of the performance period 
completed;
•  the performance conditions attached to the 
vesting of these incentives and the likelihood  
of them being satisfied; and
•  any other terms and conditions having a material 
effect on their value (“lapsed value”).
No buy-out arrangements  
were made.
No buy-out arrangements intended 
to be made.

The Committee considers that performance conditions for all incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business strategy, 
shareholder expectations, the markets in which the Group operates and external advice. To the extent that any performance condition is 
not met, the relevant part of the award will lapse. There is no retesting of performance.
Bonus awards
In respect of the 2016 financial year, the financial target that underpins the performance targets for the payment of bonus, which was 
the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA of not less than £50m, was not met. Therefore no bonus was payable to the executive directors in 
respect of 2016, even though the quality and occupancy targets were met in part/full. Full details of achievement against the performance

Long-term incentives awarded in 2016 (audited)
As a consequence of the transaction involving the sale of the Adult Services business, the Company was unable to make LTIP awards 
during 2016 prior to the sale due to share dealing restrictions. Therefore, as set out in the Circular, a 2016 LTIP award has been made 
to the CEO and COO of 100% of the revised base salaries, and was granted in early 2017 following completion of the transaction. The 
Remuneration Committee has taken the view that this set of awards will be in line with the new strategic plan and therefore subject to 
an absolute shareholder return metric, with a share price target of 225p, over the three year period to 8 December 2019 following the 
publication of the Circular. The share price used to calculate the awards was based on the five day average share price following the 
publication of the Circular. Full vesting will occur if the share price target of 225p is met, with nil vesting below this target.

Outstanding share awards
In 2015, Saleem Asaria was awarded nil-cost options over 2,222,223 ordinary shares under the Cambian IPO Continuation Option Plan 
No1 (“COP1”), having a value of £5,000k at the time of the award. The options shall become exercisable as to one third on each of the third, 
fourth and fifth anniversaries of admission.
Payments to past directors/payments for loss of office
There have been no payments made to past directors in the year.
Andrew Griffith left the Company on 27 April 2016. In 2014, under the Cambian IPO Continuation Option Plan No1 (“COP1”), Andrew Griffith 
was awarded nil-cost options over 133,333 ordinary shares under COP1 having a value of £300,000, with the options exercisable as to 
one third each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of admission. The Committee determined that Andrew Griffith was to be treated 
as a good leaver and determined that the options granted to Andrew under the COP1 would vest in full and be exercised. The value of the 
options on exercise was £100,666.

Governance Statement of directors’ shareholdings (audited)
Shareholding requirements in operation at the Company are currently 200% of base salary for the CEO and 150% of base salary for other 
executive directors. Executive directors are required to build up their shareholdings over a reasonable amount of time, which would 
normally be five years. The number of shares of the Company in which current directors had a beneficial interest and details of long-term

The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s shares since listing compared to the FTSE All Share index. The graph 
shows the total shareholder return generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of dividend 
income. The Committee considers that the FTSE All Share index is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this 
since listing. This graph has been calculated in accordance with Regulations. It should be noted that the Company listed in April 2014 and 
therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 11 April 2014 to 31 December 2016.

Change in CEO’s remuneration compared with employees
The following table sets out the change in the remuneration paid to the Chief Executive from 2015 to 2016 compared with the average 
percentage change for employees.
The CEO’s remuneration disclosed in the table below has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits, excluding  
his allowance in lieu of pension, and annual bonus (including any amount deferred). The employee pay (on which the average percentage 
change is based) is calculated using the increase in the earnings of all employees (including part-time and casual staff) using P60 and P11D 
data from tax years 2015 and 2016. Part time employees have been excluded from the analysis. The employee analysis is done on a matched 
basis, that is the same individuals appear in the 2015 and 2016 populations.

Governance Non-executives
No changes have been made to the fees due to the non-executive directors. A breakdown of fee payable to the non-executives in 2016 is 
as follows:
Chairman’s fee £125,000
Base fee £40,000
Chair of Committee fee £7,000
Senior Independent Director £3,000
Benefits and pension
No changes are proposed to benefits or pension. 
Executive directors are now eligible to participate in the Company’s defined contribution plan or receive a salary supplement equivalent  
to 15% of base salary.
Annual Bonus Plan
It is intended that the executive directors will be able to earn an annual bonus, dependent on achievement of a threshold performance 
of 95% of budgeted Adjusted EBITDA and none of the Company’s facilities being closed due to regulatory action. It is considered that the 
disclosure of the targets is commercially sensitive. The Company will disclose performance against target in full in next year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration. The metrics chosen, weighting of the bonus target and proposed payout based on threshold, target and maximum 
performance are set out below (malus and clawback provisions apply):
Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum
Adjusted EBITDA 50% 95% of target (10% of 
opportunity)
100% of target (30% of 
opportunity)
110% of target (50% of 
opportunity)
Percentage of facilities rated  
‘Good’ or better
25% 78% of scores Good or 
better (5% of opportunity)
80% of scores Good or 
better (15% of opportunity)
85% of scores Good or 
better (25% of 
opportunity)
Individual objectives 25% Assessment will be made on individual, operational, financial and non financial 
metrics at the end of the year. Detailed disclosure of individual performance 
targets cannot be disclosed due to commercial sensitivity. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
It is intended that an award of nil-cost options will be made under the LTIP to the executive directors representing a maximum of 100% of 
base salary. Any awards will vest in 2020, if performance conditions measured over a three year period have been met. The performance 
targets for the 2017 award continue to be absolute total shareholder return.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply.
Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors’ remuneration
Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for determining 
specific packages for the executive directors, the Chairman and other members of the executive management team. The Company 
consults with key shareholders in respect of remuneration policy and the introduction of new incentive arrangements. The terms of 
reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website and from the Company Secretary at the registered office.
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors. The Committee received assistance from the Company Secretary, 
who attended meetings by invitation, except when issues relating to their own remuneration were being discussed. Alfred Foglio, the 
representative of GI Partners, the Company’s largest shareholder, and the CEO also attended by invitation on occasions. The Committee 
met six times during the financial year. Meeting attendance is shown on page 40 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee has engaged the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as independent remuneration adviser and they attended 
meetings of the Committee by invitation.
During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of remuneration policy for executive directors and members of the 
executive management committee. PwC also provided advice to the Company in relation to the drafting and implementation of executive 
and employee incentives. Fees paid during the year for these services were £49,700.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective and independent advice is given to remuneration committees.

Directors’ report
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 60 Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s articles of association permit it to indemnify 
directors of the Company (or of any associated company) in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The Company may  
fund expenditure incurred by directors in defending proceedings 
against them.
The Company may indemnify any director of the Company or of 
any associated company against liabilities. However, the Company 
may not provide an indemnity against: (i) any liability incurred by 
the director to the Company or to any associated company; or (ii) 
against any liability incurred by the director to pay a criminal or 
regulatory penalty; or (iii) against any liability incurred by the director 
in defending criminal proceedings in which they are convicted; or 
(iv) in defending any civil proceedings brought by the Company 
(or an associated company) in which judgment is given against 
them; or (v) in connection with certain court applications under the 
Companies Act 2006. No indemnity was provided and no payments 
were made pursuant to these provisions during the year.
The Company also maintains directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance which gives appropriate cover for any legal action 
brought against its directors.
The articles of association of the Company confer the following 
powers upon and contain the following provisions relating to the 
appointment and removal of the directors:
Number of directors
Unless and until otherwise determined by the Company by ordinary 
resolution, the number of directors (other than any alternate 
directors) shall not be less than two and there shall be no maximum 
number of directors.
Powers of directors
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the articles of 
association of the Company and to any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by the 
Board, which may exercise all the powers of the Company.
The directors were empowered by resolutions of the Company 
passed on 6 June 2016 to, inter alia:
• allot equity securities (as defined by the Companies Act 2006) 
for cash (other than in connection with a pre-emptive offer to all 
shareholders) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £184,100. 
A resolution authorising the directors to allot shares will be 
sought from shareholders at the forthcoming AGM; and
• make market purchases of the Company’s shares, up to a 
maximum aggregate number of 27 ,445,613 ordinary shares. It is 
proposed to seek renewal of this authority at the forthcoming AGM.
Appointment of directors
Subject to the articles of association of the Company, and without 
prejudice to the power of the Company to appoint any person to be 
a director, the Board shall have power at any time to appoint any 
person who is willing to act as a director, either to fill a vacancy or  
as an addition to the existing Board, but the total number of directors 
shall not exceed any maximum number fixed in accordance with 
the articles of association. Any director so appointed shall hold office 
only until the next AGM of the Company following such appointment 
and shall then be eligible for re-election.
Retirement of directors
At each AGM, any director who was a director at each of the two 
preceding AGMs, and who was not appointed or re-appointed by 
the Company in general meeting at or since either such meeting,  
is required to retire and stand for re-election as a director. 
However, the Company follows the UK Corporate Governance 
Code’s recommendation that all directors of FTSE 350 companies 
are subject to annual re-appointment by shareholders.
Removal of directors
In addition to any powers of removal conferred by the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company may by ordinary resolution (of which special 
notice has been given) remove any director before the expiration 
of his or her period of office and may (subject to the articles of 
association of the Company) by ordinary resolution, appoint  
another person who is willing to act in his or her place.

Governance Capital structure
As at 31 December 2016, the Company had 184,198,746 issued 
ordinary shares of 1 pence each. The Company has and as at 31 
December 2016 had one class of ordinary shares and each share 
carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company 
and to participate in any dividends declared in accordance with the 
articles of association. No person has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital.
The authority under the Companies Act 2006 granted on 6 June 
2016 at the Company’s 2016 AGM for the directors to issue new 
shares for cash remains valid until the forthcoming AGM when  
it is intended that a resolution will be put forward to shareholders  
to renew the authority to issue shares for cash. 
Cambian Group Employee Benefit Trust (the “EBT”)
The EBT, a discretionary trust for the benefit of executive directors 
and employees, was established on 14 April 2014. The trustee, 
Lutea Trustees Limited (incorporated in Jersey), is not a subsidiary 
of the Company. The EBT operates in conjunction with the Cambian 
Group 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Cambian Group Annual 
Share Option Plan, the Cambian Group IPO Continuation Plan No.1 
and the Cambian Group IPO Continuation Plan No.2 (together, the 
“Employee Plans”). The number of shares held by the EBT at any 
time, when added to the number of shares held by any other trust 
established by the Company for the benefit of employees, will not 
exceed 5% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The EBT is funded by loans from the Company which are then used 
to acquire, either via market purchase or subscription, ordinary 
shares to satisfy conditional share awards granted under the 
Employee Plans. For the purpose of the financial statements, the EBT 
is consolidated into the Company and Group. As a consequence, 
the loans are eliminated and the cost of the shares acquired is 
deducted from equity as set out in note 26 on page 97 of the 
financial statements.
In relation to its operation in conjunction with the Employee Plan, 
the EBT does not transfer the beneficial interest in the shares to the 
executive directors and employees until such share awards are 
vested. On establishment of the EBT, the Company contributed an 
initial trust fund of £1,000 and provided a sum of £34,662 to the EBT 
by way of gift for the purpose of subscribing at par for 3,466,222 
ordinary shares of one penny each. As at 31 December 2016, the EBT 
held the non-beneficial interest in 3,234,222 shares in the Company.
While any shares are held by the EBT it will refrain from exercising 
any voting rights unless the Company otherwise directs and is not 
obliged to exercise such voting rights in a manner requested by 
the employee beneficiaries. The EBT has agreed to waive dividends 
in respect of any shares held in the EBT unless and to the extent 
otherwise directed by the Company.
Rights attaching to shares under the articles of association
The Company’s articles of association do not contain any specific 
restrictions on the size of a shareholder’s holding.
Voting rights
Subject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached to 
any shares by or in accordance with the articles of association, on a 
show of hands every member who is present in person or by proxy 
and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member who 
is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote for 
every share of which he, she or it is the holder.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be 
entitled to be present at or vote at a general meeting or at any 
separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares, either in 
person or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him, her or it  
or to exercise any right as a member unless all calls or other sums 
presently payable by him, her or it in respect of that share have 
been paid to the Company. In addition, any member (or other 
person appearing to be interested in the shares (a “third party”)), 
who (having been served with a notice under section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006 by the Company requiring such member 
to disclose to the Board in writing within such reasonable period 
as may be specified in such notice, details of any past or present 
beneficial interest of such member or any such third party in 
the shares or any other interest of any kind whatsoever which a 
member or third party may have in the shares and the identity of 
the person having or having had any such interest) fails to do so, 
may be disenfranchised by service of a notice by the Board.
Transfer
Any member may transfer all or any of his uncertificated shares 
by means of a relevant system in such manner provided for, and 
subject as provided, in the CREST Regulations and the rules of any 
relevant system. Subject to the articles of association, any member 
may transfer all or any of his, her or its certificated shares by an 
instrument of transfer in any usual or common form or in any other 
form which the Board may approve.
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Board  
may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of  
any share which is not a fully paid share provided that where such 
a share is a member of a class of share admitted to the Official List, 
such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent 
dealings in shares of that class from taking place on an open and 
proper basis.
The Board may only decline to register a transfer of an uncertificated 
share in the circumstances set out in the CREST Regulations, and 
where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of 
joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is to be transferred 
exceeds four.

the progress of the business and operational highlights. The Group 
also carried out an engagement survey to ask staff what matters to 
them, which was followed up with a further engagement workshop.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements including the Directors’ remuneration report 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements 
under Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework. Under company law, the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing 
these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 65
Governance The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in  
the Board of Directors’ section on pages 36 and 37 , confirm that,  
to the best of their knowledge:
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
• the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and its subsidiary undertakings, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Each director at the date of this report also confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information or to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation is given 
and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
section 418 Companies Act 2006.
Approved by the Board and signed on behalf of the Board.

Summary of our audit approach
Key risks
The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• Revenue recognition
• Presentation of exceptional items
• Risk of impairment of goodwill 
• Risk of impairment of property, plant and equipment
• Recoverability of trade receivables 
• Accounting for the disposal of the Adult business
• Provision for National Minimum Wage payments for sleep-ins
Our assessment of the risks on which we report has changed in light of the developments in the Group during 2016. In the prior year, we 
reported on risks relating to going concern (including covenant compliance) and the completeness of liabilities. Following the repayment 
of the Group’s borrowings in the year, and the progress in the Group’s internal controls, we no longer consider these to be key risks. The 
additional risks we report on in the current year relate to the disposal of the Adult business and the implications of the National Living 
Wage regulations in relation to ‘sleep-ins’.
Materiality
The materiality that we used in the current year was £0.6 million which was determined on the basis of pre-tax profit from continuing and 
discontinued operations, adjusted for exceptional items.
Scoping
Our Group audit scope covers 100% of the Group’s subsidiaries, all of which conduct activities in the UK.

Financial statements Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of Cambian Group plc continued
Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting 
contained within note 2 to the financial statements and the directors’ statement 
on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report  
on page 27.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on pages 24 to 29 that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 28 to 29 that describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation on page 27 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention  
to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted,  
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the Group  
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with  
those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We 
also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services 
referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on 
pages 44 to 46. 
Revenue recognition
Risk description The Group recognises revenue over the period in which its behavioural health services in specialist high severity care sub-sectors 
are provided to adults and children in the UK and measures revenue at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in 
respect of services rendered. Accounting policies relating to revenue are set out in note 2.
Due to the manual nature of the occupancy and billing processes and systems and the significant number of sites within the Group, 
we identified a key risk around the completeness of revenue.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
risk
We developed an expectation of recorded revenue based on key metrics, including average bed days and changes in fee, on a site 
by site basis and compared this to the actual revenue recognised. Where a reasonable expectation could not be formed, e.g. due to 
new sites or changes in service conditions, we traced a sample of transactions to invoice. 
For a sample of sites, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of occupants being billed by tracing occupants from the 
individual site patient lists through to contract, the billing system, invoice and general ledger.
Key observations We have assessed revenue on a site by site basis to be in line with our expectations, and we consider revenue to be free from 
material misstatement.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 68 Presentation of exceptional items 
Risk description The Group has defined exceptional items within its accounting policies on page 82 as items which individually or, if of a similar type, 
in aggregate, need to be disclosed separately due to their size or incidence in order to obtain clear and consistent presentation of 
the Group’s performance. These are further disclosed in note 6 of the financial statements.
The Group has recorded exceptional items totalling £17.1 million (2015: £24.9 million) in respect of non-recurring items and 
transactions that are outside the normal course of business. Of this, the significant elements are costs associated with the disposal 
of the Adult business of approximately £9.6 million, the write-off of unamortised bank loan interest of £1.8 million, re-financing costs 
of £2.4 million and redundancy costs of £1.1 million. 
The classification of items as exceptional involves judgement and therefore presents a risk that the classification is not appropriate 
and that the definition is not applied consistently each year.
This risk is discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 44.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
risk
We assessed the nature of these items to determine whether they met the definition included under the Group’s accounting policies 
and that the definition had been applied consistently.
We agreed the quantification of the exceptional items to supporting documentation and challenged management on the 
appropriateness of classification of these items as material, non-recurring and exceptional in nature.
We assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements provide sufficient detail for the reader to understand the 
nature of these items. We considered whether appropriate prominence is given in the Annual Report to statutory financial 
information and related commentary compared to the ‘underlying’ financial information, and whether the two have been 
reconciled. We also considered whether the basis of the ‘underlying’ financial information is clearly and accurately described and 
not misleading in the form in which it appears in the Annual Report.
Key observations We have concluded that management’s assessment of the classification of exceptional items has been applied consistently and 
that the disclosures are sufficient for the reader to understand the nature of these items. 
Risk of impairment of goodwill 
Risk description The Group has recognised a goodwill balance of £75.8 million (2015: £114.3 million) as described in note 13 to the financial 
statements. Following the disposal of the Adult business, the goodwill balance at 31 December 2016 relates wholly to the continuing 
Child business. Management have concluded that goodwill is not impaired at 31 December 2016.
Goodwill must be tested annually for impairment and requires a comparison between the carrying value of the cash generating unit 
and its recoverable amount. Determination of the recoverable amount is based upon the higher of fair value less costs of disposal 
and value-in-use. An impairment assessment requires management to make significant estimates and judgements. 
The cash-generating unit is reviewed for impairment using a value in use model which reflects management estimates of future 
cash flows for the next three years, the long-term growth rate thereafter and the application of the appropriate discount rate. 
This risk is discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 44.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
risk
We challenged the assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill which calculates the value-in-use. Our challenge 
focused on assessing the appropriateness of the cash flow projections relative to previous performance and external evidence on 
growth rates and the related sensitivity analysis which we have reperformed using our own defined variables. In the course of this 
work, we consulted with Deloitte valuation specialists on the appropriateness of the discount rate.
We assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial statements, in particular in relation to the sensitivity disclosures.
Key observations We concur with management’s conclusion that goodwill is not impaired at 31 December 2016.
Risk of impairment of property, plant and equipment 
Risk description In light of historical performance, there is a risk that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment (“assets”) is impaired. The 
carrying value of property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2016 is £177.2 million (2015: £364.0 million).
There is significant judgement involved in identifying the recoverable amount of the carrying value of the assets which is based on 
management estimates of future cash flows and the application of appropriate discount rates or third party surveyor property valuations.
At 31 December 2016, the Group did not identify any assets that were impaired (2015: £21.7 million impaired assets). The impairment 
was recognised within exceptional items in 2015. This is shown in note 6.
This risk is discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 44.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
risk
We obtained management’s fixed asset impairment model and challenged the assessment of the assets for impairment, and in 
particular, the underlying rationale and assumptions used, which were consistent with the Board’s approved cash flow forecasts 
and were used in the Group’s assessment of going concern and goodwill impairment. 
We assessed the integrity of management’s calculations.
Key observations We concur with management’s conclusion that there are no fixed assets requiring impairment at 31 December 2016. 
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 69
Financial statements Independent auditors report to the members 
of Cambian Group plc continued
Recoverability of trade receivables
Risk description Given the nature of the Group’s customer base, largely Local Authorities and National Health Service bodies, the risk of non-
payment of receivables due to inability to pay is considered low. However, due to complexities in customers’ accounting processes 
and the time required to negotiate and agree fee rates, receivables are often overdue beyond contractual payment dates. The 
Group had significant levels of trade receivables as at 31 December 2016 of £39.5 million (2015: £46.4 million). 
A risk therefore arises relating to the judgement involved in determining whether aged receivables are recoverable and therefore  
if they are sufficiently provided for at 31 December 2016. 
This risk is discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 45.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
risk
We reviewed management’s provision methodology, reviewed the aged receivables listing as at 31 December 2016 and challenged 
management on all debts greater than 120 days old as to whether they had been appropriately provided for.
We tested the integrity of the aged receivables listing by recalculating the ageing of a sample of debtors as at 31 December 2016.
We selected a sample of outstanding debtors at the year-end and assessed recoverability by agreeing to payment received from 
debtors post 31 December 2016. For those where payment was not received, we challenged whether the debt should be provided 
for as at 31 December 2016.
We have challenged management’s level of credit note provision as at 31 December 2016 based on historical trends of credit notes 
issued in the year and to the end of March 2017 and tested a sample of credit notes raised. 
Key observations We have concluded management’s assessment of the recoverability of trade receivables and the calculation of related provisions  
to be appropriate.
Accounting for the disposal of the Adult Services business 
Risk description The disposal of the Adult business was completed on 28 December 2016. The Adult Services business represents a separate major 
line of business disposed of during the year, and therefore is required to be disclosed as a discontinued operation with the related 
accounting and disclosure being material to this report. This is disclosed in note 11. 
There is complexity involved in the calculation of the gain or loss on disposal of the discontinued operation. Central costs are 
incurred on a Cambian Group level and there exists a risk that these costs are not appropriately allocated between the continuing 
and discontinued operations.
The Group recorded a profit for the year from discontinued operations of £155.0 million, which included a gain on disposal of the 
Adult business of £144.3 million, in the consolidated profit and loss statement. 
This risk is discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 45.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
risk
We obtained the agreements and contracts relating to the disposal of the Adult business. The pertinent terms of these agreements 
were determined and the calculations of the consideration paid were re-performed based on our understanding of the agreements. 
We assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial statements. We have assessed the allocation of the central 
costs of the business between the continuing and discontinued operations, challenging assumptions made to assess their 
appropriateness in the context of our knowledge of the business. 
We have substantively tested the calculation supporting the profit earned by the Group from the Adult Services business due  
to the disposal occurring during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Key observations We have concluded that management’s treatment of the disposal, and the disclosures surrounding discontinued operations in the 
financial statements are appropriate.
Provision for National Living Wage payments for ‘sleep-ins’
Risk description The Group, in common with a number of mental health care providers in the industry, is undergoing a National Living Wage audit  
by HMRC. The HMRC audit has focused on the application of National Minimum Wage regulations to employees on ‘sleep-in’ shifts. 
Management has recognised a provision at 31 December 2016. Given the early stage of the investigation, the complexity of applying 
the regulations to this activity and that management have disclosed in note 3 that there is a range of potential financial outcomes of 
the current investigation, we have identified this as a key risk in the current year.
This risk is discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 45.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
risk
We reviewed the Group’s records of policies and procedures with regard to compliance with the National Living Wage regulations 
and in particular, the process for employees working on sleep-in shifts.
We consulted our in-house employment tax specialists to challenge management’s assumptions on the application of the regulations 
and the potential implications of non-compliance and the likelihood of this having an impact on the Group’s annual financial statements.
We assessed the adequacy of any provisions made by management by testing the mathematical accuracy of the provision 
calculation and testing the underlying data on which the provision is based on a sample basis. 
We performed a sensitivity analysis on the provision by flexing management’s key assumptions to ascertain the range of possible 
outcomes if the assumptions used are not accurate. 
Key observations We consider management’s approach to be appropriate in the light of the complexity of the assessment and the early stage of the 
investigation and concur with the level of provision recognised.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 70 These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £0.6 million (2015: £0.5 million)
Basis for determining 
materiality
We determined materiality for the Group to be £0.6 million (2015: £0.5 million), which is 5% (2015: 6%) of pre-tax profit for continuing 
and discontinued operations adjusted for exceptional items.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We used pre-tax profit for continuing and discontinued operations as the Group operated both the Adult and Child businesses 
throughout the year. Pre-tax profit represents a key performance measure for the Group and due to the non-recurring nature of the 
exceptional items, we consider it appropriate that these are excluded. This approach is consistent with prior year. 
Following our reassessing the levels at which we would report to the Audit and Risk Committee, we discussed and agreed with the Audit 
and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £32,000 (2015: £20,000), as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope covers 100% of the Group’s subsidiaries, all of which conduct activities in the UK and are considered to be one 
component. All subsidiaries were audited by the Group audit team to component materiality which did not exceed 95% of Group 
materiality. Where subsidiaries are operated by separate finance teams, audit work was carried out by the Group audit team in the 
relevant location. At the parent entity level, we have also tested the consolidation process. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.

directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that 
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 76 Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2016
1. General information
Cambian Group plc (“Company”) is incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 2006. The principal activity of the Company and 
its subsidiaries (“Group”) is the provision of high quality behavioural health services.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
On 28 December 2016 the Group sold its Adult Services business. As a result the Adult Services business has met the definition of a 
discontinued operation under IFRS5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’ and is therefore presented as such 
throughout this report. In order to comply with the presentation, comparative income statement disclosures have been re-presented 
separating continuing and discontinued operations.
The historical cost convention has been applied except in respect of those financial instruments that have been measured at fair value at 
the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market 
participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for 
measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-
based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions within the scope of IAS 17 , and measurements that 
have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the 
inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which 
are described as follows:
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Going concern
As indicated on page 27 of the Annual Report, the directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The directors have considered 
the Group and Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, and are 
satisfied that the Group and Company should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (the 
“subsidiaries”) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when a company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete for a business combination by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the “acquisition date”). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at 
the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are comprised of customer relationships, and contractual obligations entered into by 
the vendor not to provide competing services with the Group for a determined period (“non-compete agreements”).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and charged to 
administrative expenses on the following basis:
Customer relationships 7 to 18 years
Non-compete agreements Shorter of the agreement term or 5 years
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal 
group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to 
qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are 
classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest 
in its former subsidiary after the sale.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of loan issue costs incurred, when the relevant contracts are entered into. Borrowings 
are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of loan issue costs) and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 78 Current tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at year-end in the UK where the 
Company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax 
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by year-end and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets (other than land and assets under construction) less their residual values over 
their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
Land and buildings 2%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20% − 33%
Motor vehicles 20% − 25%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for 
qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same 
basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there  
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite 
useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is 
recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 79
Financial statements 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Restructurings
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to 
those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditure arising from the restructuring, which 
are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises 
its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The 
impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at 
fair value.
All financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents and derivatives, are classified as “loans and receivables”.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future 
cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 60 
days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised 
borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Notes to the financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 80 Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities. In certain 
circumstances the Group is required to undertake the responsibility of Corporate Appointee for individuals under the Group’s care, as they 
lack the capacity to manage their own finances. The responsibility involves safeguarding the individual’s financial assets and ensuring that 
the support they receive from the UK Government is apportioned appropriately. The Group segregates these funds from its own in 
restricted bank accounts and records a corresponding liability.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to interest rate risks.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised immediately within finance costs in the combined statement 
of comprehensive income, unless it is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in 
profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a 
financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
At inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along 
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows 
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the finance costs line item.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity at that time remains and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of services provided in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, estimated rebates and VAT. In all cases revenue is recognised over the period in which the service is provided. 
Additional services provided by the Group are recognised on provision of the service. Sales rebate accruals and provisions are established 
in the same period as the revenue to which they relate.
Revenue invoiced in advance is included in deferred revenue until the service is provided.

Financial statements 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state 
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the 
schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as 
a finance lease obligation.
Finance lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Interest expense is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where 
another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items reflect items of expenditure which, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed separately due to 
their size or incidence in order to obtain clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s performance.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted:
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, IFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative
None of the new or revised standards that have been adopted affected the amounts reported in the financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results and financial position
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the Group had not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 16 Leases
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiative
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
The directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed above, other than IFRS 16, will not have a material impact on the financial 
information of the Group in future reporting periods. Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of 
the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 82 3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the historical financial information. Those involving estimations are dealt with 
separately below.
Exceptional items
The directors have used judgement in determining those items which, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed 
separately due to their size or incidence in order to obtain clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s performance.
Discontinued operations
Judgement is required by the directors to allocate central costs that have been disclosed as part of the discontinued operations in order to 
obtain clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s performance. This is done consistent with the size of the respective operation.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed 
below.
Carrying value of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. The 
value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs, and a suitable discount rate in 
order to calculate present value (see note 13).
Sleep-ins
The Group operates a number of sites where individuals “sleep in” overnight and are paid an allowance for so doing. It is the Group’s view 
that this practice is not in breach of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 or the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (as amended 
and in force). Following the decision in Whittlestone v BJP Home Support Limited [2013] UKEAT, HMRC has made enquiries of Cambian and, 
the Board believes, other care service providers, regarding payments for individuals who are engaged in a “sleep in”. HMRC’s enquiries are 
at a preliminary stage and it is, therefore, not possible to say when HMRC may conclude their enquiries in this area nor what the result of 
those enquiries may be. The directors have used their judgement to make a provision for this. If it is ultimately judicially determined that 
Cambian had to pay each individual engaged in a “sleep in” an amount calculated by reference to the National Living Wage, the additional 
cost could be material. The amount has not been separately disclosed to avoid commercially prejudicing the issue.
Onerous contract
The Company is party to an exclusive supply agreement in respect of pharmaceutical supplies. This contract did not automatically transfer 
with the sale of Adult Services. The supplier has indicated that the sale is in breach of the agreement and is seeking either a novation of the 
agreement or compensation. The directors have used their judgement to make a provision for this. The amount has not been separately 
disclosed to avoid commercially prejudicing the issue.
Carrying value of trade receivables
The year-end provision is based on provision for older receivables to the extent that they have not been collected since the year-end and 
any specific issues identified in the more recent receivables (see note 16).

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 83
Financial statements 4. Business and geographical segments
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues
Following the sale of the Adult Services business, the directors have determined there is one remaining operating segment. 
On 28 December 2016, the Group made a substantial disposal with the sale of the Adult Services business. Prior to this disposal, the Group 
provided behavioural healthcare services to both children and adults. Going forward, the Group is wholly focused on Children’s Services. As 
required by accounting standards, Children’s Services are treated as “continuing operations” and Adult Services are treated as “discontinued 
operations”, however they are presented together in order to provide a fuller understanding of the overall trading performance over the last 
two years.
The Group assesses performance using Adjusted EBITDA as its primary measure. This provides a more appropriate assessment of the 
operations of this business to enable the directors to make informed decisions.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before net finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on disposal of assets, merger 
and acquisition costs, IPO share option charges and exceptional items.
All revenue for the Group is generated from within the UK.

The allocation between Adult and Child included in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts has been re-presented in the 2016 to represent 
continuing and discontinued operations. This is because the perimeter of Adult and Child has changed, due to sites which carry out the 
Adult Services business which were not included in Adult being transferred to Adult, and likewise sites which carry out the Children’s Services 
business which were not included in Child being transferred to Child. Further, the allocation of central costs between Adult and Child has 
been realigned to be consistent with the new perimeter. This is now consistent with the Cambian Group Circular dated 9 December 2016 
which is available on the Company’s website.

subsequent 1% reduction to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. These rate changes were substantively enacted on 18 November 2015
In March 2016, the UK Government announced a further reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. 
This rate change was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
Most of the exceptional costs are capital in nature and therefore not tax deductible, and it is estimated that £8.2m (2015: £2.5m) of the 
exceptional costs will be deductible which has reduced the tax charge by £1.6m (2015: £0.5m).

Financial statements 11. Sale of discontinued operations
On 5 December 2016, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Cambian Healthcare Limited and its subsidiaries, Care 
Aspirations Developments Limited and its subsidiaries, and Cambian Care Services, (“the Adult Services business”), which carried out all of 
the Group’s Adult Services operations. The disposal was effected to allow the Cambian Group to focus on being a market leading provider 
of Children’s Services, where the Board sees significant opportunities for growth, development and the creation of shareholder value. The 
disposal was completed on 28 December 2016, on which date control of the Adult Services business passed to the acquirer, Cygnet Health 
Care Limited.
A profit of £144.3m arose on the disposal of the Adult Services business, being the difference between the proceeds of disposal and the 
carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ net assets and attributable goodwill, as summarised in the below table:

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 90 12. Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company, from continuing operations, by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding the effect of the weighted average 
number of share options under the Continuation Option Plans outstanding that were anti-dilutive for the periods presented but could dilute 
loss per share in the future.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit 
from that business combination.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 91
Financial statements 13. Goodwill (continued)
Goodwill was allocated to two identifiable CGUs, Adult and Child, which align to the reported operating segments. Following the disposal  
of the Adult business, only Child remains as at 31 December 2016. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in  
use calculations.
The CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are presented below:

Adult segment – 38,489
Child segment 75,783 75,783
75,783 114,272
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use of CGUs, has been determined based on 
value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections for operational assets at the balance sheet date based on financial 
budgets approved by the board of directors for the forthcoming year and forecasts for up to four years which are based on assumptions of 
the business, industry and economic growth. Cash flows beyond this year are extrapolated using growth rates, which do not exceed the 
expected long-term economic growth rate. The cash flows are discounted to the net present value using pre-tax discount rates.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, long-term growth rates, mature occupancy rates, 
asset level fill rates, patient fee rates and costs. Mature occupancy rates, asset level fill up rates, patient fee rates and direct costs are 
derived from bottom up, asset by asset level analysis produced as part of management’s annual budget process and are not dissimilar to 
past experience at the point of budget production. The Group has assumed a growth rate of 2% (2015: 2%) into perpetuity when assessing 
its future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment of the time value of 
money as at each balance sheet date, adjusted for the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount cash flow forecasts of CGUs is as follows:
2016 
£’000
2015 
£’000
Adult segment – 8.7%
Child segment 7.9% 8.8%
Sensitivities
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other variables held 
constant. Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next.
The current headroom for Child is £27 .7m (2015: £12.9m). Consequently, the directors have considered the amount by which the value 
assigned to each key assumption must change, after incorporating any consequential effects of that change on the other variables used to 
measure recoverable amount, in order for the Child CGU’s recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying amount. This is illustrated in the 
below table:
2016 2015

Average annual revenue growth rate 4.9% (6.8%) 6.5% (1.6%)

The Group has additionally completed fair value assessments of the business, which supports the carrying value.

Invoices to customers are due for payment within 60 days of issue. Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts (see below for aged 
analysis) which are past due at the reporting date. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited due to its customers being principally local 
authorities controlled by the UK Government. The Group has recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables at each reporting date by 
considering the receivables which are overdue. The average age of receivables is 72 days (2015: 49 days).The Group does not hold collateral 
or other credit enhancements over its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against amounts owed by the Group to the 
counterparty. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates their fair value.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences where the directors believe it is 
probable that these assets will be recovered.
In addition to the recognised losses disclosed above the Group has unused tax losses at the balance sheet date, relating to a mixture of 
trading losses, non-trade deficits and management expenses, of £13.9m (2015: £29.5m) available for offset against suitable future taxable 
profits. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of any of these losses as it is not considered probable that there will be 
sufficient future taxable profits available.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax capital losses of £3.9m (2015: £6.7m) available for offset against future capital 
gains. No deferred tax asset has been recognised for these losses as no future capital gains are currently expected to arise. There  
is no expiry date for any of the recognised and unrecognised tax losses.

the forfeitable shares if they cease to be an employee of the Group before the vesting date, unless otherwise determined by the Board.
During 2014, and prior to IPO, nil-cost options were awarded to certain employees and executives of the Group under Continuation Option 
Plan 1 and Continuation Option Plan 2. 3,199,997 nil-cost options over ordinary shares were awarded under Continuation Option Plan 1, and 
a third of these become exercisable on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of IPO and remain exercisable until the 
tenth anniversary of the date of IPO. 246,225 nil-cost options over ordinary shares were awarded under Continuation Option Plan 2, and 
these become exercisable 18 months from the date of IPO and remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date of IPO. All of the 
nil-cost options awarded under these plans were awarded at the then fair value market price of 225 pence.
The total fair value charge of £7.8m is being expensed over the vesting periods, ranging between 18 months and 5 years. The total 
expense recognised in the year was £2.2m (2015: £2.3m) (note 5).

Goodwill arising from the acquisition of By the Bridge and Interact consist of the value of the assembled workforce, potential synergies 
gained from combining the head office functions and expansion potential.
The acquisitions of Potterspury and Spring Hill resulted in a gain to the income statement as the previous owners were focused on selling 
the business to a high quality acquirer and not marketed widely, as a result the Group was able to agree the purchase on favourable terms.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 100 32. Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates a stakeholder pension scheme as required by the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 and the Stakeholder 
Pensions Scheme Regulations 2000. The Group does not contribute to the scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The Group contributes to a defined benefit scheme for the benefit of the teaching staff employed by subsidiary companies. The assets are 
administered by the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. The Teachers’ Pension Scheme is a multi-employer scheme run by the UK Government 
where the employer’s liability is limited to providing defined contributions on behalf of its employees. As such, the scheme is treated as  
a defined contribution scheme.
The total cost charged to income of £1.3m (2015: £0.9m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified 
in the rules of the schemes. As at 31 December 2016, contributions of £0.3m (2015: £0.4m) due in respect of the current reporting year had 
not been paid over to the schemes.
33. Financial instruments
The Group seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs 
of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and 
transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the 
bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2.

Trade payables (2,157) (6,047)
Financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost – (255,354)
Financial liabilities (2,157) (262,534)
The directors consider that the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities approximates to their fair value.
Capital risk
The Group objectives when managing capital (defined as borrowings plus equity) are to safeguard the Group ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising returns to shareholders through an 
appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
External debt liabilities in the period have been undertaken in the subsidiaries of the Group. Details of all such loans are included in note 20.
Each loan has been monitored closely to ensure that the terms of the loan are adhered to with sufficient headroom to manage any 
contingencies. As at 31 December 2016 there is no RCF in place (2015: £33.5m unutilised portion of the RCF).

Net cash/(debt) 116,107 (239,262)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages its exposure to 
liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts. 
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances to ensure that it has sufficient funds for general corporate purposes including working capital.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 101
Financial statements 33. Financial Instruments (continued)
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, settlement and other financial 
activities. The Group’s credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables. The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The Group has a very low operational credit risk due to the Group 
providing services principally to local authorities. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a 
large number of local authorities and combined commissioning groups. The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as virtually 
all customers are backed by the UK Government.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings during the year. At 31 December 2016 the Group had bank borrowings 
of £nil (2015: £256.5m) with a weighted average interest rate in the year of 10.30% (2015: 3.10%). The Group had in place financial 
instruments to hedge against interest rate movements in the current year.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
Following the settlement of all its debt, Cambian no longer has material interest rate risk as at 31 December 2016. In the prior year, if interest 
rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group loss before tax would decrease/increase by £1.8m. 
This is mainly attributable to the Group exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings, part of which have not been hedged.
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agreed to exchange floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal 
amounts for a fixed rate interest amount. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow 
exposures on the issued variable rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at the end of the reporting period is determined by 
discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the end of the reporting period and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is 
disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the reporting period.
The following table details the notional principal amount and remaining terms of the interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the end  
of the reporting period.

– – – 80,000 – 1,133
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly and monthly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is a 1-month LIBOR. The Group 
will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not trade internationally, and has no material foreign currency risk.
Maturity of non-derivative financial instruments
The Group non-derivative financial assets consist of cash and trade and other receivables, both of which are non-interest bearing.  
The Group expected maturity for its non-derivative financial assets is less than one year.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 102 The following tables detail the Group remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment 
periods. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which 
the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, 
the undiscounted amount is derived from the prevailing 3-month LIBOR rate at the balance sheet date. The contractual maturity is based on 
the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 105
Financial statements 1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The individual financial statements of Cambian Group plc (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with UK law and applicable 
UK accounting standards. The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 100, issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payment, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash flow statement and certain related party transactions.
Investments in subsidiary companies
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. All investments held by the Company 
are in its subsidiaries.
Going concern
As indicated on page 27 of the Annual Report, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future having considered the Company forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the current economic uncertainty. Accordingly, they have adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of loan issue costs, when the relevant contracts are entered into. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after year-end.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and the shares are fully paid up. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Share issue costs incurred directly in connection with a 
business combination are shown as a deduction from equity.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense 
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.

The derivative financial instruments were entered into to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk on its external borrowings.
All derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the IFRS 13 hierarchy. Level 2 fair value measurements are 
those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
6. Deferred tax asset
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of either 17% or 19% (2015: 18% or 19%), 
dependent on when the amount is expected to unwind.
The below table represents the deferred tax assets recognised by the Company and movements thereon during the current and prior

All administrative enquiries relating to shares should, in the first instance, be directed to the Company’s registrar, Equiniti, and clearly 
state the registered shareholder’s name and address. Please write to Cambian Group plc Registrar, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, 
Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA (Tel: from the UK 0371 384 2030 and from outside the UK +44 (0) 121 415 7047).
Shareview
The Shareview portfolio service from the Company’s registrar gives shareholders more control over their Cambian shares and other 
investments, including:
• Direct access to data held for them on the share register, including recent share movements and dividend details;
• A recent valuation of their portfolio; and
• A range of information and practical help for shareholders including how they can elect to receive communications electronically.
It is easy and free to set up a portfolio – shareholders will just need the shareholder reference printed on their proxy form or dividend 
stationery. Please visit the following website for more details: www.shareview.co.uk. The Shareview Dealing service is also available  
by telephone on 03456 037037 between 8.00 am and 4.30 pm, Monday to Friday (excluding Bank Holidays).
Payment of dividends
Shareholders may find it more convenient to make arrangements to have dividends paid directly to their bank account. The advantages 
of this are that the dividend is credited to a shareholder’s bank account on the payment date, there is no need to present cheques for 
payment and there is no risk of cheques being lost in the post.
To set up a dividend mandate or to change an existing mandate please contact Equiniti Limited, our registrar, whose contact details  
are set out above. Alternatively, shareholders who use Equiniti’s Shareview portal can log on to www.shareview.co.uk and follow the 
instructions online.

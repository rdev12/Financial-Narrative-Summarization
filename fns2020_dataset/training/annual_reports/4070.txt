Customer: Highways Agency
Electronic Service Delivery  
for Abnormal Loads (ESDAL2) 
The Highways Agency appointed Costain to deliver a 
technology solution that would improve the service for 
road users moving Abnormal Indivisible Loads (AIL) around 
Britain’s highways. As part of the technology solution, 
Costain provides a hosted software application with access 
provided via web portals to the Highways Agency, hauliers, 
police, and bridge and highways authority users. The solution 
includes the provision of a help desk to support system users 
and to manage and maintain the solution. The collaboration 
provided by the web portals boosts efficiency and eliminates 
wasted time and effort on the part of hauliers and the 
authorities. It also enables the Highways Agency’s Abnormal 
Loads Team to collaborate with stakeholders to plan routes 
and authorise Special Orders for the largest movements.
 We now provide one 
integrated system which is 
faster and far more friendly 
for all users. It’s having a 
very real and positive effect 
on our roads.

REDUCING THE IMPACT OF  
NUCLEAR WASTE IN THE UK
Customer: Magnox
Bradwell FED Treatment Project
Costain delivered the engineering, procurement, construction 
and commissioning of the Bradwell Fuel Element Debris (FED) 
Treatment Project, which is part of the decommissioning 
programme taking Magnox’s Bradwell site into a long-term 
state of care and maintenance. 
FED is the most significant solid Intermediate Level Waste 
(ILW) hazard, by volume, stored on Magnox sites. Costain’s 
application of innovative thinking and extensive industry 
experience has resulted in the development of an innovative 
dissolution process which dissolves FED waste in nitric acid, 
greatly accelerating the accepted process using carbonic acid. 
This process has been shown to reduce the volume of FED 
waste by over 90%. This form of hazard reduction will make a 
significant contribution to the nuclear waste legacy clean up 
in the UK.

David Allvey, Chairman
Chairman’s  
statement
I am delighted to report that Costain had another year of strong performance 
and made further progress in its corporate development.
Delivering growth
The rigorous implementation of our ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ 
strategy has delivered increases in revenue, underlying 
operating profit and a record forward order book which 
now stands at £3.5 billion.
Across the business we have continued to create and deliver 
innovative solutions to help address critical national needs in 
energy, water and transportation.
We successfully completed a capital raise of £70.3 million 
(net of expenses) to enable the business to take greater 
advantage of opportunities in its chosen markets and 
thereby accelerate the Group’s medium and long-term 
growth prospects.
Dividend
At the time of the capital raise, the Group confirmed that 
it intended to continue with a progressive dividend policy, 
targeting an ongoing dividend cover of around two times 
underlying earnings.
Our performance and confidence in the long-term prospects 
for the Group has resulted in the Board recommending a final 
dividend of 6.25 pence per share on the capital base enlarged 
by the capital raise completed in March (2013: 7.75 pence per 
share). On a pro forma basis, allowing for the issue of new 
shares in connection with the capital raise, this represents an 
increase of approximately 25% in the total amount of dividend 
paid to shareholders compared with the total dividend for 2013.
Governance
As Chairman, my priority is to ensure the effectiveness of the 
Board and, once again, we made good progress in delivering 
against our objectives. During the year, an externally facilitated 
evaluation of Board performance was conducted and actions 
were agreed to further improve the effectiveness of the Board.
In 2014, we welcomed two new independent Directors to 
the Board. Alison Wood joined Costain as a Non-Executive 
Director in February, succeeding Mike Alexander as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee when he retired from the Board in 
March. We were also pleased to announce the appointment of 
David McManus as a Non-Executive Director in May.
Corporate citizenship
We have an outstanding team at Costain, one that takes its role 
in society and its corporate responsibility very seriously.
In 2015, Costain is celebrating its 150th anniversary and, 
to help mark this special occasion, we are undertaking the 
Costain 150 Challenge, which will change many people’s lives 
by raising £1 million for the Costain Charitable Foundation’s 
four chosen charities: British Heart Foundation, Macmillan 
Cancer Support, The Prince’s Trust and Samaritans. A number 
of fundraising events are taking place across the business. 
Outlook
We have delivered another strong performance, with increases 
in revenue and underlying operating profit and an enhanced net 
cash position.
Costain has an established reputation for innovative 
multi-disciplined services that enables the Group to win large, 
long-term contracts addressing the UK’s national needs in 
energy, water and transportation. 
This strong market position and the additional capital secured 
during the year is enabling the Group to accelerate its growth, 
as demonstrated by a record order book of £3.5 billion.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
Andrew Wyllie, CBE, Chief Executive
Chief Executive’s  
review
This has been another good year for Costain, the engineering 
solutions provider.
Through our unique and focused ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ 
strategy we have successfully positioned the business 
to provide the range of innovative integrated services 
demanded by our customers to meet critical national needs 
in energy, water and transportation. 
During the year, we added to our skills and breadth of 
capability, developed our market proposition through 
the introduction of new technologies and ensured that 
we consistently delivered on the commitments given to 
our customers.
Our capability was further enhanced in March when we 
successfully completed a capital raise of £70.3 million 
(net of expenses). 
The proceeds are being utilised for a number of purposes 
including: ensuring the requisite financial capacity to 
support anticipated further increases in contract size and 
duration; investing in innovation and technology; financing 
bid costs; and, providing flexibility to make selected in-fill 
acquisitions to complement Costain’s existing capabilities 
as opportunities arise.
Market trends and developments
There is growing consensus across the political spectrum 
of the explicit link between investment in a 21st century 
infrastructure and the creation of sustainable economic 
growth and global competitiveness. 
The UK Government’s 2014 National Infrastructure Plan 
has set out an overall investment of over £320 billion to 
2020-21 in an identified pipeline of projects in the UK, 
including a further £15 billion announced in December 2014 
on road infrastructure. 
The UK market is further defined by significant and long-term 
planned expenditure programmes underpinned by committed 
regulated spend and essential capital investment. With the 
majority of this total investment expected to continue to 
come from the private sector, the opportunities in our markets 
are substantial.
At the same time, and as we anticipated, the changing nature 
and increasing complexity of the requirements of the major 
customers in these markets continues to change fundamentally 
the way in which they procure services and work with their 
supplier partners.
These trends have created a rapidly changing and dynamic 
market environment in which further consolidation has taken 
place and is expected to continue.
Unique ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy
We have been successfully implementing our unique and 
evolving ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy for a number of 
years. Our target customers are large organisations that need 
solutions to their complex business requirements.
We are a trusted delivery partner that collaborates strategically 
at all levels with our customers. We use our detailed customer 
understanding to create and deliver innovative engineering and 
technology-led solutions. 
We win by developing insightful and trusted relationships 
with our customers, enabling a better understanding of their 
needs and allowing us to identify, create and deliver the best 
solution. Our strategy is profitable because our customers value 
our long-term commitment to the relationships and trust us to 
address their challenges in a collaborative and innovative way.
Go to page 26 for more
13 Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
14 Strategic report: Chief Executive’s review
We sustain our competitive advantage by delivering on our 
promises and staying ahead using our customer insight to 
constantly improve our proposition.
Our major customers, who are spending and will continue to 
spend billions of pounds in meeting national infrastructure 
needs, are consolidating their supply chains as they seek to 
derive business benefits by working in a more strategic and 
collaborative manner with a reduced number of preferred Tier 
One providers through larger longer-term contracts. To be 
successful in the future we must continue to grow the business, 
both organically and by targeted acquisition, to ensure that we 
have the scale and capability to satisfy the full range of their 
service needs for increasingly complex and large-scale projects. 
Innovation driving value
Engineering, technology and innovation are in the DNA 
at Costain.
We recognise that no customer will buy the same product, 
with the same attributes at the same price point year after 
year. It is therefore essential that we continuously improve the 
products and services that we provide and enhance value for 
our customers.
Our ability to develop and offer innovative solutions – often 
ones which our customers have not previously considered – is 
a fundamental differentiator. It drives our ability to secure very 
high levels of repeat business with major customers who regard 
Costain as a long-term partner in the development, delivery and 
optimal operation of their assets.
Our contracts now involve a significant amount of collaboration 
amongst the supply chain, our partners and external 
stakeholders, such as researchers and universities, utilising 
the latest information-sharing software and technology.
We have research and development relationships established 
with eight leading universities and have continued to progress 
a number of patent applications. We also moved 400 people 
into our new engineering centre in Manchester.

Innovations, in collaboration with partners, which have added 
value to our customers’ businesses this year, include:
• Use of the Costain ‘WeCARE’ system for predictable 
pre-planned and cost-effective Technology Asset 
Maintenance using data analytics;
• Creation of 3-D models utilising 3-D printing technologies 
to articulate complex engineering solutions;
• Application of manufacturing assembly best practice 
to achieve significantly accelerated project delivery and 
cost savings.
Good operating results and strong cash 
position
Revenue, including the Group’s share of joint ventures 
and associates, for the year increased to £1,122.5 million 
(2013: £960.0 million), circa 30% of which was derived from 
support service related activities. 
Group underlying operating profit increased to £28.7 million 
(2013: £27.4 million).
Adjusted profit before tax was £28.5 million 
(2013: £31.0 million); the reduction is due to the significant 
profit generated in 2013 on the sale of the Group’s minority 
shareholdings in three joint ventures. Adjusted basic earnings 
per share was 27.8 pence (2013: 41.0 pence), the lower level 
also reflecting the enlarged capital base following the capital 
raise completed in March 2014. 
The Infrastructure division had an excellent year with increases 
in revenue, operating profit and order book. The Natural 
Resources division delivered an operating profit excluding 
the impact of a provision associated with the legacy Greater 
Manchester Waste PFI contract awarded in 2007, as detailed 
in the Divisional review.
The Group’s net cash position at 31 December 2014 was 
£148.5 million (2013: £57.7 million). The increase in the net cash 
position reflects the successful £70.3 million (net of expenses) 
capital raise in March, and benefitted from the timing of positive 
contract cash flows at the period end. As previously highlighted, 
the Group’s net cash position has changed as we continue to 
increase our workload with major customers who utilise lower-
risk target-cost, cost-reimbursable contracts. The average 
month-end net cash was £95.6 million (2013: £50.7 million) and 
we anticipate small increases from this level going forward.
Record order book
The ability to provide and integrate a wide range of 
multidisciplined skills and services, along with our strong market 
position and reputation for innovation, has enabled us to secure 
over £1.5 billion worth of large and complex projects and 
contract extensions during the course of the year which include:
• the delivery of Network Rail’s National 
Electrification Programme;
• appointment to the Highways Agency’s Collaborative 
Delivery Framework;
• a position on three transmission frameworks for National Grid;
• a framework contract with BAE Systems for their submarine 
site redevelopment programme;
• appointment by Southern Water for their AMP6 
investment programme;
• the delivery of EPC services for the upgrade of the Dimlington 
gas terminal for Perenco.
Consequently, the Group’s order book has further increased, 
finishing the year at a new record level of £3.5 billion 
(31 December 2013: £3.0 billion).
As well as including over £1.0 billion of revenues secured for 
2015 (as at 31 December 2013: over £750 million secured for 
2014), the order book also provides good long-term visibility 
with £2.5 billion of revenues secured for 2016 and beyond.

The increasingly strategic nature of Costain’s long-term 
customer relationships has ensured that over 90% of the order 
book comprises repeat business and, given the complexity 
of the customer’s requirements, over 90% is in a target cost, 
cost reimbursable, collaborative forms of contract providing 
good long-term earnings visibility. The Group also has a strong 
preferred bidder position increased to over £500 million.
Such a level of secured work gives us good reason to look to the 
future with confidence, especially as the level of active tendering 
across all our target markets remains high. 
The Group’s tender success rate is now better than one 
in three of all opportunities pursued, a win-rate that has 
improved significantly as a consequence of the implementation 
of our strategy to focus on the needs of major customers. 
These customers are increasingly procuring contracts on a 
larger and longer-term basis, reflected in the fact that over 70% 
of the Group’s order book is for contracts or frameworks with a 
remaining value in excess of £100 million. The average life of a 
contract in the Group has increased considerably in the last few 
years and is now over four years in duration.
‘Costain Cares’
Our customers continue to place great emphasis on the 
‘good citizen’ credentials of their supply chain partners. 
Given the profile of their businesses and the nature of the 
activities we undertake, how we deliver our services is as 
important to them as what we do. Increasingly, customers 
insist that their Tier One providers share their corporate and 
social responsibility values and failure to embrace this means 
non-qualification for tender lists.
The management of Health and Safety is a core value at Costain. 
We place a priority on the management of Safety, Health and 
Environment, and the Group’s Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) 
improved to 0.10 (2013: 0.12), which compares favourably with 
our peer group. We also received 17 Gold Awards from RoSPA, 
seven Gold Medals and a prestigious Order of Distinction. 
Notwithstanding the improved performance, and in view of the 
prosecution and fine for Health and Safety breaches following 
the death in 2011 of a subcontract worker at a site in Newbury, 
we recognise that there is still more we must do to achieve our 
objective of zero accidents.
Our ‘Costain Cares’ programme places responsible, effective 
and collaborative stakeholder relationships at the core of 
everything we do. It is a central part of our value proposition to 
customers and has a direct impact on the size and quality of our 
order book.
In the year, we retained our Platinum status in the Business in 
the Community index, recognising our proactive commitment to 
the environmental and social aspects of our operations.
Costain further improved its position in the annual assessment 
by Management Today magazine of Britain’s Most Admired 
Companies, ranking 52nd overall, up from 55th the 
previous year.
Teamwork
We adopt a ‘One Costain’ philosophy across the Group, and 
that is evident in the way in which our team of over 3,500 people 
work together to deliver an outstanding service to customers 
and deliver strong business performance. 
We have continued to develop and enhance skills across 
the business and there are currently 179 graduates and 
80 apprentices on our structured development programmes.
During the year, David Taylor was appointed to the Executive 
Board as Group Commercial Director, replacing Patrick Bruce 
who is retiring from the Group in March 2015 after over 40 years 
of service.
Outlook
We have delivered a strong performance, and successfully 
completed a capital raising to enable the Group to accelerate its 
growth. We are excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead 
and, with an outstanding team and record order book, we look 
forward to reporting on further progress in 2015.

1. Operating safely, efficiently  
and responsibly
The Health and Safety of our people and 
everyone who is involved with Costain remains our 
highest priority. We demand that safety must be 
adhered to at all times to ensure that we operate 
in an environment which is free from harm.
We concentrate on solutions that deliver best 
value for customers. This requires an unrelenting 
focus on our customers’ costs and our own 
operating procedures. 
We believe that responsible business is integral 
to delivering greater value to our customers 
and all our stakeholders. Our commitment to 
delivering services responsibly and sustainably 
is vitally important to the Group. We are focused 
on building a long-term sustainable business that 
creates economic, environmental and social value.
2. Continue to enhance  
customer insight
The ability to understand the challenges facing 
our customers is crucial if we are to strengthen 
and evolve our relationships with them. 
Continuing to enhance our customer insight 
is one of our top priorities and it is by building 
strategic, long-term, collaborative partnerships 
that we are best positioned to deliver innovative

Our focus and the  
opportunities we see
The sectors in which the Costain Group is active have, in total, a targeted 
investment spend of more than £87 billion per annum for the immediate 
future. Below is a summary of activity in those sectors.
Ofwat’s final determination for the sixth asset 
management cycle will see the investment of 
£44 billion in improving services, improving 
resilience and protecting the environment. 
This will be delivered through 522 performance 
commitments to deliver a high-quality 
service to customers with incentives to 
promote success. This demonstrates a 
continued commitment to spend in the sector. 
The regulators’ focus on total expenditure 
(Totex) provides an opportunity to grow into 
higher value services and drive efficiency 
across the industry. 
Our road network requires significant 
investment. Road congestion is forecast to 
keep increasing, costing the economy billions 
each year and causing frustration to road users. 
The road network is also an ageing asset. 
The Government’s response in December 
2014 was to announce its ‘Roads Investment 
Strategy’– the biggest-ever upgrade of the 
UK’s existing roads. The Government has 
committed £15 billion to improve the national 
road network. 
• £6 billion to resurface 80% of the 
national network
• £9 billion to add 1,300 extra lane miles
• Over 60 junction improvements to the 
national road network
Through the National Infrastructure Plan 
the Government will also be providing 
local authorities in England with £5.8 billion 
over 2014-2020 for the maintenance of 
local highways.

Between 2014 and 2020, an estimated 
£34 billion of further investment may be 
needed in electricity and £7.6 billion in 
gas networks
1
.
Resilient energy networks are critical for energy 
security and vital components of a successful 
economy. Historically, our existing networks 
have served us well but they are ageing and 
out of date. Not only do we need to rebuild 
our networks to ensure resilience, we need to 
expand them so we can take advantage of the 
new types of low carbon energy generation. 
We also need to modernise them so we can 
take advantage of the new ways of controlling 
power flows – ultimately developing smart grids 
that are much more responsive and can deliver 
better efficiency and higher energy savings.
Our national networks also need to be more 
integrated with neighbouring markets. 
Increased interconnection will support 
the UK’s energy security, affordability and 
decarbonisation objectives, and support 
the development of a single European 
electricity market.
In addition to network infrastructure, the 
requirement for clean energy for the future is 
attracting investment in carbon capture and 
storage projects and technology, as well as new 
nuclear power stations. There is over £46 billion 
of planned investment in this area

Investment: Networks. Published: January 2015
The challenges faced with the reducing oil 
price will drive operators to reduce costs, 
work more efficiently and re-evaluate project 
execution. This will provide opportunities 
for Costain to build upon its reputation as a 
value-added solution provider of full life-cycle 
engineering services. With its particular 
expertise in all sectors, Costain is ideally 
positioned for involvement in necessary 
brownfield upgrade and expansion projects; 
the growing demand for oil and gas storage; 
and the enhancement and maintenance of 
transmission systems. Further opportunities lie 
ahead in regards to the increasing momentum 
for UK development of unconventional gas and 
carbon capture projects.
The Government underpins its commitment to 
rail with industry-wide strategic engagement 
and ongoing investment. UK plc is benefiting 
from this, with passenger journeys set to 
grow a further 30% over the next decade on a 
safer, more reliable and cost-effective railway. 
Technology driven ‘digital solutions’ will help 
achieve these national needs. The £38 billion 
investment on the national rail networks over 
the next five years is underway, covering 
electrification, station enhancements and route 
upgrades, with further significant commitments 
to London Rail, Crossrail and London 
Underground. HS2 continues to gather pace 
as a key emerging market. We have developed 
our specialist railway skills to provide a full 
spectrum portfolio for customers.
Significant opportunities exist in the UK 
nuclear market, both in decommissioning and 
new power plant construction. The Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority continues to 
accelerate its strategy to manage the clean up 
of the legacy sites offering long-term clean up 
and decommissioning contracts. In conjunction 
with the Government’s objective to deliver 
16GW of new nuclear capacity by 2030 and 
growth in the MOD market, this presents 
further opportunity for Costain’s position to 
grow further in the Nuclear sector.

28 Strategic report: Principal risks and uncertainties
This section highlights the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
together with the key mitigating activities in place to manage those risks.
The Board formally reviews the material risks and ensures that these are appropriately managed by the management team. 
The Board retains the ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk management framework, including reviewing its effectiveness. 
It has, however, delegated responsibility for annually reviewing the overall effectiveness of the risk management programme to 
the Audit Committee. The internal audit function provides assurances to the Audit Committee of the effectiveness of the internal 
control procedures through completion of the annual audit plan, which takes into account current business risks. 
The table below lists the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group at the date of this Report. This list is not intended to be 
exhaustive. Some risks have not been included in this section on the basis that they are not considered to be material or are not 
presently known to the Board.
Principal risks 
and uncertainties 
Risk and Impact Mitigation
Health, Safety and Environment
• Failure to prevent a major safety 
incident/accident or environmental 
event which could adversely affect the 
Group’s reputation and its operational 
and financial performance
The health and safety of our people and everyone who is impacted by Costain 
remains our highest priority.
Accordingly, Costain has detailed Health and Safety policies in place to minimise 
such risks. Regular Health and Safety visits by experienced professionals and on-site 
training take place to reduce the risk of human error. Any breaches in procedures 
are reported quickly and acted upon as appropriate. A Health and Safety committee 
also meets monthly to develop a consistent approach and consider best practice.
Performance metrics in the Group’s Annual Incentive Plan also include a key 
non-financial indicator for Health and Safety.
Political, economic and market 
conditions
• Change in Government and policy 
on spending
• Residual effects of the global 
economic downturn resulting 
in contracts being cancelled 
or postponed
The strategy of the Group is to focus on major customers in the UK energy, water 
and transportation markets. These markets are defined by significant and long-term 
planned expenditure programmes underpinned by committed regulated spend 
and essential capital investment. The future opportunities in these markets 
are substantial.
The UK Government’s National Infrastructure Plan has identified investment of over 
£320 billion to 2020-21 in an identified pipeline of projects in the UK, including a 
further £15 billion announced in December 2014 on road infrastructure. The plan has 
identified that the funding for investment will be 65.6% from the private sector, 13.8% 
representing a mix of public and private sources and 20.6% from the public sector.
Financial strength
• Unable to demonstrate to customers  
the required level of financial 
resource resulting in failure to 
win long-term contracts
• Inability to maintain competitive scale  
in a consolidating market
• Failure to maintain adequate working 
capital to operate the business
The Group has a strong balance sheet with a positive net cash position and no 
significant debt.
In March 2014, the Group successfully completed a capital raise of £70.3 million 
(net of expenses) to enable the business to take greater advantage of the 
opportunities in its chosen markets and therefore accelerate the Group’s medium 
and long-term growth prospects. The capital raise significantly increased the 
net asset base of the Company.
The Group has in place extensive unutilised banking and bonding facilities. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132

Risk and Impact Mitigation
Winning new work
• Competition and failure to win work
The Group’s unique ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy focuses on blue-chip 
customers whose major spending plans are underpinned by strategic national needs, 
regulation commitments or essential maintenance requirements. 
The Group has successfully developed strong relationships with these customers 
across a range of markets in energy, water and transportation that need solutions 
to their complex business requirements. The Group regularly monitors the pipeline 
of opportunities available.
The Group’s ongoing drive, both organically and by acquisition, to broaden its skills 
and breadth of capability, develop its market proposition through the introduction of 
new technologies and its strong brand and excellent reputation for delivery, will also 
provide it with a competitive edge.
Operational delivery
• Failure to deliver the services to 
the time, cost or quality required in 
the contract
• Failure to accurately assess risks, 
costs, time or contractual terms
• Design faults
• Procurement delay or failure
• Failure to obtain/renew insurance or 
refusal of claim by insurers
Costain has in place policies, processes and procedures for the tendering, 
preparation, planning and delivery of contracts. These are brought together 
in the ‘Costain Way’ setting out the requirements for all employees.
Costain has defined delegated authority levels for approving all tenders. 
All significant contracts are subject to review by the Investment Committee. 
To mitigate the cost risk, experienced and qualified staff are used to prepare bids, 
which are subject to internal review and approval before submission. 
During the life of the contract, regular contract leaders’ meetings take place to discuss 
safety, progress, quality, cost, financial performance, end forecast, risk, etc.
Work on site is audited by in-house specialists and reports are prepared so that 
corrective action, where required, can be taken. A senior executive is responsible 
for overall quality issues, the updating of best practice and ensuring compliance. 
The senior executive is also responsible for reviewing and updating the Group’s 
procedures in line with the changing business.
Supply chain/joint venture risks
• Failure of subcontractors, suppliers 
or joint venture partners resulting in 
failure to deliver contracts on time and 
to budget
The Group seeks to ensure that it is not over-reliant on any one subcontractor, 
supplier or joint venture partner. In addition, the Group maintains a list of preferred 
subcontractors and suppliers which is reviewed regularly. The Group also undertakes 
financial monitoring of subcontractors and suppliers and endeavours to maintain a 
dialogue with them in order to identify any issue or cause for concern. The Group 
has in use an external audit system to ensure compliance by its preferred and 
strategic suppliers. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

Risk and Impact Mitigation
People and skills
• Failure to attract, retain and develop 
a best-in-class team in an increasingly 
competitive market may limit the 
Group’s ability to grow the business 
as anticipated
To support its goal to develop a best-in-class team, the Group’s remuneration 
policy is designed to attract and retain high-calibre individuals in an increasingly 
competitive market and to remunerate fairly, whilst not encouraging inappropriate 
business risk to be taken. Pay and conditions of employment are also regularly 
reviewed against the prevailing market and bench marked against competitors to 
ensure that the Group remains competitive at all levels. 
The Group has in place a well-developed succession planning process which 
is regularly monitored. This process includes carrying out talent reviews and 
encouraging ongoing development at all levels. The Group also seeks to actively 
engage with employees through engagement surveys.
Pension liabilities 
• Failure to manage the Group’s pension 
scheme so that the liabilities are within 
a range appropriate to its capital base 
which could have an adverse impact 
on the Group’s operational results
The Group manages a legacy defined benefit scheme and continually reviews the 
actions it can take to mitigate long-term risk and consults professional advisers, 
as necessary. 
The scheme was closed to new members from 1 June 2005 and to future accrual 
on 30 September 2009. A number of other actions have been taken to manage 
the obligations in the scheme, including the transfer of assets into the scheme 
and the implementation of Enhanced Transfer Value and Pension Increase 
Exchange exercises.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2013 was concluded during 
2014 and the Group agreed a deficit recovery plan with the Trustee.
Acquisitions 
• Failure to integrate successfully an 
acquired business or recognise and 
mitigate new and related risks could 
have a damaging impact on the 
Group’s future revenue and profits
Full due diligence is carried out before any acquisition is made. Integration plans 
are put in place and managed by a dedicated team and progress monitored against 
pre-agreed performance indicators.
Failure of IT systems
• Failure of IT systems, inability to 
manage and/or to integrate IT 
systems, as well as the failure to store 
key documentation securely, could 
cause financial loss to the Group and 
expose the Group to breaches of 
legislation and fines.
A senior executive is responsible for the IT systems and has a suitably qualified team 
for support. Critical areas are subject to testing and include rapid recovery as well as 
sound data backup procedures. Online security training is provided for safe usage 
and storage of documentation.
The Group is accredited to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Information Security 
Management System.

Divisional review
We have two core operating 
and reporting divisions within 
our business: Infrastructure and 
Natural Resources.
Our customer-aligned divisional structure has enabled us to 
continue to focus our resources on identifying and securing 
the most attractive new business opportunities across the 
sectors in which we operate.
Infrastructure
The Infrastructure division, which operates in the Highways, 
Rail and Power sectors, experienced another year of 
strong growth as major customers continued to invest in 
upgrading and renewing the UK’s infrastructure assets, 
encouraged by Government initiatives such as the National 
Infrastructure Plan.
Revenue (including share of joint ventures and associations) 
increased to £785.2 million (2013: £560.6 million) whilst 
adjusted profit from operations rose to £38.3 million 
(2013: £31.4 million) as the division performed well on existing 
projects and secured significant new contracts across all its 
target sectors. Profit margins in the year were at the upper 
end of our expectations and included the benefit of the award 
of gain-share and bonuses on a number of projects. 
The order book for the division has grown to £2.3 billion 
(2013: £1.9 billion) as we have secured significant new orders 
and contract extensions from customers. We have also 
delivered several major Early Contractor Involvement (‘ECI’) 
schemes through the planning and statutory process, prior to 
commencing delivery phase. The level of tendering activity 
remains high with a significant opportunity pipeline.
In Highways, Costain continued to build on its status as a 
leading supplier to the Highways Agency. The Group secured 
a place on their five-year, £5 billion Collaborative Delivery 
Framework and was awarded three Smart Motorway schemes 
as part of the Managed Motorway Programme on which 
Costain is a long-term partner. The Group also continued 
to deliver significant maintenance works within the Asset 
Support Framework and three Managing Agent Contracts. 
Our broad, multidisciplinary capability is also enabling close 
involvement at earlier stages of major projects through ECI 
schemes, which then lead to contract extensions for the 
delivery phase, for example on the A556 Knutsford project.
Costain has also continued to be a major supplier to the 
Welsh Government, with the All Wales Technology contract 
progressing well and the A465 ECI contract now moving 
to the construction phase following the Group’s successful 
delivery of the front-end engineering and design stage of the 
project. The Group’s work on strengthening the strategically 
important Hammersmith flyover for Transport for London is also 
progressing on time and on budget.
In Rail, a Costain joint venture was awarded the largest share of 
Network Rail’s £2 billion National Electrification Programme and 
the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Project. The Group’s 
position as one of the most significant service providers for 
Crossrail, Europe’s largest infrastructure project, was reinforced 
with the award of the North East Spur contract, whilst Costain’s 
other works for Crossrail at Paddington Station, Bond Street 
Station and Paddington New Yard continue to progress well.
Her Majesty the Queen opened Reading Station after the critical 
redevelopment project was handed over ahead of schedule. 
At London Bridge, one of the busiest transport hubs in the UK, 
Costain has continued to deliver on key milestones, including 
bringing into use, six new platforms.
In Power, the Group is making significant progress delivering 
National Grid’s London Power Tunnels project, which involves 
the construction of the longest tunnel under London in history. 
In addition, the Group has also secured repeat work with 
National Grid following appointment to their high voltage 
underground and overhead transmission line frameworks. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

The Costain team has delivered several key overhead line 
projects for UK Power Networks and also continues to 
perform operations and maintenance activities for SSE, E.ON 
and Scottish Power. The Group is also engaged at the ECI 
stage with EDF in the development of the Hinkley C new 
nuclear power plant, designing and developing the cooling 
system marine tunnel.
Natural Resources 
The Natural Resources division encompasses Costain’s 
activities in the Oil & Gas, Nuclear and Water sectors.
Revenue (including share of joint ventures and associations) 
for the year was £335.0 million (2013: £397.6 million), with 
adjusted profit from operations, including £4.0 million profit 
on transfer of interest in associates to The Costain Pension 
Scheme, of £0.5 million (2013: £12.8 million, including 
£9.1 million profit on sale of interest in joint ventures). 
The reduction in revenue reflects our policy of prioritising and 
allocating tendering resources towards the most attractive 
opportunities for growth across the Group at any point 
in time.
The adjusted operating result for the year includes additional 
costs for the completion of the legacy waste PFI contract 
awarded in 2007 for the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal 
Authority as described on page 33. Excluding these costs, the 
division generated an operating profit and is trading in line 
with expectations including an increasing level of tendering 
costs for new work. The division has increased its forward 
order book to £1.2 billion (2013: £1.1 billion) and is expected to 
benefit from customer spend in its target markets which are 
underpinned by regulatory and legislative requirements.
In Water, the Group continued to deliver successfully AMP5 
frameworks for United Utilities, Southern Water, Severn Trent 
Water, Welsh Water and Northumbrian Water. Looking to 
the future, Costain has been awarded places on the five-year 
AMP6 programmes, which commence in April 2015, for Thames 
Water, Severn Trent Water and Southern Water. The Group is 
continuing to deliver the large waste water treatment plants at 
Liverpool and Woolston, and has completed the award-winning 
Brighton & Hove scheme. In addition, work commenced on the 
Shieldhall contract with Scottish Water.
Costain continued to broaden its specialist capabilities in the 
Oil & Gas market where it believes it will continue to secure new 
work although there will be some impact from the recent falls in 
the oil price. In 2014, the Group secured a contract with Centrica 
Energy for EPC services as part of the Barrow Gas Terminals 
Project and with Perenco for its Freon replacement project 
at Dimlington.
We continue to deliver support services for the Oil and Pipelines 
Agency, including operations, maintenance and upgrade 
services across its network of jet fuel pipelines and storage 
facilities, with a further one-year extension being awarded in 
the year. Costain Upstream, which delivers asset development 
and asset improvement consulting services from its base in 
Aberdeen, has performed well and continued to secure new 
work including an extension to the Premier Oil framework. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

In Nuclear, the Group is now a major contract partner 
with BAE having been appointed to its £300 million, eight 
year programme to re-develop the submarine site in 
Barrow-in-Furness. The delivery of Evaporator-D construction 
at the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Facility in West 
Cumbria continues as expected. The Fuel Element Debris 
dissolution facility at Bradwell was successfully handed over 
for active commissioning.
During December, handover was achieved on the final waste 
facility on the legacy Greater Manchester Waste Disposal 
Authority PFI contract awarded in 2007. All 46 facilities on the 
contract are now either fully completed or in the warranty 
period under the terms of the contract during which further 
work and plant modifications will be completed. In achieving 
handover of the final facility, we received in December 
contractual retention and milestone payments of £14 million. 
As previously reported, Costain is in discussions with relevant 
contract counterparties and the Group’s insurers regarding 
the issues that have arisen on this contract. The Board 
expects a successful outcome to these discussions. In 2014, 
a provision has been taken for additional costs to complete 
the project. It has been the Group’s policy since 2009 not to 
pursue fixed-price contracts of this nature. 
We completed the Parkway development in Newbury, a mixed 
retail and residential project, and reached agreement on 
the final account for the work with our client. Following legal 
proceedings, a fine of £0.5 million for health and safety 
breaches relating to the death of a contract worker at the site 
in 2011 was incurred.
Land Development
The Group’s non-core Land Development activity in Spain, 
undertaken in a 50:50 joint venture with Santander Bank, 
continued to be subject to challenging market conditions. 
The joint venture has a portfolio of in excess of 500 hectares 
of land in Southern Spain with varying levels of planning 
approval for residential and hotel development. It also holds 
two leisure businesses, a golf club and 624-berth yacht marina, 
adjacent to Gibraltar. Both leisure activities have reported 
improving revenue streams, particularly in the marina where 
the boat repair yard is in demand and is assisting in raising 
marina occupancy. 
Whilst the Spanish economy continues to show signs of 
improvement, there remains considerable uncertainty as 
to when significant recovery will be achieved. Revenue was 
£2.3 million (2013: £1.8 million) and the loss after tax was 
£1.3 million (2013: £2.1 million). As anticipated, no significant land 
sales were completed in the year Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
34 Strategic report: Corporate Responsibility review
Corporate Responsibility  
review
We are committed to delivering projects and services 
responsibly and sustainably, ensuring that we meet our 
customers’ and society’s needs while managing the social, 
environmental and economic issues that impact our 
business either directly or through our supply chain. 
“ Costain Cares is a continued 
commitment to you, our 
stakeholder, to focus on the 
issues you care about.”
   Andrew Wyllie CBE, Chief Executive
Through stakeholder engagement and by assessing our 
impacts and level of influence, we have identified key priorities 
that are material to our business and are of importance to our 
key stakeholders.
Costain Cares, our Corporate Responsibility (CR) strategy and 
vision to build a longer-term sustainable business that creates 
economic, environmental and social value, addresses these 
key priorities. 
Our approach
Costain Cares is based on three fundamental pillars: 
Relationships, Our Environment and The Future.
1. Relationships
We encourage open, honest and respectful communication 
and believe in strong, long-lasting relationships that are 
mutually beneficial.
We will:
• provide a safe working environment free from harm;
• provide a healthy working environment for all our people;
• support the local communities in which we operate, ensuring 
we leave a lasting legacy;
• provide sustainable solutions and the highest standards of 
service for our customers;
• attract, retain and develop the best people for the Costain 
Group; and
• operate a collaborative, responsible supply chain where our 
partners support us in delivering efficient, innovative and 
sustainable solutions. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
2. Our Environment
We operate in the built environment, where we meet  
national needs for strategic investment in infrastructure. 
Next, we compete in the economic environment, where we 
must deliver value for customers and shareholders. Finally,  
we have to deliver responsibly to the natural environment  
for the benefit of everyone. 
Where possible, we will work with our customers and supply 
chain to:
• reduce our impact on climate change;
• conserve natural resources through effective waste 
management, minimising water consumption and 
sustainable sourcing of materials; and
• protect and enhance the environment.
3. The Future
We play an important role in the provision of infrastructure 
vital to the UK economy. The benefits of investment in 
infrastructure today will be felt for many years to come. 
We will:
• be one of the UK’s top engineering solutions providers
• provide a sustainable return on investment for 
our shareholders;
• invest in innovation to provide solutions to 
tomorrow’s challenges;
• work with our customers and supply chain to develop skills 
to respond to future needs within our sector; and
• contribute to economic growth by supporting our supply 
chain, including small and medium-sized enterprises.
Our CR performance
The next page summarises our progress against our key 
CR priorities that are not already reported on either in 
our review of strategic priorities on page 20 or financial 
performance on page 41. 
 More details about our Costain’s CR work are  
 available online at costain.com/our-culture
The Board is responsible and the Executive Board is 
accountable for all aspects of CR including setting 
policy and strategy and providing leadership to drive 
our CR programme. Every employee is expected to 
work in a responsible and sustainable way.
In addition to measuring performance against our 
strategy, we also measure and benchmark ourselves 
against our peers and other companies in the wider 
marketplace by participating in Business in the 
Community (BITC) CR Index. The CR Index illustrates 
how companies integrate responsible business at 
strategic and operational levels. In 2014, we were proud 
to retain Platinum status.

Key highlights
• The launch of the Costain Safe Start Toolkit aimed at ensuring 
that every worker at Costain starts work safely. The toolkit 
includes a training package which focuses on developing the 
communication skills of the managers and supervisors who 
put people to work.
• Two successful safety, health and environmental (SHE) 
Leadership Impact days were held across the Group in 
April and October. Led by the two Managing Directors, 
approximately 50 senior business leaders visited over 50 sites 
and the two principal offices in order to engage with site 
personnel and demonstrate commitment from the highest 
level. The two key themes for both days were the importance 
of putting people to work safely using the Safe Start toolkit 
and the management of health and wellbeing.

Heysham to M6 Link Scheme
This long-awaited dual carriageway and park-and-ride 
scheme will improve access and ease congestion for local 
businesses and residents, while a park-and-ride scheme 
will help boost the Lancaster economy.
The Heysham to M6 Link scheme will provide the 
long-awaited connection from the M6 at Junction 
34 to the Morecambe and Heysham peninsula. Since 
construction began in early 2014, the scheme is set to 
realise a number of key environmental and community 
benefits including improved air quality, biodiversity, 
increased passenger access and employment 
opportunities. 
Reducing our carbon footprint
We have been working closely with our supply chain 
partner, Lafarge Tarmac, to minimise the carbon footprint 
during the construction phase, a target that also delivered 
safety and cost benefits. 
Early engagement on the design and materials led to a 
total carbon reduction of 21% from the original design. 
Our team were able to identify considerable savings in 
the quantity of materials required and the embodied 
carbon footprint of the entire project. The new design 
reduced the aggregate tonnage by nearly 25% alone, 
while the largest carbon savings have been realised 
through the reduction in asphalts. There is opportunity to 
identify even further carbon and cost reductions.
Safety remains a high priority during delivery. Our team 
is proud of the safety record (current AFR 0.11) and work 
they have done with local road users to raise awareness 
and prevent road risk.
Supporting the local community
The local community has also benefited from the scheme 
with Costain insisting on using local labour where 
possible. This has resulted in 85% of agency personnel 
living locally, 80 of whom were previously unemployed. 
We have also recruited five apprentices to assist in the 
successful delivery of the scheme.

London Bridge Legacy
At London Bridge station, we are striving to maintain a 
fit and healthy workforce, to reduce our use of natural 
resources, eliminate waste, maximize our talent and skills, 
integrate business into the community and help tackle 
low employment in the London Borough of Southwark.
Key benefits, as at December 2014:
•  c.£1.8 million spent with local and small and  
medium-sized businesses (SMEs) by December 2014
• 99% of waste diverted from landfill
• 26 apprenticeships offered
We are working with our client, Network Rail, to ensure 
long-term employee and project value by implementing 
sustainable solutions both in design and construction. We 
have introduced a number of best practices and initiatives 
that will help us provide a sustainable legacy.
Integrating business into the community
Engagement with local companies and recruiting 
local SMEs is important to promote local economic 
sustainability. By holding local supplier events and 
encouraging companies to develop their offering, we 
have contributed towards the economy of the London 
Borough of Southwark. 
By identifying skills gaps within the local community and 
gaining our Skills Academy status in 2013, we have helped 
young people obtain employment, providing them with 
the basic training needed in the construction industry.
Environmental responsibility
We proactively work to minimise all impacts through 
changes in methods or mitigation in advance of major 
works. Automated monitoring systems have been 
installed around the worksite to assess noise and 
air quality impacts and allow us to pinpoint any problems.
One of our focuses has been the responsible procurement 
of materials and services using tools such as our material 
use plan. This allows us to make informed decisions about 
the materials that we use on projects. 
The project has required the removal of over 200,000 tonnes 
of waste, and despite the contaminated nature of the sites 
we have diverted over 99% of the waste from landfills.

Goal: To conserve natural  
resources 
Goal: To protect and enhance 
the environment
Conserve natural resources 
Key highlights
• We continued to raise awareness of efficient material and 
waste management and identify, in early phases of contracts, 
ways to minimise materials and eliminate waste.  
• Where feasible, we used the CL:AIRE Code of Practice  
to manage materials and, therefore, reduce waste. 
• We continued to work closely with our supply chain to 
minimise or eliminate wastage and ensure we reduced 
or limited and recovered as much waste as possible. 
Protect and enhance the  
environment
Key highlights
• Significantly raised awareness over the last three years of 
environmental incidents and the importance of reporting, 
undertaken via numerous mechanisms including increased 
levels of training and communication initiatives.
Tonnes of waste removed
Environmental incidents
We have under taken a 
number of high volume 
excavation projects in the last 
four years…
Better staff training has led to an increase in awareness and the 
reporting of incidents.
…but the percentage of 
waste we divert from landfills 
remains consistently high.
No environmental 
prosecutions, cautions or 
notices in the last eight years
Focus for 2015
• Continue to drive resource efficiency and improve our systems 
with the aim of maximising the efficient use of resources. 
• Work closely with our supply chain to continue to reduce 
waste production and increase diversion from landfills.
Focus for 2015
• We are committed to minimising our impact on the 
environment and reducing our overall environmental  
incidents year-on-year. 
• Reduce our Environmental Incident Frequency Rate to 0.31.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
Overview
Group revenue, including share of joint ventures and associates, 
was £1,122.5 million for the year to 31 December 2014 
(2013: £960.0 million). The Group generated a 5% increase in 
underlying operating profit to £28.7 million (2013: £27 .4 million). 
The increased profit reflects the Group’s continued focus on  
long-term repeat orders with blue chip customers.
Profit before tax, before other items, for the year was £28.5 million 
(2013: £31.0 million). Basic earnings per share, before other items, 
amounted to 27 .8 pence (2013: 41.0 pence). Reported basic 
earnings per share were 22.2 pence (2013: 17 .6 pence).
Profit before tax, before other items, includes profits on the 
transfer or disposal of the Group’s PFI equity portfolio and in 
2014, the Group transferred its remaining two PFI investments 
into The Costain Pension Scheme (CPS) at a value agreed with 
the Trustee of the scheme of £7 .4 million, which resulted in a 
profit on the transfer of £4.0 million. In 2013, the Group sold its 
minority shareholdings in three joint venture companies as part 
of the disposal of this portfolio, for an aggregate consideration of 
£12.0 million. The Group realised a profit of £9.1 million as a result 
of this sale. 
The Group secured a number of new contracts and extensions 
and the Group’s order book increased to £3.5 billion (31 December 
2013: £3.0 billion).
The results of the Group’s operating divisions are considered 
in the Divisional review section and are shown in the segmental 
analysis in the financial statements. 
Capital raising 
On 18 March 2014, the Group successfully completed the raising 
of £70.3 million (net of expenses) of new capital. The proceeds 
are being, and will be, utilised:
• to demonstrate to customers the Group’s financial capacity 
to support the anticipated further increases in contract size 
and duration; 
• to invest in innovation and technology necessary to enhance 
the service offering to customers; 
• to finance bid costs associated with a greater number of large 
scale projects for which the Group is in a position to tender; 
• to fund likely increased working capital requirements  
arising from the move in the market towards target-cost,  
cost-reimbursable contracts; 
• to provide flexibility to make selected in-fill acquisitions to 
complement Costain’s existing capabilities as opportunities 
arise; and 
• for general corporate purposes. 
Finance Director’s  
review
This review brings together the key financial metrics of the Group and sets out 
the matters of financial significance. 
Anthony Bickerstaff, Finance Director
41 Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
42 Strategic report: Finance Directors’ review
Interest
Net finance expense amounted to £3.6 million 
(2013: £4.0 million). The interest payable on bank overdrafts, 
loans and other similar charges was £2.2 million 
(2013: £2.6 million) and the interest income from bank deposits 
and other loans and receivables amounted to £0.7 million 
(2013: £0.7 million). In addition, the net finance expense 
includes the interest cost on the net liabilities of the pension 
scheme of £1.4 million (2013: £2.1 million) and £0.7 million 
(2013: £Nil) unwind of discount on deferred consideration.
Tax
The Group’s effective rate of tax was 7.1% of the profit 
before tax (2013: 3.1%). The lower than normal rate of tax 
arose owing to tax relief on the sale of shareholdings in 
PFI assets, Research and Development tax relief claims, timing 
differences not previously recognised as deferred tax assets, 
and the effect on the brought-forward deferred tax balances 
of the reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 20%.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year 
of 6.25 pence per share (2013: 7.75 pence per share) to bring 
the total for the year to 9.5 pence per share (2013: 11.5 pence 
per share). The reduction in dividend per share is due to the 
increase in the number of shares as a result of the new capital 
raised during the year.
In accordance with the pension deficit recovery plan agreed 
with the Trustee of the CPS, the Group will make an additional 
cash contribution to the pension scheme to match the total 
deficit contribution to the total amount of dividends paid 
to shareholders.
Shareholders’ equity
Shareholders’ equity increased in the year to £110.8 million 
(2013: £43.3 million). The profit for the year amounted to 
£21.0 million and other comprehensive expenses to £16.1 million. 
The movements are detailed in the consolidated statements 
of comprehensive income and expense and changes in equity 
in the financial statements. The most significant change to 
shareholders’ equity resulted from the capital raise completed 
during the year. 
Pensions
As at 31 December 2014, the Group’s pension scheme deficit in 
accordance with IAS 19, net of deferred tax, was £33.4 million 
(2013: £29.4 million). The scheme deficit position has increased 
primarily as a result of a reduction in the discount rate used 
to calculate the liabilities offset by a decrease in the assumed 
inflation rate, the return on assets and company contributions.
As part of the ongoing actions to manage the Group’s pension 
obligations, in 2014, the Group transferred its interest in two PFI 
investments into the CPS at a value agreed with the Trustee of 
the scheme of £7.4 million. 
In the year, agreement was reached with the Trustee of the CPS 
regarding the triennial actuarial review as at 31 March 2013 and 
the associated deficit recovery plan. As anticipated, the annual 
cash contribution to the scheme deficit has been agreed at 
£7.0 million per annum (increasing annually with inflation) plus an 
additional contribution to bring the total contributions to match 
the total dividend amount paid by the Company over the next 
three years.

review 
continued Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
Cash flow and borrowings
The Group has a positive cash balance, which was 
£148.5 million as at 31 December 2014 (2013: £84.3 million) and 
no borrowings (2013: £26.6 million), this included cash held by 
joint operations of £24.1 million (2013: £25.6 million).
As set out in the consolidated cash flow statement, the Group 
had a positive operating cash flow, together with outflows 
for payment of dividends and pension deficit contributions. 
The cash balance was enhanced by the £70.3 million 
capital raising completed during the year. The average 
month-end net cash balance during 2014 was £95.6 million 
(2013: £50.7 million).
Contract bonding and banking facilities
The Group’s long-term contracting business is dependent 
on it being able to supply performance and other bonds 
as necessary. This means maintaining adequate facilities 
from banks and surety bond providers to meet the current 
and projected usage requirements. The Group has contract 
bonding and banking facilities of £495 million with a 
maturity date of 30 June 2017 with its relationship banks and 
surety companies.
Treasury
The Group’s treasury and funding activities are undertaken 
by a centralised treasury function. Its primary activities are 
to manage the Group’s liquidity, funding and financial risk, 
principally arising from movements in interest rates and foreign 
currency exchange rates.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that adequate liquidity and 
financial resources are available to support the Group’s growth 
development, while managing these risks. The Group’s policy 
is not to engage in speculative transactions. Group Treasury 
operates as a service centre within clearly defined objectives 
and controls and is subject to periodic review by internal audit.
Liquidity risk
The Group finances its operations primarily by a mixture of 
working capital, funds from shareholders, retained profits and 
borrowings. The Directors regularly monitor cash usage and 
forecast usage to ensure that projected financing needs are 
supported by adequate cash reserves or bank facilities.

Foreign currency exposure
Translation exposure: the results of the Group’s overseas 
activities, mainly non-core Land Development in Spain, are 
translated into sterling at rates approximating to the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries and investments 
are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date.
Transaction exposure: the Group has small transactional 
currency exposures arising from subsidiaries’ commercial 
activities overseas and from overseas supply purchases for 
business in the UK. Where appropriate, the Group requires its 
subsidiaries to use forward currency contracts to minimise any 
currency exposure unless a natural hedge exists elsewhere 
within the Group.
Interest rate risks and exposure
The Group enters into financial instruments, where necessary, 
to finance its operations. Various financial instruments (for 
example, trade receivables and trade payables) arise directly 
from the Group’s operations.
The main exposure to interest rate fluctuations within 
the Group’s operations arises from surplus cash, which is 
generally deposited with the Group’s relationship banks, and 
bank borrowings.

Chairman’s summary statement
Dear Shareholder
As Chairman, I am accountable for corporate governance 
at Costain.
Our Board is ultimately responsible for the success of the 
business and we are committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance to enable us to continue to achieve 
our vision of being one of the UK’s leading engineering 
solutions providers. Our role is to create a robust governance 
framework that encourages transparency and accountability, 
combined with a meticulous and efficient approach to internal 
control and risk management.
I lead a team that is diverse across a range of measures, 
including skills, experience, gender and nationality. 
In May 2014, we further strengthened our Board with 
the appointment of David McManus, whilst in April 2014 
Alison Wood, who had been appointed to the Board in 
February 2014, became Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
following the retirement of Mike Alexander. My focus 
continues to be on maintaining a strong team.
In keeping with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’), we carried out an externally 
facilitated evaluation of the Board’s performance in 2014. 
This was conducted by way of personal interviews and detailed 
questionnaires. Further details can be found on page 50 of the 
Corporate Governance report.
In addition, the Board undertook wide-ranging discussions 
on key strategic issues and this included a number of Board 
workshops attended by members of the Executive Board and 
third-party advisers. These conversations continued to be 
focused on implementing our unique and evolving ’Engineering 
Tomorrow‘ strategy, including the ongoing consideration of 
potential in-fill acquisitions to complement Costain’s existing 
capabilities as opportunities arise. A business plan was 
approved in December 2014. 
The following pages discuss in more detail the Board’s 
various activities during the year, explaining how the various 
committees govern our approval and operating procedures.

specific term because the Company’s two major shareholders 
are entitled to appoint a Non-Executive Director for so long 
as they each hold 7% of the then issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company, as detailed on page 50 of this Corporate

The biographies illustrate that the Non-Executive Directors 
have a range of business and financial experience that is 
important and relevant to the management of the Company. 
The Board believes that there is an appropriate balance 
between Executives and Non-Executives and that this 
balance is enhanced by the varying lengths of service of the 
Non-Executive Directors depicted in the pie-chart above.
The Board recognises the importance of greater diversity (not 
just gender specific) in the boardroom and throughout the 
business, further details of which are given in the Nomination 
Committee report on page 58.
The Directors’ attendance record at the scheduled Board 
meetings and Board Committee meetings for the year ended 
31 December 2014 is shown in the table below. For the Board 
and Committee meetings, attendance is expressed as the 
number of meetings that each Director attended out of the 
number that they were eligible to attend. In addition, ad-hoc 
meetings were arranged to deal with matters between the 
scheduled meetings as appropriate.
Board independence
The Board considers each of its independent Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent in character and judgment and 
there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely 
to affect (or could appear to affect) the judgment of such 
Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee continues to review succession on 
a regular basis.
At the time of his original appointment in January 2008, the 
Chairman of the Company was considered independent by the 
Board. However, in accordance with the Code, the ongoing test 
of independence is not applicable in relation to the Chairman.
The Company complies with the requirement under provision 
B.1.2 of the Code that at least half of the Board, excluding 
the Chairman, should comprise Non-Executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent, notwithstanding 
that this requirement is waived in respect of smaller companies, 
such as the Company, which are members of the FTSE 
SmallCap Index.
Appointments to the Board and retirement 
of Directors
Alison Wood was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director on 1 February 2014 and succeeded Mike Alexander as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee upon his retirement from 
the Board on 31 March 2014. David McManus was appointed to 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 12 May 2014.
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed 
by the Company’s Articles of Association, the Code, the 
Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The Articles 
of Association may be amended by a special resolution of 
the Company’s shareholders. The Company’s Articles of 
Association require that all Directors, including nominee 
Non-Executive Directors, should be subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment 
and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no more than three 
years. The Company’s Articles of Association also provide that 
Non-Executive Directors who have served for longer than nine 
years should be subject to annual re-election. Accordingly, 
the aforementioned provisions of the Company’s Articles 
of Association comply with provision B.7.1 of the Code, as 
applicable to smaller companies below the FTSE 350.

50 Governance: Corporate Governance report
Board effectiveness
The Board has established a formal process for the evaluation 
of the performance of the Board and its principal Committees.
An externally facilitated Board review was conducted between 
November 2014 and January 2015 by SCT Consultants Ltd 
(who, having no other connection with the Company, were 
considered to be independent). The process involved the 
completion of detailed online questionnaires by all Board 
members and the Company Secretary, observation of a 
Board meeting, document review and interviews with Board 
members and the Company Secretary.
The results of the evaluation were discussed at the February 
2015 Nomination Committee meeting attended by all Board 
members and the Board has already started to formulate the 
necessary actions in order to focus on the perceived areas 
of improvement and will continue to review its procedures, 
effectiveness and development in the financial year ahead.
The Board considers that the performance review shows that 
each Director continues to contribute effectively and the 
Board as a whole demonstrates good practice on the key 
indicators of Board effectiveness.   
The next independently facilitated review is expected to 
take place in 2016/17 in accordance with provision B.6.2 of 
the Code, notwithstanding that this requirement is waived in 
respect of smaller companies, such as the Company, which 
are members of the FTSE SmallCap Index.
Re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association 
and provision B.7.1 of the Code, David Allvey, Andrew Wyllie 
and David McManus will offer themselves for re-election 
at the next Annual General Meeting. Having due regard to 
the results of the externally facilitated review of the Board’s 
performance conducted by SCT Consultants Ltd, and to 
periodic internal evaluations, the Board confirms that it is of 
the opinion that each of the Directors standing for re-election 
continues to make an effective and valuable contribution 
to the Board and should therefore be re-elected at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors all have terms 
and conditions of appointment which are available for 
inspection during normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered office.
An independent Non-Executive Director’s appointment 
is for an initial period of three years, at the expiry of which 
time the appointment is reviewed to determine whether the 
appointment should continue. Mohammed Abdulmohsin 
AI-Kharafi & Sons Company for General Trading, General 
Contracting and Industrial Services WLL and the other major 
shareholder UEM Builders Berhad are each entitled to appoint 
a Non-Executive Director for so long as these shareholders 
each hold 7% of the aggregate nominal value of the then issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company. UEM Builders Berhad 
has not taken advantage of this option since 4 December 2009. 
In consequence, the Company did not comply with provision 
B.2.3 of the Code, which requires that all Non-Executive 
Directors should be appointed for a specific term.
Board induction and training
On appointment, the Directors take part in an induction 
programme, pursuant to which they receive information about 
the Group, the role of the Board and the matters reserved for 
its decision, the terms of reference and membership of the 
principal Board Committees and the powers delegated to 
the Committees, the Group’s corporate governance practices 
and procedures, and the latest financial information about 
the Group.
As regards the continuing professional development of the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, Board members, 
independent of any formal training arranged by the Company, 
are encouraged to attend seminars and conferences on issues 
relevant to their appointment as Directors of a public company, 
particularly matters concerned with corporate governance, 
audit and remuneration issues. In addition, Board site visits are 
considered essential to ensure that Directors have a thorough 
understanding of the business operations and issues that affect 
the Group. The Board also takes part in the Company’s Health 
and Safety training programmes.

Operation of the Board
In order to discharge their duties, the Directors are provided 
with full and timely access to papers prior to Board meetings 
via a fully encrypted electronic portal system. Directors are 
also free to seek any further information they consider 
necessary. In addition, between Board meetings, the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have access to the 
Chief Executive, Finance Director and Company Secretary 
in order to progress the Company’s business. The Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors also receive a weekly report 
from the Chief Executive, monthly management accounts, 
internal audit reports and regular management reports and 
information, which enable them to scrutinise the Group and 
its management’s performance against agreed objectives.
All Board members have access to all information relating 
to the Group and have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary (who is responsible for ensuring 
that Board procedures are followed) and who is also 
the Company’s Legal Director. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved 
for Board approval. The Board also obtains advice from 
professional advisers as and when required at the expense 
of the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Company has procedures in place for managing conflicts 
of interest. The Board has satisfied itself that there is no 
compromise to the independence of the Directors who 
have appointments on the boards of, or relationships with, 
other companies. The Board requires Directors to declare 
all appointments which could result in a possible conflict of 
interest and has adopted appropriate processes to manage 
and, if appropriate, approve any such conflict.
Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
The Board receives reports from the Company’s CR Director 
and monitors progress on a regular basis.
Shareholder communication and 
engagement
The Company remains committed to maintaining good 
relationships with both institutional and private shareholders. 
There continues to be regular dialogue with institutional 
investors and brokers.
Towards the end of 2014, the Group’s CR Director was also 
appointed as the Investor Relations Director, reflecting the 
Company’s continued commitment to investor relations.
At the time of the announcement of the full-year and half-year 
results, presentations are made to brokers’ analysts, the press 
and institutional investors. These presentations are available on 
the Company’s website at www.costain.com. In addition, there 
are meetings with analysts, financial journalists and institutional 
investors throughout the year including a ‘Capital Markets Day’ 
held on 5 November 2014. 
The Chairman is available to discuss strategy and governance 
issues with shareholders, and James Morley, as the Senior 
Independent Director, is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that have not been, or cannot be, addressed through 
the Chairman.
The Company obtains feedback from its brokers, Investec and 
Liberum Capital, on the views of institutional investors on a 
non-attributed basis. As a matter of routine, the Board reviews 
reports from its brokers on issues relating to recent share 
price performance, trading activity and institutional sentiment. 
The Board also receives copies of relevant analysts’ reports on 
an ad-hoc basis.
The Board regards the Annual General Meeting as an important 
opportunity to communicate directly with shareholders. 
Board members, including the Chairs of the Remuneration, 
Nomination and Audit Committees, attended the 2014 meeting 
and propose attending the 2015 meeting where they will be 
available to answer questions.
Shareholders may raise issues or concerns by contacting the 
Group’s Investor Relations Director via the email address 
stated on the Company’s website or by writing to the 
Company Secretary. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
52 Governance: Corporate Governance report
Risk management and internal control
Risk management
The Board is responsible for making a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Company and for ensuring that 
appropriate mitigating actions are in place to manage them. 
The principal risk and uncertainties facing the Company at 
the date of this report can be found on pages 28 to 30 of the 
Strategic report.
Risk management processes are incorporated within the 
Company’s normal management and governance processes 
at all levels and form an integral part of the day-to-day activity 
of the Company. For example, at the pre-bid stage, a risk 
appetite document is used to determine whether to pursue an 
opportunity or not. Risks are also identified as part of the work 
winning process , including a pre-qualification and pre-tender 
review process for obtaining approval to bid a project from 
the Investments Committee. Following contract award, there 
is a continuous review of risks and opportunities by both the 
contract leader and commercial manager. These are updated 
on a monthly basis and the top five risks and opportunities are 
reviewed by Group senior management.
The Company also has a corporate risk and opportunity 
register, which is monitored and updated regularly by the 
Group Executive Board, as well as sector business risk 
registers. The Board and Audit Committee receive reports on 
the Company’s main corporate risks and opportunities. 
The risk management strategy is regularly reviewed and the 
Group’s risks and opportunities compared against those of 
other blue-chip companies. The Group reviews any changes 
in moving into new markets, such as its recent move into 
technology contracts, and attempts to identify any emerging 
risks and possible effects on the business. 
Internal Audit provides independent assurance that risks 
inherent to the Company’s business processes are reasonably 
controlled and assists management in assessing those risks 
and how effectively they are managed by internal controls. 
Internal Audit also promotes best practice in risk management 
processes to ensure delivery of corporate objectives.
In 2014, Internal Audit conducted project and departmental 
reviews to appraise and report on the effectiveness of the risk 
management processes. All reviews carried out were subject 
to appropriate follow-up action to provide assurance that 
accepted recommendations have been implemented effectively. 
The overall assessment is that there is a strong risk management 
culture within the Group which is continuing to develop.
The Board also assesses the effectiveness of the Group’s 
reporting controls to ensure that the Group’s risk profile reflects 
its strategic objectives.
Internal controls system
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system, 
however, can only manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board maintains full control over strategic, financial, 
operational and compliance issues. Management of the Group 
is delegated to the Chief Executive, who is assisted by members 
of the Executive Board. The Chief Executive has full authority 
to act subject to the matters reserved to the Board and to the 
requirements of Group policies.
Following the introduction in 2013 of ‘the Costain Way’, a 
common platform which contains all governance, controls, 
policies and procedures, the Company has further fine-tuned 
the control environment and delivered training to its users.
The effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems are regularly reviewed by the 
Board, in compliance with the Code and such a review was 
undertaken during the year. The review covered all controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls and 
risk management.

Operational controls
Controls and procedures are detailed in Group policy 
statements, procedure manuals and other written instructions, 
which are reviewed and updated regularly.
The Company uses an operational management system (‘the 
Costain Way’). The objective of the Costain Way is to provide 
assurance that:
• Company activities across the business are compliant with 
appropriate legislation and codes of practice;
• Company systems, procedures and processes are effective 
at mitigating identified risks;
• customer expectations are understood, communicated and 
effectively delivered;
• management controls are consistently applied across the 
Group; and
• performance is reviewed, validated and 
continually improved.
The Costain Way has been externally certified by BSi as 
compliant to ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 22301, 
ISO 27001 and BS 11000.
Each contract leader completes monthly reports, that include 
information on safety, health and environmental statistics, 
cash flow, value, cost and profit, claims and variations, risk 
management, progress and staffing levels. All projects 
operate within a controlled framework of best practice, 
safety, health and environmental guidelines and the project 
management team monitors, and the safety, health and 
environmental advisers audit, compliance with, and execution 
of, those guidelines.
The Board and Group Executive Board receive regular 
reports on safety, health and environmental performance 
and significant operational matters. The Group Executive 
Board is responsible for ensuring compliance with Company 
procedures. The Chief Executive is the Board member 
responsible for Health and Safety.
Financial controls
There is a comprehensive annual budgeting system, linked to 
the annual strategy review, for each business within the Group. 
The budget for the following year is reviewed and finalised by 
the Executive Board, alongside the three-year business plan, 
before final approval by the Board in December.
The Company also has in place internal controls and risk 
management systems in relation to the Company’s financial 
reporting process and the Group’s process for preparation of 
consolidated accounts. These internal controls are designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external reporting purposes. The Company produces a 
monthly rolling forecast update for the current year which is 
compared with the annual budget. Each division’s performance 
is reviewed monthly by management and reported against 
budget to the Board and Executive Board. The reports cover 
profit and loss and cash flow with an accompanying narrative on 
significant issues underlying the financial reports. Furthermore, 
a review of the consolidated financial statements is completed 
by management to ensure that the financial position and results 
of the Group are appropriately reflected therein. The Group 
Treasurer and Group Taxation Manager also report to the 
Audit Committee, via the Finance Director, on any issues of 
significance to the Group.
Compliance
The Group’s policies contain a statement on business 
conduct, emphasising the legal, ethical and moral standards 
that must be employed in all the Company’s business 
dealings. This statement is regularly reviewed and updated 
as appropriate to ensure compliance with any change in 
legislation. The Company expects the highest standards from 
all employees, suppliers and joint venture partners.
In the event of a critical legal issue, a legal report is submitted 
to the Board. An annual review of all litigation valued 
above £50,000 is submitted to, and reviewed by, the Board. 
Significant legal and regulatory changes are notified to the 
appropriate staff and training given where necessary. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
54 Governance: Audit Committee report
Operation of the Committee 
The Committee is comprised exclusively of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The members of the Committee and 
details of their attendance at meetings are given on page 49. 
Biographies are shown on pages 46 to 47.
The Company considers that it has in Jane Lodge, as Chair 
of the Audit Committee, an appropriate person possessing 
what the FRC’s Guidance on Audit Committees describes 
as recent and relevant financial experience. Prior to joining 
the Costain Board, Jane, a chartered accountant, spent 35 
years at Deloitte LLP (UK), with 25 years as an audit partner 
advising global companies, particularly in the manufacturing, 
house-building and property and construction sectors. She was 
also senior partner of the Birmingham office and the Deloitte UK 
Manufacturing Industry Sector.
The meetings of the Committee are normally also attended by 
the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the 
External Auditor, the Head of Internal Audit and the Group 
Financial Controller. Other senior executives will attend as 
required to provide information on matters being discussed 
which fall into their area of responsibility. The Committee 
regularly meets privately with the External Auditor and Head 
of Internal Audit. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to 
the Committee.
Terms of reference
The Committee’s terms of reference are available from the 
Company Secretary and are published on the Company’s 
website at www.costain.com. These are reviewed annually and 
some minor changes were made in 2014.
Chairman’s summary statement 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to take this opportunity, on behalf of the 
Board, to present our report on the work of the Audit 
Committee (‘the Committee’) in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2014. 
In this report, we have set out the Committee’s ongoing 
responsibilities and key tasks undertaken over the last year 
including reviewing the appropriateness of the Company’s 
financial reporting, the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal controls systems, together with the 
robustness of the internal and external audit process.
Looking ahead, the Committee welcomes the changes to 
the revised UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) 
and the Financial Reporting Council’s (‘the FRC’) Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting issued in September 2014. 
These changes apply to accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 October 2014 and the Company has started to monitor 
the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 
on an ongoing basis and a robust assessment of principal risks 
facing the Company will continue to be an area of focus.

Significant accounting matters 
The Committee considered key accounting issues, matters and 
judgments in relation to the Group’s financial statements and 
disclosures relating to:
(1) Key contract judgments
As more fully explained in Note 2, on pages 92 to 98, the 
majority of the Group’s activities are undertaken via long-term 
contracts and these contracts are accounted for in accordance 
with IAS 11, which requires estimates to be made for contract 
costs and revenues. These costs and revenues may be affected 
by a number of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of 
future events and may need to be revised as events unfold and 
uncertainties are resolved.
Management bases its judgments of costs and revenues and 
its assessment of the expected outcome of each long-term 
contractual obligation using detailed contract valuations 
and forecast of the costs to complete. Given the Company’s 
extensive portfolio of contracts, a large proportion of time 
was spent by the Committee during the year reviewing the 
positions and judgments taken by management on a number of 
material contracts across the Group, through discussions with 
management and the External Auditor. 
This review included inter alia consideration of the Manchester 
Waste Disposal Authority PFI contract awarded in 2007. 
The Committee noted that during December 2014, handover 
was achieved on the final waste facility. All 46 facilities on the 
contract are now either fully completed or in the warranty 
period under the terms of the contract, during which some 
further work and plant modifications will be completed. In  
achieving handover of the final facility, the Group received in 
December 2014 contractual retention and milestone payments 
of £14 million. It was also noted that the Group is in discussions 
with relevant contract counterparties and the Group’s insurers 
regarding the issues that have arisen on the contract. The Board 
expects a successful outcome to these discussions. During the 
year, a provision has been taken for additional costs to complete 
the project. It has been the Group’s policy since 2009 not to 
pursue fixed-price contracts of this nature.
On the basis of these reviews, the Committee concluded that it 
was content with the judgments that had been made.
Role of the Audit Committee
In accordance with its terms of reference and in compliance 
with the Code, the Committee is responsible for:
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
and any formal announcement relating to the Group’s 
performance, and reviewing significant financial judgments 
contained in them;
• monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit process 
and making recommendations to the Board in relation to 
the appointment, reappointment and remuneration of the 
External Auditor;
• ensuring that an appropriate relationship between the 
Group and the External Auditor is maintained, including 
reviewing non-audit services and fees;
• reviewing the Group’s system of internal controls and the 
processes for management of the risks facing the Group;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function 
and approving, in consultation with the Chief Executive, the 
appointment and termination of employment of the head of 
that function; and
• reviewing its terms of reference and its effectiveness from 
time to time and recommending to the Board any changes 
required as a result of the review.
Principal activities during the year 
In 2014, the principal activities of the Committee and the 
manner in which it discharged its responsibilities were 
as follows:
Financial statements
The Committee reviewed the Group’s draft financial 
statements, preliminary and interim results and reports from 
the External Auditor, on the outcome of its reviews and audits 
in 2014. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
56 Governance: Audit Committee report
Independence of the External Auditor
The Company’s External Auditor is KPMG LLP (“KPMG”).
In order to ensure the independence and objectivity of the 
External Auditor, the Committee monitors the non-audit 
services being provided to the Group by its External Auditor, 
and has adopted a policy on the provision of non-audit services 
by the External Auditor with the objective of ensuring that such 
services do not impair the independence or objectivity of the 
External Auditor.
The policy also sets out a number of key principles that underpin 
the provision of non-audit services by the External Auditor: 
the External Auditor should not audit its own firm’s work; 
make management decisions for the Group; have a mutuality 
of financial interest with the Group; or be put in the role of 
advocate for the Group.
Approval of the Committee is required for any services provided 
by the External Auditor where the fee is likely to be in excess of 
£25,000. The Committee reviews all services being provided by 
the External Auditor annually to assess the independence and 
objectivity of the External Auditor, taking into consideration 
relevant performance and regulatory requirements, so 
that those are not impaired by the provision of permissible 
non-audit services.
In 2014, the External Auditor performed non-audit services 
in reporting on working capital in connection with the capital 
raising. The External Auditor was selected as the most 
cost-effective and efficient supplier to undertake these services 
based on their thorough understanding of the Group and their 
particular expertise. In the financial year, the Company spent 
£0.4 million (2013: £1.7 million) with the External Auditor in 
respect of non-audit fees.
In accordance with best practice and professional standards, 
the Company also requires its External Auditor to adhere to 
a rotation policy whereby the audit engagement partner is 
rotated after five years. The External Auditor is also required 
to periodically assess whether, in its professional opinion, 
it is independent and those views are shared with the 
Audit Committee.
The Senior Statutory Auditor (who has signed the Audit report 
on behalf of KPMG on page 82) is Mr Andrew Marshall who was 
appointed as the lead audit partner at the beginning of 2013.
(2) Pension
The Group’s defined benefit scheme requires significant 
judgments in relation to the assumptions for inflation, future 
pension increases, investment returns and member longevity 
that underpin the valuation. Each year, in selecting the 
appropriate assumptions, the Committee takes written advice 
from an independent qualified actuary. The assumptions and 
sensitivities are set out in Note 20 on pages 120 to 123.
(3) The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
As set out in Note 11 on page 107, the goodwill and acquired 
intangible balances within the Group relate to the acquisition 
of companies. During the year ended 31 December 2014, 
the Committee critically reviewed the analysis performed by 
management on goodwill and intangibles and agreed with 
the amortisation charge in respect of intangibles and that no 
impairment to goodwill was necessary.
(4) Alcaidesa Holding SA
The Committee has reviewed the net realisable value of each 
of the land holdings in Spain held by the Group’s 50:50 joint 
venture. The Committee addressed this issue by considering 
the report from management on the review carried out 
of the net realisable value of each of the land holdings in 
Spain and of the carrying value of the marina assets, and 
the golf courses including the use of external valuations. 
The Committee agreed that no further impairment should be 
taken against the assets of the joint venture.
(5) Cash flow and working capital
The Group’s processes for the management of cash flow 
and working capital is also an area which the Committee has 
reviewed in detail, particularly in view of the capital raising 
which took place in March 2014. The Committee concluded 
that it was satisfied with these processes. 
(6) Future IFRS and UK GAAP developments
During the year, the Committee received a management 
report from the External Auditor regarding future accounting 
developments likely to affect the presentation of the Group’s 
financial statements including capitalisation of operating 
leases and revenue recognition on long-term contracts.

Risk management and internal controls
Details of the Group’s internal controls and risk management 
are more fully set out on pages 52 to 53 of the Corporate 
Governance report.
The Committee has evaluated the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls and risk management operated within the 
Group pursuant to the FRC’s guidance on internal control. 
The evaluation covered all controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management.
The Committee has also considered the confidential reporting 
and whistle blowing procedures the Company has in place and 
is satisfied with the process. 
Internal audit
The Group has an internally resourced internal audit function 
reporting directly to the Committee. The Committee is 
responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and 
effectiveness of this function. During the year, the Committee 
undertook an internal assessment of the effectiveness and 
independence of the internal audit function.
The Committee has received regular reports on the programme 
and findings of reviews at each of its meetings during the course 
of the year and action plans to resolve any highlighted areas. 
The Company has decided to create a new role of Group 
Risk Manager who will be responsible for the management 
of risk across the Group and will be accountable directly to 
the Committee.
Accountability
The Board is required to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s financial 
position and prospects. The responsibilities of the Directors 
and External Auditor are set out on pages 79 to 82. As set out 
in the Director’s report, the Directors consider the Company’s 
business is a going concern.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the independence 
of the External Auditor is not impaired given the audit 
engagement partner has recently changed and that the 
amount of non-audit fees are of a level that does not impact 
upon KPMG’s objectivity and independence.
Audit quality and approach to audit tender
As part of a formal review process, external audit 
effectiveness questionnaires are completed by members of 
the Committee, the Executive Directors, other members of 
the Executive Board Committee and certain members of the 
finance team. Based on the responses to the questionnaires, 
the Company Secretary produces a report for detailed 
consideration by the Committee.
Based on its consideration of the report, together with its own 
ongoing assessment, for example, through the quality of the 
External Auditor’s reports and the audit partner’s interaction 
with the Committee, the Committee remains satisfied with the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit.
The Committee has not therefore considered it necessary 
to require the audit to be put out to tender. The Committee 
continues to be satisfied with the work of the External Auditor, 
considers that it remains objective and independent and has 
unanimously recommended to the Board that a resolution 
for the reappointment of KPMG as the Company’s External 
Auditor be proposed to shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
The Committee recognises the requirements in the 2012 
Code that the External Audit contract be put out to tender at 
least every ten years, notwithstanding that this requirement is 
waived in respect of smaller companies, such as the Company, 
which are members of the FTSE SmallCap Index. In addition, 
the Committee has also discussed the new EU regulation in 
relation to rotation including the proposed transition rules 
and has considered the potential optimum timing for a tender 
of the External Audit. The lead audit partner was not present 
during such discussions. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
58 Governance: Nomination Committee report
Dear Shareholder
The Nomination Committee (‘the Committee’) is comprised 
exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The members of the Committee and details of their 
attendance at Committee meetings are given on page 49. 
Biographies are shown on pages 46 to 47.
Role of the Committee
The principal role of the Committee is to review the structure 
and composition of the Board and to identify and propose to 
the Board suitable candidates to fill Board vacancies.
The Committee directs the periodic Board effectiveness 
reviews, both internal and external, which forms part of 
the regular evaluation and development work conducted 
by the Board to ensure it continues to improve its overall 
effectiveness. The Committee also reviews management 
training and succession planning arrangements in respect 
of the Company’s senior executives. The Company Secretary 
is the Secretary of the Committee.
The Board aims to have a broad range of skills, backgrounds 
and experience whilst following a policy of ensuring that 
the best people are appointed. Within this context, and as 
part of the ongoing process of refreshing the Board, the 
Company will continue to encourage and welcome interest 
from candidates drawn from a diverse background, who will 
add to the Board’s diversity.
As reported last year, with effect from 1 February 2014, 
Alison Wood was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and 
became Chair of the Remuneration Committee with effect 
from 1 April 2014 upon the retirement from the Board of 
Mike Alexander. 
With effect from 12 May 2014, David McManus was appointed 
to the Board as a Non-Executive Director. The Committee 
instructed Odgers Berndtson (who do not have any other 
connection with the Company) to identify appropriate 
external candidates, and after meetings with shortlisted 
candidates, the Committee identified David McManus as a 
suitable appointee and recommended his appointment to the 
Board. David brings considerable experience to his role and 
enhances the skill set of the Board as a whole.
Main activities during the year 
In 2014, the Committee discharged its responsibilities by 
performing the following activities:
• Reviewing the overall structure and composition of the Board;
• Commissioning an independent external review of Board 
effectiveness, facilitated by SCT Consultants Ltd (‘SCT’), which 
concluded in December 2014. Following the completion of 
a questionnaire, each member of the Board was interviewed 
individually on a confidential basis by SCT and the results of 
the external review were then discussed by the Nomination 
Committee. Further details of this review can be found on 
page 50 of the Corporate Governance report;
• Reviewing potential candidates for the position of 
Non-Executive Director and making recommendations to 
the Board as to their appointment;
• Receiving notifications from Directors of situations, such as 
proposed external appointments, in which a potential conflict 
of interest may arise;
• Reviewing/recommending to the Board the reappointment 
of those Directors who are due to offer themselves for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting in accordance 
with the Articles of Association, following due consideration 
of the Board’s policy on independence and the results of 
periodic Board performance reviews; 
• Reviewing succession planning in respect of the 
Executive Directors; and
• Reviewing succession planning and development of talent 
in respect of the Company’s senior executives.

Directors’ remuneration  
report
“We continue to 
take a disciplined 
approach to ensure 
that our remuneration 
framework supports the strategic 
direction of the Company”.
Alison Wood, Chair of the Remuneration Committee
• To encourage behaviours which facilitate the delivery of 
sustainable growth and the future development of the 
business, allowing us to meet our business goal of delivering 
value to all our stakeholders:
 –  the performance metrics for our AIP aim to balance earnings 
growth and other key financial objectives (including cash 
and order book targets) with non-financial indicators, 
particularly Health and Safety targets and specific 
individual objectives; 
 –  a third of any AIP award earned is deferred into shares to 
ensure that executives consider the longer term impacts 
of their decisions and the effect on the sustainability of 
the business; 
 –  our Long-Term Incentive plan (‘LTIP’) captures long-term 
growth in earnings. An additional two years’ deferral 
on half the LTIP was introduced last year to support 
longer-term alignment between Executive Directors  
and shareholders; and 
 –  the performance targets are set to reward sustainable 
business performance, whilst not encouraging inappropriate 
business risks to be taken;
• To support our goal to develop a best-in-class team, our 
remuneration policy is designed to attract and retain 
high-calibre individuals in an increasingly competitive market 
and to remunerate executives fairly and responsibly.
Chairman’s summary statement
Dear Shareholder
I became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (‘the 
Committee’) with effect from 1 April 2014, having been a 
member since joining the Company’s Board in February 2014. 
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, our 
Directors’ remuneration report in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2014.
Remuneration Policy
Last year, we made a number of changes to our Executive 
Director remuneration framework in order to simplify the 
structure and shift the balance of Executives’ incentives 
towards the long-term without increasing the overall level 
of incentive pay. These changes were set out in our Policy 
report which was subject to a binding vote at our 2014 
AGM. We were pleased that the Policy report was approved 
by shareholders with a 97% vote in favour (including 
discretionary votes). 
During 2014, we have not made any significant changes to 
our remuneration arrangements and we continue to take 
a disciplined approach to ensure that our remuneration 
framework supports the strategic direction of the Company 
and the implementation of our ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ 
strategy. 
The following is an overview of how our remuneration policy 
supports the strategic priorities of the business as set out on 
pages 20 to 25 of the Strategic report:
• The Health and Safety of our people and everyone who 
is involved with Costain remains our highest priority. 
Accordingly, the performance metrics for our Annual 
Incentive Plan (‘AIP’) includes a key non-financial indicator 
around Health and Safety targets;  Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
60 Governance: Directors’ remuneration report
Conclusion
The following pages describe in further detail how we have 
implemented our remuneration policy in respect of 2014, 
together with our approach for 2015. 
The Policy report approved last year will remain in force. 
We have therefore published the Policy table but not the full 
Policy section, recognising that it was approved by shareholders 
at our 2014 AGM. The Policy report in its entirety is available on 
our website in the 2013 Annual Report.
Overall, given the Company’s performance over the one- and 
three-year periods to the end of the 2014 financial year, we 
believe that the remuneration of the Executive Directors in 
respect of 2014 reflects our success in the delivery of our 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy and the drive for long-term 
growth for our shareholders.

Chair of the Remuneration Committee

Remuneration disclosure
This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. It also meets the requirements of the UK 
Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
It is unaudited unless otherwise stated. In this report we describe how 
the principles of good governance relating to Directors’ remuneration, as 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’), are applied 
in practice. The Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) confirms 
that throughout the financial year the Company has complied with these 
governance rules and best practice provisions.
The report is in two sections:
•  Extract from the Policy report. This section contains the policy table 
summarising the remuneration policy approved at the 2014 AGM and is 
for information only.
•   The Annual Report on Remuneration. This section sets out details of 
how our remuneration policy was implemented for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and how we intend for the policy to apply for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 and is the subject of an advisory 
shareholder vote.
Performance and variable pay outcomes for the year 
ended 31 December 2014
As described in the Strategic report, the Company continues 
to perform strongly delivering profitable earnings growth 
and strong progress against the Company’s key strategic 
priorities. The key highlights are as follows:
• Revenue increased to £1.1 billion (2013: £960.0 million)
• Underlying operating profit up to £28.7 million 
(2013: £27.4 million)
• Net cash balance of £148.5 million (2013: £57.7 million)
• Record forward order book up 17% to £3.5 billion 
(2013: £3.0 billion) 
• Over £1.0 billion of revenue secured for 2015, (as at 
31 December 2013: over £750 million secured for 2014) 
The performance targets set for both the AIP and LTIP 
represent a significant stretch. Taking into account the 
performance achieved during the year, AIP payments 
to Executive Directors were 71.6% and 75.3% of the 
maximum AIP opportunity for the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director respectively. Further rationale for these 
payments can be found on pages 66 to 67. 
The LTIP award granted on 9 May 2012 was based on 
performance to the year ended 31 December 2014 and is due 
to vest in May 2015 (subject to the Committee’s determination 
that the performance conditions have been met) at 50% of 
maximum, in light of aggregate adjusted EPS of 107.7 pence 
delivered over the performance period. 
Reward changes for 2015
No changes are being made to our reward framework in 2015.
We approved salary increases for the Executive Directors of 
2.5% after carefully considering their performance, the range 
of salary increases awarded to other employees and market 
reference points.

• The Committee considers and approves the 
measures and targets at the start of each year 
and ensures they are aligned with business

• Financial metrics comprise at least three quarters 
of AIP opportunity, of which at least half will be a 
measure of Group profit.
• In addition to these financial metrics, the 
AIP includes Health and Safety targets and 
personal objectives.
• In setting financial parameters, the Committee 
takes into account the Company’s internal 
budgets and, where applicable, investors’ 
expectations. The targets applying to financial 
measures are based on a sliding scale.
• Two-thirds paid in cash.
• Not pensionable.
• Deferral into shares of one third of earned AIP; 
this vests on the second anniversary of grant 
(subject to continued employment and not being 
under notice of termination, either given or 
received, on the date of vesting).
• Shares provided under the AIP are typically 
purchased by a trust on behalf of the Group so as 
to not lead to any dilution of shareholder interest.
• Awards may be subject to clawback if the 
Committee becomes aware of a material 
misstatement to the audited accounts, an 
error in calculation of targets resulting in an 
overpayment, gross misconduct or criminal 
behaviour on the part of a participant.

• Annual grant of performance shares, half of which 
vest after three years subject to continued service 
and performance targets, and half of which vest 
after five years (the final two years being subject 
only to continued service).
• LTIP performance is measured over three years.
• The performance condition consists of a measure 
of EPS over a three-year period, starting with the 
year of grant.
• Awards may be subject to clawback if the 
Committee becomes aware of a material 
misstatement to the audited accounts, an 
error in calculation of targets resulting in an 
overpayment, gross misconduct or criminal 
behaviour on the part of a participant.
• LTIP awards with a face

• Amount that is paid for 
achievement of threshold

Notes
The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the AIP reflect the Committee’s aim that our annual incentives should balance 
the delivery of earnings growth and other key financial objectives with non-financial indicators, particularly Health and Safety 
targets, and specific individual objectives. The LTIP captures long-term growth in earnings, which we believe is most closely aligned 
with the financial performance expected by our shareholders.
The quantum of salary, benefits and incentive packages of Executives (and senior management) are set with reference to market 
comparatives and the impact of an individual’s role. Employees below Executive level receive packages that are reflective of their 
role and typically have less emphasis on variable, performance-related pay than for Executive Directors. Long-term incentives are 
provided only for the most senior executives who, it is anticipated, have the greatest potential to influence the overall performance 
of the Company. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132

Advice provided to the Committee
Advice was sought where appropriate from other sources. During the course of the year, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, 
the Group’s Chairman, the Group HR Director, and the Legal Director and Company Secretary were invited to attend various 
meetings of the Committee, although none was present when their own remuneration was being discussed.
To assist the Committee in ensuring that the Company’s remuneration practices take due account of market and best practice, 
the Committee has access to experienced specialist independent consultants. During the year, the Committee took advice, as 
appropriate, from Deloitte LLP (a member firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited) and from New Bridge Street (a trading name 
of Aon Hewitt Limited).
It is the policy of the Committee to put the remuneration consultant function out to tender on a periodic basis to ensure that 
the Company continues to receive independent support and advice of a high standard. Following a tender process in 2014 by 
the Committee, Deloitte LLP were appointed in place of New Bridge Street to act as the Company’s remuneration consultants. 
Deloitte LLP received fees of £50,208 and New Bridge Street received fees of £93,712 for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
Both Deloitte LLP and New Bridge Street are founder signatories to the Remuneration Consulting Group’s Code of Conduct. 
Neither Deloitte nor New Bridge Street (nor any other part of the Deloitte or Aon Hewitt group of companies) provided other 
services to the Company during the year and, having no other connection with the Company, Deloitte LLP and New Bridge Street 
are considered to be independent. 
Voting on the remuneration report at the AGM in 2014
Last year’s remuneration report was approved by shareholders with a 99.64% (2013 AGM: 96.90%) vote in favour (including 
discretionary votes).

Additional Notes to the single total figure of remuneration
(a) Taxable benefits provided to Executive Directors
The main benefits available to the Executive Directors during 2014 (and their approximate values) were a car allowance of £12,000 
(2013: £12,000) for Andrew Wyllie and £10,500 (2013: £10,500) for Anthony Bickerstaff together with private medical insurance for 
both Executive Directors of £1,275 (2013: £1,283). This package of benefits was unchanged from 2013.
(b) Determination of the 2014 Annual Incentive 
As reported in last year’s Directors’ remuneration report, during 2013 the Committee decided to simplify the structure of the annual 
bonus plan by combining the annual cash bonus and the legacy Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) into one Annual Incentive Plan 
(AIP). The operation of the deferred element of the new AIP was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
The combined maximum AIP opportunity for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director for the year ended 31 December 2014 
remained unchanged from 2013 at 150% of base salary, with one-third of the earned AIP award to be deferred into shares for a 
further two years (i.e. maintaining the same level of deferral as under the operation of the legacy DSBP) and two-thirds of the earned 
AIP award paid in cash. Grants will be made under the Company’s Share Deferral Plan (SDP) in March 2015.
The performance measures established by the Committee for the 2014 AIP continued to align reward with the Company’s 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy whilst not encouraging inappropriate business risks to be taken. These included inter alia a 
maximum target measure of £31.6 million for Group EBITA
1
. In addition, all measures were subject to an underpin for cash in order 
to encourage the timely collection of cash. This underpin is defined as “cash received by the Group from project and contract 
operations equal to 90% of budgeted gross margin”. If this underpin was not achieved, the 2014 AIP would be subject to a 
reduction of 10%. 
The achievement of the performance measures has been reviewed, with appropriate input from the Audit Committee, following the 
end of the year. The maximum 2014 AIP opportunity against each of the performance measures is shown below, together with the 
AIP award actually achieved. The cash underpin has also been achieved. 
In determining the bonus outcome for the Executive Directors, the Committee took into account that performance against the 
principal financial measure (EBITA), calculated in accordance with the scheme rules, would include the profit recognised on the 
transfer of assets into the pension scheme. The Committee took the view that this profit should not count fully towards the EBITA 
measure for the 2014 bonus and therefore reviewed the bonus outcome, both including and excluding the effect of this transfer, 
determining that the bonus payable should be at the mid-point of these two results. The result in the right-hand column shows this 
adjusted amount which will form the basis for payment.
The Committee is satisfied that these measures remain aligned with the execution and delivery of the Company’s strategy.

(c) Vesting of the 9 May 2012 LTIP award 
The LTIP award granted on 9 May 2012 was based on performance to the year ended 31 December 2014 and is due to vest in  
May 2015, subject to the Committee’s determination that the performance conditions have been met.
This award has two performance conditions:
Aggregate EPS
1
 for the financial years ended 31 December 2012, 2013 and 2014 Vesting level (for 50% of the award)
Below 81.66 pence 0%
81.66 pence 15%
Between 81.66 pence and 90.73 pence 15% – 100% pro rata
90.73 pence or more 100%
Operating profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 Vesting level (for 50% of the award)
Below £29.6 million 0%
Between £29.6 million and £37 million 0% – 50% pro rata
£37 million 50%
Between £37 million and £44.4 million 50% – 100% pro rata
£44.4 million 100%
1
 As adjusted following the capital raising in March 2014.
In addition, the Committee agreed that no element of the award relating to the Operating Profit shall vest unless an EPS underpin 
has been met which requires that the aggregate EPS performance condition as shown above is met in full and that the EPS for the 
financial year ending 31 December 2014 is at least 32.21 pence (as adjusted following the capital raising in March 2014).
EPS for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 calculated on an adjusted basis approved by the Committee was 24.8 pence 
and aggregate EPS for the financial years ended 31 December 2012, 2013 and 2014 (calculated on the same basis) was 107.7 pence. 
As a result, 100% of the element relating to aggregate EPS is due to vest (50% of the maximum award), and 0% of the element 
relating to Operating Profit is due to vest (50% of the maximum award). Therefore, 50% of the awards granted on 9 May 2012 are 
due to vest in May 2015 and are shown in the table below:

Under their terms of engagement, the Executive Directors are entitled to an annual pension allowance of 22% of base salary. 
Life assurance cover of four times base salary is provided through the Costain Life Assurance Scheme. The annual premiums 
payable in respect of life assurance for Andrew Wyllie and Anthony Bickerstaff were £2,016 (2013: £1,950) and £1,335 (2013: £1,292) 
respectively.
The Group offers a Group Flexible Retirement Plan which was set up in 2009 with Standard Life for employees and senior

2015 Annual Incentive 
Executive Directors and other senior management are eligible for annual bonuses under the AIP to encourage improved 
performance, with targets established by the Committee to align rewards with the Company strategy. The targets were set at 
the end of December 2014/beginning of 2015 and are clearly aligned with the delivery of our ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy. 
Their achievement will be reviewed, with appropriate input from the Audit Committee, at the end of the year.
The combined maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director for the year ended 31 December 2015 
will remain unchanged from 2014 at 150% of base salary, with one-third of earned bonus deferred into shares for a further two years 
and two-thirds of earned AIP opportunity paid in cash.
The performance measures for the 2015 AIP are as follows:
Performance Measures
2015 AIP Opportunity –  
Maximum Percentage of Bonus
Andrew  
Wyllie
Anthony  
Bickerstaff
Group EBITA 60% 60%

Order Book Contract Profit 6% 4%
Total Order Book 6% n/a
Cash Balance 6% 4%
Personal Performance 6% 16%
Total 100% 100%
The Committee has chosen not to disclose in advance the target performance for maximum achievement for the year ended 
31 December 2015, as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. The Committee will continue 
to provide retrospective disclosure of certain target performance for maximum achievement in next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration to the extent the Committee determines these measures are not commercially sensitive.
2015 LTIP Grant
The grant level for the Executive Directors remains at 100% of salary. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions as set 
out below, half of the award will vest after three years and the other half will vest after five years (the final two years being subject 
only to continued service), thereby ensuring long-term alignment of the Executive Directors’ and shareholders’ interests. 
It is proposed that the targets for the 2015 LTIP awards will be as follows:
EPS performance condition
Sum of the EPS for the financial years ending 31 December 2015, 2016 and 2017 Vesting level for awards
Below 83.9 pence 0%
83.9 pence 15%
96.9 pence or more 100%
Between 83.9 pence and 96.9 pence Between 15% and 100% pro-rata on a straight-line basis
The Committee has the discretionary power to vary these EPS targets. It is anticipated that the 2015 LTIP awards will take place in 
March 2015.
The Committee believes that EPS remains the most appropriate metric to use under the LTIP, as growth in EPS is one of the key 
drivers of the Company’s share price. As with previous LTIP awards, EPS for the awards that are due to be made in 2015 shall be 
calculated on an adjusted basis.
A clawback and malus provision is incorporated in the AIP and the LTIP (and the legacy DSBP) with regard to any material 
misstatement to audited accounts, an error in calculation of targets resulting in an overpayment, gross misconduct or criminal 
behaviour on the part of a participant. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

Share awards under the legacy DSBP
Under the legacy DSBP, deferred bonus awards were granted in the following two forms:
i.  an option with a nil exercise price over a fixed value of shares (‘the Combined Deferred Award’), which is granted in combination 
with an HMRC approved market value option over a fixed number of shares (‘the Option’) – this applies to an individual maximum 
of £30,000; and
ii.  an option with a nil exercise price over a fixed number of shares (‘Deferred Award’).

 Maximum number and value of shares under the Combined Deferred Award.
4
 Number of shares under the Option.
The value of the shares under the Combined Deferred Award and the Option are equal. The Combined Deferred Award and the 
Option must normally be exercised at the same time. When calculating the maximum value of the shares under a Deferred Award 
that may be granted under the terms of the Plan, the value of the shares under the Option is not counted.
All of the awards become exercisable on the second anniversary of the date of grant subject to the continued employment of the 
participant. The value of the shares delivered under the Combined Deferred Award on exercise is the same as the value of the 
shares under that award at the time of grant. The number of shares under the Deferred Award and Option at grant will be delivered 
to the participants on exercise. To the extent that all or any part of an award becomes exercisable, it remains, subject to the 
DSBP Rules, exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132

The profit after tax for the financial year ending  
31 December 2014 amounted to £21.0 million 
(2013: £12.5 million). An interim dividend of 3.25 pence 
per share (2013: 3.75 pence) amounting to £3.2 million 
(2013: £2.5 million) was paid on 24 October 2014. A final 
dividend at the rate of 6.25 pence per share (2013: 7.75 pence) 
amounting to £6.3 million (2013: £5.2 million) will also be 
recommended to shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 6 May 2015. If approved, the dividend

The Company may, by ordinary resolution, from time to time 
declare dividends not exceeding the amount recommended 
by the Board. Subject to the Companies Act 2006, the Board 
may pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, 
whenever the financial position of the Company, in the 
opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If the Directors act 
in good faith, they are not liable for any loss that shareholders 
may suffer because a lawful dividend has been paid on other 
shares which rank equally with or behind their shares.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of 
any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the 
Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25% interest in 
a class of the Company’s shares if such a person has been 
served with a restriction notice after failure to provide 
the Company with information concerning interests 
in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Directors submit to the members their report and accounts of the 
Company for the year ended 31 December 2014. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

Powers in relation to the Company issuing 
or buying back its own shares
The Directors may only issue and buy back shares if authorised

general meeting. At the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
held on 7 May 2014, shareholders granted an authority to the 
Directors to allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £16.7 million. As this authority is due to expire on 
6 May 2015, shareholders’ approval will be sought to renew the 
Directors’ authority to allot ordinary shares at the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting, up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£16,867,991. As at 31 December 2014, the only shares that had 
been allotted were in order to satisfy awards under employee 
share schemes and the scrip dividends. The Directors did not 
request authority to buy back any of the Company’s shares 
at the last Annual General Meeting in 2014 and they do not 
propose to do so at this at this year’s Annual General Meeting.

restriction notice (as defined in the Articles of Association) after 
failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act 2006.

of securities that may result in restrictions of voting rights.

dividend in respect of this shareholding.

Company, except:
• that certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws);

awards to be granted to employees under such schemes and 
plans to vest on a takeover.

the sectors in which it operates. The Group’s engineers and 
technical staff in these named sectors seek to develop and

Employee information
The average number of employees within the Company 
and Group is shown in Note 5 to the financial statements on 
page 103.
Apart from ensuring that an individual has the ability to carry

any way. The Company endeavours to retain employees if they 
become disabled, making reasonable adjustments to their role 
and, if necessary, looking for redeployment opportunities within 
the Group. The Company also ensures that training, career 
development and promotion opportunities are available to all 
employees irrespective of gender, race, age or disability.

The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is 
no relevant audit information (as defined in section 418 of the

is unaware and that each Director has taken all the steps that he/
she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s external auditors are aware of that information.

that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report

information necessary to assess the Company’s and the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors of the Company confirms that, to the best

with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profits/losses of 
the Company (and of the Group taken as a whole); and
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the

On behalf of the Board
David Allvey  Andrew Wyllie
Chairman   Chief Executive
02 March 2015  02 March 2015
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, the Director’s remuneration report and 
accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for 
each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group and Company accounts in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union (‘EU’).
Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that these give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and the Company accounts, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
accounts and the Director’s remuneration report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group accounts, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
80 Governance: Independent Auditor’s report
Independent Auditor’s report 
to the members of Costain Group PLC only
and profit therefore relies on estimates in relation to the 
final out-turn of costs on each contract. Changes to these 
estimates could give rise to material variances in the amount 
of revenue and profit/loss recognised. Cost contingencies 
may also be included in these estimates to take account 
of specific uncertain risks, or disputed claims against the 
Group, arising within each contract. These contingencies 
are reviewed by the Group on a regular basis throughout the 
contract life and adjusted where appropriate. Variations and 
claims, together with, in limited circumstances, insurance 
recoveries, are recognised on a contract-by-contract basis 
when the Group believes it is probable that the amount will 
be recovered from the customer or insurer and the amount 
can be measured reliably. Therefore, there is a high degree 
of risk and associated management judgement in: estimating 
the amount of revenue to be recognised by the Group with 
respect to the final out-turn on contracts; assessing the level 
of the contingencies; and recognising receipt of variations, 
claims and insurance recoveries.
• Our response: Using a variety of quantitative and qualitative 
criteria we selected a sample of contracts to assess and 
challenge the most significant and complex contract 
estimates. We obtained the detailed project management 
review papers from the Group to support the estimates made 
and challenged the judgements underlying those papers with 
senior operational, commercial and financial management. 
In this area our audit procedures included:
 –  evaluating the financial performance of contracts against 
budget and historical trends;
 –  completing site visits to certain higher risk or larger value 
contracts, physically inspecting the stage of completion 
of individual projects and identifying areas of complexity 
through observation and discussion with site personnel;
 –  challenging the Group’s judgement in respect of forecast 
contract out-turn, contingencies, settlements and the 
recoverability of contract balances via agreement to 
third-party certifications and confirmations and with 
reference to our own assessments, historical outcomes and 
industry norms;
 –  analysing correspondence with customers around variations 
and claims and considering whether this information is 
consistent with the estimates made by the Group;
Opinions and conclusions arising from 
our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of  
Costain Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2014 
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
Expense, the Consolidated and Company Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated and Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Cash 
Flow Statement and related notes. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion on the financial statements the 
risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on 
our audit were as follows:
Contract accounting estimates
Refer to page 55 (Audit Committee report) and pages 92 – 98 
(accounting policies).
• The Risk: The Group recognises revenue and profit in 
accordance with IAS 11 based on the stage of completion of 
contracts which is assessed with reference to the proportion 
of contract costs incurred for the work performed to the 
balance sheet date, relative to the estimated total costs 
of the contract at completion. The recognition of revenue  Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82

Financial statements and other information 83 – 132
• Our response: The non-current asset of the marina was 
valued internally by the Group using a discounted cash flow 
projection model which was subsequently reviewed and 
reported on by a third party valuer. In respect of this asset, 
our procedures included testing the design and operation 
of the model. We then examined the output of the external 
valuer which reported on the key inputs and assumptions 
driving the outputs of the model; we utilised a member of our 
team with specialist valuation skills to compare that with our 
historical experience, our knowledge of the relevant market 
and market forecasts for growth and inflation.
  The non-current assets of the golf courses were externally 
valued by a third party valuer using discounted cash flow 
projections. We have then examined the methodology of the 
projections and both the inputs and outputs of the external 
valuation exercise utilising a member of our team with 
specialist valuation skills to compare that with our historical 
experience, our knowledge of the relevant market and market 
forecasts for growth and inflation.
  Our audit procedures in respect of the land held for 
development in the Alcaidesa portfolio included inspecting 
copies of the external valuations for that land and evaluating 
whether the valuation firms that produced the reports were 
suitably qualified. We utilised a member of our team with 
specialist valuation skills to test the underlying assumptions 
by comparing them to market evidence and our knowledge of 
the sites.
We also reviewed the level of provision held at the Group level 
in relation to the Alcaidesa investment as a whole.
3  Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group’s financial statements as a 
whole was set at £1.4 million determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation and finance charges 
of £26.2 million of which it represents 5.3%.
We report to the audit committee any corrected or uncorrected 
misstatements exceeding £70,000, in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
 –  analysing correspondence and meeting minutes with 
insurers around recognised insurance claims, analysing 
assessments of these claims undertaken by the insurer’s 
legal or technical experts, if applicable, and considering 
whether this information supports the position taken on 
the contract;
 –  inspecting selected contracts for key clauses, identifying 
relevant contractual mechanisms such as pain/gain shares, 
design bonuses, liquidated damages and success fees 
and assessing whether these key clauses have been 
appropriately reflected in the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements;
 –  assessing whether the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements resulting from the estimates and assumptions 
made represent a balanced view of the risks and 
opportunities pertinent to each contract position;
 –  considering whether provisions against contracts 
sufficiently reflect the level of risk, and challenging the 
Group’s judgement in this area with reference to our own 
assessments; and
 –  considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of contract accounting and the key risks relating 
to these amounts.
Land and property assets held by equity accounted joint 
venture – valuation
Refer to page 56 (Audit Committee report), pages 92 – 98 
(accounting policies) and pages 109 to 110 (financial disclosures).
• The Risk: Alcaidesa Holding SA (equity accounted joint 
venture of £25.2 million in the accounts) operates in the 
Spanish real estate market and holds as its principal 
non-current assets, a marina and two golf courses and, 
as its principal current asset, land held for development. 
The Group performs a yearly review for impairment of the 
non-current assets and of the net realisable value of the 
development land to determine if these assets are being 
recorded at an appropriate amount. Due to the continued 
depressed state of the Spanish economy and the property 
market in particular, the valuation of these assets represents 
a significant risk in the Group balance sheet. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014
82 Governance: Independent Auditor’s report
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the

the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 75, in relation to 
going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance report on page 48 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the ten provisions 
of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for 
our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities

Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by 
component auditors at the key reporting components in 
Spain, Aberdeen and by the Group audit team at the Group’s 
head offices. These procedures covered 99% of total Group 
revenue; 99% of Group profit before tax and 99% of total 
Group assets. The segment disclosures in Note 3 set out the 
individual significance of specific countries.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to 
the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. 
The Group audit team approved the component materialities. 
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes in Spain 
and Aberdeen were performed to materiality levels set by 
the Group audit team of £525,000 and £725,000 respectively, 
having regard to the size and risk profile of those components.
4  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
5  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the Annual Report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

There are no significant restrictions on the ability to remit overseas reserves.
Details of the nature of the above reserves are set out below.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations that are not integral to the operations of the Company, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the 
Group’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments 
related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Merger reserve
The capital raise was effected through a structure, which resulted in a merger reserve arising under Section 612 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Following the receipt of the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value 
of the share capital issued has been transferred to retained earnings.

92 Financial statements: Notes to the financial statements
1 General information
Costain Group PLC (‘the Company’) is a public limited 
company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address 
of its registered office and principal place of business is 
disclosed on the last page of this Annual Report. The principal 
activities of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings 
(collectively referred to as ‘the Group’) are described in the 
Strategic report.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended 31 December 2014 comprise the Group and 
the Group’s interests in associates, joint ventures and joint 
operations. The parent company financial statements present 
information about the Company as a separate entity and not 
about its Group.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the 
Directors on 2 March 2015.
2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies
Both the Company financial statements and the Group 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
and approved by the Directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’) and their related interpretations. 
On publishing the parent Company financial statements here 
together with the Group financial statements, the Company 
is taking advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income 
statement and related notes that form a part of these 
approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, 
rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. The financial 
statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
that financial assets and derivative financial instruments are 
stated at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies 
and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making the judgments 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. Judgments made by management in 
the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the 
financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of 
material adjustment in the next year are discussed later in 
this Note.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities and the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the Strategic report. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position, borrowing and bonding facilities, use of 
financial instruments and hedging activities, exposure to credit 
risk and its objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital and financial risk are described in the Financial review 
section of these financial statements and in Note 17.
The Group’s principal business activity involves long-term 
contracts with a number of customers, virtually all in the United 
Kingdom. To meet its day-to-day working capital requirements, 
it uses cash balances provided from shareholders’ capital and 
retained earnings and its borrowing facilities. As part of its 
contracting operations, the Group may be required to provide 
performance and other bonds. It satisfies these requirements by 
utilising its committed bonding facilities from banks and surety 
companies. These facilities have financial covenants that are 
tested quarterly.
The Directors have acknowledged the guidance “Going 
Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2009” published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in October 2009. The Directors have considered 
these requirements, the Group’s current order book and 
future opportunities and its available bonding facilities. 
Having reviewed the latest projections, including the application 
of reasonable downside sensitivities, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well-placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing these financial statements.
Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless 
otherwise stated, been applied consistently by the Group 
and the Company to each period presented in these 
financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations are effective for the 
year ended 31 December 2014:
•  IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’
•  IAS 28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and 
Joint Arrangements’
•  Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ – 
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
•  IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
•  IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
•  IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
•  Transition guidance: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 
and IFRS  12 – amendments to simplify the transition to 
these standards.
The impact of these standards is limited to minor disclosure 
changes and alignment of accounting policies has not 
necessitated any prior year restatements.

2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
Basis of consolidation
(a)  The Group’s financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group and 
control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has the 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the entity. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
(b)  Associates are operations over which power exists 
to exercise significant influence but not control. 
Associates are accounted for using the equity method.
(c)  Joint ventures are those joint arrangements where control 
is shared with another entity, and where the Group has 
rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures 
are accounted for using the equity method from the date 
that the joint venture commences until the date that joint 
control of the entity ceases.
(d)  The presentation of investments in associates and joint 
ventures in the statement of financial position restricts 
the minimum carrying value to £Nil. Where the cost of 
investment would be negative, due to losses incurred, 
then an amount up to the value of the negative position 
is applied to any outstanding loan balance with the 
investment or, where future funding commitments exist, 
a provision is made up to the value of the commitment. 
Any such transfers of excess losses from the carrying 
value of investments are shown within reclassifications in 
Note 13. 
(e)  Joint operations are those joint arrangements over which 
joint control exists, established by contractual agreement 
and where the parties have rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. 
Where a joint operation exists, then the Group entity 
involved records the assets it controls, the liabilities and 
expenses it incurs and its share of income. Such joint 
operations are reported in the consolidated financial 
statements on the same basis. Transactions between 
Group companies and joint operations eliminate 
on consolidation.
(f)  Intra-group balances and transactions together with any 
unrealised gains arising from intra-group transactions 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions 
with associates, joint ventures and joint operations are 
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the entity or 
operation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way 
as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to 
pounds sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the statement of 
financial position date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated 
to pounds sterling at exchange rates ruling at the statement 
of financial position date. The revenues and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at rates 
approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of 
these transactions.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are 
recognised directly in equity and those that have arisen since 
1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented 
as a separate component of equity. Cumulative exchange 
differences are released into the income statement upon 
disposal. Translation differences that arose before the date of 
transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign operations are not 
presented as a separate component.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, net of value added tax and includes the 
share of revenue of joint operations. 97% of the Group’s revenue 
arises from long-term contracts. 
(a) Long-term contracts
Revenue arises from increase in the value of work performed on 
construction contracts and on the value of services provided 
during the year. Where the outcome of a long-term contract can 
be estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will be 
profitable, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the statement 
of financial position date. Stage of completion is assessed by 
reference to the proportion of contract costs incurred for the 
work performed to date relative to the estimated total costs.
Variations and claims are included in revenue where it is 
probable that the amount, which can be measured reliably, will 
be recovered from the customer. When the outcome of a long-
term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue 
is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it 
is probable those costs will be recoverable. Contract costs are 
recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed 
total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
Revenue recognition continued
Construction work in progress is stated at cost plus profit 
recognised to date less a provision for foreseeable losses 
and less amounts billed and is included in amounts due from 
customers for contract work. Cost includes all expenditure 
related directly to specific projects and an appropriate 
allocation of fixed and variable overheads based on normal 
operating capacity. Amounts valued and billed to customers 
are included in trade receivables. Where cash received from 
customers exceeds the value of work performed, the amount 
is included in credit balances on long-term contracts.
(b) Other revenue
Revenue from other services contracts is recognised when the 
service is provided.
Revenue from the sale of land is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer, the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably and it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Income statement presentation – Other items
In order to aid understanding of the underlying and overall 
performance of the Group, certain amounts are shown in the 
consolidated income statement in a separate column headed 
‘Other items’.  Items are included under this heading where 
the Board considers them to be of a one-off and unusual 
nature or related to the accounting treatment of acquisitions.
Pre-contract costs
Costs associated with bidding for contracts are written 
off as incurred. When it is probable that a contract will be 
awarded, usually when preferred bidder status is secured, 
costs incurred from that date to the date of financial close 
are carried forward in the statement of financial position and 
included in amounts due from customers for contract work.
When financial close is achieved on PFI contracts, costs are 
recovered from the special purpose vehicle and pre-contract 
costs within this recovery that were not previously capitalised 
are credited to the income statement. When an interest 
in a special purpose vehicle is retained and that interest is 
accounted for as an associate or joint venture, the credit is 
recognised over the life of the construction contract to which 
the costs relate.
Research and development
Research and development activities are usually directly 
attributable to a project and accounted within project costs.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the 
fair value of the consideration over the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity and 
goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included 
in non-current assets. The attributable costs of acquisitions are 
expensed to the income statement. 
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is included 
when determining the profit or loss on subsequent disposal of 
the business to which it relates.
Other intangible assets comprise acquired intangible assets: 
customer relationships, order book and brand and computer 
software. Customer relationships and other intangibles acquired 
are measured at the present value of cash flows attributable to 
the relationship less an appropriate contributory asset charge. 
Computer software is carried at cost; subsequent expenditure is 
capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits 
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates, otherwise 
expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation begins when an asset is acquired or, in the case of 
computer software, available for use and is amortised over the 
following periods:
Brands – on a straight-line basis up to three years.
Order book – in line with expected profit generation up 
to three years.
Customer 
relationships 
– on a straight-line basis up to seven years.
Computer  
software and 
development
– on a straight-line basis up to five years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where parts 
of an item of property, plant and equipment have different 
useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items. 
Cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. For all other property, plant 
and equipment, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line 
basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their 
estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold buildings – shorter of 50 years or lease term
Plant and equipment – remaining useful life  
(generally 3 to 10 years)
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial 
position date.
Investments – Company
Company investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less 
provisions for impairment. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
PFI investments
The Group has interests in PFI investments held through 
joint ventures and associates. These arrangements, whereby 
a private sector operator participates in the development, 
financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for 
public services, are accounted in accordance with IFRIC 12. 
Under this interpretation, the infrastructure assets within 
the Group’s investments are recognised as financial assets 
because the operator has an unconditional right to receive 
a specified amount of cash or other financial asset over the 
life of the agreement. The operator recognises investment 
income in respect of the financial asset on an effective 
interest basis.
Impairment of non-financial assets
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the cash generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating 
units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro-rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in a subsequent period.
The carrying amounts of other assets, except inventories 
and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each statement of 
financial position date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset, or its cash-generating unit, is less than 
the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised 
in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates resulting in the recoverable amount rising 
above the impaired carrying value of the asset. An impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of 
the assets does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position 
when there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect 
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the 
expected benefits to be derived from a contract are lower 
than the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under 
the contract.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of United Kingdom 
corporation tax and overseas tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the statement of financial position liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
temporary differences except for those specific exemptions set 
out below and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
statement of financial position date. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or other assets and liabilities, 
other than in a business combination, in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates based on those 
enacted or substantially enacted at the statement of financial 
position date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Additional taxes arising from the distribution of dividends 
are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
Leases
Leases principally comprise operating leases. Payments made 
under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Any incentives to enter into operating leases are recognised as 
a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-
line basis. 
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts 
to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance 
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, 
the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until 
such time as it becomes probable that a payment under the 
guarantee will be required.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as distributions in the period in 
which they are declared. Dividends proposed but not declared 
are not recognised but are disclosed in the Note 10 to the 
financial statements.
Share-based payments
These comprise equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
compensation plans.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant and the fair value is expensed over 
the vesting period, based on the estimate of awards that 
will eventually vest. For cash-settled share-based payments, 
a liability equal to the portion of the services received is 
recognised at its current fair value determined at each 
statement of financial position date. Fair value is measured by 
the use of a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Where options are granted over shares in the Company to 
employees of subsidiaries, the Company recognises in its 
financial statements an increase in the cost of investment in 
its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based 
payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries’ financial 
statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised 
directly in equity.
Retirement benefit obligations
A defined benefit pension scheme is operated in the United 
Kingdom, which provides benefits based on pensionable salary. 
The details are included in Note 20. The assets of the scheme 
are held separately from those of the Group.
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. 
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected 
unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a 
high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency 
to the liability. The liability recognised in the statement of 
financial position in respect of the defined benefit pension 
scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
less the fair value of scheme assets at the statement of financial 
position date.
Administration costs of the scheme are recognised in the 
income statement. The interest cost on the scheme’s net 
liabilities is included in finance expense. Remeasurements of 
the net liability are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in 
the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
(a) Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as loans and receivables. 
The classification depends on the nature and purpose 
of the financial asset and is determined at the time of 
initial recognition.
A financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from that asset expire, or it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the asset to another entity.
Loans and receivables
Loans and other receivables with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified 
as loans and receivables and measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are stated 
at their initial value less impairment losses.
Impairment of financial assets
Estimated recoverable amounts are based on the ageing of 
the outstanding receivable and provisions against individual 
receivables are recognised when management deems the 
amounts are not collectible. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the statement of cash flows.
(b) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured 
at fair value, net of transaction costs. Financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. Where borrowings are the hedged item in 
an effective fair value hedge relationship, the carrying value is 
adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the 
hedged risk. Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(c) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks arising 
from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and 
inflation and are measured at their fair value. The fair value of 
forward exchange contracts is their quoted market value at 
the statement of financial position date. Valuations for forward 
exchange contracts are determined using valuation techniques 
supported by reference to market values for similar transactions.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as 
hedges in line with established risk management policies and 
classified as follows:
•  Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes in the 
fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or
•  Cash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash 
flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the 
hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the income 
statement and adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
hedged item.
For cash flow hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion in 
the income statement. When hedged cash flows result in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated 
gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in 
the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash 
flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity 
are transferred to the income statement in the same period in 
which the hedged cash flow affects the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged 
transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss is transferred 
to the income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of 
derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are 
recognised in the income statement.
Fair value measurement
When measuring the fair value of a financial or non-financial 
asset or liability, the group uses market observable data as far 
as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in 
a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation 
techniques as follows:
•  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets and liabilities.
•  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
•  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or 
liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value 
hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its 
entirety in the same level of the hierarchy as the lowest level 
input that is significant to the entire measurement.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 13, the 
Group has applied the new fair value measurement guidance 
prospectively and has not provided any comparative information 
for new disclosures.
Significant areas of judgment and estimation
The estimates and underlying assumptions used in the 
preparation of these financial statements are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
The most critical accounting policies and significant areas 
of judgment and estimation arise from the accounting for 
long-term contracts under IAS 11 Construction contracts, 
assessments of the carrying value of land and the carrying value 
of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and the assumptions 
used in the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes 
under IAS 19 Employee benefits. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
Significant areas of judgment and estimation continued
The majority of the Group’s activities are undertaken via 
long-term contracts and these contracts are accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 11, which requires estimates to be made for 
contract costs and revenues. In many cases, these contractual 
obligations span more than one financial period. Also, the costs 
and revenues may be affected by a number of uncertainties that 
depend on the outcome of future events and may need to be 
revised as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved.
Management bases its judgments of costs and revenues and 
its assessment of the expected outcome of each long-term 
contractual obligation on the latest available information, 
this includes detailed contract valuations and forecasts of the 
costs to complete. The estimates of the contract position and 
the profit or loss earned to date are updated regularly and 
significant changes are highlighted through established internal 
review procedures. The impact of any change in the accounting 
estimates is then reflected in the financial statements.
Alcaidesa Holding SA, one of the Group’s joint arrangements, 
operates in the Spanish real estate market and holds land and 
property within its current and non-current assets. The company 
has also developed and operates a marina under a long-term 
concession agreement and has developed and operates two 
golf courses. At 31 December 2014, a review of the net realisable 
value of its land holdings has been undertaken using external 
professional valuers. A review of the carrying value of the marina 
and golf course assets has been undertaken using a discounted 
cash flow model. As a consequence of those reviews, no write 
downs in the value of Alcaidesa’s assets were required in these 
financial statements.
Reviewing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
recognised on acquisition requires judgments, principally, in 
respect of growth rates and future cash flows of cash generating 
units, the useful lives of intangible assets and the selection of 
discount rates used to calculate present values are set out in 
Note 11.
Defined benefit pension schemes require significant judgments 
in relation to the assumptions for inflation, future pension 
increases, investment returns and member longevity that 
underpin the valuation. Each year in selecting the appropriate 
assumptions, the Directors take advice from an independent 
qualified actuary. The assumptions and resultant sensitivities are 
set out in Note 20.
IFRSs not applied
The following IFRSs having been endorsed, will be applicable in 
the future:
•  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – Published in July 2014

forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of 
financial instruments from IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with 
early adoption permitted. 
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its 
consolidated financial statements resulting from the 
application of IFRS 9.

a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how 
much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing 
revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, 
IAS 11 ‘Construction Contacts’ and IFRIC 13 ‘Customer 
Loyalty programmes.’ IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with early 
adoption permitted.
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its 
consolidated financial statements resulting from the 
application of IFRS 15.

3 Operating segments
The Group has two core business segments: Natural Resources and Infrastructure plus the Land Development operations in Spain. 
The core segments are strategic business units with separate management and have different core customers or offer different 
services. This information is provided to the Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker. The segments are discussed 
in the Strategic report section of these financial statements.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting 
policies. The Group evaluates segment performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before interest and income 
tax expense before and after other items. The segment results that are reported to the Chief Executive include items directly 
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Intersegment sales and transfers are not material.

The Group and Company have potential deferred tax assets in their United Kingdom operations that have not been recognised at 
the year end on the basis that their future economic benefits were not assured at the statement of financial position date. 
Gross deferred tax assets not recognised at the statement of financial position date were as follows:

In December 2013, the Group acquired the outstanding 27% interest from its partner Serco plc in their Managed Motorway 
Technology joint venture arrangement for a cash consideration of £2.4 million paid January 2014.
The net book value of other acquired intangible assets includes £2.1 million (2013: £3.6 million) relating to order book.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash generating units identified within the Infrastructure (£5.5 million) and Natural 
Resources (£16.8 million) reporting segments.
As described in Note 2, the Group reviews the value of goodwill and in the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are 
based on internal value in use calculations of the cash generating unit (‘CGU’). The key assumptions for these calculations are: 
discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital and the risks specific to the CGU. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU in 
Infrastructure was 10.5% and for the CGU in Natural Resources was 12.5%.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts for the following two years and 
extrapolates those cash flows based on the following internal assessments of the annual growth rates attributable to the CGUs:
Growth rates
Infrastructure 
%
Natural 
Resources 
%
Years 3-4 2.5 2.5
Year 5 1.5 2.5
Long-term average 1.5 1.5
As at 31 December 2014, based on these internal valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill exceeded the carrying amounts by 
a comfortable amount. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

14 Trade and other receivables continued
The average credit period within trade receivables on amounts billed for construction work and on sales of goods is 33 days 
(2013: 33 days). The analysis of the due dates of the trade receivables was £68.5 million (2013: £76.1 million) due within 30 days, 
£25.6 million (2013: £8.8 million) due between 30 and 60 days and £1.4 million (2013: £2.5 million) due after 60 days.
These balances include receivables, with a carrying amount of £4.3 million (2013: £5.0 million), which are past due at the reporting 
date and for which no provision has been made as there has been no significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are considered recoverable. No collateral is held over these balances. The analysis of the overdue amounts was £2.9 million 
(2013: £2.8 million) overdue by less than 30 days, £0.3 million (2013: £0.5 million) overdue by between 30 and 60 days and £1.1 million 
(2013: £1.7 million) overdue by more than 60 days.
The provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is £7.4 million (2013: £6.9 million).
The aggregate amount of costs incurred plus recognised profits, less recognised losses, for all contracts in progress at the 
statement of financial position date was £2,927.6 million (2013: £2,782.6 million). Progress billings and advances received from 
customers under open construction contracts amounted to £2,915.9 million (2013: £2,728.8 million). Advances for which work has not 
started, and billings in excess of costs incurred and recognised profits are included in credit balances on long-term contracts.

17 Financial instruments – Fair values and risk management
a) Risk management
The Group’s centralised treasury function manages financial risk, principally arising from liquidity and funding risks and movements 
in foreign currency rates, interest rates and inflation rates, in accordance with policies agreed by the Directors.
The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
The Company does not have any forward foreign currency contracts or other derivatives.
i) Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide resources 
to grow the business, in order to provide returns for shareholders and other stakeholders. The current capital base of the Group is 
driven by equity capital from shareholders and retained earnings. During the year, the Group raised £70.3 million (net of expenses) 
through a capital raise (Note 21). The proceeds will demonstrate to customers the Group’s financial capacity to support further 
increases in contract size and duration and fund likely increased working capital requirements arising from the move to target-
cost, cost-reimbursable contracts. The Board of Directors (‘Board’) continues to seek to strengthen the Group by growing the 
business and improving profitability; the Strategic report describes the Group’s strategy and its operations. It is the Board’s policy 
to progressively increase dividends paid to shareholders based on growth in underlying earnings per share after taking account of 
the investment and capital needs of the business. There were no changes in the Board’s approach to capital management during 
the year.
ii) Liquidity and funding risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity and funding risk rests with the Board, which has put in place a monitoring and reporting 
framework to manage funding requirements. 
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring actual and forecast short and medium-term cash flows and the maturity profile of financial 
assets and liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The nature and timing of the contract cash flows causes the cash 
balances to vary over the month with the balance usually highest at month end.
The average month end net cash balance during the year was £95.6 million (2013: £50.7 million).
Customers awarding long-term contracting work may, as a condition of the award, require the contractor to provide performance 
and other bonds. Consequently, the Group is reliant on its ability to secure bank and surety bonds. It has facilities in place to 
provide these bonds and monitors the usage and regularly updates the forecast usage of these facilities.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had banking and bonding facilities, including a £95.0 million (2013: £95.0 million) Revolving 
Credit Facility, extending to 30 June 2017. The facilities have financial covenants based on profit, interest cover and leverage 
measured quarterly.

* Element of above facilities available for borrowings 2.5  2.5 
At 31 December 2014, the utilisation of these bonding facilities amounted to £146.8 million (2013: £157.1 million).
iii) Credit risk
The Group focuses on major blue-chip private sector and large public sector customers. It uses an external credit scoring system 
to assess a potential customer’s credit quality and will enter into a contract only if that assessment is satisfactory. Deposits in 
the United Kingdom are placed with the bank facility providers or, in joint operations, with banks agreed by the partners. 
Overseas deposits are placed with major banks operating in those countries. Transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
are with bank or insurance company counterparties with high credit ratings that are monitored regularly and with whom there are 
signed netting agreements. Given the high credit ratings of the banks and insurance companies used, management does not 
expect any counterparty will fail to meet its obligations.
At the year end date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by 
the carrying amounts of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, and the individual constituents of amounts 
due from customers for contract work in the statement of financial position. Further information on the exposure to credit risk is set 
out in Note 14. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2014

a) Risk management continued
iv) Interest rate risk
The Group has cash balances in the United Kingdom and overseas and until late 2014 bank borrowings overseas. The largest 
constituents are United Kingdom balances denominated in pounds sterling. A 1% rise in interest rates would have increased the 
annual interest income on net cash balances by £1.0 million (2013: £0.5 million).
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Group.
v) Foreign currency risk
Transactional currency exposures arise from sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than their functional 
currency. The current strategy is to hedge both committed and forecast foreign currency exposures, where applicable, and where 
the transaction timing and amount can be determined reliably and no natural hedge exists. The Group only enters into forward 
contracts when a contractual commitment exists in respect of the foreign currency transaction and the Group’s policy is to 
negotiate the terms of the hedge derivative to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.
Investments in joint ventures includes the Group’s investment in Alcaidesa Holding SA, a company based in Spain and denominated 
in euro. At the year end, the net carrying value of the equity investment was £25.2 million (2013: £26.6 million). A 10% strengthening 
in the euro would have favourably impacted the statement of financial position by £2.8 million (2013: £3.0 million). A 10% 
strengthening in the euro would have adversely impacted the results by £0.2 million (2013: £1.3 million). 
In addition, a 10% strengthening in the UAE dirham would have adversely impacted the results by £0.1 million (2013: £0.2 million). 
At 31 December 2014, the net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation 
involved were Euro denominated net monetary assets of £0.2 million (2013: £0.1 million), US dollar denominated net monetary assets 
of £0.2 million (2013: £Nil) and UAE dirham denominated net monetary assets of £0.6 million (2013: £Nil) in members of the Group 
with pounds sterling as their functional currency.
b) Cash flow hedges
Forward currency contracts that hedge forecast transactions are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value based on 
a Level 2 valuation method, using quoted forward exchange rates. The terms of the foreign currency contracts match the terms of 
the commitments.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had foreign currency contracts (five sale contracts (2013: five), no purchase contracts (2013: seven)) 
designated as hedges of future transactions and summarised below. The carrying value represents the fair value of the contract; the 
contractual cash flows represent the pounds sterling commitments. There were no ineffective hedges at the year end (2013: Nil).

measured at amortised cost should be distinguished from instruments measured at fair value. Strategic report 02 – 44 Governance 45 – 82 Financial statements and other information 83 – 132

within financial assets, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair values. The fair values of loans 
carrying interest rates above 10% may be higher than their carrying values of £1.7 million (2013: £4.8 million), but not by a 
material amount.

(a) Pensions
A defined benefit pension scheme is operated in the United Kingdom and a number of defined contribution pension schemes are 
in place in the United Kingdom and overseas. Contributions are paid by subsidiary undertakings and employees. The total pension 
charge in the income statement was £9.2 million comprising £7.8 million included in operating costs plus £1.4 million included in net 
finance expense (2013: £9.2 million, comprising £7.1 million in operating costs plus £2.1 million in net finance expense).
The Company does not operate a pension scheme.
Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new members on 31 May 2005 and from 1 April 2006 future benefits were calculated on a 
Career Average Revalued Earnings basis. The scheme was closed to future accrual of benefits to members on 30 September 2009. A 
full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2013 and this was updated to 31 December 2014 by a qualified 
independent actuary.

(b) Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of share-based payment plans as described below.
Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIP)
Shareholders approved a new Long-Term Incentive Plan at the 2012 AGM that allows for conditional awards with a maximum face 
value of up to 100% of base salary with a performance condition based on earnings per share. 
Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)
Executive Directors and other senior management are eligible to participate in the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan, under which 
one third of the award is payable in shares. The total AIP award of up to 150% of base salary has performance conditions based 
on adjusted EBIT (Earnings before interest, tax and other items) (at least 50% of the award) and other measures. The share award 
element vests on the second anniversary of the date of grant and will be satisfied by shares purchased by a trust on behalf of the 
Group. It will not lead to any dilution of shareholder interest. Participants must be in employment with the Company and not under 
notice of termination (either given or received) on the date of vesting. 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)
Prior to 2014, Executive Directors and other senior management were eligible to participate in the Company’s Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan which allowed for conditional awards with a face value of up to 50% of base salary with a performance condition based 
on adjusted EBIT (Earnings before interest, tax and other items). The deferred bonus award vests on the second anniversary of the 
date of grant and is satisfied by shares purchased by a trust on behalf of the Group, so does not lead to any dilution of shareholder 
interest. Participants must be in employment with the Company and not under notice of termination (either given or received) on 
the date of vesting. 
Save As You Earn Plans (SAYE)
The Company operates a number of SAYE plans that are open to all employees who pay a fixed amount from salary into a savings 
account each month and may elect to save over three or five years. At the end of the savings period, employees have six months 
in which to exercise their options (after which the options expire) using the funds saved. If employees decide not to exercise their 
options, they may withdraw the funds saved. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group (except 
where permitted by the rules of the scheme).
Share-based payment expense
The amounts recognised in the income statement, before income tax, for share-based payment transactions with employees was 
£2.2 million (2013: £2.7 million); the entire charge relates to subsidiaries.
Options outstanding at the end of the year
The outstanding LTIPs (exercise price £1 per individual grant), AIP (Nil-cost option) and DSBPs (Nil-cost option), which arrange for

(b) Share-based payments continued
The fair value of options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The aggregate fair value of options 
granted during the year was £1.4 million (2013: £2.8 million). The assumptions used in valuing the grants were:
2014 2013
Expected volatility 20% 20%
Expected life (years) 2.7 – 5.0 2.7 – 5.0
Risk-free interest rate 2.1% 3.5%
Expected dividend yield 3.5% 4.0%
The expected volatility is based on the historical share price volatility over a term matching the expected life. The expected 
life is based on management’s best estimate having regard to the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.

Dividend mandate
Shareholders can arrange to have their dividends paid directly 
into their bank or building society account, by completing a 
bank mandate form. The advantages to using this service are:
• the payment is more secure as you can avoid the risk of 
cheques getting lost in the post;
• it avoids the hassle of paying in a cheque; and
• there is no risk of lost, stolen or out-of-date cheques.
A mandate form can be obtained from the Company’s website, 
or by contacting Equiniti on 0871 384 2250* (+44 (0) 121 415 7047 
if calling from outside the United Kingdom) who will be pleased 
to assist you and can also be obtained via the shareholder 
website at www.shareview.co.uk (see below for further 
details). Alternatively, you will find one attached to the tax 
voucher of your last dividend payment. Overseas shareholders 
can arrange for their dividends to be paid in their local 
currency and more information can be obtained from 
www.shareview.com/overseas
Shareview service
The Shareview service from our Registrar, Equiniti, allows 
shareholders to manage their shareholding online, giving:
• direct access to data held on their behalf on the share register 
including recent share movements and dividend details; and
• the ability to change their address or dividend payment 
instructions online.
To sign up for Shareview you need the ‘shareholder reference’ 
printed on your proxy form or dividend stationery. There is no 
charge to register.
When you register with the site, you can register your preferred 
format (post or email) for shareholder communications. If you 
select email as your mailing preference, you will be notified of 
various shareholder communications, such as annual results, by 
email instead of post.
If you have your dividends paid straight to your bank account, 
and you have selected email as your mailing preference, you can 
also collect your tax voucher electronically. Instead of receiving 
the paper tax voucher, you will be notified by email with details 
of how to download your electronic version. Visit the website at 
www.shareview.co.uk for more details.
Details of software and equipment requirements are given on 
the website.
Unsolicited mail
The Company is legally obliged to make its share register 
available to the general public. Consequently, some 
shareholders may receive unsolicited mail, including 
correspondence from unauthorised investment firms. 
Shareholders who wish to limit the amount of unsolicited mail 
they receive can contact:
The Mailing Preference Service  
Freepost 29 
LON20771 
London W1E OZT
Further guidance on this issue can also be found on the 
Company’s website at www.costain.com
ShareGift
The Orr Macintosh Foundation (ShareGift) operates a charity 
share donation scheme for shareholders with small parcels 
of shares whose value makes it uneconomic to sell them. 
Details of the scheme are available on the ShareGift website 
at www.sharegift.org. Equiniti can provide stock transfer 
forms on request. Donating shares to charity in this way gives 
rise neither to a gain nor a loss for Capital Gains Tax purposes. 
This service is completely free of charge.
*  Calls to 0871 numbers cost 8p per minute plus network extras. Lines are 
open Monday to Friday 08.30am to 05.30pm, excluding UK bank holidays.

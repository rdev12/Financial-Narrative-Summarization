development of our european appliance  
warranty business and, after the year end,  
the acquisition in the Us of the service contract 
business from n ational g rid energy services. 
We have also expanded our global marketing 
footprint with the addition of a number of new 
affinity partners including dyson and g B o ils  
in the UK, agbar in spain and piedmont g as

(2009: £304.3m) and operating profit
2
 by 13% to 
£104.4m (2009: £92.3m) with operating margin 
reducing in line with our expectations by 2.0 
percentage points to 28.3% (2009: 30.3%) reflecting 
the planned increase in customer acquisition 
marketing in the UK and continued investment in 
business development across all our membership 
businesses. earnings per share
3
 grew by 14% to 
110.9p per share (2009: 96.9p per share).
i am pleased to say that we have delivered against 
the targets we set ourselves at the start of the year 
including 3% customer growth and a retention 
rate of 82.5% in the UK, a maiden operating profit

in the Us and the continued expansion of our 
international household footprint.
t he business continues to be very cash generative 
delivering a cash inflow from continuing and 
discontinued operations of £73.4m (2009: £92.2m) 
representing cash conversion of 93.4% (2009: 
115.7%). o ur balance sheet remains strong with net 
debt at the year end of £52.9m (2009: £34.0m) and 
£150m of banking facilities in place until december 
2012 providing us with significant flexibility to take 
advantage of selective acquisition opportunities as 
they arise.    
dividend
t he Board is proposing a final dividend of 8.5p 
per share bringing the total dividend for the year 
to 44.0p (2009: 35.5p), a year on year increase 
of 24%. t his reflects the Board’s confidence in 
the continuing strength and resilience of our 
membership businesses following the exit from 
UK emergency services. t he Board intends to 
continue to follow a policy of growing future 
dividends in line with earnings per share

 growth.
sh are s UB-division
a 5 for 1 sub-division of the share capital of the 
Company is proposed, the intended effect of which 
is to seek to improve the liquidity and marketability 
of the ordinary shares of the Company by 
reducing the market price of an ordinary share 
and increasing the number of shares in issue. t he 
Board will seek approval from shareholders for the 
proposed sub-division at the Company’s agm on 
30 July 2010. 
Board Ch anges
t here were a number of changes to the Board 
during the year. o n 26 June 2009, martin Bennett 
was appointed Chief Financial o fficer following the 
departure of Jonathan simpson-dent and on  
31 march 2010, Brian Whitty, executive Chairman 
since 2004 retired from the Board. as a result,  
i was appointed n on-executive Chairman on 1 april 
2010 and ian Chippendale was appointed senior 
independent director. t he Board is extremely 
grateful for the significant contribution to the 
development and growth of the business made by 
Brian over the last 14 years not only as Chairman of 
h omeserve but also before that as Chief executive

 increased by 16% to £286.7m (2009: 
£246.6m) driven by high levels of renewals income 
and new policy sales. As reported at our interim 
results, the UK business increased investment 
in marketing in line with our focus on customer 
growth resulting in operating profit
2
 increasing 
by 10% to £95.8m (2009: £87.2m).  
i am pleased to report that the UK business 
achieved a key objective of 3% customer growth 
for the year which was mainly driven by our core 
utility and manufacturer marketing channels.  
This, combined with the continued success of 
cross-sell, enabled the business to deliver gross 
new policy sales of 1.83m (2009: 1.83m).
We are particularly pleased with our retention 
performance having delivered a retention 
rate of 82.5% (2009: 83.0%) which is ahead of 
our expectations at the start of the year. This 
performance reflects the success of a range 
of retention-specific initiatives including the 
introduction of the customer magazine, the use  
of personalised renewals notices and improved 
call centre efficiency. 
The continued success of Combined policies, 
which now represent 17% (2009: 14%) of our 
customers, helped to increase policies per 
customer to 2.32 (2009: 2.23) with income per 
customer growing 14% to £74 (2009: £65). 
Our UK manufacturer warranty business has 
had another successful year with total policies 
growing by 17% to 387,000 (2009: 331,000). We 
have recently signed a long-term agreement 
with Dyson to undertake the marketing and 
administration of their manufacturer extended 
warranty scheme in the UK. 
The addition of Dyson and baumatic earlier in 
the year takes the total number of manufacturer 
partner brands to 24 across the boiler, shower, 
white and brown goods sectors and the pipeline  
of potential partners remains strong. We are  
now actively applying our UK warranty expertise 
and best practice to the development of our 
european warranty business Société Française  
de Garantie (SFG). 
As well as meeting our customer growth targets 
through our core marketing channels, we have 
made good progress with a number of new 
customer growth initiatives aimed at attracting 
customers from outside our core demographic 
through new marketing channels. 
We have made good progress developing our 
pay on use service, One Contact, which is now 
available on a national basis. in September we 
purchased r eactfast, a national emergency 
trades business, which is providing an excellent 
source of new customer leads and emergency 
jobs for our repair networks having been fully 
integrated into our membership operations.

our focus now is to create additional ways of 
maximising the number of emergency jobs and 
new customer leads by leveraging existing and 
accessing new marketing channels.
in the energy sector, we announced in march the 
signing of a long-term affinity partner agreement 
with g B o ils, the UK’s leading residential oil 
distributor to offer boiler breakdown cover to their 
oil customers. We believe that this part of the 
domestic energy market represents a significant 
opportunity for us, with over 1m households in the 
UK using oil as their main source of fuel. 
at the start of april we signed a two year 
agreement with npower to market electrical 
breakdown and emergency cover as a customer 
acquisition product and we will be working closely 
with them to develop a range of home assistance 
products during the financial year.
o ur product for l andlords is making good progress 
on the back of direct advertising under the 
h omeserve brand and we are now in discussions 
with a range of potential partners to broaden our 
marketing channels and accelerate take up rates 
for this product. 
discussions with other potential distribution 
partners including credit card companies, iFas 
and travel companies to offer an insured home 
emergency product are progressing well.
We have continued to improve the efficiency of our 
network during the year through the successful 
acquisition and integration of a number of 
small plumbing businesses and as at the end 
of the year, over 80% of all plumbing jobs were 
being carried out by our network of 285 directly 
employed plumbers. increasing the proportion of 
work carried out by our own engineers will enable 
us to deliver enhanced customer service together 
with productivity gains and to steadily reduce 
the average cost per job. h aving completed the 
franchising of our electrics and g as networks 
we have now started to franchise our plumbing 
network in remote parts of the UK thereby further 
increasing the number of h omeserve branded 
vehicles and engineers in the network. in addition, 
we continue to invest in systems that support 
our network to improve customer service and 
operational efficiency. 
o ur expectations for the UK business for the 
coming year are to build on the success we have 
had this year with the delivery of further customer 
growth of 3–4% and up to a 1 percentage point 
reduction in the retention rate.

another strong performance from our claims

increased volumes from key customers.
as in the previous financial year, the overall 
operating profit
2
 result for Spain of £0.4m (2009: 
£0.1m) reflects the reinvestment of profits from our 
claims handling business in the development of 
our Spanish policy business where we continue to 
make good progress. In the 12 months to March 
2010, the number of policies nearly doubled to 
94,000 (2009: 48,000) following an encouraging 
start to full scale marketing with Endesa and 
against a backdrop of an extremely tough 
economic environment. 
In February, we announced a significant 
development for our Spanish business with the 
signing of a long-term marketing agreement 
with agbar, Spain’s largest water company 
with over 4 million residential customers. The 
agreement represents an important step for 
our Spanish business enabling us to launch full 
scale marketing in Spain under a water brand

which shows the position as at 25 may 2010, the

t he Us has had another strong year generating 
an increase in revenue

 in local currency of 41% 
(g Bp 43%) and a maiden operating profit
2
 of 
£1.5m. t he total number of policies has grown by 
38% to 756,000, driven by continued high levels of 
gross new policy sales of 290,000 (2009: 246,000) 
and an increase in customer numbers of 31% to 
580,000. 
t he retention rate has also increased to 82.6% 
(2009: 80.0%) as a result of a greater proportion 
of customers paying for their policies via their 
utility bill and the success of “easi-pay” which 
encourages cheque paying customers to switch 
to continuous payment. 
policy growth in the Us has been driven by strong 
take-ups with our new gas affinity partners 
semCo energy and piedmont g as and we have 
also been successful in attracting new customers 
under our own brand in those areas where we 
have not yet signed up an affinity partner.

£6.5m (2009: £3.7m) principally relates to customer 
and other contracts held by the acquired entities 
at the date of acquisition. t he year on year 
increase principally reflects the impact of the 
sFg, spt and r eactfast acquisitions. exceptional 
operating income of £10.2m relates to the recovery 
of previous years’ insurance premium tax in UK 
membership. For our French joint venture, the 
operating result is defined as profit after tax and 
hence £2.0m (2009: £1.9m) of taxation is reported 
within operating profit and profit before tax.
in accordance with iFr s, statutory operating profit 
for continuing operations, after amortisation 
of acquisition intangibles, tax on joint ventures 
and exceptional operating items, were: UK 
membership £104.7m (2009: £83.9m); Continental 
europe £1.4m (2009: £2.2m); and Usa £35k (2009:

profit for continuing operations of £106.1m (2009:

statutory operating loss of £42.0m.
t he g roup’s net interest charge increased 
marginally in the year to £3.9m (2009: £3.6m) with 
a more benign interest rate environment offset by 
an increase in the deferred consideration interest 
charge relating to past acquisitions. t he interest 
charge was covered 27 times by operating profit
2
. 
t he effective rate of corporation tax is 28.9% (2009: 
30.1%). t he reduction in the rate is primarily due 
to the availability of brought forward tax losses in 
our international businesses which we can start to 
utilise as those businesses reach profitability.
t he earnings of our doméo joint venture are 
shown net of tax within pre tax profit. With the 
increasing profitability (and tax impact of doméo), 
it is appropriate to highlight the joint venture 
adjusted tax rate. adjusting the tax rate to show 
the tax relating to joint ventures on a gross basis, 
the joint venture adjusted tax rate is 30.3% (2009:

t he proposed payment of a final dividend of 8.5p 
per share together with the payment of the first 
and second interim dividend payments of 11.5p 
and 24.0p per share respectively brings the total 
dividend for the year to 44.0p (2009: 35.5p), a 
year on year increase of 24% (2009: 14%). t he 
final dividend is to be paid on 4 august 2010 to 
shareholders on the register on 2 July 2010.
disCo ntin Ued o perations
t he loss from our discontinued operations of 
£42.0m reflects the decision to exit our UK 
emergency services business. 
exCeptional items
during the period, we benefited from a one 
off exceptional revenue gain of £10.2m (2009: 
exceptional cost of £2.3m relating to the 
reorganisation of our UK businesses) in respect of 
previous years’ insurance premium tax following a 
successful appeal to the h igh Court. 
Key per Fo rman Ce in diCators 
in order to assist in the management of the 
business and to provide evidence of achieving its 
strategic priorities, the Board regularly reviews 
a number of Key performance indicators (’Kpis‘) 
including customer and policy numbers which are 
set out opposite for our membership businesses. 
Changing the Way We measUr e and report 
o Ur Kpi’s
Core r enewable Customers (’Cr Cs‘), are those 
customers that we have recruited under an affinity 
partner brand (such as a utility or manufacturer) 
or our own brand and where we have a direct 
ongoing relationship with the customer including 
the right to renew. r evenue Customers are those 
customers where we receive income for providing a 
policy or service but where we do not have a direct 
ongoing customer relationship or renewal rights. 
in the future, our Kpis will be reported on a Core 
r enewable basis only as we believe this represents 
a more accurate picture of our customer numbers 
and associated Kpis (policies, policies per 
customer, retention etc). t his change in approach 
only impacts our UK membership business as all of 
our international businesses already report Kpis on 
a Core r enewable basis.

t he financial performance reported for our

 of £8.7m in our 
international membership divisions was reduced 
by £0.4m as a result of adverse foreign currency 
movements, reflecting the seasonality of the 
business and weighting of profits towards the 
second half.  
aCq Uisitions
h omeserve continues to add to its organic 
growth through the completion of carefully 
selected acquisitions. acquisition expenditure 
during the year totalled £25.5m, including the 
purchase of sFg (£15.6m), acquisitions within our 
UK plumbing and drainage business (£7.0m), and 
r eactfast (£2.0m), with a further £0.9m of deferred 
consideration paid in relation to acquisitions 
completed in prior years. after the year end, we 
announced the acquisition of n ational g rid energy 
services’ contract business for net consideration of 
$14m. t his transaction is expected to complete by 
the end of august 2010. 
r isKs and Un Certainties
t here are a number of potential risks and 
uncertainties that could have an impact on the 
g roup’s performance as detailed below.
Finan Cial r isK
as part of its ordinary activities, h omeserve  
is exposed to a number of financial risks,  
principally liquidity risk and credit risk. t he g roup 
has policies and procedures on how these risks  
will be monitored and managed.
l iquidity risk relates to the g roup’s ability to meet 
the cash flow requirements of the operations, while 
avoiding excessive levels of debt. 
t he g roup’s borrowings are principally in the form 
of short and medium-term revolving credit facilities, 
which can be drawn down on demand, providing 
flexible access to debt when required. t he total 
amount available under the facility is £150m and the 
renewal date is december 2012. t he amount of any 
committed undrawn facilities is closely monitored by 
the Board on a regular basis.
t he business is not currently exposed to significant 
foreign currency risk in relation to overseas 
transactions. h owever, as the overseas businesses 
grow, its exposure to risks relating to the translation 
of overseas profits increases. t hese risks are kept 
under constant review and policies exist to mitigate 
them should they increase in significance.
Credit risk principally relates to trade receivables 
from customers. detailed policies and procedures 
for the assessment of all customers are in place 
including reviewing credit history and setting 
appropriate credit limits before trading commences. 
t he majority of our trade receivable balances within 
our continuing operations relate to our membership 
customers who pay for their policies on a monthly 
or quarterly basis through continuous payment 
methods, such as direct debit.
in terest rate ris K
t he g roup’s exposure to the risks of changes in 
market interest rates relates primarily to the g roup’s 
long-term debt requirements with floating interest 
rates. t he g roup’s policy is to manage its interest 
cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. 
to manage this, the g roup enters into interest 
rate swaps for certain periods, in which the g roup 
agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the 
difference between fixed and variable rate interest 
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed 
upon notional principal amount. t hese swaps are 
designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.  
30 BUsiness r evieW
h omeserve  
annual r eport & accounts 2010 Commer Cial relationships
Underpinning the success in each of our chosen 
markets are close commercial relationships with a 
number of utility companies, household insurers, 
household appliance manufacturers and furniture 
retailers. many of these are long-term contractual 
relationships and the loss of these relationships 
could have a significant effect on the g roup’s future 
profitability and cash flows. t his risk is managed 
through regular reviews and contact with the senior 
management of these customers in order to ensure 
that we respond to their needs and deliver the 
service that they expect.
Competitors
additionally, there are a number of other businesses 
that provide services that are similar to those of the 
g roup and as such could compete in one or more 
of our chosen markets. in order to address this risk, 
a regular review of the market and our position is 
undertaken and the activities of other participants 
are closely monitored. t he development of 
innovative products and solutions which address 
the needs of our customers is seen as paramount  
to maintaining our competitive advantage. 
g o ing Co n Cern
t he g roup’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Chairman’s statement. principal risks and 
uncertainties are detailed in this review. in addition, 
this review includes, amongst other things, cash 
flow and financing information.
t he directors confirm that, after reviewing the 
g roup’s budget and cash flows, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the g roup has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts. 
sUmmary
i am pleased to report another very good financial 
performance for h omeserve for the year. o ur 
membership businesses have once again 
delivered strong levels of profit growth including 
an increased contribution from our international 
operations. With the UK delivering another good 
year including customer growth of 3% and a 
significant increase in our international footprint, 
the g roup is well placed to continue to deliver 
further profitable growth this financial year and 
into the future. t he business continues to generate 
strong levels of cash conversion and this, combined 
with low financial gearing enables us to access the 
funds required to make strategic acquisitions and 
accelerate development as a membership-focused 
business.

Comm Un ity
h omeserve has always been committed to the 
community in which it operates. t his year the 
business has increased its focus on the community 
and has formed its first national community 
partnership in the UK with marie Curie Cancer 
Care. 
marie Curie looks after approximately 30,000 
patients each year who are terminally ill. 5,000 
patients are cared for in their eight UK hospices, 
but the vast majority of patients are cared for in 
their own homes by their relatives and marie Curie 
nurses.  
h omeserve chose marie Curie as our first 
national charity partner because, in addition to 
the traditional fundraising channels, we are in a 
unique position to help marie Curie patients in their 
own homes. Utilising our network of tradesmen 
and engineers, we plan to undertake emergency 
and repair work in patients’ homes to provide 
support to them during their illness.
h omeserve has pledged to raise £1,000,000 
for marie Curie over the next three years (april 
2010 – march 2013). t he target will be made 
up of employee fundraising and volunteering, 
customer donations, sponsorship and gift-in-kind 
contributions.  initiatives for 2010/11 include:
•  l aunching a marie Curie Complete Cover 
patient policy
h omeserve aims to give each patient being cared 
for in their own home free cover for all home 
emergencies and repairs. a pilot test will be 
launched this summer to 2,000 patients. 
• sponsorship of Walk ten
marie Curie has three flagship events each year: 
t he g reat daffodil appeal; Blooming g reat tea 
party and now, Walk ten. h omeserve is delighted 
to announce that we are to be the headline 
sponsor for the launch of Walk ten in august and 
september 2010. h omeserve’s cash sponsorship 
of Walk ten contributes towards our fundraising 
target.
Walk ten is a series of 10k walks in the grounds 
of n ational trust properties and stately homes 
throughout the UK, which finish at 10:00pm  
– marking the start of the marie Curie nurse  
night shift.  
• employee fundraising
to encourage employee participation h omeserve 
has set fundraising targets for each of our four 
regional sites (Banbury, preston, Walsall and 
Weston). t hese targets are based on the number 
of employees working out of each site and equate 
to approximately £20 per employee per year. 
every £20 raised pays for one hour of marie Curie 
nursing care. a Fundraising Calendar of events for 
the next 12 months is to be agreed with each site.
• pennies for patients
t he pennies for patients payroll scheme enables 
employees to donate the loose change from their 
monthly wage direct to marie Curie. o ver 1,000 
employees currently contribute to marie Curie 
within their monthly pay. 
• volunteering
volunteering is promoted and encouraged by 
h omeserve and our ‘employee volunteering policy’ 
stipulates that all full-time employees may use up 
to 16 hours of work time per annum (at full pay) for 
volunteering projects. We will now aim to integrate 
this with marie Curie activity.
in addition to our partnership with marie Curie, 
h omeserve is also proud to support ad-hoc charity 
appeals throughout the year. t his year, these have 
included Comic r elief, sport r elief and Children  
in n eed.
For sports r elief in 2010, h omeserve committed to 
opening 70 donation lines during the live BBC show 
(7.00pm – midnight). 120 volunteers (h omeserve 
employees, family and friends) answered nearly 
4,000 calls and raised over £125,000.
h omeserve is also focused on supporting local 
charities. amongst other things, the business 
provides annual grants for 25 local youth teams 
linked to h omeserve employees. 
Cause related marketing
in addition to our employee fundraising and 
business donations, we recognise that our 
customers may also be interested in supporting 
our national charity, marie Curie. t herefore, as part 
of our relationship with marie Curie Cancer Care 
we intend to integrate ‘cause related marketing’ 
into our acquisition and cross sales marketing 
activity, to enable our customers to support our 
community plans. t his summer we are running 
a test which will enable customers to opt in to 
donate £1 to marie Curie. Customers will be able to 
tick a box, that will be printed on the letters that we 
send them to donate £1, when they take out a new 
or upgrade an existing policy. t hese donations will 
contribute towards our fundraising target. 
an example of how a customer donation could be 
requested is shown below:

during the year h omeserve implemented ethical 
& sustainable procurement policies to work in 
conjunction with their main procurement policy. 
t hese policies have now been integrated into the 
general procurement process and all tenders that 
are issued are now in line with these requirements. 
in this way h omeserve aims to apply its 
responsible, sustainable and ethical principles 
throughout its supply chain in all dealings with its 
goods and service providers. 
employees
o ver the last year h omeserve has reviewed and 
refocused its business values, ensuring they align 
to our Company vision, mission and strategy. in 
addition, the Company has undertaken research 
into the key leadership behaviours which have 
made h omeserve successful, bring our values to 
life, and support our continued expansion. six key 
leadership characteristics have now been agreed 
and defined and will form one of the foundations of 
our recruitment and development strategies.
h omeserve is committed to developing talent 
within its businesses, and has introduced a formal 
succession planning programme, complementing 
the performance management process and 
overseen by the executive Committee. t he 
Committee formally reviews available talent and 
key current and future opportunities twice a year, 
ensuring a planned and robust approach to 
resourcing, development, and the appointment of 
individuals to key roles. 
We have successfully employed interns in our 
French joint venture for some time, and have now 
introduced a graduate training scheme into our 
UK membership business. Four graduates have 
been appointed to roles in the UK marketing 
department, an approach which allows them 
to benefit from practical experience as well as a 
formal development programme. Feedback from 
both graduates and managers is very encouraging 
and the Company plans to extend the scheme into 
other businesses in due course.
We have developed an accredited training and 
development programme for our call centre staff 
in the UK, providing them with training which 
is externally recognised as well as improving 
personal and business performance. t he Company 
has actively supported trade apprenticeships for 
some time and this commitment will be enhanced 
with the establishment of a formal, accredited 
apprenticeship programme for plumbing and 
drainage engineers in 2010. 
We continue to recognise the importance of 
effective communication with both managers and 
employees. t he Company’s strategy has been 
circulated as a booklet to all employees in the UK 
and will be cascaded to all employees as part of the 
annual performance management and objective 
setting process. We are also continuing to make 
effective use of Company intranets, staff magazines 
and employee representative forums both to 
disseminate information and to receive feedback 
and ideas from employees regarding business 
strategy and performance. 
t he Company’s employee recognition scheme, 
h omeserve h eroes, has seen dozens of staff 
recognised and rewarded for their contribution to 
h omeserve’s success with a second annual award 
ceremony being held in June 2010. 
h ealth and sa Fety
h omeserve has continued to strive to successfully 
manage health and safety and where possible, 
deliver improvements in its performance. 
h omeserve’s strategy is to ensure compliance 
with legal standards as a minimum, but where 
practicable adopt good industry practice, whilst 
ensuring good practice is shared across the 
businesses. 
during the last 12 months h omeserve has continued 
to engage proactively with its customers, clients, 
contractors and partners. h omeserve has had 
limited contact with the health and safety enforcing 
authorities during this reporting period, with no 
prosecutions or other enforcement action being 
taken against the Company for breaches of health 
and safety regulations.
36 Co rporate r esponsi Bility
h omeserve  
annual r eport & accounts 2010 during the last year the Company has undergone 
a significant restructure, including the disposal of 
a number of its operating businesses, however 
during this period the effective management of 
health and safety has remained a key business 
driver. t he Company has consistently achieved an 
acceptable health and safety record through good 
leadership from the senior management team, 
the employment of competent health and safety 
professionals and active engagement with the 
workforce.
each of the operating businesses is required to 
have a specific h ealth and safety policy which is 
underpinned by an appropriate management 
system that ensures an effective risk assessment 
process exists within those businesses. a key 
element for the effective management of health and 
safety within the organisation is the development 
of a culture in which line management actively 
demonstrates ownership of health and safety 
issues. h omeserve expects each of its operating 
businesses to ensure compliance with relevant 
health and safety legislation regardless of the 
country in which it is operating. martin Bennett is 
the main Board director responsible for reporting  
on health and safety, but the Board as a whole 
remains responsible for health and safety issues 
across the g roup. 
t here are a number of good practices being 
implemented within the UK businesses to ensure 
the continued safety of stakeholders. h omeserve 
continues to believe, and drives the principle that, 
line management must own and take responsibility 
for the effective management of the health and 
safety process. 
o ver the last two years h omeserve has invested 
in the use of proprietary training packages such as 
‘iosh managing safety’ and ‘iosh h ealth and safety 
for senior managers’ to ensure its managers have 
the correct toolkits for managing health and safety 
effectively. in addition, during the year, the network 
management business in the UK has achieved 
the r ospa ‘silver’ award for its health and safety 
performance.
h omeserve has continued to maintain acceptable 
standards of performance in terms of health and 
safety throughout the year, one measure of that 
performance is its accident and injury rates. during 
2009/10 the accident rate across the UK operating 
businesses has continued to show an improving 
trend, although this was contributed to by the 
disposal of some businesses that operated in a 
potentially higher risk environment, such as the 
g lass and l ocks business and the property r epair 
business.
n umber of riddor reportable incidents
in the UK, under the requirements of the r eporting 
of injuries, diseases and dangerous o ccurrences 
r egulations 1995 (r iddor ) certain types of 
accidents or incidents need to be reported to the 
h ealth and safety executive. h omeserve has had a 
good year in terms of the number of the reportable 
incidents with no fatalities, no defined major 
injuries or dangerous occurrences. h owever it did 
have a total of 16 defined ‘3 day’ r iddor reportable 
lost-time incidents, but this is a reduction from 
the previous year’s performance in which 37 such 
incidents were recorded. 
in total during this period there were 126 accidents 
recorded, of which eight accidents required an 
employee to attend hospital for treatment. o verall 
a total of 252 working days were lost as a result of 
work related accidents.
as with previous years the main causes of the 
accidents or incidents were in respect of manual 
handling, slips, trips and falls, cuts and bruises 
or muscular strains. t he overall incident rate for 
reportable incidents per 1,000 employees was 5.69, 
compared with a rate of 7.59 the previous year.
37 h omeserve continues to see the management 
of its contractors as critical to the effective 
management of health and safety risks. to improve 
the current process there has been continued 
investment in the internal auditing resource. a 
significant amount of time is spent working with 
contractors who work on domestic gas systems 
to ensure excellent standards of health and safety 
are achieved.
h omeserve ensures employees receive 
occupational health support when required  
and this is currently provided by the business  
h r functions. 
although a number of achievements have been 
made by the business in effectively managing 
health and safety it is expected that successful 
health and safety will remain a continued priority 
for h omeserve, with particular emphasis being 
placed on the continued reduction in the overall 
accident rate.
en vironment
to continue to improve the governance, control and 
environmental performance of the business this 
year, h omeserve has continued to deliver several 
existing initiatives while developing several new 
environmental initiatives and projects.
g overnance
t he environmental steering Committee, which 
was set up in 2008 and chaired by Brian Whitty, 
continued to meet on a quarterly basis throughout 
the year. t he steering committee has provided 
direction for the environmental strategy of 
the Company and senior level support for the 
changes which have been made to improve the 
environmental management and performance of 
the business.
going forward the environmental steering 
committee will become a key part of the corporate 
responsibility steering committee. 
environmental management system
as an essential business tool which supports the 
business to operate in a controlled and compliant 
way, h omeserve is continuing to develop its 
environmental management system and plans to 
have the system operating across the UK business 
this financial year. 
t he benefits of having an environmental 
management system will include; having 
environmental objectives which the Company will 
commit to achieving, having a clear environmental 
statement and policy which the Company will 
commit to delivering against, ensuring that 
environmental management is embedded 
across the Company as part of business as usual 
operations; improved control through the integration 
of new or enhanced processes which will prevent 
environmental incidents arising. 
Fleet initiatives
t he commercial fleet of h omeserve contributes the 
highest proportion of carbon to our carbon footprint. 
We are therefore focusing on reducing the impact 
the fleet has on the environment by improving  
the fuel efficiency of the vehicles which constitute 
our fleet.
t he initiatives which have been implemented this 
year and will continue during 2010/2011 include the 
following;
• every van will have a telematics system 
installed to enable the business to monitor, 
amongst other measures, speed and the 
distance it has travelled in any given period.
• a league table of the commercial fleet drivers, 
showing the fuel efficiency levels each person 
is achieving, is used to encourage employees 
to drive more efficiently. a prize incentive will 
be given to the employee who achieves the 
highest fuel efficiency levels over the year.
• a move to newer and more fuel efficient 
commercial vans from 2010.
in addition, our current company car list has been 
reviewed, with the highest carbon dioxide emission 
levels per kilometre vehicle being reduced from 
225gCo
2
/km to 180gCo
2
/km. employees can now 
select vehicles with emission levels as low as 
118gCo
2
/km.

annual r eport & accounts 2010 HomeServe’s carbon footprint
At HomeServe we are committed to measuring our 
carbon footprint. Analysis of the data will enable 
us to focus attention on the areas which when 
improved, will benefit both the business and the 
climate. In 2009/10 we emitted 16,048 tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO
2
e). Of this 9,897 
tCO
2
e was emitted by the membership businesses 
and 6,151 tCO
2
e by the discontinued operations.
Energy efficiency
Reducing the amount of energy our offices 
consume is a key area of focus this year. 
HomeServe will be seeking to invest in projects 
which will lower our total energy consumption 
and our carbon footprint by 320 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent. To enable us to achieve this we 
are aiming to:
• Implement software which will ensure that 
PCs and monitors are automatically switched 
off at the end of the working day.
• Invest in the heating, ventilation and cooling 
system at our head office by installing 
centralised control over the whole system, 
which will ensure a more efficient use of 
energy. 
• Continue to install passive infra red sensors in 
our offices so that the lighting goes off when 
the offices are unoccupied.
Recycling
At the start of 2010 we reached an agreement 
with a waste management company that is now 
working with HomeServe to support us in recycling 
as much of our waste as possible, with the aim of 
diverting all waste away from landfill by 2012.
Now that we have recycling facilities in place 
across the UK business we aim to set recycling 
targets this year and to further drive the “reduce, 
reuse and recycle” message to employees to 
ensure we achieve the targets we set. 
Reducing our paper consumption
As a business which relies heavily on direct mail 
to communicate with our customers we utilise 
thousands of tonnes of paper each year. However 
we are continually looking into ways of reducing 
the impact of the paper we use. All of our direct 
mail packs are made using sustainably sourced 
wood (PEFC).
Employee travel 
To encourage our employees to travel to work 
using low carbon modes of transport we launched 
the HomeServe Cycle2Work scheme in partnership 
with Halfords in the summer of 2009. The scheme 
is a tax efficient way for employees to purchase a 
bicycle which they use to travel to and from work 
for some or all of their journeys. The scheme has 
been well received and will continue to be offered 
to employees this year.

annual r eport and accounts for the year ended 
31 March 2010.
Pr In c IPaL ac TIv ITIeS
During the year the Group was engaged in the 
provision of insured repair solutions and 
emergency services to the home. Details of the 
Group’s activities and a review of the business are 
set out in the c hairman’s statement, c hief 
executive’s review and Financial review on pages 
3 to 31.
Details of the key performance indicators used by 
the Directors to assist in the management of the 
business and to provide evidence of the 
achievement of its strategies are included on 
page 9.
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group is included in the 
Financial r eview.
Information relating to the environment and 
employees is included in the c orporate 
responsibility report. 
FIn anc IaL re SULTS an D DIv IDen DS
The Group’s results are shown in the Group 
income statement on page 70. The Directors are 
recommending the payment on 4 august 2010 of 
a final dividend of 8.5p per ordinary share to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 2 July 2010 which, together with the 
net interim dividends of 11.5p per ordinary share 
paid on 3 January 2010 and 24.0p per ordinary 
share paid on 1 april 2010, results in a total net 
dividend for the year of 44.0p per share (2009: 
35.5p). For further details of the dividend see note 
12 to the financial statements.
c aPITaL STr Uc TUr e
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, 
together with details of the movements in the 
c ompany’s issued share capital during the year 
are shown in note 26. The c ompany has one class 
of ordinary shares which carries no right to fixed 
income. each share carries the right to one vote at 
a general meeting of the c ompany.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are 
both governed by the general provisions of the 
articles of association and prevailing legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the c ompany’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in 
note 38. n o votes are cast in respect of the shares 
held in the employee Benefit Trust and dividends 
are waived.
n o person has any special rights of control over 
the c ompany’s share capital and all issued 
shares are fully paid. Subject to the c ompanies 
act 2006 and any relevant authority of the 
c ompany in general meeting, the c ompany has 
authority to issue new shares.
The aGM held in 2009 authorised the Directors to 
allot shares in the capital of the c ompany up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £2,841,739 (being 
approximately 35% of the then issued share 
capital) with a further authority to allot shares up 
to a maximum nominal value of £406,462 (being 
approximately 5% of the then issued share 
capital) as if statutory pre-emption rights did  
not apply.
The authorities given to the Directors to allot 
shares at the 2009 aGM were granted for a 
period expiring at the 2010 aGM of the c ompany 
or 31 o ctober 2010, if earlier. Similar resolutions 
will be put to the forthcoming aGM to renew this 
authority.
The 2009 aGM authorised the purchase by the 
c ompany of up to 6,535,405 ordinary shares 
(being approximately 10% of the then issued 
share capital) and this authority will remain 
available until the forthcoming aGM, when the 
granting of a similar authority will be proposed. 
n o shares were purchased during the year and 
no shares are held in Treasury.
There are a number of agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the c ompany such as commercial contracts, 
bank loan agreements, property lease 
arrangements and employees’ share plans. n one 
of these are considered to be significant in terms 
of their likely impact on the business of the Group 
as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not 
aware of any agreements between the c ompany 
and its Directors and employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid.

It is the Group’s policy that all persons should be 
considered for employment, training, career 
development and promotion on the basis of their 
abilities and aptitudes, regardless of physical 
ability, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion or 
ethnic origin. 
HomeServe plc and its subsidiaries apply 
employment policies that are fair and equitable 
for all employees and these ensure that entry 
into, and progression within the Group, are 
determined solely by application of job criteria 
and personal ability and competency.
Full and fair consideration (having regard to the 
person’s particular aptitudes and abilities) is given 
to applications for employment and the career 
development of disabled persons. HomeServe’s 
training and development policies also make it 
clear that it will take all steps practicable to 
ensure that employees who become disabled 
during the time they are employed by the Group 
are able to remain employed by the Group.
eMPLo Yee In vo Lv eMen T
HomeServe attaches considerable importance to 
ensuring that all its employees are provided with 
information concerning them as employees, 
particularly the economic and financial factors 
affecting its performance and the market in which 
it operates. Involvement of employees in the 
Group’s performance is also encouraged by the 
availability of performance-related bonuses as 
well as share option schemes, which are 
described in more detail elsewhere in this report. 
We continue to make effective use of c ompany 
intranets, staff magazines and employee 
representative forums both to disseminate 
information and to receive feedback and ideas 
from employees regarding business strategy and 
performance. c onsultation between 
management and staff is an ongoing process 
and employees are consulted on issues directly 
affecting them as soon as is practicable.

annual r eport & accounts 2010
DIrec To r S’ rePo r T HomeServe complied throughout the year with 
the provisions set out in the c ombined c ode 
published by the UK Financial r eporting c ouncil in 
2003 as updated in June 2008 (‘the c ode’).
The manner in which the c ompany applies the 
principles of good governance contained in the 
c ode is described in the appropriate parts of this 
annual r eport and accounts. Thus the application 
by the c ompany of the c ode’s principles relating 
to remuneration matters in the r emuneration 
report on pages 52 to 65 should be read in 
conjunction with the statement below. a review of 
the Group’s position and prospects is set out in 
the c hairman’s statement, the c hief executive’s 
review and the Financial review on pages 3 to 31.
THe Boar D
The Board of Directors leads and controls the 
c ompany by holding 10 meetings a year at which 
its current and forecast performance is reviewed 
and monitored. r egular reports on monthly 
performance and other matters of importance to 
the Group ensure that the Board is supplied in a 
timely manner with the information necessary to 
make informed judgements. In addition, the 
Board holds regular meetings at least annually, 
also attended by senior operational 
management, to devise and discuss the 
c ompany’s medium and long-term strategic focus 
and management development strategy. r egular 
formal and informal presentations are given and 
meetings held in order to inform Directors of 
issues of importance affecting the Group. 
o ccasionally, meetings of the Board are held at 
the c ompany’s operating sites other than Walsall, 
in order to afford the Board, particularly the 
n on-executive Directors, with the opportunity to 
meet with local management.
In accordance with the provisions of its articles of 
association and with the c ode, each Director is 
subject to election by the c ompany’s 
shareholders at the annual General Meeting 
immediately following his appointment and is 
subject to re-election at least every three years 
thereafter.
The Board has a Schedule of Matters specifically 
reserved to it for decision and has approved the 
written terms of reference of the various 
committees to which it has delegated its authority 
in certain matters. Matters reserved to the Board 
include the recommendation or approval of 
dividends, the approval of preliminary and interim 
financial statements, major financial 
commitments, the acquisitions of significant 
companies or businesses, appointments to the 
Board and its audit, r emuneration and 
n omination committees, the c ompany’s future 
strategy and its internal controls. It also provides 
that the Board receive regular updates from the 
chairmen of its committees.
During the year the Board was led by Brian Whitty, 
the executive c hairman, who also served as a 
member of the Board’s n omination c ommittee.
The c hairman’s responsibilities were clearly 
defined in a written specification agreed by the 
Board and which made clear the division of 
responsibilities between the executive c hairman 
and the c hief executive. They included the smooth 
running of the Board, effective communication 
between executive and n on-executive Directors 
and the general progress and long-term 
development of the Group. His executive 
responsibilities included the management of the 
emergency Services businesses and those 
relating to property, legal and governance 
matters.
Brian Whitty retired on 31 March 2010 and Barry 
Gibson was appointed as n on-executive 
c hairman. Mr Gibson’s responsibilities have been 
clearly set out in his letter of appointment.
The Board has established a formal procedure for 
Directors wishing to seek independent legal and 
other professional advice and all members of the 
Board have access to the advice and services of 
the c ompany Secretary.
The day-to-day running of HomeServe’s business 
is delegated to an executive c ommittee which is 
led by r ichard Harpin, c hief executive. o ther 
members of the executive c ommittee include Jon 
Florsheim, Martin Bennett and the c hief 
executives of HomeServe europe and 
HomeService USa.
During the year, four independent n on-executive 
Directors (Messrs Gibson, c hippendale, Morris 
and Sibbald) with extensive business, finance and 
marketing backgrounds, provided the Board with 
a breadth of experience and with independent 
judgement. Barry Gibson served as the 
c ompany’s independent Senior n on-executive 
Director until 31 March 2010 when he was 
replaced by Ian c hippendale. 
c o r Po ra Te Go vernance
47 The Board actively encourages all Directors to 
deepen their knowledge of their roles and 
responsibilities and to gain a clear understanding 
of the Group and the environment in which it 
operates; and has adopted a formal policy on the 
induction and training of Directors. n ewly 
appointed Board members are required to 
undergo an induction programme, which includes 
obtaining a thorough understanding of the 
Group’s various operations, and they have the 
opportunity to receive formal training from 
external providers if they wish. During the year, 
the n on-executive Directors have met with various 
members of the Group’s management teams and 
external advisers. 
The Board has implemented a formal process for 
reviewing its own effectiveness, that of its 
r emuneration and audit committees and its 
individual members. In addition, it continued to 
ensure that regular meetings of the n on-
executive Directors were held without the 
executive Directors, and at least once a year, 
without the c hairman present, in order to 
evaluate his performance. The evaluation 
process, which was conducted by the c hairman 
and c ompany Secretary, was concluded in March 
2010. Directors completed evaluation 
questionnaires and a formal written report 
summarising their views and containing 
recommendations to further improve the 
effectiveness of the Board was prepared and 
reviewed by the whole Board in March 2010. The 
Board concluded that it was operating effectively, 
although a number of recommendations for 
further improvement were approved. 
c o MMITTeeS
The Board operates a number of committees to 
which it has delegated certain specific 
responsibilities and each of which has formally 
adopted terms of reference. These comprise the 
n omination, audit and r emuneration 
c ommittees. The terms of reference of each of the 
Board’s committees are available on request from 
the c ompany Secretary.
a r isk c ommittee, comprising certain executive 
Directors and members of the executive 
c ommittee, operates across the Group and is 
chaired by Martin Bennett. Its terms of reference 
have been approved by the Board and its purpose 
is to establish the Group’s risk appetite, to 
evaluate the risk registers compiled by each of its 
businesses, to monitor the effectiveness of its 
action plans for the mitigation of those risks, and 
to report thereon to the audit c ommittee and the 
Board, which retains responsibility for the overall 
evaluation of the Group’s risk management 
processes.
n o MIn aTIo n c o MMITTee
The n omination c ommittee, which makes 
recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment of Directors, was under normal 
circumstances chaired by Brian Whitty with the 
other members being the independent  
n on-executive Directors. This c ommittee met 
informally to consider the position of c hief 
Financial o fficer to which Martin Bennett was 
appointed on 26 June 2009. Following this, 
andrew Sibbald assumed the role of c hairman of 
the c ommittee, heading up the process to identify 
a n on-executive c hairman. Messrs c hippendale, 
Morris and Harpin sat on the c ommittee for this 
purpose and met informally on a number of 
occasions and formally twice before a 
recommendation was made to the Board.
The c ommittee draws on the advice of such 
professional advisers as it considers necessary 
and did so during the year in respect of both the 
c hairman and c hief Financial o fficer 
appointments.
Its duties also include the review of the size, 
structure and composition of the Board, and 
succession planning for Directors and other senior 
managers. During the year, these duties were 
undertaken by the Board itself.
aUDIT c o MMITTee
The audit c ommittee was chaired by Mark Morris 
who comes from a strong financial background 
having worked in audit, business advisory and 
corporate finance before becoming a plc finance 
director. The c ommittee comprises only 
independent n on-executive Directors with 
Barry Gibson and Ian c hippendale being the 
other members.

annual r eport & accounts 2010 The c ommittee meets regularly to review the 
preliminary and interim results before they are 
presented to the Board, to receive reports from 
the c ompany’s internal and external auditors and 
to make recommendations to the Board on 
accounting policies. Its primary duties include the 
monitoring, on behalf of the Board, of compliance 
with and the effectiveness of the c ompany’s 
accounting and internal control systems. The 
c ommittee’s duties also include agreeing audit 
strategy, monitoring the scope and results of the 
c ompany’s annual audit and the independence 
and objectivity of its auditors. The internal and 
external auditors and the c hief Financial o fficer 
are invited but are not entitled to attend all 
meetings. Where appropriate, other executive 
Directors also attend meetings at the c hairman’s 
invitation. The external and internal auditors are 
provided with the opportunity to raise any matters 
or concerns that they may have, in the absence of 
the executive Directors, whether at c ommittee 
meetings or, more informally outside of them.
The c ommittee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board for a resolution to 
be put to the shareholders for their approval in 
general meeting for the appointment of the 
external auditors, the approval of their 
remuneration and their terms of engagement.
The c ommittee has implemented a policy relating 
to the use of the external auditors for non-audit 
services and monitors fees paid in respect of such 
services. This policy provides that, excluding 
certain specialist services, the total fees payable 
to the auditor for non-audit related work in any 
financial year should not normally be more than 
50% of the total fees payable in respect of audit 
and compliance services. In addition any 
proposed spend over a predetermined limit must 
be approved by the c ommittee. This year due to 
the sale and closure of the emergency Services 
businesses and some specific projects agreed in 
2008/9 but completed in 2009/10, external 
auditor fees for non-audit services exceeded the 
audit fees. 
The c ommittee has also agreed and 
implemented a procedure for reviewing and 
assessing its own effectiveness and that of the 
internal and external audit process. The results of 
the last review of the external audit process were 
considered by the audit c ommittee in May 2010.

The c ommittee was chaired throughout the year 
by Ian c hippendale. The c ommittee comprises 
only independent n on-executive Directors, Barry

The r emuneration c ommittee’s responsibilities 
include determining the Group’s overall 
remuneration strategy and the remuneration 
packages of the executive Directors and other 
members of the executive c ommittee, after 
having consulted with the c hairman and c hief 
executive and having received professional advice 
from remuneration consultants. The c ommittee is 
also responsible for approving the grant and 
exercise of executive long-term incentive 
arrangements. In determining remuneration 
policy, the c ommittee is free to obtain such 
professional advice as it sees fit, and regularly 
monitors both the policies of comparator 
companies and current market practice, in order 
to ensure that the packages provided are 
sufficient to attract and retain executive Directors 
of the necessary quality.
The c ommittee has also agreed and 
implemented a procedure for reviewing and

The Board, on the c ompany’s behalf, recognises 
the need to maintain an active dialogue with its 
shareholders. The c hief executive and c hief 
Financial o fficer meet regularly with institutional 
investors and analysts to discuss the c ompany’s 
performance and all shareholders have access to 
the c hairman and independent Senior n on-
executive Director, who are available to discuss 
any questions which investors may have in 
relation to the running of the c ompany. The Board 
encourages shareholders to attend the annual 
General Meeting and is always willing to answer 
questions, either in the meeting itself or, more 
informally, afterwards. In addition, shareholders 
may contact HomeServe direct, either through its 
website or by telephoning its offices.
The Board also recognises the need to ensure 
that all Directors are fully aware of the views of 
major shareholders about the Group. c opies of all 
analysts’ research relating to the c ompany are 
circulated to Directors upon publication, monthly 
analyses of the c ompany’s shareholder register 
are made available to the Board and written 
feedback from shareholders and analysts, 
prepared by the Group’s brokers and public 
relations advisers is provided to all Directors after 
every significant corporate event and at least 
twice a year.
Go In G concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
c hairman’s statement and the c hief executive’s 
review. Principal risks and uncertainties are 
detailed in the Financial review. In addition, the 
Financial review includes, amongst other things, 
cash flow and financing information.
The Directors confirm that, after reviewing the 
Group’s budget and projected cash flows, they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
In Terna L con Tr o LS
as required by the UK Listing authority, the 
c ompany has complied throughout the year with 
the provisions of the c ode relating to internal 
controls, having implemented the procedures 
necessary to comply with the guidance on 
internal control published in o ctober 2005 
(Turnbull Guidance) and to report in line with 
that guidance.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
Such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
There is an established internal control framework 
in place, which is continually reviewed and 
updated taking into account the changing 
nature of the Group’s operations. This process 
has been in place for the whole of the year and 
up to the date of approval of this annual r eport 
and accounts. 
c o r Po ra Te Go vernance 51
The key elements of the system operated by the 
Group to identify, evaluate and manage significant 
risks include the following:
• The Group’s management operates a formal 
process for identifying, managing and 
reporting on operational and financial risks 
faced by each of the Group’s businesses, 
whereby each of the risks identified is reviewed 
in detail by the executive Directors on a regular 
basis. Weekly telephone meetings of the 
executive c ommittee monitor its day-to-day 
performance, and full executive c ommittee 
meetings are held at least eight times a year 
at which the Group’s senior managers report 
on the progress of the companies or discipline 
for which they are responsible and share best 
practice. 
• a clearly defined organisation structure is in 
place with clear lines of accountability and 
appropriate division of duties. The Group’s 
financial regulations specify authorisation 
limits for individual managers and for local 
Boards of management, with all material 
transactions being approved by the Board.
•  Three year business plans, annual budgets 
and investment proposals for each business 
are formally prepared, reviewed and approved 
by the Board.
•  The Group has a dedicated Internal audit 
function which reports directly to the audit 
c ommittee and a formal audit plan is in place 
to address the key risks across the Group.
•  Financial results and cash flows, including a 
comparison with budgets and forecasts, are 
reported to the Board on a monthly basis, with 
variances being identified to initiate action to 
mitigate them.
•  appropriate treasury policies are in place.
• The c ommittee has adopted a formal 
‘whistleblowing’ policy for employees, 
franchisees and sub-contractors who wish to 
raise any issues of concern relating to the 
Group’s activities on a confidential basis. 
• a mechanism exists to extend the Group’s 
formal risk management processes to any 
significant new business acquired or 
established immediately upon acquisition  
or start-up. In this way, the Board is able to 
confirm that the necessary process has  
been operated by the Group for the whole  
of the year.
• The r isk c ommittee reviews a register 
summarising the significant risks faced by the 
businesses or the Group as a whole, the 
likelihood of those risks occurring and the 
steps being taken to minimise or otherwise 
manage those risks on a quarterly basis and 
updates the audit c ommittee and the Board 
regularly.
as required by the Turnbull Guidance, the Board 
has carried out an annual assessment of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls. 
The processes applied by the Board include:
•  at the end of the year, the executive Directors 
compile a report identifying the key risks 
faced by the Group. This report is considered 
by the r isk and audit c ommittees and by the 
Board before the annual r eport and 
accounts is approved.
•  The Group has an independent Internal audit 
function which reviews the overall 
effectiveness of the risk management 
process for the key risks and reports 
independently to the audit c ommittee.
• at each meeting the audit c ommittee 
reviews reports of the executive Directors and 
the internal and external auditors, on any 
issues identified as having a potentially 
substantial impact on the results of the 
Group, or areas of control weakness.
•  The audit c ommittee reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
managing financial risk and refers any risks it 
considers significant to the Board for its 
consideration. The r isk c ommittee meets at 
least quarterly to assist the audit c ommittee 
to monitor these risks, as well as to set the 
Group’s risk appetite and to evaluate in detail 
risk registers compiled by the Group’s 
businesses.
•  at least twice a year, the audit c ommittee 
reviews the work plans and results of each of 
the internal and external auditors.
•  The audit c ommittee c hairman reports the 
outcome of all audit c ommittee meetings to 
the Board, which also receives minutes of all 
such meetings. 52 Governance

The r emuneration c ommittee is responsible for 
determining and agreeing with the Board the pay, 
benefits and contractual arrangements for the 
executive Directors of the c ompany and other 
members of the executive c ommittee. It aims to 
develop and recommend remuneration strategies 
that drive performance and reward it 
appropriately. In determining its policy, the 
c ommittee has paid regard to the principles and 
provisions of good governance contained in the 
c ombined c ode published in July 2003 by the UK 
Financial r eporting c ouncil as updated in June 
2008 (‘the c ode‘). The c ommittee operates under 
the delegated authority of the Board and its terms 
of reference are available on request from the 
c ompany Secretary. 
Membership
The c ommittee was chaired throughout the year 
by Ian c hippendale. The other members of the 
c ommittee were Barry Gibson and Mark Morris.  
all of the members are independent n on-executive 
Directors. The Board has determined that the new 
c hairman, Barry Gibson, should remain a member 
of the c ommittee taking account of the fact that he 
is considered to be independent and also that, as 
a former c hairman of the r emuneration 
c ommittee, his knowledge of the development of 
the remuneration policy and practices at 
HomeServe is invaluable. He takes no part in 
discussions relating to his own remuneration.

During the year Hewitt n ew Bridge Street (’Hn BS‘), 
a firm of independent remuneration consultants, 
served as advisers to the c ommittee. The 
c ompany also instructed Hn BS to advise it on a 
limited number of remuneration matters 
concerning individuals below the executive 
c ommittee during the year. o ther than in relation 
to advice on remuneration, Hn BS has no other 
connections with the c ompany. The terms of 
engagement for Hn BS are available on request 
from the c ompany Secretary.
The c ommittee has also received assistance from 
Brian Whitty, the Group’s c hairman, r ichard 
Harpin, the c hief executive and anna Maughan, 
the c ompany Secretary, all of whom attended 
meetings of the c ommittee as required. n one 
took part in discussions in respect of matters 
relating directly to their own remuneration. 
r eMUn era TIo n Po LIc Y
The c ommittee’s remuneration policy for the 
remuneration of executive Directors and other 
senior executives is based on the following 
principles: 
• to provide a remuneration package that is 
sufficient, but no more than necessary, to 
attract, retain and motivate high calibre 
executives;
•  to align rewards with the Group’s 
performance;
•  to reward good performance with 
remuneration that is in line with that payable 
by broadly comparable businesses i.e. 
high-growth companies of a similar size and 
those with similar operating characteristics;
• to reward exceptional performance in such a 
way as to align the executives’ interests with 
those of the c ompany’s shareholders, with 
the potential to deliver above market levels of 
reward for outstanding performance.
r eMUn era TIo n re Po r T 53
To that end, the committee structures executive 
remuneration in two distinct parts: fi xed 
remuneration of basic salary, pension and 
benefi ts and variable performance-related 
remuneration in the form of a cash bonus and 
long-term incentive arrangements. remuneration 
for executive Directors is structured so that the 
variable pay element forms a signifi cant portion 
of each Director’s package. 
The charts below demonstrate the balance 
between fi xed and variable pay at ‘on-target’ and 
maximum performance levels, in the case of the 
long-term incentive arrangements assuming 
certain levels of share price growth. Maximum 
performance assumes the achievement of 
maximum bonus and full vesting of shares under 
the company’s long-term incentive arrangements.
They demonstrate the signifi cant weighting of the 
package towards variable (performance-related) 
pay. In particular, the majority of executive 
Directors’ total remuneration at the maximum 
performance level will derive from the company’s 
long-term incentive arrangements, which are 
strongly aligned to shareholder value creation.
The committee has the discretion to take into 
account performance on environmental, social 
and governance matters when setting the 
remuneration of the executive Directors. However, 
the committee has chosen not to take these into 
specifi c account in setting performance targets for 
2010/11 in the belief that the structures in place 
neither encourage nor reward inappropriate 
behaviour in this regard and that relevant 
operational controls relating to such matters are 
in place.

This is normally reviewed annually with any

Following a review undertaken by HNBS in March 
2009 the Committee determined that the top-half of 
the FTSE 250 was the most appropriate comparator 
group against which to benchmark salaries. 
Reflecting the desire to control fixed costs across the 
business, no pay increases were implemented as at 
1 April 2009 for either the Board or the members of 
the Executive Committee. The budgeted increase for 
the general workforce was 2%.
HNBS updated their review in February 2010 using 
the top-half of the FTSE 250 as a comparator group 
(at the time of the review the Company was ranked 
163rd in the FTSE). It was agreed that the basic 
salaries of the Board and Executive Committee 
be increased by 2% with effect from 1 April 2010. This 
was also the budgeted increase for the general 
workforce.
Current salaries are set out below:
Name of Director 2009/10 Salary 2010/11 Salary
R D Harpin £500,000 £510,000
M Bennett £300,000 £306,000
J Florsheim £500,000 £510,000
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward 
excellent short-term operating performance of the 
Company and encourage real year-on-year growth 
in profitability. No annual bonus is paid unless a very 
high level of profit performance is achieved. The 
maximum annual bonus for 2010/11 will be 
maintained at 100% of basic salary (with the 
exception of Jon Florsheim whose maximum bonus 
potential is unchanged at 150% of salary). 
During the year, Executive Directors were able to 
earn up to 80% of bonus potential for Group 
financial performance, measured by profit before 
tax, amortisation and exceptional items. The 
remaining 20% of bonus potential was based on 
measurable personal targets, relating to the part of 
the business or the function for which the Director is 
responsible. This weighting differed for Jon 
Florsheim who was able to earn a higher proportion 
of his bonus potential based on targets specifically 
related to the performance of UK Membership. 
For 2010/11 the maximum limits will remain the 
same and the weighting between business and 
personal objectives will remain 80% financial: 20% 
personal. Provided their personal objectives are met 
in full, the normal ‘on-target‘ bonus payable to 
Executive Directors in any year is expected to be  
in the region of 60% of their basic salary (90% for  
Jon Florsheim). 
Executive Directors’ bonuses are paid entirely in 
cash, though under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
adopted in 2008, Directors have the opportunity 
to invest part of their net bonus in shares. If they 
choose to do this, they may be awarded a 
matching award which is subject to a 
comparative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) 
performance condition and an EPS target.
Long-term incentives
The Committee’s policy for the provision of 
long-term incentives to Executive Directors is to 
grant awards of performance shares 
(performance awards) and to provide them with 
the opportunity to voluntarily invest their annual 
bonus into a matching share arrangement 
(matching awards) under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan adopted in 2008 (the ‘2008 LTIP’). 
The maximum individual award limit under the 
2008 LTIP is 200% of basic salary for performance 
awards and for matching awards of up to two 
shares for each share invested, based on a 
maximum investment of the net of tax equivalent 
of 75% of the maximum bonus potential. 
Consistent with the grant policy applied in 2008 
and 2009, the Committee intends to limit the size 
of performance share awards in 2010 to the 
Executive Directors to 150% of salary. Matching 
awards up to the maximum ratio of two shares 
for each invested share will continue to be 
granted. It should be noted that, under the plan 
rules, the executives may invest up to the lower of 
their actual bonus earned in the preceding 
financial year and 75% of their maximum bonus 
potential. In the event that actual bonuses are 
lower than 25% of salary, executives may 
invest up to 25% of salary in shares from their 
own money. 
The Committee has conducted a review of the 
performance targets to be attached to the 2010 
awards under the LTIP. Following the review the 
Committee concluded that TSR remains an 
important performance condition and should be 
retained. However, in order to balance this measure 
with one which provides a stronger link to the 
long-term financial performance of the Company, 
the Committee has decided that it would be 
appropriate to incorporate a stretching Earnings per 
Share (’EPS‘) target. The Committee considers that 
the use of both EPS and TSR creates a balance 
between internal financial and external relative 
stock market measures and both measures are 
aligned to shareholder value creation. 56 Governance
HomeServe  
annual r eport & accounts 2010
accordingly, 50% of the award of performance 
and matching shares will be subject to TSr 
targets. 25% of any award subject to TSr will vest 
if HomeServe’s TSr performance is equal to the 
FTSe-250 index, increasing in a straight line basis 
to 100% vesting where TSr performance exceeds 
the Index by an average of 15 percentage points 
per annum.
In determining the vesting of awards in any year 
under the TSr part of the award, the c ommittee 
will also take into account the underlying financial 
performance of the business. 
50% of the award will be subject to a target 
based on a range of ePS growth. 25% of any 
award subject to ePS will vest for average annual 
ePS growth of r PI + 4%, increasing in a straight 
line to 100% vesting where average annual ePS 
growth is r PI + 10%. 
For both conditions performance will be 
measured over a period of three financial years.
The fair value of LTIP awards granted in 2009 
was 60% of the face value of the share at the time 
of grant.
awards under the 2008 LTIP may be satisfied 
through a mixture of either market purchase or 
new issue shares. To the extent new issue shares 
are used, the 2008 LTIP will adhere to a 5% in 
10 year dilution limit.
executive Directors may also participate in the 
Group’s Save as You earn Scheme (where share 
options are exercisable after three or five years at 
a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the 
shares at the time of grant). n o performance 
criteria are attached to this scheme.
Benefits
n on-pension benefits comprise company car and 
fuel allowance and medical insurance. The range 
of benefits and their value are considered to be 
broadly in line with those provided to executive 
Directors in similar companies in the FTSe-250. 
Shareholding guidelines
It is the Board’s policy that executive Directors and 
certain members of the c ompany’s senior 
management build up and retain a minimum 
shareholding in the c ompany. each executive 
Director is encouraged to hold shares of at least 
equal value to his annual basic salary. 
accordingly, if the holding guideline has not been 
fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or 
the vesting of any other long-term incentive 
award, the Director must retain 50% of the net 
proceeds in the c ompany’s shares until the 
holding requirement is achieved. Details of the 
current shareholdings of the executive Directors 
are provided on page 61. 
Service contracts
The c ommittee’s policy is to offer service contracts 
with notice periods of one year or less (other than, 
in exceptional circumstances, where longer initial 
notice periods may be offered on appointment, 
and then reduced to one year over time).
all executive Directors’ contracts of service are 
terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. 
Further details of the executive Directors’ contracts 
are summarised in the table below:
n ame of Director Date of contract
r D Harpin 18 January 2002
M Bennett 26 June 2009
J Florsheim 5 March 2007
The company may terminate the executive’s 
employment by making a payment equivalent to 
one year’s remuneration (excluding bonus in the 
case of Martin Bennett). n otice periods and 
payments are not extendable in takeover 
situations.
Brian Whitty left the c ompany on 31 March 2010. 
Details of his termination package are provided in 
the notes to the emoluments table on page 59.
Pensions
executive Directors currently participate in one  
of two pension schemes, the Water c ompanies 
Pension Scheme (Wc PS) or the HomeServe  
Money Plan (HMP). The normal date of  
retirement for executive Directors is at age 60. 
Both arrangements are non-contributory for  
executive Directors.
r eMUn era TIo n re Po r T 57
The Wc PS is a funded, Inland r evenue approved 
occupational defined benefit scheme. Brian Whitty 
and r ichard Harpin were members of the Wc PS 
during the year. In respect of these Directors, its 
main features are:
•  pension at normal retirement age of one-half 
of final pensionable salary and a tax free 
lump sum of one and a half times final 
pensionable salary on completion of 40 
years’ service at an accrual rate of 80ths  
plus 
3
/80ths cash;
•  life assurance of five times pensionable 
salary for Brian Whitty or five times basic 
salary for r ichard Harpin;
•  pension payable in the event of ill health; and
• spouse’s pension on death. 
a notional earnings cap restricts the benefits 
provided to members of the Wc PS. In respect 
of r ichard Harpin, an unapproved pension 
payment, equal to 20% of the amount by which 
his basic salary exceeds the notional cap is paid 
annually. The notional cap is indexed in line with 
earnings inflation.
With effect from 6 april 2006, all of Brian Whitty’s 
retirement benefits were provided through the 
Wc PS, on the basis of a pension accrual rate of 
45ths of his basic salary for future service.
The HMP is a funded, Inland r evenue approved 
occupational defined contribution pension 
scheme. Jon Florsheim and Martin Bennett are 
members of the HMP. In respect of Martin 
Bennett, its main features are:
• employer contributions of 20%;
•  life assurance of five times basic salary;
•  permanent health insurance; and
•  spouse’s pension on death.
In respect of Jon Florsheim, its main features are:
• employer contributions of 8%;
•  life assurance of five times basic salary;
•  permanent health insurance; and
• spouse’s pension on death.
Where the benefits provided to executive Directors 
under the scheme are restricted as a result of the 
notional earnings cap described above, further 
provision is made by making a payment of 20% in 
cash of the amount by which his basic salary 
exceeds the cap in respect of Martin Bennett, and 
8% into the HMP in respect of Jon Florsheim.
n o n- ex ecUTIv e DIr ecTo r S
n on-executive Directors serve under letters of 
appointment for periods of three years. Previously 
these letters included provisions in respect of 
liquidated damages limited to the payment of 
one year’s fee. This provision has been reviewed 
during the year and removed. The n on-executive 
Directors now have a notice period of three 
months but no liquidated damages are payable. 
Their fees are determined by the executive 
Directors within the limits set by the articles of 
association and are based on information on fees 
paid in similar companies and the skills and 
expected time commitment of the individual 
concerned. n on-executive Directors are not 
entitled to bonus payments or pension 
arrangements, nor do they participate in the 
c ompany’s long-term incentive plans. 
Details of their current three year appointments 
are as follows:

The fees for the n on-executive Directors were last 
reviewed in January 2010 with the changes being 
effective from 1 april 2010. The fee policy for 
n on-executive Directors during the year was a 
base Board fee of £40,000, a £7,500 premium for 
c hairmanship of the audit and r emuneration 
c ommittees and a £2,500 fee for membership of 
those committees. During the year, Barry Gibson 
received an additional fee of £40,000 on top of his 
base and committee membership fees as Senior 
Independent Director. The Board considered the 
level of the additional fee to be appropriate taking 
into account the time commitment and the 
prominence of the role in the absence of a 
n on-executive c hairman. From 1 april 2010  
Barry Gibson will take up the role of n on-executive 
c hairman for which he will receive a fee of 
£200,000. 
With effect from 1 april 2010 the base Board fee 
will be £44,000 with a premium for c hairmanship 
of the audit and r emuneration c ommittees of 
£8,500. Ian c hippendale will receive an 
additional fee of £5,000 for his role as Senior 
Independent Director.  58 Governance

The price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2010 when Mr Whitty exercised options was £17.92.
The DBP was introduced in 2005. Under its terms, executive Directors were able to invest some or all of their 
annual bonus into shares and to defer receipt for three years. Matching shares could be earned if the TSr of 
the c ompany over a three year period exceeds the median of the FTSe-350 index of companies (excluding 
investment trusts).

there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the c ompany at the 
time of vesting.
Shares invested in the DBP by executive Directors may be withdrawn at any time but any entitlement to 
matching shares will be forfeit in such circumstances. 
at the end of the performance period for the 2006 awards, HomeServe’s was ranked between median and 
upper decile against the constituents of the FTSe 350 Index. accordingly 1.19 matching shares vested for 
each invested share out of a maximum three matching shares for each invested share. The price of an 
ordinary share on 26 June 2009, the date on which the 2006 invested shares vested was £14.81.
In relation to the 2007 awards, at March 2010 the c ompany’s TSr performance in the period from the date 
of grant of awards is below the upper decile in comparison with the comparator Group. If this performance 
were unchanged at the end of the performance period, the number of matching shares available to each 
participant would be 1.70.

³  Jonathan Simpson-Dent left on 26 June 2009 and was treated as a good leaver under the rules of the plan. His awards may vest at the end of the three year 
performance period subject to the performance conditions and will be pro-rated for time.
The market price of the c ompany’s shares on 23 June 2009, the date the awards were granted was £14.63. 
The performance conditions in respect of the 2008 LTIP awards granted in 2008 and 2009 are based 
exclusively on a TSr performance condition, as described in the unaudited section of this report in relation 
to the TSr part of the award.
For awards granted in 2008, as at 31 March 2010 the c ompany’s TSr performance was below that of the 
FTSe 250 Index. If this level of performance was maintained until the end of the performance period, no part 
of the performance or matching awards would vest. 
For awards granted in 2009, as at 31 March 2010 the c ompany’s TSr performance was greater than the 
Index but less than 15% p.a. compound. If this level of performance was maintained until the end of the 
performance period 41.4% and 33.7% respectively of the performance and matching awards made in June 
2009 would vest.
Genera L
The market price of the c ompany’s shares at 31 March 2010 was £17.92 (2009: £11.70). During the year the 
price ranged from £11.70 to £18.04.
The shares required for share options and awards under any of the long-term incentive schemes described 
above may be fulfilled by the purchase of shares in the market by the c ompany’s employee benefit trust 
(eBT). as beneficiaries under the eBT, the Directors are deemed to be interested in the shares held by the eBT 
which at 31 March 2010 amounted to 1,811,498 ordinary shares. Shares may also be fulfilled through newly 
issued shares, subject to the dilution limits within each scheme (fully compliant with investor guidelines).

in the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted  
in these financial statements.
Standards affecting presentation and disclosure
ias1 (revised 2007) presentation of Financial statements: ias1 (revised 2007) requires the presentation  
of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income. as a result, a statement of changes in equity has been included  
in the primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
amendment to ias38 intangible assets: ias38 has been amended to state that an entity is permitted to 
recognise a prepayment asset for advertising or promotional expenditure only up to the point at which the 
entity has the right to access the goods purchased or up to the point of receipt of the services. in the past 
Homeserve has recognised inventories of brochures as an asset up to the date of dispatch to the customer. 
t he adoption of this amendment has not resulted in any significant impact on these financial statements.

t he principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
basis of consolidation
t he consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the c ompany and entities 
controlled by the c ompany made up to 31 march each year. c ontrol is achieved where the c ompany has 
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities.
o n acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
t he results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group.
all intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
investments in joint ventures
t he Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the 
equity method of accounting. t he Group’s share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance 
sheet, including associated goodwill. based on the guidance of ias28 ‘investments in associates’, provision 
for the Group’s share of the joint venture losses are not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces 
the Group’s share of the joint venture’s net assets below zero.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture at the date 
of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an 
indication that it may be impaired. any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and 
is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. if the recoverable amount is less than the 
carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. an impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period.
o n disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to iFr ss has been retained at the previous 
UK Gaap amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves 
under UK Gaap prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal.
r evenue recognition
r evenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts 
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, vat and other 
sales related taxes.
n otes to t He Financial statements
year en DeD 31 marc H 2010 r evenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Group’s role as an intermediary in 
the policy sale and administration process. any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are 
rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Group’s role is only as an intermediary in 
the cash collection process, are not included in revenue. c onsequently, revenue consists of a component of 
the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable for the marketing and sale of the policy, 
stated net of insurance premium tax.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to 
customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as 
if it were an individual contract. accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an 
obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services. in 
these situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is 
deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income. t he assessment of future claims handling takes 
account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are 
validated through experience of historic actual costs. t he deferred revenue is released over the expected 
profile of anticipated claims over the policy period. t he deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the 
performance of these services in the future.
r evenue on sales to franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete. r evenue 
on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement. 
t hese franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
l easing
l eases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. all other leases are classified as operating leases.
assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. t he 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. l ease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
r entals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also 
spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. at each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
n on-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
o n consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. exchange differences arising, if 
any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. such translation differences 
are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
borrowing costs
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
o perating profit
o perating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures 
(net of tax) but before investment income and finance costs.
77 2. siGn iFicant acco Un tin G policies (contin UeD) 
r etirement benefit costs
payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit 
credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. t hey are recognised outside the income 
statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and 
otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
t he retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value 
of scheme assets. any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
taxation
t he tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
t he tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. t he Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of 
the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
t he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the 
asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when 
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Homeserve  
annual r eport & accounts 2010
n otes to t He Financial statements
year en DeD 31 marc H 2010 Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful 
lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
buildings 25–50 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7 years
c omputer equipment 3–7 years
motor vehicles 3 years (with 25% residual value)
assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as 
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
intangible assets
intangible assets arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at their fair 
value and are amortised over their useful lives, using the straight line method, as follows:
c ustomer relationships 3–7 years
c ustomer databases 3–10 years
Franchise assets 3–15 years
trademarks and similar access rights, acquired on an exclusive use basis from third party commercial 
partners, are also treated as intangible assets. t hese assets are recorded at cost and amortised on a 
straight line basis over the length of the contractual agreement up to a maximum of 20 years.
c omputer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of three 
to seven years.
impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
at each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
r ecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. in assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
if the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. an 
impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. a reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
inventories
inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. c ost comprises direct materials and, 
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. c ost is measured on a first-in, first-out (FiFo ) basis. n et 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to 
be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective 
items where appropriate.
79 2. siGn iFicant acco Un tin G policies (contin UeD)
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
trade receivables
trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
c ash and cash equivalents
c ash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
borrowings
interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to 
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Hedge accounting
t he Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges. at the 
inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging 
relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
c ash flow hedges
t he effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges are deferred in equity. t he gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement and is included within finance costs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income 
statement.
amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is also 
recognised in the income statement in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. any cumulative gain or 
loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement.
trade payables
trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
equity instruments
equity instruments issued by the c ompany are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
share-based payments
t he Group has applied the requirements of iFr s2 share-based payments. in accordance with the transitional 
provision, iFr s2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 n ovember 2002 that were 
unvested as of 1 april 2005.

year en DeD 31 marc H 2010 t he Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. t he fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. t he Group also provides employees with the ability to 
purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through save as you earn 
schemes.
Fair value is measured by use of the black-scholes model or monte c arlo simulation models depending on the 
type of scheme.
o wn shares reserve
shares of the parent c ompany that are purchased by the Homeserve plc employee benefit trust are held at 
cost and shown as a deduction in equity. c ost comprises consideration paid, including directly attributable 
costs. t he shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes.
3. JUDGements an D estimation Un certainty
r evenue recognition
an appropriate proportion of revenue is deferred to future periods when the Group has obligations extending 
to future periods. as a result, judgement is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling 
those future obligations. t he Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the 
appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods. 
impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets
t he annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of 
the value in use (or fair value less costs to sell) of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition 
intangibles have been allocated. as a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an 
appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows. t he carrying 
value of goodwill is £190,186,000 (2009: £175,667,000). t he carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 
£27,931,000 (2009: £28,643,000). Following the annual impairment review, an impairment charge of £nil (2009: 
£59,179,000) has been recorded against goodwill and £nil (2009: £16,965,000) against acquisition intangibles. 
as set out in note 14, reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, 
prices and margins can impact the recoverable value.
pensions
t he Group participates in a defined benefit retirement scheme for certain employees. t he scheme assets and 
liabilities are valued by an independent qualified actuary using the assumptions summarised in note 39. as 
required by ias19, the value of the defined benefit obligation has been measured using the projected unit 
credit method which requires the use of judgement and estimation.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (’c GUs‘) 
that are expected to benefit from that business combination. t he carrying amount of goodwill has been

t he Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired.
t he recoverable amounts of the c GUs are determined from value in use calculations. t he key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes 
to selling prices and direct costs during the period. management estimates discount rates using pre-tax 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the c GUs. 
t he growth rates are based on detailed business plans. c hanges in selling prices and direct costs are 
based on expectations of future changes in the market.
t he Group prepares annual cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by 
the Directors and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2009: 
2.5%) representing long-term growth rates based in respective country GDp rates. t he pre-tax rate used to 
discount the forecast cash flows for all c GUs is 11.2% (2009: 11.3%).

t he Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each c GU’s carrying value, the key 
assumptions are as noted above. management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to 
the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the 
recoverable amount. t his view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, takes account 
of the headroom in management’s internal growth targets verses the conservative growth estimates used 
in the impairment review.

trade receivables
t he Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. t his 
assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and 
involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty. in the 
prior year, an impairment of £7,152,000 was included to recognise the surplus of the UK emergency services 
assets impairment against the pre-impairment carrying value of the non-current assets, for certain cash 
generating units within the division. n o such amounts have been recognised in the current year. 92 Financial statements

o f the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, 
with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers. t here are no customers who 
represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £4,176,000 (2009: 
£21,187,000) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not 
been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. t he Group 
does not hold any collateral over these balances. t he average age of receivables not impaired is 40 days 
(2009: 62 days).

in determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality 
of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. t he concentration 
of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. accordingly, the Directors 
believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

o ther receivables
as part of our activities, the Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of 
cash on behalf of third parties. o ther receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from 
policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for components such as underwriting fees and insurance 
premium tax. t he concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and 
spread across a diverse policyholder base. in addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as 
defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included 
in ’o ther creditors’.
c ash balances and cash equivalents
c ash balances and cash equivalents of £25,409,000 (2009: £21,345,000) comprise cash held by the Group 
and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. t he carrying amount of 
these assets approximates their fair value.

iii.  all of the Group’s borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of between 0.1% and 1% above 
l ibor , thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. 94 Financial statements

at the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £26,800,000 (2009: £23,700,000) available 
for offset against future profits and which can be carried forward indefinitely. a deferred tax asset of 
£2,318,000 (2009: £2,518,000) has been recognised in respect of these losses. Deferred tax has not been 
recognised on the remainder of these losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of future recovery. 
temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures are not material.

o n 22 may 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of société Française de Garantie s.a. (sFG),  
a leading French extended warranty seller and service provider. t here were also a number of other 
acquisitions in the year which individually were not significant.
all these transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Fair values are 
reported as provisional for a period of 12 months following acquisition to allow the incorporation of any 
subsequent amendments to completion accounts, contingent consideration or directly attributable costs. 
Fair value adjustments to the acquired underlying book value of assets and liabilities, prior to the 
recognition of fair values on intangible assets identified on acquisition, were not significant, and in summary 
terms consisted of:
• sFG – acquired book value of net assets of £3,146,000 increased by £241,000 to eliminate certain 
historic liabilities.
• o ther acquisitions – acquired book value of net liabilities of £65,000, reduced by £279,000 for provision 
of certain receivables and payables, to recognise impairment against redundant fixed assets and to 
recognise additional liabilities.
as these adjustments were not significant, no separate tabular summary of pre-adjusted balance sheets, 
together with analysis of the line items that these adjustments relate to, has been presented.

intangible assets identified on the acquisitions of sFG and o ther acquisitions represent the Directors’ 
estimate of the value of the customer relationships at acquisition, the expected value of trade names 
associated with the business or the value of acquired customer policy databases. Goodwill represents 
future cross sell opportunities, efficiency savings and synergies from these acquisitions.
if all the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the Group revenues for the 
year and Group profit before tax attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £380,807,000 
and £102,240,000 respectively, for continuing operations.
in addition to the net cash outflow arising on the acquisitions above of £24,644,000, contingent and 
deferred consideration of £897,000 was paid relating to prior period acquisitions; and additional goodwill of 
£582,000 was recognised in respect of adjustments to consideration relating to other prior acquisitions.
t he post acquisition operating profit from these acquisitions in the year ended 31 march 2010 was 
as follows:
          sFG
          £000
o perating profit pre amortisation of acquisition intangibles      722
o perating loss post amortisation of acquisition intangibles      (550)
t he other acquisitions have been subsumed within existing businesses and it has not been practicable to

o n 24 september 2009, the Group announced the sale of its emergency services Division (excluding the 
Homeserve property r epairs businesses) (the ’ Hes Disposal Division‘) to a newly incorporated company 
backed by l loyds tsb Development c apital l imited and management. t he total consideration will be up to 
£11,000,000 of which £7,652,000 was paid in cash on completion. Deferred consideration relates to 
successful future contract renewals and the resolution of indemnities as part of the sale. t he sale of the Hes 
Disposal Division is consistent with Homeserve plc’s previously announced strategic objectives enabling it 
to focus on the Group’s higher margin, higher growth membership businesses.
t he Hes Disposal Division consisted of the businesses operated by Homeserve Glazing & l ocks, Homeserve 
c ontents services and c hemDry. t hese businesses provide repair and replacement services primarily to the 
end customer/policyholder of general insurers in the United Kingdom through a network of directly 
employed, franchised and sub-contract engineers.
Following the disposal of the Hes Disposal Division the board announced the proposed closure of 
Homeserve property r epairs l imited, based in n ottingham, and anglia (n W) l imited, based in Dyserth, 
n orth Wales (together the ’property r epairs’ business) on 20 o ctober 2009. t his closure process was

t he esop provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the c ompany’s shares on 
the day before the date of grant. t he vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase 
in earnings per share over the vesting period. in addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependant 
upon a share price target. if the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of 
grant, the options expire. 
ii) 2005 Key executive incentive plan (‘Keip’)
t he Keip provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the c ompany’s shares on the 
day before the date of grant. t he awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years 
from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche. 
t he number of awards vesting is dependent upon the profit before tax of the Group for the year ended 
31 march 2008 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 march 2009.  
if the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
iii) l ong term incentive plan (‘l tip ’)
t he ltip provides for the grant of nil cost options. t he vesting period is three years and is dependent upon 
the total shareholder r eturn performance of the Group over the relevant performance period. if the options 
remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. 
iv) Deferred bonus plan (‘Dbp’)
t he Deferred bonus plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus (up to a 
maximum of 100%) and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the c ompany.  
t he deferred bonus may be matched by the c ompany dependent upon the c ompany’s relative total 
shareholder r eturn over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper 
decile performance. t he shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised 
within 10 years from the date of grant.
v) save as you earn scheme (‘saye’)
t he saye is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market 
price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount. t he options can be exercised during 
a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.
vi) c onditional share schemes (‘c ss’)

expected dividends based on historic dividend yield
r isk free interest rate 3.8% – 5.2%

Defined contribution schemes
t he Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees. t he 
assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. 
Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions fully vesting, the contributions 
paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
t he total cost charged to income of £2,484,000 (2009: £2,890,000) represents contributions payable to 
these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. at 31 march 2010, contributions of 
£nil (2009: £nil) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme
t he Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water c ompanies pension scheme, for qualifying 
employees. t his is a sectionalised final salary scheme and the Group participates in the Homeserve plc 
section of the scheme. t he section funds are administered by the trustees and are independent of the 
Group’s finances. c ontributions are paid to the section in accordance with the recommendations of an 
independent actuarial adviser. t he section has a history of raising pensions in line with price inflation, and 
these increases are reflected in the measurement of the obligation. 
t he results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 march 2008 were updated to the accounting date by an 
independent qualified actuary in accordance with ias19. as required by ias19, the value of the defined 
benefit obligation and the current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.

c apital risk management
t he Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns 
while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. t he 
capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22, cash 
and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 26 to 33.
t he table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital:
        2010 2009
        £000 £000
shareholders’ funds        234,061 212,984
r evolving credit facilities        78,000 55,000
Unsecured loan notes        300 300
c ertain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the 
Financial services authority. Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close 
monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations. t he 
Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
Financial risk management objectives
t he Group’s principal financial instruments, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and cash and 
cash equivalents. t he main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s 
operations. t he Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, derivatives and loans to joint ventures which arise directly from its operations.
c lassification of financial instruments
in addition to the other financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 20, 22 and 24, the Group has 
derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships with a notional value of £nil (2009: 
£50,000,000) and a carrying value and fair value of £nil (2009: £1,947,000 liability). t he fair value of these 
derivative instruments has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates, sourced from observable market data.
t he main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
107 42. Financial instr Uments (contin UeD) 
interest rate risk
t he Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates. t he Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost 
using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. to manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps for 
certain periods, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed 
and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. 
t hese swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
t he maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is provided in the table below. interest is payable on 
the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities and loan notes. Deferred and contingent consideration 
payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows, before discounting.

c redit risk
t he Group trades only with creditworthy third parties. it is the Group’s policy that, with the exception of 
our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for 
financial stability.
t he majority of the Group’s trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for 
these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty. as a 
result, the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and 
cash equivalents and investment in joint ventures, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of 
the counterparty.
t he Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with 
reputable and creditworthy banking institutions. t he risk associated with the investment in joint ventures is 
mitigated through the close management and regular review of the performance of the assets.
t he Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables 
and instruments.
l iquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group’s board which sets the framework 
for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. t he Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities 
and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. included in note 22 are details of the undrawn 
facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, all of the Group’s financial liabilities are due for 
payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.

trade receivables
t he c ompany has a policy for providing fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. 
t his assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due 
and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
o f the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, 
with exposure spread across a large number of subsidiary undertakings.

significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. t he c ompany does 
not hold any collateral over these balances. t he average age of receivables not impaired is 30 days 
(2009: 15 days).

in determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the c ompany considers any change in the credit 
quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. t he 
concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
n o allowance for doubtful debts are considered necessary based on prior experience and the Directors’ 
assessment of the current economic environment.
t he Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their 
fair value.
c ash balances and cash equivalents
c ash balances and cash equivalents of £50,663,000 (2009: £65,515,000) comprise cash held by the 
c ompany and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. t he carrying

During the year ended 31 march 2010, the c ompany had five (2009: five) share-based payment 
arrangements, which are described below:
i) executive share o ption plan (‘esop ’)
t he esop provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the c ompany’s shares on 
the day before the date of grant. t he vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase 
in earnings per share over the vesting period. in addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependent 
upon a share price target. if the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of 
grant, the options expire. 
ii) 2005 Key executive incentive plan (‘Keip’)
t he Keip provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the c ompany’s shares on the 
day before the date of grant. t he awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years 
from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche. 
t he number of awards vesting is dependent upon the profit before tax of the Group for the year ending 
31 march 2009 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 march 2010. if the 
options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
iii) l ong term incentive plan (‘l tip ’)
t he ltip provides for the grant of nil cost options. t he vesting period is three years and is dependent upon 
the total shareholder r eturn performance of the Group over the relevant performance period. if the options 
remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
iv) Deferred bonus plan (‘Dbp’)
t he Deferred bonus plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus (up to a 
maximum of 100%) and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the c ompany.  
t he deferred bonus may be matched by the c ompany dependent upon the c ompany’s relative total 
shareholder r eturn over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper 
decile performance. t he shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised 
within 10 years from the date of grant.
v) save as you earn scheme (‘saye’)
t he saye is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market 
price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount. t he options can be exercised during 
a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.

£17.34 (2009: £14.68).
t he estimated fair values are calculated by applying a black-scholes option pricing model for the esop and

models are as follows:

principal financial instruments
t he principal financial instruments used by the c ompany from which financial instrument risk arises are  
as follows:
– cash and cash equivalents 
– bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities 
– trade receivables 
– inter-company receivables and payables 
– trade payables
all principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
c apital risk management
t he c ompany manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. t he capital structure of the 
c ompany consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 50, cash and cash equivalents 
and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 54, 57 and 58.
t he table below presents quantitative data for the components the c ompany manages as capital:

shareholders’ funds        171,505 201,020
r evolving credit facilities        (27,337) (10,515)
Financial risk management objectives
t he c ompany’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts. t he main purpose  
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the c ompany’s operations. t he c ompany also has 
various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly  
from its operations.
t he main risks arising from the c ompany’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
interest rate risk
t he c ompany’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the c ompany’s 
long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates. t he c ompany’s policy is to manage its interest 
cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. to manage this, the c ompany enters into interest rate 
swaps for certain periods, in which the c ompany agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference 
between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional 
principal amount. t hese swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
t he maturity profile of the c ompany’s financial liabilities is provided in the table below. interest is payable 
on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.

c redit risk
t he c ompany trades only with creditworthy third parties and subsidiary undertakings. it is the c ompany’s 
policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the c ompany, which comprise cash and 
cash equivalents the c ompany’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
t he c ompany manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only 
with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions. 
t he c ompany has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and 
instruments.
l iquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the c ompany’s board which sets the 
framework for the management of the c ompany’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. t he c ompany manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and 
banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. included in note 22 are 
details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the c ompany and the Group to further reduce 
liquidity risk.
all of the c ompany’s financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual 
payment terms.

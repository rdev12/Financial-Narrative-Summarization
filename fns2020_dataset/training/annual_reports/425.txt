Operational highlights
Our Highlights
Making good progress
Our 201 1 results reflect the good progress we have made across the business, delivering 
against each of our core strategic objectives. During the period we significantly increased  
our production and resource base, expanded our portfolio of assets, strengthened our  
capital structure and posted financial results that are materially ahead of 2010.
For more information
See page 32
Increasing production  
– first oil at Ebok
In 2011 we consolidated our position as 
a leading independent producer offshore 
Nigeria with the start-up and commissioning 
of all 14 wells associated with the initial 
phases of the Ebok field development, 
and at the Okoro field commissioned two 
new infill wells helping to further underpin 
the Company’s profitable and growing 
production base.
Acquisition of major 
portfolio onshore  
Nigeria completed
In 201 1 FHN, in which Afren is a 45% shareholder, 
completed the acquisition of a 45% interest in 
OML 26 and at the same time secured US$280 
million in new financing. The block includes two 
producing fields and three proved undeveloped 
assets with significant exploration upside.  
By year end the partners had almost doubled 
gross production at the Ogini and Isoko fields  
to 10,500 bopd, and are working towards  
ultimately delivering 50,000 bopd from a major 
redevelopment programme.

Overview
Responsibility highlights
Outlook
Operating safely  
and responsibly
We recorded a strong Environment, Health, 
Safety and Security (EHSS) performance 
with a year-on-year improvement during 
the period, when several complex and 
potentially hazardous operations were 
undertaken at our development projects. 
We have also continued to develop our 
Corporate Social Responsibility policies 
against best practice guidance by both the 
UN Global Compact and Equator Principles. 
•  Continued production growth with 
full year net working interest production 
of between 42,000 to 46,000 boepd
•  Ongoing development of our producing 
assets offshore and onshore Nigeria 
•  Early production at Okoro East
•  First oil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq  
at Barda Rash 
•  Up to 14 high-impact exploration and 
appraisal wells targeting in excess of 
800 mmbbls net to Afren across each  
of our core regions
•  Good financial management 
underpinning a well funded and  
agile business
Strategic entry  
into the Kurdistan 
region of Iraq
The acquisition of interests in  
the contiguous Barda Rash and 
Ain Sifni PSCs has increased our 
2P/2C reserves and resource base 
by over 633% at a cost of under 
US$1.0/bbl and offers line of sight 
on major long-term production 
growth. Strategically, we are now 
well positioned in two of the 
world’s top ten oil producing 
countries, Nigeria and Iraq.
Multi-well exploration 
campaign under way 
We have now entered the most active phase 
of exploration drilling in Afren’s history, 
and in doing so have completed our transition 
into a full-cycle business. We have made 
a successful start to our ongoing exploration 
campaign with the significant Okoro East 
discovery in Nigeria, and over the coming 
months will participate in several high-impact 
wells in each of our core areas, all of which 
have the potential to unlock sizeable volumes.

The story so far
Seven years ago Afren was a company with a minority interest  
in a single asset offshore in the deepwater Gulf of Guinea. Today  
we are a full-cycle business with 29 assets in 12 countries, a growing 
platform of profitable production, large-scale reserves and  
resource base, high-quality pipeline of development projects  
and an extensive multi-well exploration drilling campaign.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Overview
Our vision and strategic priorities
Afren’s vision is to be the leading independent 
E&P Company in each of the areas in which 
we operate. We also aim to be recognised 
as the partner of choice by all of our 
stakeholders, and have created a balanced 
portfolio of high quality upstream assets 
across the full-cycle E&P value chain. 
In order to achieve our vision, we have 
identified clear strategic priorities focused on 
running our business and delivering efficient 
growth in a responsible way. 
Low cost reserves growth
In July 2011 we announced the acquisition 
of two major assets in the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq – the Barda Rash and Ain Sifni Blocks. 
The acquisition, which is consistent with our 
strategy of acquiring low cost barrels, has 
increased our 2P and 2C recoverable reserves 
and resources base by over 633% at a cost 
of under US$1.0 per barrel and strategically 
means that Afren is now well positioned in 
two of the world’s most prolific oil producing 
countries, Nigeria and Iraq. We were pleased 
to receive all requisite approvals for 
development of the large scale Barda Rash 
field in December 2011, and are now under 
way with the development of what is a truly 
world class asset. Furthermore, we completed 
the OML 26 acquisition through our 45% 
interest in First Hydrocarbon Nigeria (FHN), 
adding a significant reserves and resources 
base onshore Nigeria, fully funded by FHN.
Stable production platform
In 2011, we successfully delivered first oil 
from the landmark Ebok field development 
in just over two years from commencing 
appraisal drilling. We have also concurrently 
maintained production at the Okoro 
development (at levels which have exceeded 
our pre-start up expectations) as well as 
our operations in Côte d’Ivoire. In 2011, we 
achieved an average full production growth 
of 19,154 boepd (14,333 boepd in 2010).
 
We will continue to grow our production by 
developing the existing production and 
appraisal opportunities within our portfolio, 
whilst also pursuing high impact exploration 
targets in East and West Africa as well as the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq.
Record financial results
The Company benefited from increased 
production and a higher realised oil price in 
201 1, achieving record profits of US$125.4 
million on turnover of US$596.7 million. During 
the year we raised US$184.5 million from an 
equity placing in support of our expansion into 
the Kurdistan region of Iraq and took the 
opportunity to access the bond market, allowing 
us to repay shorter-term facilities and at the 
same time reduce any potential over-reliance on 
a relatively limited number of lending banks in 
times of economic uncertainty.
High impact exploration  
campaign under way
We were delighted to be able to announce, 
post period end, that we made a successful 
start to our 2012 exploration drilling 
campaign with the Okoro East exploration 
well. The proximity of Okoro East to the 
producing Okoro main field means we are 
well positioned to monetise this discovery 
quickly and efficiently – both in terms of 
leveraging our detailed understanding of the 
subsurface and development track record in 
the area. We will be looking to replicate this 
success with further wells planned at our core 
Ebok/Okwok/OML 115 hub and will also 
participate in multiple high impact wells in 
key plays across the Kurdistan region of Iraq, 
West Africa Transform Margin and the rift 
and coastal basins of East Africa, each of 
which has the potential to materially increase 
our discovered resource base. 
Key Performance Indicators
We measure the performance of the business 
with five KPIs that are designed to measure 
progress against our strategic objectives. 
In 2011 we realised strong year-on-year 
performance. More information on our KPIs 
and 2011 performance is included on pages 
16 to 17.
The Afren team
As global demand for energy increases and 
competition for upstream oil and gas assets 
intensifies, we are witnessing similar trends in 
a tightening recruitment market with demand 
and competition for skilled and experienced 
people increasing. Industry surveys highlight 
that a growing skills shortage is now the 
greatest concern to employers within the 
industry, ahead of both economic instability 
and geopolitical risks. Afren’s growth and 
success revolves first and foremost around the 
quality and commitment of our people – and 
the values to which we all subscribe, namely 
professionalism, dedication, creativity and 
respect. In order to ensure that we can attract 
and retain the best people, we have in place 
a remuneration policy that is necessarily 
competitive within the industry, and rewards 
exceptional performance with a balance 
between short- and long-term rewards 
and a comprehensive benefits scheme.  10 Afren plc

Chairman’s Statement Continued
Since 2009, Afren has engaged the British 
Safety Council to independently audit our 
health and safety performance in Nigeria and 
Côte d’Ivoire based on rating performance 
in five key areas:
•  Safety organisation
•  Management control systems 
•  Emergency control systems
•  Management of accident/incident reporting 
and investigation
•  Workplace implementation.
We are pleased to report that we have 
achieved three out of five stars again in 2011, 
with 75% compliance with best practice. 
We have established challenging EHSS targets 
across all areas of our operation, against 
which we are well positioned to deliver. 
In 201 1 we continued to develop and 
implement social and economic capacity 
advancement programmes in our areas of 
activity. This year we have communicated 
more about our all encompassing CSR strategy, 
in particular the stakeholder engagement 
activities that provide a foundation for our 
wider CSR programme. More information 
on our CSR initiatives and performance in 201 1 
is included on pages 52 to 57.
‘We remain committed 
to developing local content 
in each of our operating areas 
and employ 178 people in 
Africa, of whom over 97% 
are local nationals.’
We continued to grow our team in 2011 with 
86 new arrivals joining us during the year and 
opened two new regional offices in Nairobi 
and Erbil. Our total workforce grew to 272, 
up 30% year-on-year, of which all are 
full-time employees. We remain committed 
to developing local content in each of our 
operating areas and employ 178 people in 
Africa, of whom over 97% are local nationals. 
We will continue to evolve our employment 
practices and policies to ensure we are able 
to attract and retain the best talent, and are 
wholly committed to developing all our staff 
to their full potential.
Corporate Social Responsibility
At Afren, we aim to be a responsible and 
transparent business. Our CSR policies 
encompass our relationship with all 
stakeholders including shareholders, 
employees, contractors, local communities 
and host governments, as well as with the 
environments in which we work. We have 
successfully worked with the host 
communities in the areas in which we 
operate. A key strategic priority is the effective 
management of CSR policies across all 
operational areas.
During the year we implemented a number 
of key EHSS initiatives. These included 
developing a comprehensive Environmental, 
Health and Safety Management System 
across our portfolio and benchmarking 
ourselves against the Oil and Gas Producers’ 
(OGP) annual average safety performance. 
Both reinforced our continuous improvement 
in EHSS, resulting in significant declines in 
the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) and 
Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIR) of 79% 
and 91% respectively.  Afren plc 11

Overview
Managing risks to our business
The monitoring and management of risks 
to the business are integral to Afren’s 
organisational framework. So that we can 
continue to operate safely and effectively, 
we are constantly identifying and analysing 
potential risks that could adversely affect 
our ability to deliver against our objectives. 
At the same time, crucially, we map out our 
response should things go wrong.
We have a robust, solutions-based reporting 
system in place that enables the direct and 
timely reporting of risks to the Board of 
Directors. This focuses on specifying precisely 
what actions are required to help us 
continually improve risk mitigation and ensure 
we are equipped to deal with a constantly 
evolving operating and business environment.
So that we can identify all risks to the delivery 
of our strategy early and put mitigation measures 
in place, we are continuing to enhance our risk 
management process and to embed it in the 
organisation. We are therefore cascading the 
management of risks at all organisational levels 
to reaffirm that everyone is responsible for 
managing those risks that may impact their 
day-to-day work. More information on our risk 
management and performance in 201 1 is 
included on pages 20 to 25.
Expanding the Board
In February 2012, Patrick Obath was 
appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director. Mr Obath, an East African national 
and senior energy industry practitioner, 
has held a number of senior management 
positions in a career spanning over 36 years, 
including 20 years with Shell International, 
Shell Kenya, Shell Tanzania and Shell Oil 
Products Africa. Mr Obath brings a wealth 
of expertise in corporate health, safety and 
environmental management, combined with 
significant East African experience. These 
attributes will prove invaluable as we move 
into an active operational phase across our 
exploration portfolio in Kenya, Tanzania, 
Madagascar, Ethiopia and Seychelles.
Group Code of Business Conduct
Your Board is fully committed to the principles 
of good corporate governance. These 
principles are detailed in Our Group Code of 
Business Conduct, which has been updated 
in line with the enactment of the Bribery Act 
2010. The Code sets out the behaviour which 
Afren expects of its Directors, managers and 
employees, of our suppliers, contractors, 
agents and partners. We are committed to 
complying with all applicable legal requirements, 
to upholding the highest ethical standards 
and to acting with complete integrity at 
all times. Our employees and everyone that 
we work with create and support our reputation 
and ensure our progress and success. 
This Code demonstrates our commitment 
to ensuring that these high levels of conduct 
are maintained.
The Company has complied with the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code throughout the year and, 
where specific provisions may not appear 
to have been complied with, a full explanation 
is provided in the Corporate Governance 
statement on pages 64 to 72 of this report.
Outlook
2011 has been another year of growth and 
delivery for Afren. We have made good 
progress in all aspects of our business, in 
particular delivering significant year-on-year 
production and reserves growth and posting 
a record set of financial results. 2012 is also 
set to be an exciting year for the Company 
as we continue to pursue further growth 
opportunities and begin to unlock the true 
potential of our portfolio – both through our 
active field development, and exploration and 
appraisal drilling programmes.

Strategy and Vision
A strategy delivering 
long‑term value
Our vision to be the leading independent upstream exploration and  
production company in each of the areas in which we operate is underpinned 
by a clear and consistent strategy – one that is designed to provide a framework 
for sustainable long-term growth across the full-cycle E&P value chain.

Vision Objective Strategy
To maximise  
shareholder  
value
Our strategy will  
be driven across five  
strategic priorities
A closer look at our strategic priorities sets 
them in the context of Afren’s growth to 
date. From the outset one of our key priorities 
was to establish a reliable platform of cash 
generative reserves and production that 
would lead us ultimately to a self funded 
forward work programme and creating value 
across the full-cycle exploration and 
production value chain. Afren plc 13

Governance, Corporate and Social Responsibility
In alignment with our strategic 
priorities, our business model is 
designed to create and preserve 
long-term shareholder value 
through the development of a 
financially self-sufficient portfolio 
of assets spanning the full-cycle 
E&P value chain. Underpinning our 
business is a portfolio of producing 
assets that generates the cash flow 
we require to reinvest in and 
accelerate the development of 
further reserves and at the same 
time technically mature our  
exploration and appraisal asset 
base to drillable status. 
At the core of this approach are 
high standards of governance, 
corporate and social responsibility, 
a detailed and methodical 
planning and financial 
management process to ensure 
we are investing our capital in 
the most efficient way and the 
operational execution and delivery 
of our forward work programme. 
The application of our business 
model is the responsibility of our 
senior management team and 
dedicated technical, financial, 
commercial, risk management and 
legal business functions, under the 
ultimate stewardship of our Board 
of Directors.

Production  
growth
Organic reserves 
growth
Significant 2P + 2C reserves and 
resources base
Afren now has a portfolio in place capable of yielding 
sustainable, long-term production growth. Our net 2P/2C 
recoverable reserves and resources total almost a billion 
barrels of which only 7% has so far been developed and 
brought into production.
Delivering Against our Strategy
Year-on-year production increase
Ebok – a successful partnership
We are developing Ebok through a phased approach. The initial 
stages are now complete and we have 14 wells onstream and 
a further four planned in 2012. Our partnership and working 
relationship with Oriental Energy Resources has been successful, 
also creating follow on opportunities at Okwok and OML 115.
Okoro – Optimising production and maximising oil recovery
Okoro is Afren’s maiden greenfield development project. To date 
we have successfully operated one appraisal well and drilled nine 
production wells in partnership with Amni, an established indigenous 
oil and gas company. We achieved first oil in just two years from 
entry and output at the field has consistently remained ahead of 
pre start-up expectations, meaning that we are now on a trajectory 
towards what was the 3P recovery scenario at the time of start-up.
OML 26
OML 26 is a large scale redevelopment opportunity. FHN completed 
the acquisition of a 45% interest in December 2011. Afren is the 
Technical Services Provider to FHN and also a 45% shareholder.
Transitioning 2C resources to 2P reserves 
– creating predictable reserves generation
A key opportunity for us over the near to medium term is to 
convert a substantial volume of our currently defined 2C 
resource base into 2P reserves. This will be achieved through 
the progressive investment in and development of our key 
projects in Nigeria and the Kurdistan region of Iraq that hold 
the majority of our 2C resources. Our portfolio today is 
capable of being a predictable reserves generator of scale 
for many years to come. 
Most active exploration period in our short history
2012 is our busiest exploration period to date. We plan to drill up to 
14 exploration and appraisal wells, which will target over 800 
mmbbls of net unrisked prospective resources.
Our dedicated team of explorationists have responsibility for 
identifying exploration ideas, prioritising our prospect inventory 
and ensuring efficient deployment of capital and execution of our 
exploration data gathering and drilling activities. Our exploration 
strategy is play led and balanced across three key themes:
•  Exploration in proven areas, which are low risk and quick to monetise 
•  Proven play concepts that offer significant upside, with moderate risk
•  Higher risk frontier areas with play opening possibilities and 
potentially large rewards
Our 2012 exploration campaign got off to a successful start at Okoro 
East and includes further high impact wells in Ghana, Nigeria, the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq, Kenya and Tanzania – all of which could 
materially transform our discovered resource base.

Operational

Pursue materially accretive 
acquisitions
Accessing low cost reserves
We have been successful in achieving low entry and acquisition 
costs by focusing on areas where we are strategically and 
competitively advantaged. 
These include areas where: 
• There are proven working hydrocarbon systems
•  Opportunities have been overlooked, under-developed 
or may be out of reach to much larger companies
•  We have an in-depth understanding of the subsurface, 
key relationships or a local structure we can leverage. 
As an agile independent with a successful track record we can 
move swiftly – a hallmark of our growth to date being a willingness 
to take ‘early mover’ advantage when the opportunity merits it.
Robust capital structure
Afren’s prudent approach to planning has resulted in a robust 
capital structure and firm financial control, which will provide a solid 
foundation for future growth. 
At 31 December 2011, we had US$292 million of cash, augmented 
by a thriving, cash generative portfolio. Hedges are in place for 
2012, providing a minimum floor price of US$80/bbl – US$90/bbl 
over circa three mmbbls production.
We have a clear debt reduction schedule, with the majority of debt 
due in 2016. We have also looked to implement a more balanced 
debt strategy and have become the first E&P company to gain 
access to the bond market. At year-end 2011, our net debt 
(excluding finance leases) was US$548 million. Our capital structure 
was further strengthened by the completion of a second secured 
Bond issue, with proceeds of US$300 million, in February 2012.
Corporate 
responsibility
Increased financial 
flexibility
Increased production means 
that we now have significant 
cash flow generation in  
excess of forward capex.  
This gives us significant 
financial flexibility to develop 
our portfolio and support 
growth.
Acquisition in the Kurdistan region of Iraq
The most recent example of this is our acquisition of interests in  
two contiguous Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) in the Kurdistan 
region of Iraq. We now have a 60% participating interest in the 
Barda Rash PSC and a non-operated 20% participating interest 
in the Ain Sifni PSC. The total acquisition cost of US$588.4 million 
equates to just US$0.68 per 2C barrel, and is significantly below the 
values of other comparable transactions in the region during 2011.
This acquisition is a highly complementary extension to our existing 
portfolio and an opportunity to transfer our core development and 
production skill set we have developed in Africa over the past seven 
years. The assets offer a compelling combination of both near-term 
development upside and substantial low risk exploration potential.
Tanzania and South Africa
In 2011 we also expanded our African exploration portfolio through 
the acquisition of interests in the Tanga Block offshore Tanzania and 
Block 2B offshore South Africa.
CR: The Afren 
approach
Corporate responsibility (CR) 
continues to be a critical focus 
area. We are committed to 
ensuring that Afren is 
recognised as a responsible 
organisation with high 
standards of CR performance.
Maintaining these standards 
will ensure that the business 
grows successfully for the 
benefit of all stakeholders, 
whose concerns and 
aspirations we must 
understand if we are to 
develop long-standing, 
successful relationships.

Progress Progress Progress Progress Progress
Net production has been primarily influenced 
by the start of production at Ebok and the 
completion of the Okoro infill wells.
This growth has been offset by a reduction 
in working interest production from Okoro 
following the completion of cost recovery 
in 2010.
Reserves increases have again been 
significant, driven largely by the acquisition 
of our interest in the Barda Rash PSC.
This reflects an increase in operating profit 
for the year compared to 2010, following 
the start of production at Ebok and higher 
realised oil prices.
Several factors have influenced the operating 
cost per barrel in 2012. The effect of the 
production ramp-up at Ebok was offset by 
a decrease in gross production at Okoro.
Performance during 2011 has shown a strong 
improvement in both the LTIF and TRIR, with 
both KPIs showing a significant and sustained 
decrease over the 12-month period. This has 
been achieved through a rigorous programme 
of auditing and supervision of key contractors 
during the period of installation, hook-up and 
commissioning of the Ebok production facilities.
Outlook Outlook Outlook Outlook Outlook
The Company expects that, with a full year 
of production from Ebok and the success 
of future projects, production growth will 
continue in 2012 and beyond.
Despite increased production being expected 
from Ebok in 2012, the significant exploration 
and appraisal programme planned for 2012 
and the development of Okoro East has the 
potential to generate high reserves replacement 
throughout the course of the coming year.
Production growth and strong realised 
oil prices are expected to lead to increased 
operating cash flows in 2012.
Although we expect a certain level of 
operating cost increases year-on-year, 
particularly at Okoro, a full year of production 
at Ebok is likely to lead to a lower operating 
cost per unit in 2012.
We will continue to monitor both LTIF and TRIR 
as KPIs of safety performance and to benchmark 
ourselves against industry standards. In addition 
we will also look towards more proactive 
indicators of safety performance in a drive 
to avoid injuries in the workplace.
Risk management Risk management Risk management Risk management Risk management
The in-depth geological understanding 
of our assets and close monitoring and 
planning of production performance and 
simultaneous operations help us to guard 
against unplanned interruptions and 
maximise production.
Exploration risks are managed through our 
wide portfolio of assets, with each asset being 
subject to rigorous peer review and detailed 
evaluation of prospects. In addition, the 
Directors will continue to consider materially 
accretive acquisitions to supplement organic 
reserves growth, if deemed appropriate.
Tight controls over expenditure and detailed 
monitoring of cash flows enable us to 
ensure positive cash generation from 
our operating activities.
Budgets are set on an annual basis and 
continually monitored throughout the year to 
identify and eliminate the cause of potential 
cost over-runs.
Our operations team is committed to identify 
and implement areas of efficiency in the 
production process.
Injury to our workforce is a major risk to 
our business both in absolute terms resulting 
from consequential losses, but also from 
the reputational damage this causes to 
Afren’s name.

Our development expenditure has ensured 
that the Ebok field had reached targeted 
production rates by the end of 2011.
We have continued to invest in our 
exploration activities in areas such as Ghana, 
Nigeria and East Africa. 
Oil prices continued to strengthen 
throughout 2011.
During the year, the Company realised an 
average oil price of US$109/bbl, which was 
equivalent to the average Brent price for 
the year (2010: US$80/bbl, average Brent 
price of US$79.5/bbl).
The high yield bond issues in January 2011 
and February 2012, together with the equity 
placing in July 2011, have enabled us 
to restructure our debt profile and provided 
considerable financial resources to 
take forward.
Voluntary turnover is still relatively low when 
compared to our peer group (especially for 
technical and operational disciplines), 
indicating that Afren remains an employer

Risk Management Process
Risk management process
Afren’s approach to business risk management has continued 
to evolve during 201 1 in response to changes in the business 
and operating environment. 
Risk overview 
The key objectives of early identification of 
risks, effective implementation of mitigation 
measures and active monitoring and review 
are central to our risk management process. 
This has been achieved through close and 
continuing co-operation between the Risk 
Management and the other business 
functions, in particular the operations team. 
Ongoing monitoring of our business risks will 
ensure that shareholder returns are maximised 
from our diverse and dynamic portfolio.
Our risk management process continues 
to be refined as we implement it across the 
business. The key steps in the process are 
illustrated below and this approach has been 
used at a corporate level and has been 
cascaded down to our Nigerian operations 
and to several projects.
 
Risks are identified and assessed in the 
context of our business plans and the risk 
registers that are generated are monitored 
and actioned by functional and line 
managers. The Audit and Risk Committee 
of the Board are then regularly appraised 
of progress on implementing the risk 
management system and the steps that 
have been taken to mitigate the significant 
business risks.
Our acquisition programme saw the mid-year 
addition of assets in Kurdistan. As a new 
country entry this acquisition poses different, 
if similar risks to those faced in our core 
African operations and as such, was subject to 
wide reaching risk assessment. The proposed 
development project for the Barda Rash field 
has been through a detailed risk review 
focusing on the well workover programme 
and plans for early production facilities. 
The risk mitigation measures will be 
incorporated into the overall project plan and 
actions will be tracked through the regular 
project review meetings.
Progress on implementing the Afren Business 
Risk Management System was reviewed 
regularly throughout 2011 with the Audit 
and Risk Committee. The Committee were 
updated on the output from specific risk 
assessments and the mitigation measures 
that were implemented.

2011 saw a major focus on managing the risks 
associated with Ebok drilling and development 
activities. The installation, commissioning and 
early production ramp-up from the central 
Ebok facilities and West Fault Block development 
were all subject to the risk review process and 
followed up by rigorous monitoring of actions 
to ensure that targets were met.
The management of security risks has also 
been under the spotlight and a structured 
process has been implemented for carrying 
out security risk assessments. This process 
necessarily involves wide participation  
from partners, contractors and external 
stakeholders in order to provide a baseline  
for managing security risks for our operations. 
The process has been used to validate the 
security arrangements for our offshore 
operations in Nigeria and the upcoming 
exploration activities in East Africa.

2012 Outlook
The East Africa Exploration portfolio is also an 
area where we have been reviewing the risks 
associated with exploration activities both 
on- and offshore ahead of commencing 
operations. The detailed planning for the 
seismic and drilling activities targeted for 
2012 has taken account of the identified 
risks and will help ensure a successful 
exploration campaign.
The major goal for 2012 is to further strengthen 
the linkage between our corporate strategic 
objectives and the risk management programme. 
This will ensure alignment between business 
plans, budgets and employee objectives and will 
cascade the accountability for risk management 
down to individuals. 
Afren is operating in a fast moving and dynamic 
environment with geo-political and operational 
risks that require constant monitoring and 
response. It is essential that the approach to risk 
management mirrors this reality and is flexible 
and responsive to the business needs. At the 
end of the day this requires a collaborative 
approach with all our key stakeholders in order 
to effectively manage and mitigate the risks.

OPERATIONAL RISK
Field delivery risk •  Field delivery risk applies to all phases of the E&P cycle from seismic 
acquisition through to production operations. At each phase the 
mitigating measures will be different, however failure to control risks 
will manifest itself as project delays, cost overruns, high production 
costs, early field decommissioning and ultimately lower than 
expected reserves. 
•  All operations are subject to risk reviews to identify as early 
as possible potential risks to delivery.
•  Our engineers analyse results from appraisal and development wells 
and determine the appropriate course of action in terms of drilling 
programme and facility design.
•  All projects are closely monitored to ensure the project delivers 
against plan and to enable actions to be taken to maintain progress.
•  Project finances are monitored against budget to minimise overruns.
•  Production operations are closely monitored to ensure that 
unplanned downtime is minimised and that operating costs are 
tightly controlled.
•  Actual production is regularly checked against the annual 
production forecast.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Chief Executive’s Statement
“The 201 1 results reflect the growing maturity of our business, with record net profit of 
US$125 million, up 172% on 2010 and an increase of 2P reserves by 132% to 185 mmboe. 
We have a made a successful start to our multi-well exploration campaign for 2012 with 
a significant new discovery offshore Nigeria. We have a visible production trajectory 
to 100,000 boepd by 2017 and a mature capital structure that will internally fund both 
organic and inorganic opportunities.
Since the Company was listed in 2005, we have demonstrated strategic foresight and taken 
significant positions in Nigeria, East Africa and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, at a cost of entry 
highly accretive to our shareholders, coupled with a strong track record of operational delivery.”

Chief Executive and Founder Afren plc 27
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Significant reserves growth
2011 was a defining year for Afren, and one 
of continued delivery and growth – a period 
in which we expanded our portfolio by three 
assets to 29 assets across 12 countries. In the 
process we increased our net 2P reserves by 
132% to 185 mmboe and at a cost of less 
than US$1/bbl – well within our targeted 
range of under US$4/bbl. Our production 
increased by 34% year-on-year to 19,154 
boepd, and, although a longer than expected 
period of facilities-related downtime at the 
Ebok field held back our average annual rate, 
we still exited the year ahead of target. 2011 
undoubtedly presented us with installation 
related challenges, while undertaking 
simultaneous operations, at the major Ebok 
field development. I therefore take great 
encouragement from the way we worked 
tirelessly as a team to overcome them, and 
still deliver the project in a fast-track timescale 
that few other operators would be able 
to match. 
Strong production performance
Afren’s highlight of 2011 was delivering first 
oil at the major Ebok field development 
offshore South East Nigeria, this important 
landmark being achieved in just over two 
years since the Company first started appraisal 
drilling at the field. At the same time, we have 
successfully maintained oil production at the 
Okoro field at levels well in excess of pre 
start-up expectations and also continued to 
manage mature production at our operations 
in Côte d’Ivoire, in line with expectations. 
The Company now has a commanding 
presence offshore South East Nigeria and is 
firmly positioned as a leading independent 
upstream operator in the region. 
Onshore Nigeria, First Hydrocarbon Nigeria 
(FHN) successfully completed the acquisition 
of OML 26 from the SPDC Joint Venture. We 
will realise the benefit of current and future 
production growth at OML 26 through our 
45% shareholding in FHN.
The combined performance of our producing 
assets in 2011 yielded full year average 
production of 19,154 boepd (compared to 
14,333 boepd in 2010). Taking into account 
the weighting of Ebok production in our 
portfolio, and the requirement in 2012 to 
manage simultaneous operations associated 
with the field’s ongoing development, we 
expect to produce between 42,000 boepd 
and 46,000 boepd in 2012. 
We have a pipeline of large scale development 
projects and multiple exploration and appraisal 
wells planned that we expect to bolster this 
inventory further, allowing us to continue 
to grow our production base into the 
foreseeable future.
Nigeria – our engine for growth
Nigeria has provided the opportunities for 
us to grow and establish Afren as a leading 
independent E&P company and as a partner 
of choice. Ultimately, it has also given us the 
track record and credentials that allowed us to 
expand across and beyond Africa. Simply put, 
Nigeria is our heartland and its attraction is 
clear. At a fundamental level, Nigeria is the 
most prolific oil and gas producing nation 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for around 
80% of proved oil and gas reserves discovered 
to date across the region. The sheer scale of 
the resource base and numerous partnership 
opportunities, coupled with our strong ties 
and Nigerian management, mean that we are 
firmly in Nigeria for the long-term. Furthermore, 
Afren’s key early priority was to establish 
a solid platform of cash generative reserves 
and production that would enable us to build 
and grow the business on a sustainable basis. 
Nigeria lends itself perfectly to the achievement 
of this objective. In particular, we had identified

Chief Executive’s Statement Continued
that there are a large number of discovered 
but undeveloped oil fields in Nigeria that have 
been licensed to indigenous operators or are 
peripheral within the Major IOCs’ portfolios, 
and that opportunities exist for an aligned 
partner to assist in the effective development 
and monetisation of these assets by providing 
access to capital and the necessary technical 
and operational capacity. 
We took our partnership model to the next 
level by establishing FHN, an indigenous 
company in which Afren holds a 45% interest 
and for whom we act as Technical Services 
Provider. In 2011 FHN completed the 
acquisition of a 45% interest in the major 
onshore Block OML 26 from the SPDC Joint 
Venture, crystallising a new and innovative 
dimension to our long-term growth plans in 
Nigeria. The completion of the transaction is 
further evidence that, as pressure mounts on 
the incumbent asset holders to optimise 
development of Nigeria’s national hydrocarbon 
resources and develop local capacity, a 
secondary asset acquisition and divestiture 
market is opening up in the country. The 
transaction is also a strong endorsement of the 
progressive role that independent E&Ps such as 
Afren can play in achieving this goal. 
I am proud to be able to say that we have now 
successfully delivered two high quality Nigerian 
development projects in Ebok and Okoro, and 
built a portfolio of six further development, 
appraisal and exploration projects. These will 
ensure we continue to organically grow our 
reserves and production base in Nigeria for 
many years to come. Furthermore, we are now 
in a better position than ever to capitalise on 
new partnership opportunities that may 
present themselves. These include those 
currently held in joint ventures between the 
Nigerian Government and Major IOCs, assets 
that could be connected to future indigenous 
licensing rounds, and assets of other Nigerian 
companies if appropriate. The future for us 
in Nigeria is bright.
Transferring our core skills with expansion 
into the Kurdistan region of Iraq
Our most significant strategic move in 201 1 
was undoubtedly our expansion into the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq. We are an 
entrepreneurial Company and take a long-term 
view of growing our business. We play to our 
strengths by leveraging our relationships and 
expertise to access new basins in areas where 
we can gain a strategically and competitively 
advantageous position – always willing to move 
ahead of the curve for the right opportunities. 
Afren is now the most active international 
independent E&P in Nigeria, and also in East 
Africa where we have assembled a highly 
attractive acreage position in some of the 
region’s most sought after play fairways. 
Thematically, the Kurdistan region of Iraq 
shares similarities with the Nigerian opportunity 
set. Although oil has been discovered in 
abundance and plays proven, the region has 
nevertheless been overlooked by, or remained 
out of reach for, much larger international 
companies. This has created a window of 
opportunity for smaller, agile independents to 
secure assets with world class potential. For us, 
it is a prime opportunity to transfer and deploy 
the fast track development and production 
capabilities that we have developed in Nigeria, 
and deliver a complementary additional 
production stream to the business. The 
acquisition is consistent with our strategic 
priorities and has delivered independently 
certified net 2P/2C resources of 868 mmbbls 
at US$0.68 per 2P/2C bbl – well below other 
regional transaction values during the year. 
2012 will see us focus on development of 
the major Barda Rash field, and progressive 
transitioning of 2C resources into 2P reserves 
and production. We have received all requisite 
approvals for the Field Development Plan 
associated with approximately 500 mmbbls 
of light oil at Barda Rash. There we plan to 
commence production this year from existing 
well stock and ultimately seek to deliver up to 
125,000 bopd over the medium term. We will 
also continue to explore the highly prospective 
Ain Sifni block as part of our broader 
exploration and appraisal drilling campaign.
Moving into our most active period 
of exploration drilling
We recognise that exploration is one of the 
most efficient ways of creating significant 
value, if done well and in a structured way. 
For us, first and foremost, exploration should 
be carried out on a sustainable and internally 
funded basis. Secondly, it is important to have 
a prospect inventory balanced across the risk 
spectrum that offers exposure to a variety 
of independent play types and geologies. 
We have therefore constructed our 
exploration portfolio around play-based 
themes with an emphasis on blending 
exposure across:
•  Low risk, quick to monetise opportunities 
in and around our core production and 
development areas in the Niger Delta and 
Kurdistan region of Iraq.
•  Moderate risk, proven play concepts that 
offer significant upside along the West 
Africa Transform Margin and other parts 
of the region.
•  Higher risk, play opening opportunities 
in the rift and coastal basins of East Africa.
We believe that technical maturity of an asset 
is key to unwinding risk and uncertainty, 
and we seek to use available technologies 
to minimise pre-drill risks and maximise our 
chances of a successful drilling outcome. 
We also look to actively manage our portfolio 
from a risk/reward perspective, and will 
consider farm in and farm out opportunities 
as appropriate. 2012 will see Afren participate 
in up to 14 exploration wells across our core 
areas, each of which has the potential to 
materially transform our discovered resource 
base. We were pleased to make a successful 
start to our campaign with the Okoro East 
exploration well, offshore Nigeria, and eagerly 
look forward to the outcome of our other 
current and planned wells throughout the 
remainder of the year.  Afren plc 29
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
KPIs and Risk 
Management
External market and industry backdrop
2011 was a period of continued volatility in 
the markets, characterised by political tensions 
and unrest in North Africa and spreading 
across the Middle East, followed by the 
Eurozone crisis. Negative news from the 
Eurozone in particular depressed investor 
sentiment toward equities worldwide in 
the second half of the year, resulting in 
downward pressure on equity valuations. 
Against this backdrop, commodity prices 
strengthened over the course of 2011, with 
Brent Crude starting the year at US$95.3/bbl 
and exiting the year at US$106.6/bbl – 
an increase of 12%. Continued uncertainty 
in the Middle East has led to ongoing 
concerns over risks to near-term oil supply. 
These have, in turn, contributed to oil prices 
staying consistently above US$110/bbl in 2012 
year-to-date. We actively seek to manage our 
exposure to oil price volatility and continue to 
adopt an opportunistic approach to hedging. 
The US dollar strengthened against sterling 
in the first half of 2011, but weakened over 
the last few months of the year to give an 
average rate of US$/£1.604, with a change 
over the year of 0.3%.
In terms of the cost environment, the effects 
of inflation on discretionary capital and 
operating expenditure for Afren have been 
negligible on account of current price levels. 
Initial indications for the industry in 2012 
are encouraging, with a consensus indicating 
a supportive oil price environment and equity 
markets making positive ground in the first 
few months of the year. We recognise that 
the future will always hold a degree of risk 
and uncertainty. In this respect we are 
planning for a number of possible external 
scenarios, and will ensure that operational 
and financial flexibility is integral to Afren’s 
business to enable us to deliver 
maximum returns.
2012 to 2015 business targets
Having expanded the business significantly 
over the past three years, we feel it is 
important to set out our business targets 
for the next three years, in alignment with 
our strategic vision and objectives. Targets 
to 2015 are therefore to:
•  Continue to grow Afren’s presence in our 
core areas of activity and geological plays;
•  Progressively transition a significant portion 
of our existing 2C resource base into the 
2P reserves category;
•  Maintain valuation discipline by targeting 
2P/2C additions at a cost of under US$4/bbl;
•  Discover 250 mmboe of net recoverable 
2P/2C reserves and resources from our 
forward exploration drilling programme;
•  Deliver year-on-year production growth;
•  Manage and optimise our production and 
development operations to maximise the 
core value of the business;
•  Ensure that available capital is deployed in 
the most efficient way and in alignment with 
our full cycle business requirements; and
•  Continually improve CSR performance.
Outlook
We have made a strong start to 2012. 
Production has increased substantially as a 
result of ramp up at the Ebok field. We are 
making good progress in the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq, having moved into the development 
phase of the large Barda Rash field, and have 
already begun to see a positive production 
response to early optimisation measures at 
OML 26. Our appraisal activities will assist 
in maturing existing discoveries through the 
development approval process and we have 
made a successful start to our 2012 
exploration drilling campaign, which will 
see Afren participate in multiple high impact 
wells in a combination of proven and frontier 
basins. Underpinned by a strong financial 
platform and mature capital structure, 
we look forward to another year of 
significant achievement.

Operations Review 
Production and development
An established and growing production base. In 201 1, we 
achieved first oil at the Ebok field and successfully completed 
infill drilling at the Okoro field. The Group is well placed to 
achieve 100,000 boepd of production by 2017 from known 
2P reserves and contingent resources (on Field Development 
Plan approval where appropriate) from the Ebok, Okoro, 
Okoro East, CI-1 1, OML 26, Okwok and Barda Rash projects.

Strong production performance
In 2011, Afren and its partner Amni 
International Petroleum Development 
Company Limited (Amni) successfully 
completed two infill wells, Okoro-11 and 
Okoro-12, taking the total number of 
producing wells at the field to nine. As a 
result, output at the field during the year 
averaged 15,801 bopd on a gross basis 
(9,000 bopd net to Afren) in line with 
guidance. In 2012 the partners are aiming 
to sustain production from existing well 
stock between 14,000 bopd and 16,000 
bopd. By the end of 2011 the Okoro field had 
produced 19.8 million barrels of oil.
New oil discovery made at Okoro East
Post period end, Afren and Amni announced 
that the Okoro East exploration well had 
made a new oil discovery. The well was 
spudded on 18 December 2011 with the 
Transocean Adriatic lX jack-up drilling rig, 
the objective being to explore a separate, 
previously undrilled structure located 
approximately 2 km east of the Okoro main 
field. Okoro East is in a similar structural 
setting to the main field, with a fault sealed 
three-way dip closure in Tertiary reservoir 
sands at equivalent intervals to the Okoro 
main field. 
In addition, the Okoro East exploration well 
was targeting a deeper horst block structure, 
a play concept that had not been previously 
explored on the block. The well was drilled 
to a total measured depth of 8,751 ft 
(8,016 ft true vertical depth) and successfully 
encountered good quality oil in both the 
Tertiary reservoir sands equivalent to those 
that have been developed and are in 
production at the Okoro main field, and the 
deeper, previously unexplored reservoirs. 
The well encountered 549 ft true vertical 
thickness of net oil pay (580 ft gross) and 
41 ft of net gas pay. The discovery of pay 
in the deeper zones has opened up further 
prospectivity at similar levels on the Okoro 
main field and elsewhere on the block. 
The partners subsequently undertook and 
completed logging and testing operations, 
confirming the presence of a high quality 
38° to 40° API oil in excellent reservoir sands. 
Pressure data that was also obtained has 
assisted with the Group’s structural 
understanding of the field and will be used 
to help determine the optimal development 
solution for this significant new discovery. 
2012 Outlook 
The year ahead will see ongoing management 
of existing production at the Okoro field with 
the objective of optimising the oil recovery 
factor from the developed reservoir zones. 
There are two available well slots at the 
existing Okoro wellhead platform, from which 
Afren and its partner Amni plan to drill new 
production wells targeting the Okoro East 
reservoirs, in order to establish early 
production whilst also deciding upon the 
most appropriate long-term development 
solution for the new field.

Production and development
Production start-up
In 2011, Afren and its local partner Oriental 
successfully commenced production at the 
Ebok field. By year end the partners had 
commissioned all 14 production wells 
associated with the initial phases of the field 
development. The project is Afren’s second 
major greenfield development offshore 
south-east Nigeria, following the Okoro field 
development, and first oil was achieved in a 
record time of little over two years following 
the first appraisal well drilled by the partners. 
By the end of 201 1 the Ebok field had produced 
approximately 3.0 million barrels of oil.
Innovative development solution
The development configuration at Ebok 
consists of two unmanned wellhead platforms 
at the Central Fault Block and West Fault Block 
locations. Both are tied back to a Mobile 
Offshore Production Unit (MOPU) where the 
produced crude oil is processed. From there it 
is piped to a 1.2 million barrel capacity Floating 
Storage Offloading vessel (FSO) spread-moored 
nearby, prior to offtake and direct sale on the 
international market. 
The MOPU is a former jack-up drilling unit  
that was specially converted into a production 
facility. The FSO was likewise converted, 
from a pre-existing tanker vessel. Both of 
these initiatives significantly reduced lead times 
to delivery compared to if new build facilities 
had been fabricated. The MOPU is designed 
to allow for future on-site expansion to 
accommodate higher production rates, and 
the FSO can quickly and efficiently be changed 
out for a larger capacity vessel should greater 
storage capacity be required. Furthermore, 
the MOPU and FSO development solution 
has enabled the Group to save an estimated 
US$51 million in upfront costs and day rate 
charges compared to alternative FPSO-based 
development concepts also considered.
Creating a new production hub offshore 
south-east Nigeria
Our development strategy is to systematically 
bring each proven area of the Ebok field 
onstream and, through ongoing drilling, 
continue to increase the reserves base and 
production from the field over the coming 
months and years. We plan for the MOPU and 
FSO to become a central facility, not just for 
the immediately surrounding Ebok structure, 
but also for the broader Ebok/Okwok/OML 
115 area. This will facilitate the economical and 
rapid tie-back of production from potential 
future developments on the acreage.
2012 Outlook
Afren and Oriental plan to drill a further four 
horizontal production wells from the West 
Fault Block location in 2012. These will target 
proved oil bearing zones that were not captured 
by the initial phases of field development 
work. The field partners also plan to drill an 
exploration well on the Ebok North Fault Block 
during the first half of the year.

Overview
Okwok is an undeveloped oil field located in 
OML 67, 50 km offshore in 132 ft of water 
and in close proximity to the Afren/Oriental-
owned Ebok development. The field was 
discovered by the ExxonMobil/NNPC JV 
in 1967 (Okwok-1), and two subsequent 
appraisal wells were drilled in 1968 (Okwok-2 
and Okwok-3), but not production tested. 
The Okwok-1 and Okwok-2 wells 
encountered over 150 ft of oil pay. The 
Okwok-9 appraisal well was spudded during 
August 2010 by Afren and Oriental, and 
reached a total measured depth of 8,083 ft. 
The well was completed over a 35 ft interval 
with average porosity of 30% and flowed 31° 
API crude oil. This confirmed the field as a 
commercial development project.
The Group completed an Ocean Bottom 
Cable 3D seismic survey over the whole Ebok/
Okwok/OML 115 area in November 2011, 
acquiring in total 348 km
2
 of new, high 
quality data. Processing of the new data 
is under way and expected to be completed 
by the second quarter of 2012. One of the 
primary purposes of the new data is to assist 
in development planning for the Okwok field, 
alongside determining the optimal placement 
of one further appraisal well.
2012 Outlook
Afren and its partner Oriental intend to drill 
one further appraisal well at the Okwok field 
during the second half of 2012, ahead of 
formal submission of a Field Development Plan 
to the Nigerian authorities. The most likely 
development scenario for Okwok comprises 
the installation of a separate dedicated 
production processing platform tied back to 
and sharing the existing 1.2 mmbbls capacity 
Ebok Floating Storage Offloading vessel (FSO) 
located approximately 13 km to the west. 4

Completion of a landmark  
transaction by FHN
On 1 December 2011, First Hydrocarbon 
Nigeria (FHN), in which Afren is a 45% 
shareholder, announced that it had completed 
the acquisition of a 45% interest in the 
OML 26 licence onshore Nigeria from the 
Shell Petroleum Development Company of 
Nigeria Ltd (SPDC), Total E&P Nigeria Ltd (Total) 
and Nigeria Agip Oil Company (Agip), together 
with the SPDC Joint Venture. FHN also 
announced that it had reached completion 
on financing facilities totalling US$280 million 
enabling it to fully fund the acquisition cost 
and its share of future capital requirements 
associated with the initial development of the 
block. FHN is partnered in the redevelopment 
of the block with Nigerian Petroleum 
Development Company (NPDC), the oil and 
gas exploration and production subsidiary of 
Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC). 
A major redevelopment opportunity 
with substantial upside
The Ogini and Isoko fields are currently 
producing from a limited number of 
currently active drainage points. Several 
wells are currently shut in and there is 
significant potential for further redevelopment. 
Under the proposed development plan, 
initial work is focused on certain ‘quick-win’ 
opportunities including low-cost workovers 
of existing wells and reactivation of gas lift 
to existing wells. From the existing wells, the 
Block attained production of 10,500 bopd 
with optimised compressor uptime in 
December 2011. The partners will next seek 
to mobilise a land rig to the field location in 
order to commence drilling new development 
wells and undertake de-bottlenecking work 
of surface facilities. 
Significant upside potential also exists at the 
undeveloped Aboh, Ovo and Ozoro discoveries, 
together with an estimated 615 mmboe 
gross unrisked prospective resources defined 
across multiple prospects that will continue 
to be worked up in parallel to, and 
integrated with, future development plans. 
2012 Outlook 
The proposed forward work programme 
(including facilities upgrade) is expected to 
sustain optimised production in 2012 and 
increase production to more than 40,000 
bopd through phased development over 
the next four years.

A large scale development project
The Barda Rash PSC is located 55 km north 
west of Erbil, and holds the 14,015 mmbbls 
STOIIP/1,433 mmbbls gross recoverable Barda 
Rash oil field (split approximately 471 mmbbls 
light oil and 962 mmbbls heavier oil). The field 
is defined as an elongated anticline with 
surface expression of 20 km length and up 
to 7 km width. The reservoirs are fracture 
carbonates of various depositional settings.
In 2009, the BR-1 discovery well was drilled 
to 3,300 m and successfully encountered oil 
in Cretaceous to Jurassic reservoirs. Well tests 
were carried out on the Jurassic Mus and 
Adaiyah formations, each yielding rates of 
around 3,200 bopd, with a subsequent 
extended test of the BR-1 well producing 
440,000 barrels of 30° to 32° API oil over a 
three-month period. During this time, oil was 
trucked from onsite storage and sent to local 
refineries. Export pipeline infrastructure is 
located approximately 55 km from the field 
location and has capacity available. Two 
further wells were drilled at the field in 2010 
– BR-2 and BR-3 – both encountering oil 
full-to-base in all reservoirs. No oil water 
contact has yet been established. The field 
is defined by 330 km of good quality 2D 
seismic data.
Kurdistan region of Iraq – a world class 
petroleum play
2011 saw the Group expand its geographic 
footprint to encompass the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq, through the acquisition of a 60% 
participating interest in the Barda Rash PSC 
and 20% participating interest in the Ain Sifni 
PSC. The Kurdistan region of Iraq represents 
an attractive upstream opportunity set for 
Afren. The region is geologically, part of the 
world’s most prolific petroleum system, the 
Zagros Fold Belt trend. This extends across all 
of the Middle East’s most productive regions 
and accounts for 60% of the world’s proved 
oil and gas reserves. 
The Kurdistan region of Iraq is a heavily 
under-explored component of this play, with 
only a small portion of licensed acreage and 
limited number of mapped prospects having 
been drilled to date. Despite this, drilling 
results so far have yielded exploration success 
rates in excess of 70% and discovery rates of 
over 200 million barrels per well. This justifies 
its status as a fast emerging region of global 
oil and gas importance. Estimates for ‘yet to 
find’ resources in the region are substantial, 
ranging from 40 billion to 70 billion barrels. 
This potential has not gone unnoticed, with 
the region continuing to attract the attention 
of the global oil Majors as competition for 
acreage intensifies.

Left: 
Barda Rash field in the Kurdistan region of Iraq; 
the target for initial phases of development is 
approximately 500 million barrels of light oil. 
2012 Outlook
In December, Afren received all necessary 
approvals of the Field Development Plan 
(FDP) for Barda Rash. The Group plans 
to undertake a phased development of the 
field with production start-up scheduled 
in 2012. Work is now focused on the 
development of the light oil reserves, the 
first stage of which comprises re-entering 
the three existing wells that have been 
drilled at the field to date, completing them 
as production wells and commissioning 
a modular early production system. 
Production will be trucked to nearby 
pipeline export points and ultimately in the 
third phase, be exported via the planned 
Taq Taq to the Ceyhan export pipeline. 
The Company will then commence the 
drilling and completion of multiple new 
development wells with the intention of 
increasing production to a planned trucking 
capacity of 35,000 bopd and ultimately 
to a targeted 125,000 bopd by 2017. 
Following this, the Group will focus on the 
development and production of the heavier 
oil resources, which will offer further large 
scale production growth.

 ‘ The fact that only 7% of our 
discovered 2P and 2C reserves and 
resource base has been developed 
and brought into production 
to date is indicative of the scale 
of growth our portfolio is capable 
of yielding in the future.’ 38 Afren plc

Production and development
Production at Block CI-11
Full year 201 1 gross production at Block CI-1 1 
was approximately 3,200 boepd, comprising 
an oil rate of 831 bopd and natural gas rate 
of 14 mmcfd. Production levels were below 
expectation during the year due to the impact 
of political and social unrest. This delayed 
importation of equipment and resources 
required for routine maintenance of the 
compressor unit during the first quarter 
of 201 1.
2012 Outlook
We continue to evaluate our strategic and 
operational options.
Overview
Afren is the sole owner of the Lion Gas Plant, 
which processes gas from the CI-11 and 
adjacent CI-26 and CI-40 blocks operated by 
Canadian Natural Resources. The plant has an 
inlet capacity of 75 mmcfd and strips gasoline 
and butane from the rich gas stream it 
receives. The butane is sold into the local 
market (meeting approximately 35% of 
domestic butane demand) and gasoline is 
spiked into the CI-11 crude stream and sold 
on the international market. The LGP plant 
benefits from tax-exempt status, delivering 
618 boepd average NGL production in 2011. 
Production levels were below expectations 
during the year, due to the impact of political 
and social unrest in the first half of the year.
2012 Outlook
The Group continues to evaluate methods 
to extract propane at the plant, which could 
be sold locally to industrial customers.

Overview
OML 115 surrounds the Ebok and Okwok 
development area, where Afren is also 
partnered with Oriental, and is close to the 
giant Zafiro Complex in Equatorial Guinea. 
The block offers us an attractive opportunity 
to further capitalise on our extensive 
knowledge of the area, exploring the same 
reservoirs that have already been proved as oil 
bearing and productive at Ebok and Okwok. 
The southern portion of the Okwok structure 
(Okwok South) extends into OML 115 and 
additional prospectivity has already been 
defined within the deeper Que Iboe, Biafra 
and Isonga formations. With production 
processing, storage and export infrastructure 
in place at the Ebok field, we have a readily 
available export route for any potential future 
development in the area. At the same time, 
we will be able to benefit from cost synergies, 
lowering the economic threshold for 
new barrels.
2012 Outlook
Following the completion of the Ocean 
Bottom Cable 3D seismic over the whole 
Ebok/Okwok/OML 115 area on 4 November 
2011, the partners plan to drill an exploration 
well on the block during the second half of 
2012, potentially targeting the Ufon prospect. 
The Ufon prospect is a three-way dip closed 
structure that is interpreted to have oil 
prospectivity in the same D Series reservoirs 
that have proven to be oil bearing at the 
nearby Ebok and Okwok fields among 
other intervals.
‘ We have assembled a balanced 
portfolio of exploration assets 
that provide a mix of exploration 
options across multiple play types 
and basins’.
Overview
The Ain Sifni PSC is located 70 km north-west 
of Erbil, and operated by Hunt Oil Middle 
East. Drilled on the crest of the Simrit anticline 
in 2010, the JS-1 discovery well logged 
continuous oil pay from 1,1 10 m to 3,070 m 
in Cretaceous and Jurassic reservoirs. Triassic 
reservoir targets were not penetrated by the 
well and no oil water contact was established. 
The PSC has substantial upside over and 
above the volumes discovered to date at the 
Simrit structure, with prospective resources 
independently estimated at 7,493 mmbbls 
STOIIP and 917 mmbbls recoverable on a 
gross unrisked basis. This is primarily attributed 
to as yet undrilled parts of the Simrit structure 
and the Maqlub prospect that is interpreted 
to be the westerly extension of the proven 
Barda Rash anticline.
2012 Outlook
The operator, Hunt Oil Middle East, spudded 
the Simrit-2 exploration well at the end of 
October 2011. The well is seeking to prove 
and test Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic 
reservoirs at the western extent of the Simrit 
anticline structure and is drilling ahead in 
accordance with the planned schedule. 
Once this is completed, the partners intend 
to proceed with drilling further exploration 
wells targeting the East Simrit, Maqlub and 
Betnaar structures.

The Keta Block is located in the Volta River 
Basin in Eastern Ghana, next to the maritime 
boundary with Togo. The block has both 
Tertiary and Cretaceous prospectivity, with 
the principal exploration focus being the 
Cretaceous Albian to Campanian sections. 
The block offers multiple prospects and 
leads, with a variety of trapping and 
depositional settings. A number of these 
show potential for significant stratigraphic 
trapping and giant field potential. 
In October 2011, we announced the formal 
completion of the farm out of a 35% 
working interest and transfer of operatorship 
to Eni. Under the terms of the farm out, 
Afren will receive a carry through the 
drilling of one exploration well, back costs 
and carry through future seismic acquisition. 
A milestone bonus is payable upon the 
achievement of first oil on the block. 
2012 Outlook
Post period end on 6 February 2012, Afren 
announced that Eni had commenced drilling 
of the Nunya-1X (formerly named Cuda-2) 
exploration well with the Marianas semi-
submersible drilling rig. The Nunya prospect 
is a four-way dip closed structure with a 
primary reservoir target comprising Upper 
Cretaceous deep-marine fan sandstones. 
These are analogous to those that have

Overview
OPL 310 is located in the Upper Cretaceous

Transform Margin and lies next to the 
Chevron operated Aje field, which has been 
declared commercial. Extending from the 
shallow water continental shelf to deep water, 
the block represents an exploration opportunity 
in an under-explored basin with a proven 
working hydrocarbon system. It is also in close 
proximity to the recently completed West 
African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) which allows 
future gas discoveries to be readily developed. 
We have good seismic coverage of the block 
in the form of a 307 km
2
 3D survey and 
483 km of 2D data, which has been 
integrated with new electromagnetic gravity 
data that the partners acquired in 2011.
Afren has identified several prospects that lie 
in the same Senonian, Turonian and Albian 
sandstone intervals that have yielded 
significant discoveries along with the West 
African Transform Margin in Ghana and 
Côte d’Ivoire.

1,600 m to 1,800 m. One discovery has been 
made on the block with the sole exploration 
well that has been drilled to date. In 2006, 
the Obo-1 exploration well encountered 
150 ft of net pay and importantly proved 
a working hydrocarbon system in the JDZ. 
The proximity of Total’s operated licences and 
production facilities in Nigeria creates strong 
synergies and will enable cost reductions 
in any potential future development of the 
licence’s resources. 
2012 Outlook
Total is seeking to reprocess existing seismic

Overview
CI-01 has a proven petroleum system in 
multiple reservoirs within the Cretaceous. 
Both oil and gas have been found and tested 
in the Ibex and Kudu fields, while only gas has 
been found in the Eland field. Most of the oil 
and gas encountered is in reservoirs that are 
younger than the Albian structural closures 
targeted in the past. There are 3D seismic 
surveys covering Ibex, Kudu and Eland, and 
a 2D seismic grid covers the rest of the block. 
CI-01 borders the maritime boundary with 
Ghana, and lies adjacent to the major Jubilee 
and Tweneboa oil and gas discoveries made 
in recent years. 
By applying the latest understanding of 
Cretaceous depositional systems to the 
existing well and seismic dataset, to redefine 
the distribution of oil and gas in existing 
discoveries on the block, we believe that the 
potential exists for these accumulations to be 
significantly larger than originally mapped.

Overview
Block 2B is located in the Orange River Basin, 
an offshore shallow water area lying between 
the Ibhubesi gas field and the Namaqualand 
coast. The block covers an area of 
approximately 5,000 km
2
 with water depths 
ranging from shore line to 250 m. The main 
reservoir objectives are the fluvial and 
lacustrine sands of the AJ Graben of Lower 
Cretaceous age, which occur in three 
sequences. The A-J1 exploration well, drilled 
in 1989, successfully encountered oil in these 
sequences and tested good quality 36° API 
oil. Reprocessing of 2D seismic data has since 
defined several other Lower Cretaceous rift 
graben prospects, genetically analogous to 
the prolific Lake Albert play in Uganda. 
Further prospectivity has also been identified 
within a fractured basement play (analogous 
to Yemen), which could form a secondary 
exploration play on the acreage.
2012 Outlook
The partners’ near-term work programme 
involves the acquisition of 600 km
2
 of new 3D 
seismic data, with reprocessing of existing 2D 
seismic and ongoing seismic inversion and 
regional biostratigraphy studies ahead of 
expected exploration drilling in 2013 or 2014. Afren plc 43

We are focused on onshore rift 
basins and the deepwater 
Cretaceous/Tertiary play systems 
which are geological settings that 
have yielded significant discoveries 
in Uganda, Sudan, Tanzania, 
Madagascar, Mozambique and 
most recently in Kenya.’
Overview
Block 10A is located in the Anza Basin 
onshore northern Kenya, which is part 
of the Central African Mesozoic rift system 
that also includes the Muglad Graben 
in Southern Sudan, and the Lamu Graben 
in Kenya. The block covers a total of 
14,747 km
2
. Three exploration wells were 
drilled by Amoco in Block 10A (Sirius-1, 
Bellatrix-1 and Chalbi-3) throughout 1988 
and 1989, in the southern part of the block. 
The presence of oil and gas shows and the 
high maturity level of organic rocks in wells 
Bellatrix-1 and Sirius-1 are evidence of a 
working hydrocarbon system on the block. 
The latter well notably established the 
presence of an Upper Cretaceous lacustrine 
source rock that may have generated 
low-sulphur/paraffinic oil.
2012 Outlook
Having satisfied all seismic work commitments 
with the acquisition of 750 km of 2D seismic 
over the block in 201 1, the operator (Tullow 
Oil) will commence the drilling of one 
exploration well on the Paipai prospect. The 
drilling rig is now scheduled to arrive at the 
field location later than planned, which means 
that the well is expected to spud in mid-2012.
Overview
Block 1 is located on the western margin 
of the Mandera-Lugh basin in north-eastern 
Kenya bordering both Somalia and Ethiopia, 
where it is connected to the Ogaden basin. 
The Upper Triassic and Jurassic formations 
that have been identified are considered 
to be the primary zones of oil prospectivity. 
An oil seep close to the Tarbaj-1 well in the 
south-west corner of the block confirms the 
presence of hydrocarbons. Analogous data 
with the Ogaden basin also suggests there 
may be other potential source rocks and 
reservoirs. The Bur Mayo and the Kalicha-Seir 
formations in the Mandera-Lugh basin appear 
comparable to the Lower and Upper 
Hamanlei (Jurassic) formations in the Ogaden 
basin. If analogous, these formations should 
have high total organic content (TOC) source 
rocks and good quality reservoirs.
Several major structures have already been 
mapped on the block, that currently has 850 
km of existing 2D seismic coverage. During 
the first half of 2011, the partners successfully 
acquired airborne gravity and magnetic data, 
the results of which have been encouraging 
and have been used to target an additional 
1,800 km of 2D seismic data on the block.
2012 Outlook
The partners on Block 1 have commenced

Overview
Blocks L17 and L18 are located in the Lamu 
Coastal Basin, offshore south-east Kenya, 
covering an area of approximately 
1,275 km
2
 and 3,630 km
2
 respectively. 
They are situated in water depths varying 
from a few metres along the shoreline 
to up to around 500 m.
There are several potential source rocks for 
the Cretaceous plays in the southern areas 
of the basin including the Premo-Triassic 
Karoo interval and sections within the 
Lower to Middle Jurassic. There are oil 
seeps in the Lamu Basin and Pemba Island 
linked to a Jurassic source which implies 
that the structures in Blocks L17/L18 are 
most likely oil bearing. Although there may 
be additional potential in clastic reservoirs 
within the Tertiary, the main reservoir 
targets are in the Upper Cretaceous. The 
hydrocarbons are expected to have been 
generated in the deep Pemba trough south 
of Block L18.
Following completion in 2010 of a 400 km 
short offset shallow 2D seismic acquisition 
programme in the Shimoni area of Block 
L18 and in the Mombasa area of Block L17, 
a number of newly defined prospects and 
leads have been identified on the acreage.
2012 Outlook
The Group has completed the acquisition 
of additional 2D seismic data targeting the 
deepwater region of the block and plans 
to drill one exploration well targeting the 
coastal play in the second half of the year, 
and is currently trying to source an 
appropriate rig.
Overview
On 24 March 2011, Afren expanded its 
East African footprint with the acquisition 
of a 74% operated working interest in the 
Tanga Block, located offshore and onshore 
north-east Tanzania. The block lies south of, 
and is contiguous with, Afren’s 100% owned 
and operated blocks L17 and L18 in Kenya. 
It contains a southerly extension of the same 
coastal high and basin trough plays allowing 
us to leverage our regional expertise 
and knowledge. 
The block is covered by 200 km of legacy 2D 
seismic data, and 1,200 km of good quality 
new 2D seismic data. Immediately post 
completion, Afren undertook and completed 
a 751 km shallow water 2D seismic programme. 
The results of this survey have been encouraging, 
and provide excellent definition of several 
large scale prospects and leads that have 
been identified to date, together with new 
zones of additional potential. 
During Q4 2011, over 900 km of deepwater 
2D seismic was acquired. This is currently 
being processed with final results expected 
at the end of the Q1 2012.
2012 Outlook
The partners plan to acquire 3D seismic data 
in the deepwater and to drill the Orpheus 
prospect in 2012 from a shallow water 
offshore location and is in the process 
of securing a jack up drilling rig capable 
of this work.

Areas A, B, C
Areas A, B and C are located in the Seychelles 
micro-continent and cover a combined area 
of approximately 14,964 km
2
. Areas A and B 
are located in shallow to deep water in the 
northern half of the Seychelles plateau while 
Area C is in shallow water to the south. 
The main exploration targets are the 
Permo-Triassic Karoo interval which comprises 
non-marine sands inter-bedded with shales 
and a Cretaceous marine rift basin underlain 
by Jurassic platform source rocks. The Karoo 
formation contains both the source rock 
and the reservoir. Over 1980 to 1981, three 
exploration wells were drilled, all of which 
encountered oil shows and confirmed the 
presence of a working hydrocarbon system. 
Over 3,500 km of 2D seismic data was 
acquired over areas A and B in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 and is currently being processed.
2012 Outlook
Seismic data acquired to date by the partners 
has revealed the presence of several large 
scale structures in all three licence areas, 
in addition to new basins that could also 
contain significant Jurassic and Cretaceous 
sedimentary sections. Afren plc 45

Overview
In 2011, Afren and its partners decided to 
relinquish Blocks 2 and 6 in order to focus 
future exploration activities on Block 7 and 8.
Blocks 7 and 8 are located in the Ogaden 
Basin and are both part of the same PSC 
covering an overall area of 23,162 km
2
. 
Exploration in the Ethiopia area began in 
the 1970s with Tenneco discovering the Calub 
and Hilal gas fields approximately 200 km 
to the east of Block 6. Exploration continued 
throughout the 1980s. Three wells, El Kuran-1, 
El Kuran-2 and Bodle-1, have been drilled 
on the blocks. Both of the El Kuran wells 
encountered hydrocarbons and oil was 
recovered from the Jurassic Hamanlei 
formation. The main potential reservoirs 
in the basin are clastic sediments of the 
Carboniferous age Calub formation and 
the Triassic age Adigrat formation. In addition, 
some permeable Jurassic carbonate rocks in 
the Hamanlei formation can be considered 
potential reservoirs.
2012 Outlook
Work is ongoing to further interpret the 
prospectivity of Blocks 7 and 8 ahead of 
expected drilling in mid-2012.
Overview
Block 1101 is located on the eastern flank 
of the Ambilobe Basin, onshore northern 
Madagascar. The block encompasses an area 
of approximately 14,900 km
2
. Some 220 km 
of 2D seismic has been acquired over the 
block to date. The main exploration targets are 
sands of the Isalo formation. There are proven 
heavy oil accumulations in the Isalo formation 
in Central Madagascar such as Bemolanga and 
Tsimiroro, indicating good reservoir conditions.
Having increased its working interest to 
90% through the reassignment of 50% from 
partner Candax Energy, the Group has agreed 
with state oil and gas agency OMNIS an 
expanded work programme that combines 
the first two exploration phases on the block 
and requires the drilling of one exploration 
well to a minimum depth of 1,600 metres. 
The partners have also agreed to acquire 
an additional 150 km of new 2D seismic and 
airborne gravity and magnetics. The airborne 
gravity and magnetic acquisition has been 
undertaken and is currently being processed. 
2012 Outlook
The expanded work programme combines 
the first two exploration phases on the block 
and requires the drilling of one exploration 
well. The partners have also agreed to acquire 
an additional 150 km of new 2D seismic. 
Drilling is expected in 2013.

Financial Review
Financial Review
Afren has transformed its capital structure in 201 1 – cash flow 
from operations strengthened with the start of production at 
Ebok; the January 201 1 bond issue enabled the Group’s debt to 
be restructured such that it is better aligned to future investment 
needs and production cash flows; and an equity placing, plus 
a second bond issue in February 2012, has funded the acquisition 
of two PSCs in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. There are now 
considerable financial resources at the Group’s disposal.

Financial Review Continued
Profit for the year
Profit after tax on continuing activities for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 was US$125.4 
million (2010: US$45.9 million). Normalised profit 
after tax was US$125.1 million. See note 7 to 
the financial statements for a full reconciliation 
of this figure (2010: US$62.4 million). 
The impairment charge on oil and gas 
assets was US$1.1 million (2010: charge 
US$1.6 million) largely reflecting the 
relinquishment by Afren of its interest in 
Ethiopia Blocks 2 and 6. The low level of 
impairment reflects the ongoing success 
of the Group’s exploration and appraisal 
programme.
Finance costs for 2011 were US$57.1 million 
(2010: US$11.3 million). The increase in 
finance costs relates to the issue of a new 
Bond in January 2011 (issue costs of 
US$20.9 million); and early redemption fees 
of US$2.5 million arising from the settlement 
of the Group’s historical facilities, as well as 
increased interest charges relating to the Bond 
issue and further drawdowns on our Ebok 
facility during the year. The Group capitalised 
US$46.9 million of finance charges in the 
year, largely as part of the Ebok project 
financing (2010: US$13.6 million).
 
During the year we recognised a loss from 
derivative financial instruments of US$12.5 
million (2010: US$8.9 million) relating to crude 
oil hedging contracts. This reflects a realised 
loss of US$9.3 million (2010: US$2.4 million 
loss) as the oil price realised averaged 
consistently above the hedged price during 
the year. There was a further mark to market 
loss of US$3.2 million (2010: loss of US$6.5 
million) on the unrealised positions due to 
further strengthening in the oil price from 
around US$90 per barrel at the start of the 
year to over US$108 per barrel at year end.

1. Result for the year
Revenues
Revenue for 2011 was US$596.6 million, 
an increase of 87% from 2010. The increase 
in revenue arises from the start of production 
from the Ebok field in the year (US$272.0 
million) partly offset by the reduced working 
interest on the Okoro field. Working interest 
production for the year increased to 19,154 
boepd from 14,333 boepd in 2010 due to 
the start of production from the Ebok field in 
2011, offset by the Group reaching payback 
on the Okoro field which, as expected, saw 
our interest reduced from 95% to 50% 
in mid-2010.
The Group realised in 2011 an average oil 
price of US$109.0/bbl and an average gas 
price of US$8.8/mcf (2010: US$79.7/bbl and 
US$5.7/mcf), before all royalties. The average 
price for Brent in the period was US$109.0/bbl 
(2010: US$79.5/bbl).
Gross profit
Gross profit for the year was US$302.3 
million, an increase of 134% on the prior year 
(2010: US$129.0 million), largely related to the 
commencement of production at Ebok and 
higher realised prices at the Okoro field. The 
DD&A charge for oil and gas assets in 2011 
was US$155.4 million, an increase of 71% 
on the prior year (2010: US$90.5 million). 
The increased charge relates to the start 
of production at Ebok.
The increase in crude oil stock at the year end 
resulted in a credit for stock adjustment of 
US$25.4 million, compared with a charge 
of US$9.5 million in 2010.
The Group achieved a normalised operating 
cost of US$17.9/boe, a decrease of 1% over 
2010 (2010: US$18.1/boe). This was largely 
due to efficiencies generated in reaching 
full production at Ebok being offset by: 
a decrease in gross production at Okoro and 
an increase in operating expenditure following 
the completion of initial development 
in mid-2010. Normalised cost per barrel 
includes costs and production from Ebok 
from Q4 2011 onwards. All other field costs 
are included on an annualised basis.

2. Financing the Group’s activities
Net cash generated from operating activities 
in 2011 was US$337.5 million (2010: 
US$209.3 million), and this cash has been 
used alongside financing cash flows primarily 
to fund the Group’s exploration and 
appraisal activities.
In January 2011, the Company completed 
a Bond issue, raising US$500 million before 
issue costs. The coupon on the bonds is 
11.5% and they are listed on the Luxembourg 
Stock Exchange. The Company used part of 
the funds to repay borrowings amounting to 
US$171 million of certain pre-existing facilities. 
In February 2012, the Bond issue was 
recognised by Euromoney as one of the 
“2011 Deals of the Year”.
A facilities agreement of US$50 million 
was entered into with Socar Trading S.A. 
in August 2011, and was fully drawn down 
at 31 December 2011. The funds received 
under the Socar loan are used by us for 
general corporate purposes. 
In July 2011, the Company raised US$184.5 
million, before commission and expenses, by 
placing 83,679,544 new ordinary one pence 
shares in the capital of the Company, with 
institutional investors, at a price of 135 pence 
per share. The capital was used to acquire 
a share in the Ain Sifni and Barda Rash 
licences in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
Further payments in connection with 
the acquisition of the Group’s interest in 
the Ain Sifni block were funded through 
a US$200 million corporate credit facility 
provided by BNPP and VTB. US$100 million 
of this was drawn down in November 2011 
and used to fund payments made in 
December 2011 and March 2012.
Associate investment in FHN
In 2010, a gain of US$10.0 million arose as 
a result of new funding raised by FHN’s other 
shareholders increasing the equity share 
attributable to Afren. Similar gains totalling 
US$14.7 million have arisen during 2011, 
as well as a gain of US$8.0 million relating to 
the increase in value of certain equity options 
in FHN held by Afren, driven by an increase 
in the underlying value of FHN.
Afren’s share of FHN’s loss for the year was 
US$14.0 million (2010: US$1.3 million loss), 
reflecting costs incurred in the development 
of FHN’s interest in OML26 during the year. 
This loss is offset by income received from 
FHN of US$6.3 million (2010: US$nil) in 
relation to various management and support 
services provided by Afren.
Taxes paid in the year
The income tax charge for the year is 
US$96.0 million (2010: US$32.9 million). 
The increase reflects the increased profitability 
of the Group in 2011. Of this, US$8.1 million 
(2010: US$0.9 million) has been paid locally 
in Nigeria in respect of income from Okoro. 
The balance of current tax will be paid in 
2012 with the deferred tax liability spread 
over the life of the field.
In addition, the Group pays other taxes 
in the form of royalties, withholding taxes, 
and non-recoverable VAT locally in Africa. 
In 2011 these amounted to US$166.5 million 
(2010: US$83.2 million) – as a percentage 
of revenue this represents 28% (2010: 26%). 
Okoro royalties are deducted within revenue 
whereas Ebok royalties are deducted as 
cost of sales, reflecting differences in the 
applicable contractual arrangements.
Loan repayments in the year, excluding 
payments in respect of finance leases, 
were US$182.3 million reflecting early 
settlement of historical facilities using the 
proceeds of the Bond issue in February 2011 
and periodic payments due under other 
facilities. Cash at bank at 31 December 2011 
was US$291.7 million, resulting in net debt, 
excluding finance leases, of US$548.3 
million (2010: net debt, US$127.5 million).
In 2011 the Group recognised a finance 
lease in respect of the arrangements with 
Mercator Offshore Nigeria (Pte) Limited for 
the production facilities on the Ebok field. 
This resulted in a finance lease liability at 
31 December 2011 of US$135.5 million 
(2010: US$nil) to be settled in monthly 
payments of US$2.4 million (including 
interest) over a seven-year period.

3. Development, appraisal  
and exploration activities
The Group’s investment in appraisal and 
exploration activities has continued during 
2011, with expenditure of US$107 million, 
excluding the acquisition of the Group’s 
interest in the Ain Sifni PSC of US$164 million 
(2010: US$74 million, excluding the acquisition 
of the Black Marlin exploration assets).
The main areas of expenditure were on Okoro 
East (US$7 million), Okwok (US$10 million), 
OML115 (US$45 million), OPL310 (US$10 
million), the acquisition of a 74% interest 
in the Tanga block in Tanzania and seismic 
on the area (US$7 million) and expenditure, 
largely seismic, on the Group’s East African 
exploration assets (US$18 million). 
Development expenditure was US$469 
million, excluding the acquisition of the 
Group’s interest in the Barda Rash PSC, 
largely comprising US$380 million on the 
Ebok field and US$40 million on the Okoro 
infill well drilling programme.
The Group’s 2P and 2C reserves and resources 
have increased by 859 mmboe, or 633% 
as at 31 December 2011 compared to 
31 December 2010, largely achieved by the 
acquisition of the Ain Sifni and Barda Rash 
PSCs and the continued investment in African 
assets such as Ebok and Okoro. 
There has been minimal write-off of 
unsuccessful exploration costs (2011: charge 
of US$1.1 million, 2010: charge of US$1.6 
million) following the relinquishment of the 
Ethiopia Blocks 2 and 6.

4. Acquisitions in the year
In July 201 1 the Group acquired interests in two 
contiguous PSCs located in the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq. The total amount payable for the 
acquisition is US$588.4 million (before the 
discounting of deferred consideration). In parallel 
the Company announced the successful 
placement of 83,679,544 ordinary shares, 
raising a total of £113.0 million (US$184.5 
million) before fees which has been used, 
together with cash and debt resources, 
to fund the acquisition. Final settlement of the 
acquisition costs was made in March 2012. 
The Company also acquired interests in two 
exploration licences during the period; the Tanga 
Block in Tanzania and Block 2B in South Africa.
The Company increased its equity investment 
in FHN in 2011 through additional investments 
of US$9.8 million.

5. Our commitments
The Group has operating and capital 
commitments as at 31 December 2011 of 
US$537.7 million (2010: US$482.6 million), 
largely in respect of the lease of rig and field 
equipment and the ongoing exploration and 
evaluation programmes.

6. Bond issue to fund  
future growth
In February 2012, the Company completed 
a second Bond issue, proceeds of which 
were US$300 million before issue costs. 
The coupon on the bonds is 10.25% and they 
are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. 
The proceeds from the issue of the new Bond 
have been used to repay and cancel the 
US$200 million VTB/BNPP facility and for 
general corporate purposes.

7. Review of our  
hedging arrangements
In the context of volatile oil prices and with 
the imminent first oil at Ebok, the Group 
reviewed its hedging arrangements in 
early 2011.
The Group previously had taken hedging 
positions associated with its operations in 
Okoro and Côte d’Ivoire. These arrangements 
were synthetic puts which allowed the 
Group to protect itself from the downside 
movements in prices while also benefiting 
from most of the upside. In early 2011 the 
Group purchased a number of deferred put 
options. These options allow the Group to sell 
approximately 5.9 million barrels in the period 
to 31 December 2013 at an average price of 
US$82.54/bbl. The average cost of the hedge 
is US$4.08/bbl giving effective protection to 
the Group at a price of US$78.46/bbl. The 
new instruments have been classified as cash 
flow hedges. Each period the portion of the 
gains and losses on the hedging instrument 
that is determined to be an effective hedge 
are taken to equity and the ineffective 
portion, as well as any change in time value, 
is recognised in the income statement. 
In 2011, a loss of US$9.3 million (realised) 
and US$3.2 million (unrealised) was taken 
to the income statement, as a result of 
realised oil prices in the period and forward 
curve being higher than the hedged price.
Existing hedges covering 248,000 barrels 
at a price of US$60/bbl and 339,000 barrels 
at a price of US$81/bbl expired during 2011. 
These instruments were not designated as 
cash flow hedges and gains or losses were 
taken directly to the income statement in 
the period.
Since the year end, to take advantage of recent 
record oil prices, further deferred put options 
have been acquired. These allow the Group 
to sell a further 600,000 barrels at US$90 
in 2012. In addition the Group has acquired 
deferred put spreads at US$90 and US$60 
covering 1.44 million barrels guaranteeing 
US$90 per barrel if the oil price is between 
US$60 and US$90 and a US$30 per barrel 
benefit if the oil price falls below US$60.
The policy of the Group is to protect its 
minimum cash flow requirement in the 
context of a sustained downturn in oil prices. 
As such the maximum amount of our 
working interest we would seek to protect 
with these arrangements is between 20-30% 
of estimated production for a rolling period 
of 24 months forward. Our current outlook 
including the most recent hedge is that we 
have 28% of 2012 oil barrels hedged and 
23% of 2013.
8. Outlook
The operational cash flows achieved from 
Ebok and Okoro in 2011, together with the 
proceeds of the January 2011 bond issue and 
July 2011 equity placing, have remodelled 
Afren’s capital structure and provided the 
basis for further financial flexibility in 2012. 
This flexibility has been enhanced by the 
completion of a second bond issue in 
February 2012.
Afren has made good progress in 2011 and 
continues to grow in strength. The Group has 
assembled a world class portfolio of assets 
that offers significant potential across the full 
cycle E&P value chain. Through clear strategic 
foresight and capitalising on early mover 
advantage in Nigeria, East Africa and the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq, Afren has secured 
attractive acreage positions in some of the 
world’s most prolific and emerging oil and 
gas basins. Combined with a good track 
record of operational delivery and a mature 
capital structure, this means that Afren is well 
positioned for further exponential growth.

Corporate Social Responsibility
CSR: The Afren Approach 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) underpins the way 
we do our business globally. We are committed to improving 
the quality of life in the countries where we operate. 
We always consider the ramifications of our actions and 
incorporate CSR into our management systems and 
procedures. We strive to operate to the highest international 
social, environmental and safety standards.
Health and Safety
We insist on high  
standards of performance  
to ensure our workforce  
remains safe and healthy. 
Page 54
Social
We appreciate the  
opportunities to be gained 
from co-operation with local 
communities, striving to 
make connections and foster 
relationships with all of  
our stakeholders.
Page 55
Human resources
We reward performance  
and offer a progressive  
working environment and 
development opportunities  
for our employees. We will  
not tolerate discrimination  
of any sort.
Page 56
Business ethics
We conduct ourselves  
with integrity to ensure  
that every aspect of our 
business is operating to  
the highest standards  
of business ethics.
Page 57
Environment
We place value on our 
relationship with the  
environment and strive  
constantly to interact  
respectfully with it by being 
mindful of its fragility.
Page 53
How we define CSR 
We continue to evaluate  
our CSR policies and procedures  
against international best practice  
guided by both the UN Global  
Compact and Equator Principles.  
Based on this framework,  
our CSR report covers  
five key areas:
In 2011 we continued to support a variety 
of sustainable initiatives across our operations 
in locations including: 
•  Nigeria – where we focused on supporting 
Nigerian youths from our host communities 
with skills acquisition training to improve 
their chances of long-term employment
•  Côte d’Ivoire – where we support the SOS 
Children’s Village in Aboisso by providing 
food, supplies, beds and medical equipment
•  Kenya – where we donated desks, chairs, 
lockers and other school supplies to primary 
schools in local villages
•  Kurdistan region of Iraq – where we are 
committed to a multi-million dollar project at 
the American University of Iraq – Sulaimani to 
develop a Petroleum Engineering department.
In addition, we have:
•  Experienced no major environmental spills, 
fines or warnings in our operations
•  Achieved over 1 million man-hours without 
a lost time accident on the Ebok project
•   Successfully recruited six graduates through 
our dedicated internship programme. 
Key objectives for 2012 
Our objectives for 2012 are to 
continue to consolidate 
existing systems for 
managing EHSS, community 
and security issues. 2011 saw 
production start-up at Ebok 
and entry into the Kurdistan 
region of Iraq, where we have 
already performed extensive EHSS 
due diligence. In 2012 we intend to 
carry out a Social Impact Assessment for 
the Kurdistan region of Iraq and engage 
with the local communities to implement 
sustainable community development 
projects focused on education. Additionally, 
our goal for EHSS is to have zero lost time 
incidents, zero fatalities, and zero oil spills.
We have defined how we manage EHSS,  
ethical and HR issues through a set of corporate 
policies, management systems and supporting 
procedures and guidelines: www.afren.com Afren plc 53

Corporate responsibility 5
At Afren, environmental management is one of our top priorities. Our operations vary  
from offshore to onshore and our approach is to maintain the highest international 
standards, rather than just abiding by local regulations. For each of our assets,  
we perform environmental impact assessments to identify any and all risks to the 
environment associated with our operations. Throughout 201 1, we worked on defining 
our oil spill response plans and emergency preparedness. Our target was to avoid spills 
altogether, even though a minor spill did occur which was immediately cleaned and 
the incident investigated. Procedures have now been put in place to further strengthen 
spill prevention procedures across our operations.
Atmospheric emissions
Afren is developing its approach to the issue 
of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric 
pollutants. In the first instance we have 
examined our emissions of the key gases, 
carbon dioxide (CO
2), methane (CH4), nitrous 
Oxides (NOx), Sulphur Oxides (SOx) and other 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) since the 
start of operations in 2009. Over this period 
there has clearly been a significant increase 
in activity, with the start of Okoro production, 
intensive development drilling on Ebok and 
the start of Ebok production in 2011. This 
increase is directly reflected in an increase 
in atmospheric emissions.

In addition to looking at the total volumes 
of atmospheric emissions, we have also 
examined the source of emissions by drilling 
and production activity. The results for 2011 
emissions are shown in the graphs above for 
2011 emissions.
As we move into 2012 our focus will remain 
on implementing energy efficiency initiatives 
that are aimed at driving down both our 
energy costs and atmospheric emissions.
Environmental highlights from 
our operations
Environmental monitoring
We are committed to monitoring our 
environmental performance and we are 
making significant progress on quantifying 
the emissions from our operations. In Nigeria 
in particular we have extensive annual 
monitoring programmes carried out on 
our behalf by independent third party 
consultants. This monitoring covers a host 
of environmental parameters including 
atmospheric and liquid discharges, waste 
and noise. The intent of the programme is to 
ensure that our emissions are consistent with 
those we predicted in our environmental 
impact assessments, that they remain within 
the legal limits and that we are able to 
demonstrate this to our stakeholders.
In addition to the atmospheric emissions 
described in the previous section we are 
monitoring the level of oil discharged with 
our produced water. Figure 1 shows that the 
oil concentration in parts per million (ppm) 
for our Nigerian operations remained well 
below our target discharge level of 20 ppm 
throughout 2011.
 
Our waste streams are generally separated 
into recyclable, non-hazardous and hazardous 
materials and disposed of at licensed facilities. 
The total tonnage of production waste arising 
from Okoro and Ebok for 2011 was around 
285 tonnes, with 4,120 tonnes of cuttings 
processed and disposed onshore from drilling 
operations at the two fields.

201 1 Highlights
•  Achieved over 1 million man hours 
without lost time incidents on 
Ebok project
•  Significant improvement to our 
Total Recordable Incident Rate 
(TRIR) and Lost Time Injury Frequency 
(LTIF) (see graphs to the right)
•  Continuous improvement in Nigeria 
and Côte d’Ivoire to achieve 92% 
compliance with best practice 
through British Safety Council audits
•  New health and safety management 
system developed and implemented 
across Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire
•  New focus on performance based 
audits and unannounced inspections 
•  Early EHSS plans formulated 
for new projects 
Health and Safety
We benchmark our performance against 
International Association of Oil & Gas Production 
(‘OGP’) annual safety performance averages  
to help identify Group-wide and function-specific 
safety targets for the following year.
People are our most valuable resource. We ensure that they 
remain healthy and safe in the workplace by identifying, 
assessing and mitigating risk. Our goal is simple: zero injuries 
and fatalities across all areas of our operations. 
We strive to ensure that we address important factors when  
developing systems and procedures, such as an understanding 
of cultural differences in host countries and the use of external 
contractors and representatives from our host communities 
where we operate. We aim to construct, maintain and develop 
world-class safety systems across all of our operations.
Security 
The security challenges faced by all companies 
today is truly global. In order to ensure that 
Afren provides a safe and secure workplace for 
its employees and contractors, a comprehensive 
security programme is in place to ensure that 
security measures are taken to help mitigate 
security threats.
A key component of this programme is the 
development and implementation of a 
security risk assessment to cover all aspects 
of Afren’s operations in Africa and the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq.
Afren is dedicated to ensuring that all security 
threats to our staff and contractors are treated 
with the highest level of attention and that 
everything is done to take the required steps 
to ensure a safe and secure workplace. 
How we achieved our objectives
Identifying, assessing and mitigating risks  
are the primary focus of our health and  
safety programme. In our opinion, proper 
assessment of risks at all levels of our 
operations can eliminate events that may lead 
to injury and other losses. Our management 
system and procedures consequently 
incorporate a suite of risk assessment 
techniques ranging from hands-on job safety 
analysis, to design risk assessment such as 
Hazard Identification Study (‘HAZIDS’) and 
Hazard and Operability Study (‘HAZOPS’). 
We also require that our contractors adopt 
the same principles, rigorously checking to 
ensure this is the case – both before contracts 
are signed and again once work starts. By 
developing close relationships with our key 
contractors, we have aligned health and 
safety programmes so that we share lessons 
learned and participate jointly in activities  
such as training and audits. 
Our efforts to improve health and safety 
standards have dramatically reduced the TRIR 
and LTIF 12-month rolling averages. These 
initiatives have included performing internal 
and external assessments, working closely 
with contractors to identify and manage 
hazards, enhancing performance incident 
investigations and developing strategies 
to prevent reoccurrence. As a result, our Total 
Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) decreased 
from 7.57 to 1.96 and our Lost Time Injury 
Frequency (LTIF) from 1.85 to 0.22 (well 
below the international OGP benchmark). 
Corporate Social Responsibility Continued
Our Goal
Our goal is zero injuries and 
fatalities across all areas of our 
operations and to minimise  
and/or negate operational 
health issues.

Social
Afren’s mission is to improve the lives 
of the communities in which we operate 
by implementing sustainable community 
development projects. 
Education
Country Project
Nigeria •  The University of Uyo Project: Afren acquired all the essential lab 
equipment and scientific journals for the University’s Chemical and 
Petroleum Engineering department.
•  Secondary and tertiary scholarships awarded to 255 students 
in our Effiat and Eastern Obolo communities. All applicants take 
placement tests and were selected according to qualifications 
and financial need. Not only will the scholarships enable the 
young people in the community to continue their education, 
recipients will continue to receive financial assistance for the 
duration of the programme.
•  Construction began on science labs at three schools in Eastern 
Obolo. The three science blocks will spark interest in the sciences, 
education and career goals among the students in our communities. 
Local contractors were engaged to complete the construction, 
providing local employment and creating a sense of ownership 
within the community.
Côte d’Ivoire •  Renovated two classrooms and living quarters at a school 
in Jacqueville.
•  Partnered with Save the Children for a school rehabilitation and 
sanitation initiative at five schools in Abdijan.
East Africa •  Our East Africa community affairs team forged strong relationships 
with the local chiefs and stakeholders in Kenya and Tanzania. 
Successful development initiatives included re-roofing the Shimo 
La Tewa School in Mombassa, donating 100 lockers and chairs 
to a local secondary school and providing 170 desks for the 
Kichaka Mkwaju primary school in Ukunda.
Multi Country •  Established the University of Texas – Afren Management 
Endowed Graduate Fellowship in Engineering which provides 
a full scholarship for one African student a year. The student’s 
tuition, books and living expenses will be covered, allowing them 
to devote all their concentration to obtaining a Master’s Degree 
from one of the leading Petroleum Engineering departments 
in the United States.
•  Afren welcomed 13 Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences 
interns at our Houston office over the summer to work alongside 
our engineers and geoscientists and gain valuable real-world 
experience. We provide internship opportunities to African 
students studying at US universities, students who would 
otherwise face difficulties obtaining internship opportunities 
due to visa issues.
Kurdistan •  Committed to a multi-million dollar educational assistance project 
at the American University of Iraq – Sulaimani to create a Petroleum 
Engineering department in Iraqi Kurdistan.
Health
Country Project
Nigeria •  Afren funded the inaugural phases of Faith Regen’s Mobile 
Midwives project. This will see prototypes of mobile clinics 
travelling throughout rural Southern and Northern Nigeria 
to provide access to healthcare for women and infants. 
The project is revolutionary in its commitment to meeting the 
Millennium 2015 health goals by increasing access to essential 
pre-natal and post-natal healthcare in isolated locations.
Côte d’Ivoire •  Afren donated food, cleaning products, bunk beds and clean 
mattresses to three local orphanages in Abobo, Aboisso and 
Bingerville.
East Africa •  In response to the devastating drought in East Africa, Afren made 
a humanitarian donation towards Save the Children’s East African 
Food Crisis appeal. The funds were allocated to provide life-saving 
nutrition, water and healthcare for the victims of the drought.
Corporate •  Afren is supporting 67 families in a Family Strengthening 
Programme at the SOS Children’s Village in Aboisso, Côte d’Ivoire, 
where they will be provided with access to medical care, 
educational tools, food, counselling and training in income 
generating activities.
Employment
Country Project
Nigeria •  Afren supported skills training for 19 young people in Eastern 
Obolo. This initiative was designed to increase the human 
capacity of our Nigerian host communities by focusing on 
skills in welding, fabrications, structural and pipeline welding, 
auto mechanics and electrics, computer science, office 
management and crane operations.
Corporate •  Afren sponsored the University of Texas’s Projects for 
Underserved Communities in Patriensa, Ghana for a third year. 
The PUC programme challenges graduate students to use 
their education and skills to make a positive impact on 
underdeveloped communities. Student led teams are working

Human Resources
We are totally committed to attracting, retaining and 
developing the highest calibre employees to support Afren’s 
growth strategy and to build on our significant success. 
We aim to be an attractive employer, giving our people the 
tools and skills to enable them to achieve their full potential 
and to flourish in what is a diverse and fast-moving business.
One of our key objectives in 2011 was to 
continue our impressive record of developing 
national staff and we are encouraged that our 
Intern Programme is going from strength to 
strength with the recruitment of 37 interns in 
Houston, London, Lagos and Abidjan. These 
talented graduates gained valuable technical  
and professional experience during their time 
with us working on projects in geosciences, 
reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, 
human resources, commercial, legal and  
finance areas.
Our graduate programme has been very 
successful with six graduates recruited during 
201 1 who are currently completing their training. 
Two of our graduates have now returned 
to Lagos, one of whom we feature opposite.
In 2011 we invested over US$850,000 in 
training and development programmes 
including leadership and general management, 
technical, operational, finance, EHSS and 
IT programmes. We also introduced a 
structured online soft skills programme which 
is available to all staff. We will continue 
to support and develop our existing 
employees through structured learning 
and development programmes. 
We are also sponsoring undergraduates 
through their degree programmes and 
partnering with top universities in the USA, 
UK, Nigeria and the Kurdistan region of Iraq 
to build new skills for the future.
We want our employees to feel valued and 
engaged. We know that by providing an 
excellent physical environment, upper quartile 
rewards, and challenging and interesting 
projects they will have the opportunity to 
deliver to the highest industry standards. It is 
critical for us that we motivate and retain our 
most important asset – our people. 
We are dedicated to providing a fair 
environment and do not discriminate when 
making decisions on hiring or promotion on 
the grounds of race, colour, gender, age, 
religion or disability. During 2011, we have 
again seen significant growth in our 
organisation and have recruited 86 new 
employees. This is an increase of nearly 
30% on 2010 numbers.
In addition, new acquisitions in East Africa 
and the Kurdistan region of Iraq meant 
new offices in Nairobi and Erbil to add 
to our international portfolio. We are 
extremely proud that over 97% of 
permanent employees in our overseas 
offices are local nationals. 
Our voluntary staff turnover rose to 3% 
during 2011 from 2% in 2010. This is still 
an exceptionally low percentage and 
indicates a high level of employee 
engagement and satisfaction with 
the working environment. 
Olusegun Babalola is a Nigeria-based 
geoscientist – a BSc graduate in 
Geology from the University of Ibadan 
recruited by Afren Nigeria in 2010. 
Olusegun’s role as an operational 
geologist and interpreter with the Lagos 
team is also now benefiting from new 
ideas and techniques acquired during 
placements at the Company’s London 
and Houston offices.
“Afren’s enlightened training philosophy 
has made a positive impact on both the 
business and my job as a geoscientist,” 
says Olusegun, a member of the 
America Association of Petroleum 
Geologists and the Nigerian Association 
of Petroleum.
“During my time with Afren in the UK 
and US, I expanded my network of highly 
experienced people and acquired important 
new skills too. Real time geosteering 
drilling, sub-surface interpretation, permit 
preparation and operational geology are 
just some of the valuable techniques now 
shaping my career.”

Business Ethics
We are committed to conducting business according to the 
highest ethical standards – reinforcing our efforts to uphold 
this principle in 201 1. Our policies set out standards for our 
employees’ behaviour. We require our people to comply  
with our business ethics, as we do our suppliers. 
We remain vigilant in the important area of 
corporate governance. The Code of Business 
Conduct Policy is part of our employee 
handbook which we require all new staff  
to read, confirming that they understand  
and will abide by its requirements. The whistle 
blowing policy and procedure established  
in 2009 to alert us to potential malpractices 
remains in place. An independently operated 
and confidential ethics reporting facility is 
available worldwide so employees can raise 
issues or concerns regarding business conduct 
independently of the normal management 
chain. Employees can send emails or call 
telephone numbers in countries throughout 
the world to report any concerns they may 
have about business conduct. Calls are 
handled independently by Safecall and may 
be made in total confidence. 
In 2011 Afren received a total of two reports. 
Reports are investigated by the Group 
General Counsel & Company Secretary and 
Senior Independent Director with support 
from the relevant departments as required. 
A senior management steering group meets 
quarterly to review cases, identify trends 
and manage the associated ethical and 
reputational risks. The Audit and Risk 
Committee monitors cases reported, 
the management of cases and the results 
of high risk investigations undertaken. 
As an international company with offices 
in a number of jurisdictions, it is our policy 
to comply with all governmental laws, rules and 
regulations applicable to our business. We are 
fully aware of our obligations relating to the US 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK 
Bribery Act and have taken steps to implement 
‘adequate procedures’ to prevent corrupt 
practices either within our organisation or being 
carried out by third parties on our behalf. 
In 2011 we updated our Code of Business 
Conduct to provide further guidance on 
a range of topics and to ensure compliance 
with the UK Bribery Act. During the year 
the UK Government issued the Bribery Act 
‘Adequate Procedures’ guidance. We 
developed and implemented compliance 
procedures which we cascaded through the 
organisation during 2011 via a compulsory 
training programme for all employees. 
Consisting of information sessions, we delivered 
to employees in our offices in Nigeria, 
Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, USA and England, 
reaching over 250 officers and key contractors. 
Afren expects compliance with standards 
of integrity and adherence to policies and 
internal controls throughout the organisation.

Governance
Directors’ Report
The Directors submit their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group together with the financial statements and audit report of Afren plc for the year ended 
31 December 2011. The Corporate Governance Statement on pages 64 to 72 forms part of this Directors’ Report.
Princi PAl Acti vities
The Group’s principal activities are oil and gas exploration, development and production in Africa and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. The subsidiary and 
associated undertakings principally affecting the profits or net assets of the Group in the year are listed in notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Business review
The Company is required by the Companies Act to include a business review in this report. The information that fulfils the review’s requirements is set out within 
the Chairman and Chief Executive’s Statement, the Review of Operations and the Financial Review, which are incorporated into this report by reference. These 
sections also include details of expected future developments in the Group’s business and details of the Key Performance Indicators used by management. 
Information about the use of financial instruments by the Company and its subsidiaries is given in note 20 to the financial statements.
Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are contained in note 34 to the financial statements.
Goin G con cern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Review of 
Operations. The financial position of the Group at the year end, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review 
on pages 46 to 51. In addition, note 20 of the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial 
risk management objectives and details of its financial instruments and hedging activities. Note 20 also describes its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Afren’s net production at the 2011 exit rate of approximately 50,000 boepd, together with expected production start-up in the Kurdistan region of Iraq 
in mid-2012 and the fact that exploration expenditure in 2012 will be funded via planned operational cash flows, provides confidence that the Group will 
continue to generate sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
On the basis of the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
r esu lts And d ividends
The Group’s profit for the year was US$125.4 million (2010: US$45.9 million). The Directors have not recommended the payment of a dividend (2010: US$nil).

suPPlier PAyme nt Poli cy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied by the Group, is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensure 
that suppliers are made aware of the terms of the payment, and abide by the terms of the payment. Trade creditors of the Group at 31 December 2011 were 
equivalent to 36 days’ purchases (2010: 30 days), based on the actual year end balance.
c hArit ABle And Poli tic Al do nAtio ns
During the year, the Group made charitable donations of US$1,667,000, the majority of which related to African- and Kurdistan-focused charities and 
institutions (2010: US$582,000).
No political donations were made in either 2011 or 2010.
cAP itAl st ructure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the year, are shown 
in note 28. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carries no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings 
of the Company. The ordinary shares reflect 100% of the total issued nominal value of all share capital.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 31.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital, and all issued shares are fully paid. Details of significant shareholdings are set out below.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of Directors are 
described in the Main Board Terms of Reference, copies of which are available on request, and the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 64 to 72.
In respect of the Group’s assets in Ghana, Block 10A in Kenya, the Seychelles and Ethiopia, our partners may have a right of first refusal to acquire the 
Company’s interest should a competitor directly or indirectly take control of the Company. In relation to the Ebok asset, our partner Oriental would have 
a similar right of first refusal to acquire our interest upon a direct or indirect change of control. In addition, under the terms on which the Senior Secured Notes 
of US$500 million were issued, upon a change of control, each holder of the notes has the right to require Afren to repurchase all or any part of its holding. 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as commercial contracts, bank loan 
agreements, property lease arrangements and employee share plans. None of these is considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business 
of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
introduction from the c hAirm An
We are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and consider it critical for upholding our business integrity wherever we work around 
the world. The Board has been fully briefed on the new UK Corporate Governance Code. Key areas include annual re-election of all Directors, Board diversity, 
external evaluation, greater emphasis on risk, and a clear explanation of business model and strategy. We welcome these changes and are committed to 
complying with them.
As part of our planned and continuing strengthening of the Board, I am pleased to welcome as a new Non-Executive Director to the Board, Mr Patrick 
Obath. Mr Obath has an exceptional industry track record combined with significant East African experience that will prove useful as we move into an active 
operational phase across our regional portfolio.
We have a solid and experienced leadership team, which is collectively responsible for the Company’s long-term success and has a clear understanding of its 
roles and responsibilities. We promote an honest and open environment in which both Executive and Non-Executive Directors can constructively contribute 
to the Company’s development. 
I am satisfied that the members of the Board, in particular the Non-Executive Directors, have sufficient time to undertake their roles at Board and Committee 
level with the Company, so as to be able to discharge their responsibilities effectively. At our Annual General Meeting in June 2012, we will put all of our 
Directors up for re-election in compliance with the Code and anticipate continuing to put all Directors up for re-election annually.
Our ‘good governance’ culture is robust and is fully focused on maintaining high ethical standards and strong personal integrity. This is formalised in our Group 
Code of Business Conduct, which has been adopted across the business and clearly sets out expectations of how our employees should behave. We have 
reviewed and updated the Code in the light of the Bribery Act 2010 and have also rolled out an Anti-Bribery Policy across the Group.
This section of the Afren annual report describes how the Company has applied the main principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) throughout the year and, where specific provisions may not appear to have been met, provides an explanation.
Further information on the Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk.
I hope this report gives you a clear understanding of how we comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code and our governance arrangements.
egbert imomoh 
Chairman
c om Pli Ance with the uK c or Por Ate G overn Ance c ode
This statement explains how the Directors applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code during the year ended 31 December 2011. 
The Directors consider that the Company complied in full with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code for the whole of the 
year ended 31 December 2011.
BoArd c om Posi tion And i nde Pend ence 
The Board currently has nine members made up of three Executive Directors, five independent Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman. 
Nine Directors served on the Board in the 2011 financial year. Constantine Ogunbiyi stepped down as Executive Director on 4 January 2011, following his 
appointment as Chief Executive of First Hydrocarbon Nigeria (FHN). Mr Obath joined the Board on 2 February 2012 as a Non-Executive Director.
The Board considers that there is an appropriate balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors for governing the business effectively and promoting 
shareholder interests. It also considers that both Executive and Non-Executive Directors have the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to enable them 
to govern the business effectively. 
Our Non-Executive Directors contribute international operational know-how and were chosen for their wide range of skills and experience. They understand the 
sectors in which we operate and have valuable knowledge of international capital markets. In addition, they bring in-depth understanding of the health, safety, 
environmental, political and community challenges we face. 
Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for a three-year fixed term, renewable by mutual agreement. All Non-Executive Directors’ appointment letters are 
available for inspection at the registered address of the Company. 
The Non-Executive Directors: 
•  scrutinise, measure and review the performance of management 
•  assist in strategy development
•  review the Group’s financial information 
•  ensure appropriate and effective systems of internal control and risk management
•  review the relationship with the external Auditors through the Audit & Risk Committee 
•  review the remuneration of and succession planning for the Board.

BoArd structure
The Board is responsible for providing leadership, setting the Group’s strategic objectives and key policies, ensuring that appropriate resources are in place 
to enable the Group to meet its objectives, reviewing the Group’s performance and overseeing the Group’s internal control systems and is responsible to 
shareholders for the proper management of the Group. At the end of the period of this report, the Board comprised of a Non-Executive Chairman, three 
Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. 
Afren benefits from an experienced Board with extensive African experience and relationships plus a broad range of commercial, financial and other relevant 
expertise. Brief biographies are included on pages 58 and 59.
The Nomination Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board including the balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and 
considers succession planning for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the Group’s senior management. It is also responsible for the process for new 
Board appointments and makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new Directors and is responsible for ensuring that appointments are 
made on merit and against objective criteria. 
In making appointments to the Board, the Nomination Committee considers the skills, experience and knowledge of the existing Directors and assesses which 
of the potential candidates would bring the most benefit to the Board. It considers the potential candidate’s knowledge and experience of the territories in 
which we operate, the oil and gas industry, capital markets and the regulatory environment, and that, in the case of Non-Executive Director appointments they 
have sufficient time to devote to the role. The Chairman ensures that any new Directors are provided with a full induction on joining the Board. Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, which may be extended by mutual agreement subject to satisfactory performance. The letters of 
appointment of each Non-Executive Director are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company.
The Board meets on at least five occasions during the year to review trading performance, budgets and funding, set and monitor strategy, examine acquisition 
opportunities and report to shareholders. The Chief Executive holds informal meetings with the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors to discuss issues 
affecting the Group, such as target objectives, strategy, key performance indicators and remuneration matters.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decisions and responsibility for developing and implementing the Group’s strategic 
and financial objectives is delegated to the senior management of the Group. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and the responsibilities 
of Chairman and Chief Executive are independently defined. It is the Chairman’s responsibility to ensure that the principles and processes of the Board are 
maintained, including the provision of accurate, timely and clear information in relation to the Group and its business.
The Chairman is also responsible for encouraging debate and constructive criticism, speaking and acting for the Board and representing the Board to 
shareholders, and presenting shareholders’ views to the Board. 
The Board considers that none of the Chairman’s other commitments interfere with the discharge of his responsibilities to the Company. It is also satisfied 
that he makes sufficient time available to serve the Group effectively. The Group does not have a Deputy Chairman, but has identified Mr Bingham to act 
as Chairman should the need arise at short notice. 66 Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
inde Pendence
The independence of each of the Non-Executive Directors is considered upon appointment, annually and at any other time a Director’s circumstances change 
in a way that warrants reconsideration. Following a review of Board composition, the Company has reassessed the independence of all its Non-Executive 
Directors. It regards all as ‘independent’ within the meaning of the term as defined in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board has a policy that it uses to determine the independence of its Directors. This policy provides that the test of independence is whether the Director is 
independent of management and any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of objective and unfettered or independent 
judgement by the Director or the Director’s ability to act in the best interests of the shareholders.
Where a Director is considered by the Board to be independent, but is affected by circumstances that may give rise to a perception that the Director is not 
independent, the Board has undertaken to explain the reasons why it has reached its conclusion. The Board considers relationships with management, major 
shareholders, associated companies and other parties with whom the Group transacts business against predetermined materiality thresholds, all of which are 
set out in the policy.
Tested against this policy, the Board considers that each of the Directors has retained independence of character and judgement and has not formed 
associations with management or others that might compromise their ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests of the Company.
The Board gave particular consideration to the independence of Mr Peter Bingham and Mr John St. John. This is because, historically, Non-Executive Directors 
were eligible for share option awards prior to the Company’s admission to the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority in December 2009. 
Mr Bingham and Mr St. John are the only independent Non-Executive Directors who still have unexercised options. The Share Option Scheme Rules were 
amended in November 2009 to prohibit the award of share options to Non-Executive Directors. Since Afren’s admission to the Official List, no share options 
have been granted to any Non-Executive Director. We take the view that this does not impact the independence of the Non-Executive Directors. For more 
information see the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Some of the Directors hold, or previously held, positions in companies with which we have commercial relationships. The Board has assessed all of the 
relationships between the Company and companies in which the Directors hold or held positions. It has concluded that, in all cases, the relationships do not 
interfere with the Director’s exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement or their ability to act in the best interests of our business.
In the case of Mr St. John, the Board has considered the fact that he is a shareholder in St. John Advisors Ltd and a partner in STJ Advisors LLP, two companies 
in the financial advisory sector with which Afren has had commercial dealings. It is Mr St. John’s breadth of expertise, experience, knowledge and connections 
gained while providing capital markets advice to companies that brings significant value to the Board. Prior to Mr St. John’s appointment, the Board assessed 
the relationships between Afren and St. John Advisors Ltd and STJ Advisers LLP. It remains satisfied that Mr St. John is able to apply objective, unfettered and 
independent judgement and act in the best interests of the Company, notwithstanding his role with St. John Advisors Ltd and STJ Advisers LLP. 
In addition, any commercial dealings with St. John Advisors and STJ Advisers have been approved by the independent Non-Executive Directors, as they will be 
should they continue in the future. Mr St. John and the Executive Directors absent themselves fully from these deliberations.
Transactions during the year that amounted to related party transactions under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are outlined in note 35 
to the financial statements. The Company does not consider the level of fees paid to St. John Advisors Ltd and STJ Advisers LLP to be material to either business. 
All transactions with Directors, including Mr St. John, qualify under the exemption for smaller related party transactions in respect of the Related Party Rules 
of the UKLA Listing Authority.

Mr Toby Hayward is the Senior Independent Director. Mr Hayward was selected for the role because of his experience and expertise. In his role as Senior 
Independent Director, Mr Hayward is available to assist in resolving shareholder concerns should alternative channels be exhausted or inappropriate. 
BoArd c omm ittees
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities and duties to a number of key Committees – in particular the Audit & Risk, Remuneration and Nomination, 
each of which has defined terms of reference that are summarised below and available in full on the Company website. The Board is kept fully informed of the 
work of these Committees. A summary of the operations of these Committees is also set out below. 
Each Committee and Director has the authority to seek independent professional advice where necessary, at Afren’s expense, to discharge their respective 
duties. In addition, each Director and Committee has access to the advice of the Company Secretaries, Ms Shirin Johri and Mr Elekwachi Ukwu.
The Directors have collective responsibility for the conduct of the Group’s business and are expected, wherever possible, to attend all Board meetings, relevant 
Committee meetings and the Annual General Meeting (AGM). A table detailing the Directors’ attendance at each of the Company’s scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings during 2011 is included below.

1 Appointed on 2 February 2012.
2 Stepped down on 4 January 2011.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Board’s scheduled activities included:
•  receiving reports from key businesses within the Group
•  receiving regular reports on the financial position of the Group and the various businesses within it
•  approving the budget and long-term plan
•  approving preliminary and full-year results
•  discussing and approving strategy
•  considering opportunities for business development
•  discussing risk management and controls, including a detailed review of the Risk Register
•  receiving reports from the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee and Nomination Committee
•  receiving reports on governance issues affecting the Group
•  conducting a review of Board effectiveness.
Board performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous review of its performance and that of its Committees each financial year. In the year under review the evaluation 
was led by an independent external consultant, Tom Bonham Carter of Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP. The evaluation process involved comprehensive 
interviews with each Director and the Company Secretary. The evaluation covered the Board, the Committees and each Director.
Feedback from the evaluation process was provided to the Board in the form of a presentation and a written report to the Board. The review identified that the 
Board had a number of strengths which was exemplified in the record of the Company in acquiring and developing assets and its balance sheet management. 
The review also suggested areas for further development covering the development of strategy, Board composition and succession planning, monitoring 
operations, and stakeholder management.
The Board has addressed these issues since the review and will continue to do so going forward.
training and development
All new Directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored to their experience, background and particular areas of focus, which is designed to 
develop their knowledge and understanding of the Group. The Chairman agrees the personalised induction plan for each new Director and ensures that it 
is appropriately tailored. In the last year the Board received training focusing on recent corporate governance developments. The Board intends to hold one 
meeting overseas each year, to facilitate the Directors’ understanding of the Group’s international operations. 
future Board changes
At the time of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting Mr John St. John will step down from the Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees, Mr Patrick 
Obath will join the Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees, and Mr Toby Hayward will be appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
In May 2011 the Financial Reporting Council began consulting on possible amendments to the Code that would require companies to publish their policy 
on boardroom diversity and report against it annually, as recommended by Lord Davies in his ‘Women on Boards’ report published in February 2011, and to 
consider the board’s diversity amongst other factors, when assessing its effectiveness. The Nomination Committee is considering, as part of its general review 
of the Board, requirements of diversity, specifically gender. 68 Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Audit And r isK c omm ittee
The Audit and Risk Committee comprises Mr Peter Bingham (Chairman), Mr John St. John, Mr Ennio Sganzerla and Mr Toby Hayward. The Board has 
determined that Mr Hayward (a chartered accountant) and Mr St. John (who has extensive experience in financial markets) have recent and relevant financial 
experience through their previous and current roles. The other Committee members also have a range of financial, commercial and other relevant experience. 
Mr St. John will step down as a member of the Committee after the AGM and will be replaced by Mr Patrick Obath.
The Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and other senior executives attend meetings of the Committee by invitation. 
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) is also invited to attend meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Committee also meets privately with Deloitte representatives at 
least once a year (and as and when required) to discuss any matters the auditors may wish to raise without Executive Directors being present. During the year 
the Committee met on three occasions, at each of which there was full attendance.
The Committee’s remit includes reviewing the internal control framework, internal audit process, financial reporting practices and external audit process, 
and recommending to the Board whether to reappoint the external auditor. It also ensures that the Board regularly assesses business risks, and risk 
management and mitigation strategies. In doing so, the Committee places reliance on reports from executive management, external audit and internal 
audit reviews. 
In monitoring the financial reporting practices, the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the accounting policies, areas of judgement, going concern assumption 
and compliance with accounting standards, the Disclosure and Transparency rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code. During the year the Committee 
reviewed, prior to publication, the half-year and annual financial statements and other major statements affecting the Group that concerned price sensitive 
information. The Group maintains a Risk Register. The Register contains the key risks faced by the Group, including their likelihood and impact, as well as the 
controls and procedures implemented to mitigate these risks. The content of the Register is determined through regular discussions with senior management 
and is reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee. These key risks are summarised on pages 22 to 25 of the Business Review section of this Annual Report.
The Audit and Risk Committee has a policy for assessing whether to employ the external auditors to supply services other than audit services, and closely 
monitors the level of audit and non-audit services the external auditors provide to the Group. Non-audit services are normally limited to assignments that 
are closely related to the annual audit, or where the work is of a nature that a detailed understanding of the Group is necessary. 
The external auditors are specifically excluded from providing internal audit services, litigation support, remuneration advice and legal advice services. 
The Committee assesses every other piece of non-audit work separately, and places it depending on which professional services firm it considers best suited. 
In addition, any non-audit work with a total fee greater than 25% of the annual audit fee must be approved by the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 
prior to the appointment being made. 
The Board is satisfied that this policy is conducive to the maintenance of auditor independence and objectivity. During the year external auditors performed 
a significant amount of non-audit related work in relation to the acquisition of the Group’s interests in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, as well as Tax advisory 
services, work that would ordinarily be performed by external auditors for companies involved in such projects. The Audit and Risk Committee is satisfied that 
the carrying out of this work has not impaired the independence of the external auditors. A breakdown of the fees paid to the external auditors in respect 
of audit and non-audit work is included in note 7 to the financial statements.
The Audit and Risk Committee has recommended to the Board that the current auditors, Deloitte LLP, be reappointed as external auditor. In making the 
recommendation, it has taken into consideration the independence matters noted above and the past service of the auditors who were first appointed in 2005 
following a full tender process. The Committee has also considered the likelihood of a withdrawal of the auditor from the market and noted that there are 
no contractual obligations to restrict the choice of external auditor.

The Remuneration Committee currently comprises Mr John St. John (Chairman), Mr Ennio Sganzerla and Mr Peter Bingham. It is responsible for:
•  making recommendations to the Board on Afren’s overall framework for remuneration and its cost, and, in consultation with the Chairman and 
Chief Executive determining remuneration packages of each Executive Director;
•  reviewing the scale and structure of Executive Directors’ remuneration and the terms of their service or employment contracts, including share-based 
schemes, other employee incentive schemes adopted by Afren from time to time, and pension contributions. Executive Directors of the Company are 
not permitted to participate in discussions or decisions of the Committee regarding their own remuneration; and
•  ensuring that payments made on termination are fair to the individual and Afren. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined 
by the Chairman and the other Executive Directors outside the framework of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee has taken into account the feedback received at the last AGM in relation to the Directors’ Remuneration Report and has 
consulted with shareholders in recent months to ensure full communication of Afren’s approach to Directors, remuneration going forward. Details of the 
Directors’ remuneration and the work of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 73 to 81.
internal controls
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the date of approval 
of this report. This is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control published in October 2005 (the Turnbull Guidance).
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for the ongoing review of its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control. 
The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. It is based principally on reviewing 
reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses 
are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. 
As well as regular ongoing reviews of the Group’s system of internal control, the Board also performed a specific assessment for this annual report. 
It considered all significant aspects of internal control arising during the period covered by the report, including relevant internal audit work undertaken. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
The function of the Group’s Director of Business Process is to carry out internal audit and compliance monitoring work, supported by independent specialist 
consultants as required.
The reporting line is to the Group Finance Director, however reports of work undertaken are also provided to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and any 
requests from the Audit Committee of specific review areas are included in the work programme, and the Chairman of the Audit Committee has direct access 
to the Group’s Director of Business Process. The Board and the Audit Committee have considered the need for a formal internal audit department but consider 
the current structure to be most suitable for the present. The Audit Committee will review this annually and it is the intention of the Company to establish 
an internal audit function within the next 12 months.
c ontrol framework and activities
The Board has established a management structure with defined lines of responsibility and clear delegation of authority. The various committees are key 
elements of the overall control structure. These include the Executive Committee, which meets at least bi-monthly and is responsible for all strategic and 
operational activities day to day.
The Group has developed a formal structured business planning process, which operates on an annual cycle. The Board approves the consolidated annual 
budget, and performance against budget is monitored and reported to the Board.
The Group’s risk assessment process is described on pages 20 to 21. The Audit and Risk Committee and senior executives of the Company regularly review 
significant risks, their potential impact on the Group’s financial position, and actions taken to manage those risks during the year.

uK Bribery Act 2010
The UK Bribery Act 2010 received royal assent on 8 April 2010. In 2011 the UK Government issued the Bribery Act ‘Adequate Procedures’ guidance. 
We developed an Anti-Bribery Policy and implemented compliance procedures which have been cascaded through the organisation during the course of 2011 
via a compulsory training programme for all employees. This training, consisting of information sessions, was delivered to employees in our offices in Nigeria, 
Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, USA and England, and has reached over 250 officers and key contractors. Afren expects compliance with high standards of integrity 
and adherence to policies and internal controls throughout the organisation.
Assessment
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified, nor been advised of, any failings or weaknesses which it has 
determined to be significant.
The Board remains satisfied with the arrangements by which staff can raise concerns in confidence about possible improprieties in relation to financial reporting 
or other matters, as well as via an external reporting line.
r el Atio nshi Ps wi th sh Areh olders
The Board represents the shareholders and is accountable to them for creating and delivering value through effective governance of the business. It is fully 
committed to maintaining regular shareholder communication for which it has developed a strategy for engaging and communicating with shareholders, 
key aspects of which are outlined below.
In addition to frequent dialogue with major institutional shareholders, meetings are regularly held following significant announcements. Press releases were 
issued throughout the year and the Company maintains a website (www.afren.com) where all press releases are posted, together with major corporate 
presentations and Reports and Accounts. 
Additionally, this Annual Report, which is sent to all registered shareholders, contains extensive information about the Group’s activities. The Board welcomes 
enquiries from individual shareholders, both on matters relating to their shareholdings and the business of the Group. It also encourages shareholders to attend 
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to discuss the Group’s progress, make their views known and to raise any matters of concern directly. Through regular 
meetings, the CEO, CFO and Investor Relations Team maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders on strategy, performance, plans and objectives. 
The Company reports formally to shareholders twice a year with its half-year and full-year results. The CEO and CFO give presentations on the full-year results 
to institutional investors, analysts and the media.
With offices in London, the Group’s Investor Relations department acts as a focal point for contact with investors throughout the year. The Chairman meets 
regularly with institutional investors to hear their views and discuss issues of mutual importance and communicates the views of investors to the Board as 
a whole. The senior independent Director is also available to meet shareholders at their request. All Non-Executive Directors are available to meet with major 
shareholders if requested.
c onf licts of interest
The Company amended its Articles of Association in June 2008 to deal with, along with other issues, the provisions on conflicts of interest in the Companies 
Act 2006 which came into force in October 2008. Following this the Company established procedures for the disclosure and review of any conflicts of interest, 
actual or potential, which the Directors may have and for the authorisation of such conflict matters by the Board. 
In deciding whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict, the Directors must have regard to their general duties under the Companies Act 2006. 
The procedure operates to ensure the disclosure of conflicts, and for the consideration and, if appropriate, their authorisation by non-conflicted Directors. 
The Board may review the authorisation of a conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation, at any time. The Nomination Committee supports the Board 
in this process, both by reviewing requests from Directors for authorisations of situations of actual or potential conflict and making recommendations 
to the Board. It can also review any situations of actual or potential conflict that the Board has previously authorised, and make recommendations 
as to whether the authorisation remains appropriate. 72 Afren plc

At Afren, we uphold the highest ethical standards for the conduct of our business activities. We operate with integrity and honesty both throughout the 
organisation and with all our external stakeholders that include governments, business partners, shareholders, contractors and local communities. 
In March 2009 the Board approved a Code of Business Conduct to formalise Afren’s commitment to high ethical standards and to reinforce prompt and 
consistent action in maintaining these standards. The Code of Business Conduct was updated in 2011 to provide further guidance on a range of topics and 
to ensure compliance with the UK Bribery Act. The Code sets out the standards of business ethics to which we expect all employees, including Directors, 
to adhere regardless of their position or location. Consultants, contractors and business partners are also expected to act in accordance with the Code, 
which is available on our website at www.afren.com. 
The Group operates a whistle-blowing policy which is reviewed annually. In addition to Afren’s existing policies and procedures, an independent, external 
reporting line allows employees in any country to report concerns regarding fraud or other unethical practices in confidence. The service is provided by Safecall

introduction
On the following pages we set out the Remuneration Report for 2011. The report comprises the following five sections:
•  Introduction and background
•  Remuneration Committee overview
•  Remuneration policy and philosophy
•  Components of remuneration
•  Non-Executive Directors; and
•  Detailed audited information.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report also meets the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to the Directors’ 
remuneration in the Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company at which the financial statements will be put to shareholders for approval.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion 
those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The Report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information.

introduction And BAc KGrou nd
Following the 2011 Annual General Meeting, the Company actively engaged with shareholders and the Voting Advisory Agencies to better understand the 
concerns on the 2010 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The following concerns were highlighted in the 2010 Directors’ Remuneration Report and the following actions have been taken:
Concern Action
Option Award to Finance Director It is now Company Policy that the 2005 Share Option Scheme, which was established when the 
Company was listed on AIM, is used solely as a recruitment tool and to reward significant promotions, 
including to Executive Director.
Overall Company dilution limit at 12% A significant proportion of options and warrants were issued historically to incentivise Directors and 
Contractors who are no longer with the Company. Whilst the Company’s goal is to reduce the dilution 
limit over time to 10%, in fact the awards held by the Company’s Directors in relation to Afren’s equity 
schemes account for only 3% of total shares in issue.
Significant increase in CEO and COO base salaries Following the move from AIM to the Main Board in 2008, we benchmarked base salaries to the 
relevant Main Board and Industry peer groups with reference to a number of third-party remuneration 
surveys. Base salaries for 2012 have been frozen at 2011 levels.
Greater disclosure required on Annual Bonus We have in the 2011 Directors, Remuneration Report highlighted and reported on the Key 
Performance Indicators which are used in determining the Annual Bonus.
Performance Share Plan should include an additional 
performance metric to TSR
We have included an additional non-TSR related performance metric to determine the level of payout.
Independence of Remuneration Committee Chairman John St. John will step down from the Remuneration Committee in favour of the Senior Non-Executive 
Director, Toby Hayward. In addition, Patrick Obath will join the Remuneration and Audit Committees.
During these meetings, we also took the opportunity to provide greater context to Afren’s remuneration philosophy. Since the Company was listed on AIM 
in 2005, it has grown over a relatively short period of time into one of the leading Main Board listed upstream oil and gas companies. At 31 December 2011, 
the Company employed 272 employees, operating in 12 countries and across a portfolio of 29 licences and assets. This represents exceptional growth over a 
very short period of time, utilising highly specialised skill set. This growth has been accompanied by a significant increase in our 2P and 2C reserves base to 995 
mmboe from a standing start. These achievements have resulted in the market capitalisation of the Company increasing from US$13 million at IPO to US$2,100 
million by March 2012. This growth has only been possible through the recruitment of specialised and exceptional operational, technical and financial human 
talent. The scarcity of such human talent is compounded by the fact that we operate in some of the most insecure and politically unstable oil and gas provinces 
in the world. The Company continues to aggressively recruit across its operations, in particular in Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Kenya, 
Madagascar, Tanzania, in addition to continuing to grow its management and technical offices in London and Houston.
The competition for such human talent continues to intensify given the significant focus on Africa and the Middle East by the Majors, African National Oil Companies, 
Asian National Oil Companies, private equity groups and US independent oil companies. Our relative ‘peer group’ for compensation purposes is therefore 
increasingly evolving and the peer group are in the main not quoted on the London Stock Exchange. In order to sustain this growth trajectory, it is therefore 
essential that we offer packages which include the potential for competitive incentive payments. Our policy is to position the salaries of senior executives at 
competitive levels using a range of third-party benchmarks. Given the Company’s growth, and following the move from AIM to the Main Board, salaries were 
identified as being significantly behind the target position and so we have been progressively reducing the gap. Base salaries have, however, been frozen in 2012. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 74 Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ Remuneration Report
continued
We recognise that these are sensitive issues, but we have acted in a manner which we believe is in the long-term interests of the Company and importantly 
its shareholders. With this in mind, the Remuneration Committee and Board of Directors firmly believe in the linkage of the remuneration of Executive Directors 
with the needs of shareholders through a policy which recognises and rewards long-term shareholder value added and sets an appropriate balance between 
fixed and performance-related incentives. 
As set out in the preceding sections of this Annual Report, Afren’s corporate objectives are designed to continue to drive long-term growth and deliver 
sustained value for shareholders. The Company’s remuneration policy is strongly linked to performance against corporate objectives using a scorecard of Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs). It is therefore important that the Company’s remuneration policy is one that can incentivise, motivate and retain key employees, 
as well as attracting new personnel of a calibre able to sustain the Company’s growth rate for both existing and new projects and countries. 
Details of Afren’s remuneration policy are set out below. The following key elements of Afren’s approach to Directors’ remuneration during 2011 and looking 
forward to 2012 are:
•  Base annual salaries have been frozen for 2012;
•  Annual bonus awards take account of both business and individual performance;
•  Participation in the Group’s Performance Share Plan. No Director was granted share options under the 2005 Share Option Scheme in 2011. Going forward, 
it is not intended to award share options under the Share Option Scheme except in exceptional circumstances and only then to recruit or retain senior staff; 
furthermore, if share options are awarded in the future they will be subject to performance criteria; and
•  Payment of the ‘First Oil Reward’ to all staff, including Directors, involved in the Ebok project. The First Oil Reward was put in place at the time of Field 
Development Plan submission by Afren and its partner Oriental, to reward exceptional performance and a successful fast track appraisal and development 
of the Ebok project. The costs of the First Oil Reward have been funded by the Ebok project. Following the successful appraisal drilling in December 2009, 
after which Afren quadrupled gross 2P reserves to 105.6 mmboe, the Company fast-tracked the development with First Oil achieved in record time in March 
2011 (less than two and a half years). Comparable development lead times for offshore Nigeria are shown in the table below:

This value creation from achieving First Oil at Ebok has occurred over the full cycle of appraisal, resulting in a significant increase in reserves, through 
development, production and ultimately cash flow generation. The First Oil Reward recognises the efforts and successes of all staff involved since appraisal 
and development began in 2008, and was an integral part of our remuneration strategy for the year.  Afren plc 75

The members of the Remuneration Committee are Mr John St. John (Chairman), Mr Peter Bingham and Mr Ennio Sganzerla. At the time of the Company’s 
next Annual General Meeting, Mr John St. John will step down from the Remuneration Committee and he will be replaced as Chairman by Mr Toby Hayward. 
In addition, Mr Patrick Obath will join the Remuneration Committee. All, including Mr Hayward and Mr Obath, are Non-Executive Directors.
r ole and responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which are available in the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s 
website. These include:
•  setting and managing a remuneration strategy which will attract, motivate and retain a top quality executive team ensuring outstanding levels 
of achievement;
•  determining the terms of employment and remuneration for the Chief Executive, Executive Directors and the Executive Team and ensuring that they reflect 
their individual performance and achievement of Company objectives;
•  setting and maintaining performance parameters which incorporate mechanisms to encourage consistent and sustainable levels of Company performance 
including growth, shareholder value, risk management and profitability; and
•  approval of the design and targets of share incentive plans requiring shareholder approval.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing that the Chairman’s permission is sought and fees in excess of £10,000 
from all such appointments are accounted for to the Company, except where specific approval is gained from the Board.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year for which each member was present. Although not a member of the Committee, Dr Osman 
Shahenshah was invited to attend one of the Committee meetings during the year but he was not involved in discussions relating to his own remuneration. 
In addition to the scheduled Remuneration Committee meetings, the members of the Remuneration Committee have worked extensively with the 
management of the Company during the year to meet with shareholders and with voting advisory bodies to address the areas of concern raised by the 
shareholders at the Company’s last AGM.
Advi sers
The Committee obtains advice from various sources in order to ensure it makes informed decisions. The Committee’s main advisers are MM&K Limited. 
MM&K provided services to Afren exclusively in connection with Directors’ and executives’ remuneration, save that Higher Talent Limited, a subsidiary 
of MM&K, has assisted the Company to recruit HR and reward professionals. 
rem uner Atio n Poli cy And Phil oso Phy
Afren’s philosophy is that remuneration should be fully aligned with the long-term strategic objectives of the business, its risk appetite and its values. As set out 
in the preceding sections of this Annual Report, Afren’s strategic corporate objectives are long-term growth and increased shareholder value, whilst recognising 
the interests of all relevant stakeholders. The policy clearly links equity, bonus and salary awards to individual and Company performance.
Afren’s remuneration policy has been designed to attract, retain and motivate key executive talent to produce exceptional performance and add long-
term value in a competitive, risky and sometimes hostile environment. Accordingly, Executive Directors’ annual salaries are benchmarked against a number 
of executive salary surveys for FTSE 250 and oil and gas companies, annual bonuses are determined using a scorecard of both corporate and personal KPIs 
as a guideline, whilst long-term equity incentives are linked directly to shareholder value. 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee believes it is an essential element of Afren’s remuneration strategy to make rewards to recognise exceptional 
performance which directly and materially affects the value of the Company. The First Oil Reward paid to those Directors and employees responsible for the 
successful development of the Ebok project, achieved through strong operational efficiency and financial discipline and which accelerates Afren’s progress 
towards its core corporate objectives, is an example of this.
The Company’s policy is that performance-related remuneration should represent a significant majority of an Executive Directors’ total package. In 2011, 
the amount of annual bonus paid when added to the value of vested PSP awards represented approximately 72% of the total remuneration realised by the 
Chief Executive. For other Executive Directors, on average, performance-related reward represented about 69% of their total realised remuneration. The pay 
and employment conditions of other employees in the Group were taken into account when determining Directors’ remuneration for 2011. 76 Afren plc

BAse sAl Ary
Afren’s move from AIM to the FTSE 250 resulted in a step change in base salaries to align these with a more relevant peer group, which was implemented 
in 2010 for 2011. After taking account of shareholder feedback and the prevailing economic conditions, the Remuneration Committee has decided to freeze 
2012 salaries at the 2011 levels. The Company uses the Deloitte Executive Survey and Deloitte Beyond the Board Survey as well as the Mercer UK Oil and 
Gas Exploration and Production Survey in order to benchmark appropriate remuneration levels. 
Annu Al Bonu s sch eme
The Annual Bonus Scheme recognises both the Company’s and individual performance. The relative Company weighting is set at 80% for Directors and 
is based on the Company’s Key Performance Indicators, namely:
•  Reserves and resources growth
•  Inorganic reserves growth
•  Production growth
•  Improvement in operational efficiency
•  Maintenance of exceptional EHSS performance
In 2011, the Company recorded exceptional performance against the Key Performance Indicators:
KPI Performance
Reserves and resources growth Growth in 2P reserves of 132% to 185 mmboe and growth of 2C resources 
of 1,349% to 810 mmboe
Inorganic growth Acquisition of interests in the Kurdistan region of Iraq at a cost of US$0.68 per bbl; 
completion, through FHN, of a 45% interest in Block OML 26
Production growth Exceeded group exit production target of 50,000 barrels of oil per day
Improvement in operational efficiency Normalised operating cost per barrel of US$17.9/boe compared to US$18.1/boe 
in 2010
Maintenance of exceptional EHSS performance Strong improvement in both Lost Time Incident Frequency (0.22 compared to 
2.41 in 2010) and Total Recordable Incident Rate (1.96 compared to 9.33 in 2010) Afren plc 77
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Governance
2011 was therefore an exceptional year for Afren, measured against its Key Performance Indicators. The achievement of First Oil from Ebok, together with the 
successful drilling of two infill wells at Okoro, has meant the Company has achieved its exit working interest target of 50,000 boepd. Progress has been made 
on all of our East African Exploration assets in terms of seismic data acquired and our readiness to drill in 2012. Significant reserves growth has been achieved 
both with the acquisition of our interests in Barda Rash and, through FHN, OML 26, as well as organic growth through the development of our existing assets. 
These successes have been achieved against a background of high standards of EHSS performance and the application of financial discipline which leaves 
the Company well positioned to capitalise on further growth opportunities going forward. Further details on the results for each of the above KPIs for 2011 
are shown on pages 16 and 17. The respective weighting of each of the KPIs used in determining the level of bonus paid is rebased each year to reflect the 
evolution of Afren’s corporate objectives.
In light of the above, the Remuneration Committee determined that the overall achievement for the year had exceeded the targets set such that the maximum 
bonus of 100% of salary was awarded. 
eXce Pti on Al Bonu s AwArds
The Remuneration Committee may make an award to Directors and staff in respect of exceptional achievements over the medium- to long-term and to reward 
the efforts of those staff and Directors involved, and in doing so generated significant shareholder value. 
At the start of the Ebok project it was agreed by Afren and its partner, Oriental, that a First Oil Reward scheme would be put in place to reward the Afren 
team as Technical Service Provider, subject to exceptional performance criteria being met. In 2011, the Remuneration Committee resolved to make a First Oil 
Reward in respect of the exceptional technical performance of the Directors and staff, which resulted in a significant increase in shareholder value through 
increased reserves from development and through the resulting cash flows from production. This was transformational for Afren, and was a catalyst enabling 
the subsequent acquisition of two PSC’s in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and other fundraising to take place. The First Oil Reward recognises the performance 
of all Directors and staff involved in the project since development began in 2008.
The Remuneration Committee considered all the circumstances and on the basis of this exceptional performance decided to reward the staff and Directors 
involved in this project a First Oil Reward of US$7 million, of which US$3 million is rewarded to the Directors, and paid in cash. Because this Reward was funded 
through the project, the net cost to Afren is significantly reduced. Details of payments to individual Directors can be found in the table on page 79. 
Benefits in Kind 
The Executive Directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally private medical insurance, club membership and critical illness cover.
Pension contribution
UK-based Executive Directors are members of the Company pension scheme, and are subject to the same scheme rules as all other staff. The scheme 
is a defined contribution scheme and the Company contributes 10% of salary subject to the participant contributing at least 5% of their salary. The US-based 
Executive Director, Shahid Ullah, receives a Company contribution equal to 10% of his salary and bonus subject to the participant contributing at least 5% 
of his salary and bonus and subject to statutory limits on contributions.
Afre n equ ity sch emes
The Remuneration Committee believes that the ability of employees to acquire a meaningful equity stake in the Company is an essential element of Afren’s 
overall remuneration policy. 
To that end, in 2005 the Company adopted a share option scheme and in 2008 a Performance Share Plan (PSP) in connection with which options and 
performance share awards have been granted to a wide range of employees, including Executive Directors. 
t he 2005 share o ption scheme
The Share Option scheme was adopted before the Company’s shares were admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange plc. It is now the 
Remuneration Committee’s current policy to grant options under this scheme only in exceptional circumstances for recruitment purposes and for rewarding 
significant promotions, including to Executive Director. 
t he 2008 Performance share Plan
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) was introduced in 2008 before the Company’s shares were admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange plc. 
Under the PSP, eligible employees, including Directors, who have been selected to participate, receive an award of shares in the Company. Share awards may 
be made annually and the maximum value of an award for any Director may not exceed 200% of base annual salary, except that the Remuneration Committee 
may decide to increase this limit to 300% in exceptional circumstances. The awards are subject to achieving or exceeding the performance criteria set out for 
the individuals.
Ordinarily, an award, normally in the form of a conditional share award or a nominal cost share option, vests three years after the award date subject to the 
Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the TSR of a selected peer group of companies. An award may vest in full only if Afren’s 
position in the peer group is at or above the 75th percentile. 30% of an award vests for median performance and nothing vests if Afren’s TSR is below the 
median. There is pro rata vesting for performance between the median and upper quartile. 78 Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ Remuneration Report
continued
For future awards under the PSP, the Remuneration Committee has included an additional metric to accompany TSR in measuring performance.
The current peer group is as follows: 
Borders & Southern Petroleum Hardy Oil & Gas Salamander Energy 
Bowleven Heritage Oil Plc Serica Energy 
Cairn Energy Ithaca Energy SOCO International 
Desire Petroleum JKX Oil & Gas Sterling Energy 
EnQuest Melrose Resources Tullow Oil
Falkland Oil and Gas Petroceltic International Valiant Petroleum 
Gulf Keystone Petroleum Premier Oil
Gulfsands Petroleum Rockhopper Exploration 
The Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor the relevance of the current peer group, taking account of the following factors:
•  The industry within which the Company operates, specifically taking into account the international nature of the Company’s business;
•  The UK listing environment the Company is now part of; and
•  The market capitalisation, turnover and number of countries in which the Company operates.
The Remuneration Committee will take into account the Company’s underlying financial performance as well as relative TSR performance in determining 
the extent to which PSP awards should vest.
Details of PSP share awards granted to Directors to date are included on page 81.
employee Benefit trust
An Employee Benefit Trust was established in 2011 following approval by shareholders but has not been utilised to date and currently holds no shares 
in the Company.
dir ectors ’ con tr Acts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts of an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year’s notice. The Directors have 
no entitlement to any bonus or other additional payment on severance of their contract. Each Director would be considered on an individual basis and any 
payment would be entirely at the Company’s discretion. The details of the Directors’ contracts are summarised below:
Name of Director Date of contract Notice period
Osman Shahenshah Chief Executive Officer 27 February 2009 12 months
Constantine Ogunbiyi* Executive Director 12 June 2008 12 months

* Resigned as a Director of Afren plc on 4 January 2011.
ch Airm An And non -eXecu tive dir ectors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based on independent 
surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The notice period for the Chairman and for all Non-Executive Directors is three months. 
The Chairman, in recognition of his role as both Chairman of a Main Market listed company and ambassador for the Company, is paid a basic fee of £200,000 
(US$322,000) p.a. The basic fee paid to each other Non-Executive Director is between £51,000 (US$82,000) and £60,000 (US$97,000) p.a., and the senior 
Non-Executive Director receives £70,000 (US$113,000) p.a. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the share option scheme, although the awards 
from 2008 and earlier remain in place, and are not eligible to join the Company’s pension scheme. Afren plc 79

There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for the share options during the financial year.
In relation to the grant of share options, John St. John and Peter Bingham were appointed Non-Executive Directors and awarded share options whilst the 
Company was AIM listed on the basis that their experience and support to the executive team in relation to technical and financial expertise would, and will 
continue, to add significant value to the business. Whilst they retain options granted when the Company was AIM listed, no additional share options have been 
granted to any Non-Executive Director following admission to the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority and the Share Option Scheme Rules have 
been amended to prohibit the grant of share options to Non-Executive Directors. Afren plc 81

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and have also chosen to prepare the Parent Company financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit and loss of 
the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•  properly select and apply accounting policies; 
•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
•  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
I confirm to the best of my knowledge:
1.  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2.  The management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of Afren plc
We have audited the financial statements of Afren plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and 
Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
res Pect ive res Pons iBili ties of dir ectors And Audi tor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
sco Pe of the Audi t of the fin Anci Al st Atem ents
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
o Pinion on fin Anci Al st Atem ents
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
•  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
o Pinion on oth er mAtte rs Pres cri Bed By the com PAnies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
mAtte rs on whi ch we Are req uired to re Port By eXce Pti on
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
•  the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•  the Directors’ statement, contained within the Director’s Report, in relation to going concern; 
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review; and
•  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.

financial statements
1. Gener Al in form Atio n
Afren plc (the Company, and together with its subsidiaries, the Group) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. 
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 
and in the Chairman and Chief Executive’s Statement and Review of Operations on pages 8 to 11 and 26 to 29. These financial statements are presented 
in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance 
with the policies set out in note 2.
Adoption of new and revised standards
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards, amendments and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but are not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments
IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in other Entities
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IAS 1 (amended) Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
IAS 12 (amended) Deferred Tax – Recovery of Underlying Assets
IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits
IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised) Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures
The adoption of IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments. The Group does not intend to early adopt the standard. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial position 
of the Group.
2. Acco untin G Poli cies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union 
and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and oil inventory 
which is subject to certain commodity swap arrangements that have been measured at fair value. 
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting. The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration 
the Group’s current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern section of the Directors’ Report.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made 
up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operational policies of an entity so as to gain 
benefit from its activities. Entities over which the Company exercises joint control are accounted for using proportional consolidation, under which the Group 
records its share of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
As a consolidated Group income statement is published, a separate profit and loss account for the Parent Company has not been published in accordance 
with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured 
at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement 
period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted 
for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
 
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition 
date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree 
prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would 
be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 
•  deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 
Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
•  liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 
Share-based Payment; and
•  assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
are measured in accordance with that Standard.
 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), 
or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, 
if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances 
that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) 
in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
Property, plant and equipment – other
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the tangible fixed assets, less anticipated disposal proceeds, on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful economic life as follows:
Leasehold improvements   over life of lease
Fixtures and equipment*  over three years
Computer hardware and software  over three years
Gas plant  over six and a quarter years
* All artwork/paintings are depreciated over an economic useful life of fifteen years.
l easing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which 
case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs. Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the period in 
which they are incurred. Afren plc 91
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
financial statements
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic 
basis, such as a unit of production method, is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Contingent 
rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In the event that lease incentives are received to enter 
into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-
line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
o il and gas assets and intangible exploration and evaluation assets
The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for intangible exploration and evaluation (E&E) costs. All licence acquisition, exploration 
and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets in cost centres by field or exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of 
commerciality of the relevant property. Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration activities. Pre-licence 
costs and general exploration costs not specific to any particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred.
If prospects are deemed to be impaired (‘unsuccessful’) on completion of the evaluation, the associated costs are charged to the income statement. If the field 
is determined to be commercially viable, the attributable costs are transferred to property, plant and equipment in single field cost centres. These costs are then 
depreciated on a unit of production basis.
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment related to production activities are amortised 
in accordance with the Group’s depletion and amortisation accounting policy.
r evenues
Revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT and royalties paid in kind or where the financial obligation does not fall directly to Afren, of the Group’s share of 
oil liftings in the year together with gas and tariff income and interest income. Oil and gas revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
c ommercial reserves
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids 
which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs 
and which are considered commercially producible. There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more 
than the amount estimated as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
depletion and amortisation – oil and gas assets
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas 
production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus the production in the period, generally on a field-by-
field basis. Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs. 
Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in a discovery field, the recoverability of the net book value relating 
to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil and gas prices and 
future costs.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation. Where conditions giving rise to impairment 
subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been 
charged since the impairment.
decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed. A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also 
recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment. The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted 
to its net present value, and is reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the 
provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included as a finance cost.
impairment
Non-current assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Such 
triggering events are defined in IFRS 6 in respect of E&E assets and include the point at which determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist.
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by comparison 
with the estimated discounted future net cash flows based on management’s expectation of future production, oil prices and costs. Any identified impairment 
is charged to the income statement. 92 Afren plc

investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries held by the Company as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(its functional currency). For the purpose of consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed 
in US dollars which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are 
recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising are included in the profit and loss for the period.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of each Group company are translated into US dollars at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences (if any) 
arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the 
period in which the operation is disposed of. At present the Group has no subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars.
taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
share-based payments
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, Directors and other third parties. Equity-settled share-based schemes are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant, measured by use of an appropriate valuation model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period to exercise, 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company is liable for Employer’s National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise and exercise price. This expense 
is accrued by reference to the share price of the Company at the balance sheet date.
Pensions
Payments to a defined contribution pension scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
inventories
Inventories (spare parts and materials) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct 
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The cash flows associated with 
the purchase of spare parts and materials are classified in investment activities with the oil and gas assets. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Inventories (oil and butane inventories) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value other than certain oil inventory in Côte d’Ivoire, which is settled 
via a reduction in the amount recoverable in respect of realised gas sales from the Lion Gas Plant. The inventory subject to this swap is recorded at its fair value. Afren plc 93
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
financial statements
finance costs and debt
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use or sale.
Financial costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Arrangement fees and issue costs 
are deducted from the debt proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised and charged to the income statement as finance costs over the 
term of the debt.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. 
 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group has entered into swaps and call options to economically protect against exposures to variability in the price of a proportion of Okoro and 
Côte d’Ivoire crude oil production for 2008 to 2012. Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. The gains and losses arising out of changes in fair 
value of these derivative financial instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for in other operating income/(expense) in the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred.
In 2011 the group entered into a number of deferred put options in respect of production from the Ebok field. The new instruments were classified as cash 
flow hedges. Each period the portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instruments that is determined to be an effective hedge is taken to equity and the 
ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, is recognised in the income statement.
The Group has also entered into certain put and call option contracts in relation to its associate, FHN. Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. 
The gains and losses arising out of changes in fair value of these derivative financial instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for 
in other operating income/(expense) in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Available for sale investments
Available for sale investments are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available for 
sale investments are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is included in the profit or loss for the period.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at their fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income 
statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any 
contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded 
at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale. Investments 
in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less 
any impairment in the value of individual investments, plus any gain arising on non-dilutive, third-party equity investments. Losses of an associate in excess 
of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) 
are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations to make or has made payments on behalf of the associate. 94 Afren plc

2. Accountin G Poli cies continued 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is 
recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. 
Any excess of the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition above the cost of acquisition 
(i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant 
associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
IAS 28 is currently not specific on how changes in an investee’s net assets that are not the investor’s share of the investee’s profit or loss or other comprehensive 
income, or that are not distributions received are accounted for. The Group’s policy in these circumstances is to recognise these gains (or losses) through the 
income statement when they occur. 
Sojitz loan notes and senior loan notes
Sojitz loan notes were regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component. At the date of issue, the fair value 
of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue 
of the Sojitz loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the 
Group, was included in equity. Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative 
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability 
component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
Senior loan notes are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Senior loan notes are subsequently carried at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the senior 
loan notes. Interest is calculated by applying the coupon rate on to the redemption value.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the non-current asset (or disposal group) is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year of the classification.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
3. c rit ic Al Acco untin G Jud Gements And Key s ources of estim Atio n uncert Aint y
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements, key assumptions and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may have a significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
o il and gas assets
Management is required to assess the oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment. Note 12 discloses the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets. As part 
of this assessment in the current year, management has carried out an impairment test (ceiling test) on certain tangible oil and gas assets (Côte d’Ivoire assets). 
Management also performed an impairment test upon its Barda Rash asset, on transfer from intangible exploration and evulation assets as required by IFRS 6. 
This test compares the carrying value of the assets at the balance sheet date with the expected discounted cash flows from each project. For the discounted 
cash flows to be calculated, management has used a production profile based on its best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets and a range 
of assumptions, including an internal oil price profile benchmarked to mean analysts’ consensus and a 10% discount rate which, taking into account other 
assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
intangible exploration and evaluation assets
Management is required to assess impairment in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets. Note 12 discloses the carrying value of such assets. 
The triggering events are defined in IFRS 6. In making the assessment, management is required to make judgements on the status of each project and the 
future plans towards finding commercial reserves. The nature of exploration and evaluation activity is such that only a proportion of projects are ultimately 
successful and some assets are likely to become impaired in future periods. Afren plc 95
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
financial statements
share-based payments and fhn options
Management is required to make assumptions in respect of share based payments and FHN options of the inputs used to calculate the fair values of 
share-based payment arrangements and options. Details of these can be found in note 31 and note 20.
fair value of Black marlin acquisition
The assets and liabilities acquired following the completion of Black Marlin Energy Holdings Limited acquisition by the Company in 2010 were recorded at fair 
value at the completion date, as outlined further in note 32. The estimates of such fair values required significant judgement to be applied, particularly in 
respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets. Management generally assigns fair values to intangible exploration and evaluation assets to equal the 
excess of the purchase price consideration over and above the other assets and liabilities acquired, when this represents the most reliable indication of fair value. 
decommissioning
The Group has decommissioning obligations in Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire. The extent to which a provision is required depends on the legal requirements at the 
date of decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate to be applied. The decommissioning provision will be updated each year to reflect 
Management’s best estimates.
taxation and r oyalties
The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates can be uncertain and subject to interpretation. As disclosed in note 29, the Group 
has significant tax liabilities which may be subject to revision as the Group’s tax filings and royalties are agreed with the relevant authorities in future periods.

Geographical segments
The Group operates in five geographical markets which form the basis of the information evaluated by the Group’s chief operating decision maker: Nigeria, 
Cote d’Ivoire, Other West Africa, Eastern Africa and Middle East and North Africa. This is the basis on which the Group records its primary segment information.

During the year borrowing costs were capitalised to the Ebok field using a weighted average rate of approximately 11.03% (2010: 4.6%). The increase in the 
weighted average rate during the year arose due to the Company’s issue of the Senior Secured Loan notes which have a coupon rate of 11.5%. Following 
approval of the development plan for the Barda Rash field in Kurdistan Region of Iraq, borrowing costs were capitalised using a weighted average rate of 
11.85% (2010: nil). Further, the Okoro infill wells drilling commenced in the fourth quarter 2010 and therefore borrowing costs incurred during the year relating 
to the Okoro project were capitalised using a weighted average rate of approximately 4.4% (2010: 3.2%) related to the specific project borrowings rate.

In 2010, 9.9 million potential ordinary shares were anti-dilutive and were therefore excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the

6.75 million of the call options it holds over FHN shares in order to maintain the 45% shareholding. See note 20 for further details on the Group’s options 
relating to FHN.

In March 2010 the Group entered into a bank facility agreement, for a maximum of five years, secured against the Ebok field reserves. The facility is repayable 
in semi-annual instalments determined by borrowing base calculations linked to the certified reserves of the Ebok field. The amount drawndown, including 
certain capitalised financing costs amounted to US$217.8 million (US$213.4 million net of financing arrangement costs) and US$107.4 million (US$98.6 million 
net of financing arrangement costs) as at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 respectively. Interest on the loan is based on LIBOR plus a margin of 5.5% 
as at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
On 3 August 2011, the Company entered into a US$50 million facilities agreement (the Socar facility) with Socar Trading S.A. The Socar facility has a term of the 
earlier of (i) 23 months from the date of the agreement (i.e. 3 July 2013) or (ii) 90 days from the date that Afren’s Ebok Crude Oil Purchase Contract with Socar 
terminates (the later of 4 September 2012 or the cumulative lifting of 18.5 mmbbl of crude oil from the EBok field). The Socar facility has an interest rate of 
LIBOR plus 4.5%. 106 Afren plc

In November 2011, the Group obtained a bank facilicy of up to US$200 million in respect of acquisitions in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The outstanding 
balance was US$100.0 million as at 31 December 2011 (US$95.9 million net of financing arrangement costs), (2010: US$nil). The facility is for an 18-month term 
and interest on the facility is based on LIBOR plus 9.0%. Subsequent to year end an agreement was reached and the full facility was repaid in March 2012.

in semi-annual instalments determined by borrowing base calculations linked to the certified reserves of the Okoro field. The loan was secured by the assets 
of the Okoro field. In February 2011 the full outstanding obligation was repaid.
The 2008 acquisition of operations in Côte d’lvoire was financed by a financing package arranged through BNP Paribas. The outstanding balance on the 
financing package at 31 December 2011 was US$nil, (2010: US$71.2 million (US$69.8 million net of financing arrangement costs)). Interest on the senior debt 
was based on LIBOR plus a margin of between 3.25% and 3.5% as at 31 December 2010. Interest on the subordinate debt was based on LIBOR plus a margin 
of 4.25%. The senior debt included certain financial covenants which were assessed on a quarterly basis. In February 2011 the full outstanding obligation 
was repaid.
Borrowings also include a balance of US$nil, (2010: US$33.3 million (US$32.4 million net of financing arrangement costs)), relating to an unsecured loan facility 
from First City Monument Bank plc (FCMB). Interest on the loan was based on LIBOR plus a margin of 4.45%. In February 2011 the full outstanding obligation 
was repaid.
financial risk management
In respect of financial risk management, at the balance sheet date, the Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables and any derivative asset. The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet its commitments as they fall due. 
The Group uses projected cash flows to monitor funding requirements for the Group’s activities. 
The Group uses both short-term and long-term cash flow projections to monitor funding requirements and ensure there is sufficient cash resources to meet 
operational needs. Cash flow projections take into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans and covenant compliance. The following table details 
the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed maturity periods. The table has been drawn based on the 
undiscounted cash flows of the financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

In 2007 the Group entered into derivative financial instruments (swaps and call options) to economically protect against exposures to variability in the price 
of Okoro crude oil production for the period 2008 to 2010. During the first half of 2009 an additional derivative contract in respect of the Okoro crude was 
entered into for the period 2009 to 2011. The Group receives a minimum amount if the market falls, but receives a set discount from the market price if the oil 
price is above that minimum. The arrangement protects the Group against the risk of a significant fall in the price of crude oil by establishing a minimum price 
for the Okoro crude. During 2008 on acquisition of the CI-11 field in Côte d’lvoire, the Group entered into similar instruments to protect against variability in 
price of the CI-11 crude oil production for the period from 2008 to 2012. In February 2011 the CI-11 instruments were transferred to cover the production from 
the Ebok field. The loss of US$1.9 million (2010: US$8.9 million loss) arising during the year as a result of the changes in fair value of these derivative financial 
instruments has been accounted for in the income statement net of cash realisations, as hedge accounting was not applied.
In February 2011 and May 2011, the Group entered into a number of deferred put options in respect of production from the Ebok field. The Group will 
receive a minimum amount if the market falls. These new instruments have been classified as cash flow hedges, with a portion of the gains and losses on the 
instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge taken to equity and the ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, recognised in the 
income statement for each period. During the period the loss incurred of US$10.6 million, net of cash realisations, relating to these instruments was charged 
to the income statement in relation to the change in time value.
In addition to the above commodity derivatives, the change in July 2008 of the functional currency of the holding company from pounds sterling to US dollar 
resulted in certain sterling denominated warrants being accounted for as derivatives from that date, as they are no longer convertible at a fixed price in that 
company’s functional currency. As a result of the warrants exercised during the year, the fair value of the remaining warrants at 31 December 2011, recorded 
within other creditors, was US$0.04 million (2010: US$11.2 million) and the resultant loss during the year of US$0.07 million (2010: US$8.1 million loss) has been 
taken to the income statement.
In 2010 and 2011 the Group entered into certain put and call option contracts in relation to its associate, FHN. There are three option contracts in existence; 
two of the option contracts are with equity investors of FHN and there is also a call option between Afren and FHN. The Group recorded a net gain of 
US$8.0 million (2010: US$nil) in respect of these instruments.
The first option contract with an equity holder of FHN is a call option agreement over 7.2 million FHN shares. The Group can exercise the call option any time 
during the 2.5 years over the equity investment. The investor can exercise their put option for 90 days after the call option expires. The Group has also granted 
a put option to an equity investor of FHN over 15 million FHN shares, exercisable two years after the equity investment. This option will lapse if not exercised 
within 150 days of this date. As consideration for providing this put option, FHN granted Afren 30 million call options with a 10 year term. During the year, 
6.75 million of these options were exercised when the Group’s investment was diluted. FHN has 135 million of issued ordinary shares as at 31 December 2011. 108 Afren plc

Level 2 fair value measurements have been determined by reference to observable data in quoted markets at the balance sheet date.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include at least one input for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used. 
Otherwise management determines a reasonable estimate for the input. 
The only movement in level 3 financial instruments has been the exercise of 6.8 million options resulting in a reduction in value of US$3.1 million and 
an increase in the option valuation of US$8.0 million recorded as a gain in the income statement.
The fair value of bank borrowings and loan notes have been determined by discounting future cash outflows relating to the borrowings and loan 
notes respectively. 
For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions may change the fair value significantly. 
Where significant, the effect of a change in these assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative assumption is outlined in the table below. These sensitivities 
have been calculated by amending the fair value of the level 3 financial assets at 31 December for a change in each individual assumption, as outlined below, 
whilst keeping all other assumptions consistent with those used to calculate the fair value recognised in the financial statements.

Sensitivity analysis
interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings. The Group has managed the interest rate 
risk by using a mix of fixed and variable rates on convertible bonds, loan notes and bank borrowings respectively.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to changes in LIBOR rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax.

o il price risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in oil price relates primarily to the Group’s derivative financial instruments. The terms of the derivative financial 
instruments are such that the Group will receive a minimum amount if the market falls, but will receive a set discount from the market price if the oil price is 
above that minimum. The effect on Group loss and equity of changes in the oil price on the fair value of the derivative financial instruments is shown below:

In 2010 the majority of foreign exchange risk was as a result of the outstanding warrants held by FCMB which are financial liabilities of the Group. The impact 
of a 10% change in the Nigerian Naira to US dollar exchange rate would not be material in 2011 or in 2010.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise shareholder value. The Group’s 
funding needs are met through a combination of debt and equity. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed above after deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity 
attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity. Net debt is calculated as gross debt, 
as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents and excludes finance lease.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011
continued
The movement from 2010 is attributable to higher external borrowings during 2011, principally as a result of the Company’s senior notes, additional drawdown 
on the Ebok facility, Socar facility and Ain Sifni funding all described above, which is offset by repayment during the year of some of the borrowings existing in 
2010 and an increase in equity attributable to the equity raised in July 2011 and warrants and options exercised during the year.
c redit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group reviews the credit 
risk of the entities that it sells its products to or that it enters into contractual arrangements with and will obtain guarantees and commercial letters of credit 
as may be considered necessary where risks are significant to the Group. The Group’s business is diversified in terms of both region and the number of 
counterparties and, other than transactions with major oil companies with high credit rating and government organisations in Côte d’Ivoire, the Group does 
not have significant exposure to any single counterparty or group of counterparties with similar characteristics. The credit risk on cash is limited because the 
majority is deposited with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies or with governmental guarantee. The Group’s total 
maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2011 was US$428.7 million (2010: US$171.3 million) made up of cash and bank balances and trade and 
other receivables (excluding prepayments).

The provision for decommissioning is in respect of Ebok, Okoro and CI-11 fields. The provision represents the present value of the amounts that are expected 
to be incurred up to 2023. Additions during the year relates to additional wells drilled and production facilities installed at the Ebok field. During the year an 
independent specialist evaluated the decommissioning costs for the three fields and the study led to the adjustment of the amounts previously provided for. 
Management believe  the estimates form a reasonable basis for the expected future costs of decommissioning.

A loss of US$3.7 million (2010: US$0.6 million) has been disclosed in the period as arising from discontinued operations. This loss relates to the seismic business 
of Black Marlin Energy Holdings Limited (Black Marlin) which was acquired by Afren as part of its acquisition of the issued share capital of Black Marlin in 2010. 
The trade and assets of this business were identified as held for sale on acquisition as an active programme was in place at 31 December 2010 for the sale of 
the business. 
However, during the period under review it was decided by management that the business would no longer be sold but that it would be abandoned, 
with the assets of the business (largely marine and land seismic vehicles and equipment) either put into use by Afren in other parts of the Group or sold 
on a piecemeal basis.
These assets have therefore been reclassified in the period out of assets held for sale and into property, plant and equipment and had a carrying value of US$0.7 million 
as at 31 December 2011. The results of the business remain classified as discontinued in both periods. Afren plc 111

On 9 October 2008 Afren entered into a strategic alliance with Sojitz, a Japanese investment and industrial conglomerate, to jointly pursue acquisition 
opportunities of scale in Africa. Sojitz invested US$45 million in the form of loan notes in Afren which were to become convertible bonds at the time of 
entering into or announcing joint acquisitions. The loan notes bore a coupon based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2%. The net proceeds from the issue of the 
loan notes were split between a liability component and an equity component at the date of issue. The liability component of the loan notes was US$nil as at 
31 December 2011 (2010: US$41.4 million). The interest charged for the year was calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 2.5% (2010: 8.7%) to the 
liability component. The full outstanding balance of US$45 million on the notes was repaid in February 2011.
On 27 January 2011, Afren offered US$450 million of aggregate principal amount of its 11.5% senior secured notes due 2016 (the Notes) and on 11 February 2011, 
Afren announced an offering of an additional US$50 million of its 11.5% senior secured notes due 2016. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain 
subsidiaries of Afren plc and on a senior subordinated basis by Afren Resources Limited. Part of the proceeds of the offering were used to settle borrowings 
amounting to US$175.6 million (net of issue costs) and accrued interest of US$1.3 million. Also payable was an early redemption fee on the previously existing 
Sojitz notes, amounting to US$2.5 million.
Interest amounting to US$52.5 million (before capitalisation of some of the interest to oil and gas assets under development) , and the Sojitz fee, has been 
charged to the Income statement for the period to 31 December 2011. Total expenses of the offering incurred amounted to US$22.1 million which are being 
amortised over the life the Notes.

taxable profits against which these tax losses could be recovered. Such losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The Group and Company had temporary 
differences of US$2.3 million (2010: US$25.2 million) and US$3.8 million (2010: US$10.9 million) respectively, in respect of share-based payments, property,

against which these tax losses could be recovered.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the Group has no intention to remit the earnings to the UK in the 
foreseeable future.

Equity-settled share option scheme
The Group operates a share option scheme for employees. The Group’s policy is to award options to employees on appointment or completion of their 
probationary period and periodically thereafter. Options are issued at market price on the grant date and have vesting periods of up to three years. The options 
expire after 10 years if they remain unexercised and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest except at the discretion of the Board.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2011 was 158p (2010: 108p). 
In 2011 options were granted on 5 January, 31 March, 9, 20 and 31 May, 21 June, 31 August, 1, 19 and 20 September, 4 October, 22 November and 
5 December. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$3.5 million.

estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$2.4 million.
The options granted during the year have been valued by reference to the Barrier option valuation model, consistent with the prior year. The inputs into the 
Barrier model were as follows:

The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data. The volatility was measured utilising several formulae, 
including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH (Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model, and over several 
time periods. These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility which is in line with the prior year. Therefore the volatility assumption was reduced, 
but will remain under review going forwards. 116 Afren plc

l ong term incentive Plan
Equity-settled share award scheme
An alternative share plan was introduced during 2007 (with first grants made in June 2008) to give awards to Directors and staff subject to outperforming 
a comparator group of similarly focused oil and gas exploration and production companies in terms of shareholder return over a three-year period. The Afren 
Performance Share Plan awards a number of shares to Directors and staff based on a multiple of salary. However, these shares only vest after a three-year 
period and the full award is made only if Afren has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas 
companies: Borders & Southern Petroleum plc, Bowleven, Cairn Energy, Desire Petroleum, Enquest, Falkland Oil & Gas, Gulf Keystone Petroleum, Gulfsands 
Petroleum, Hardy Oil & Gas, Heritage Oil, Ithaca Energy, JKX Oil & Gas, Melrose Resources, Petroceltic International, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration, 
Salamander Energy, Serica Energy, Soco International, Sterling Energy, Tullow Oil and Valiant Petroleum. If Afren does not achieve at least median performance 
in the peer group, no shares will be awarded. At the median level, 30% of the shares will vest and there is a sliding scale between median and top quartile 
performance where only a percentage of the total award will vest.
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, except under certain circumstances, e.g. redundancies, where the number 
of awards vesting will be prorated according to the length of time the employee has been employed during the three-year vesting period.

–  Proved plus Probable (2P) reserves have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2007 PRMS approved by the SPE.
–  Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum that are estimated to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations but for which the projects 
are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies.
–  NGL output and the wholly Afren owned Lion Gas Plant is not included in 2011 production.
–  Quantities of oil equivalent are calculated using a gas-to-oil conversion factor of 5,800 scf of gas per barrel of oil equivalent.
–  The oil price used by NSAI and RPS Energy for their independent reserve and resource assessments at 31/12/11 was US$100/bbl flat.
–  The Group provides for depletion and amortisation of tangible fixed assets on a net entitlement basis, which reflects the terms of the licenses and agreements 
relating to each field.

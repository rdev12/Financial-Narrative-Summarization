FTSE All-Share Total Return
2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Results
Our fourth year as an investment trust has again seen the growth in
our net asset value per share outpace that of the FTSE All-Share
index, although the 11% uplift and 3% outperformance were lower
than the 34% and 10% achieved respectively last year. Nonetheless
our long established strategy of acquiring significant, but usually
minority, stakes in promising listed and unlisted companies and
working with proven managements to add shareholder value over
the longer term has enabled us to continue to record
outperformance against our benchmark FTSE All-Share Total Return
index over five and ten years of 124% and 194% respectively.
Share price and discount
Our share price rose by 4% over the year from 1980 pence to 
2066 pence with the increase muted by a widening of the share
price discount from less than 4% to just over 9% notwithstanding
the 11% increase in underlying net asset value per share. I have
cautioned in past years that it would prove challenging to continue
to reduce the share price discount and that our share price is not
ultimately within our control. The year just past has borne this out.
However we are mindful that a wider share price discount affects
shareholder value and we have used our authority to buy in our 
own shares when it was in the interest of our shareholders for us 
to do so, as detailed in the Chief Executive’s statement.
Forty year dividend record
We are pleased to propose an increase of 5.4% in the final dividend
to 21.6 pence per share from 20.5 pence last time, making a total
dividend for the full year of 31.1 pence representing a 5.1% increase
over last year and costing £18m. This marks a forty year record of
successive annual dividend increases over which period we calculate
that our annual dividends per share have increased by a factor of
over 45 times as against a factor of 12 times for inflation. Such
dividends will have aggregated to an equivalent of £5.36 per share
and have been augmented by special dividends paid in 1997 and
2000 totalling £1 per share. There have also been opportunities for
shareholders to opt for two elective special dividends. It is also of
interest that forty years ago our equivalent share price was 15p.
Elective special dividend
In our interim statement I reported that in June 2006 we offered
shareholders the option of participating in a return of funds of up to
£128m by way of an elective special dividend on a broadly one for
ten basis, with the shares so elected being cancelled for nil
consideration through a Court approved reduction of capital. The
dividend was struck at a 3% discount to the underlying NAV per
share on the designated date and the resultant dividend of
1902.17 pence per share was taken up on 84.4% of the
6,410,579 shares eligible, resulting in a payout of £102.9m.
Portfolio
Details of the changes in our portfolio are provided in the Chief
Executive’s statement and the further pages which follow. With
prices generally high, we remain selective in our investment activity
but have continued to invest where we see good opportunities at
sensible prices. During the year we invested £290m in new and
follow-on opportunities and realised £317m, the main element of
which was the £131m divestment of our remaining and long
standing investment in Kerzner International in September last year
to a management buyout led by the Kerzner family. This has proved
an excellent investment since we took our initial stake in 1994,
giving a compound annual return of 15% over the period, but we
were all much saddened by the death of Butch Kerzner, the chief
executive and architect of the buyout, who died in a helicopter
accident just after the transaction.
We have continued to increase our investment activity in Asia,
and predominantly in India, where we believe that there are
substantial opportunities for the longer term investor prepared to
develop relationships with management teams, often founding
families, who are familiar with the local business environment.

124%
Share price total return outperformance against the 
FTSE All-Share Total Return over five years Liquidity
Notwithstanding the £103m return of funds to shareholders
described above, we still held net liquid funds of £109m at the 
year end compared with £180m last year. This is a function of the
underlying dynamic of our investment activity and, given our
concern about the high prices of businesses, is a sensible position
when seeking to achieve an absolute return for shareholders over
the longer term.
Economic and political background
I have habitually made reference to the current economic and
political background as it can have a substantive effect on our
business. Inflation is rising faster than officially acknowledged and
higher interest rates have consequently been introduced.
Government spending has increased sharply for little identifiable
benefit, and has been accompanied by an unwelcome requirement
for higher taxes. It surprises us, therefore, that our economy has
remained stable. Many in the business community are aghast at the
relentless increase in new and costly legislation but seem impotent
to stem the flow. The ‘Burdens Barometer’ for the increase in costs
for business from new legislation since 1998, independently
calculated for the British Chambers of Commerce, has now risen 
to over £55bn, the majority of which is to comply with the whim 
of the unaccountable bureaucracy in Brussels. Our retiring Prime
Minister had promised a referendum if the powers of Brussels were
to be extended through a revised constitution and whilst a
disguised version of this seems an imminent prospect, the
promised referendum is being brushed aside. However this is
entirely consistent with the lack of integrity and growing
incompetence of the present Government and it is difficult to
believe that the forthcoming change of prime minister will herald
the changes which are so urgently needed. It is therefore important
to encourage a credible opposition. It is for this reason that we have
decided to ask our shareholders for permission to enable us to
make a contribution of up to £60,000 to the Conservative Party so
that it can be better equipped to form an alternative government.
To this end it is important to build its resource – especially in
marginal seats – if a change from this high spend and low delivery
Government is to become a reality.
Staff
We rely on a relatively small but dedicated management team who
make judgements on and process our various investments. They do
this against the rising tide of rules and regulations to which I have
already referred and which increasingly burden the corporate
sector. I would like to thank them all on behalf of shareholders for
their diligent and unstinting efforts.
Outlook
After a strong run in the market place, particularly in the mid-cap
sector, there are signs of more volatility. This affects the pricing 
of new opportunities, but our refusal to join auction processes,
coupled with our longer term approach and access to liquidity,
should enable us to take advantage of corrections in the market 
for the longer term benefit of shareholders.
Peter Buckley
Chairman
Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 03
“We have continued to increase our
investment activity in Asia.”
Peter Buckley
Chairman Our financial year ended 31 March 2007 saw net asset value (‘NAV’)
per share increase by 10.8% which was just over 3% ahead of the
FTSE All-Share index over the year. The graph below compares our
NAV per share performance against the FTSE All-Share index since
our conversion to investment trust status on 1 April 2003.
Although for the 12 months ended 31 March 2007 our NAV per
share growth was ahead of the market, it is disappointing to note
that, as a result of our discount widening, our share price increase
of 4.3% (from 1980p to 2066p) was below the FTSE All-Share index
growth of 7.7% for this 12 month period.
Significant changes in value
Our 10.8% NAV per share increase was significantly aided by four
investments, each of which provided total return gains (including
the value of dividends and distributions) of more than £10m.
These were:
Quintain Estates & Development (quoted) + £22.1m
Sterling Industries (unquoted) + £21.8m
Polar Capital (quoted on 6 Feb 2007) + £11.8m
Terrace Hill (quoted) + £11.1m
No individual investments had value losses of more than £10m, but
in two cases there were losses in value of over £5m:
Alok Industries (quoted) – £6.0m
Tribal Group (quoted) – £5.0m
However, in both of the above two holdings, their share prices have
improved markedly since 31 March 2007.
In addition, the fall in value of the US dollar compared with sterling
over the period of 13.1% had an adverse effect on NAV. Although
we had hedged our Kerzner International exposure, we had not
hedged our other US dollar denominated investments, and we
estimate that the foreign exchange effect on these US dollar
investments reduced NAV by around £7m.
Investment activity
It has been an active investment year for us, both for investments
made and for realisations.
As a result of our style as long term supportive and
constructively involved investors, we are approached with many
opportunities not always offered to others. During the financial
year, our investment management committee evaluated 130 new
investment opportunities. We made 14 new investments for a total
amount of around £128m – more than half of this in unquoted
companies. In addition, a further £162m was made in follow-on
investments, giving a total investment of £290m for the year. This 
is a significant increase on the £155m we invested in the previous
year. More information on these is given in the business review 
on page 13.
With our increased knowledge of the market in India we have
been carefully increasing our exposure to businesses trading in that
rapidly expanding area. As at 31 March 2007 the total value of our
Indian investments (including two UK listed entities that focus on
India) was £71.8m – representing 5.4% of shareholders’ funds.
We continue to be actively and constructively involved with our
investee companies, which we believe materially aids performance.
It is our normal policy for a Caledonia executive to join the board 
of an investee company, and during the year we have had our
executives on the boards of 18 of our top 20 investments.
Realisations this year totalled £317m, a similar level to the
previous year. By far the largest was the buyout by a
management-led investor group of Kerzner International, the
resorts owner and operator in which we had an 8% stake. The
$237m received by us in September had been hedged at an average
of $1.81 to the pound, resulting in an overall realisation of £131m,
including a £6m benefit from the hedge. More information on our
realisations is given on page 14 in the business review.
We started the year with £180m of cash and in view of our
liquidity level, we believed it to be in shareholders’ interests to offer
an elective special dividend with an associated share cancellation.
All such shareholder elections, including those for oversubscription,
were met in full. As a consequence, £102.9m was paid out and
shares in issue reduced by about 5.4m to around 58.7m.
As a result of the above investment activity and the elective
special dividend, our liquidity slightly reduced during the year 
and was £109m at 31 March 2007.

Keeping overhead costs down is an important objective for us as
every pound of cost is a pound reduction in our shareholders’ net
assets. Nonetheless, it is vital that we have sufficient resources to 
be able to manage our portfolio effectively in a hands-on fashion,
while also attracting and evaluating a strong deal flow. We believe
that being a self-managed investment trust company, with direct
control over costs, significantly helps this objective. Our pre-tax
total expenses ratio was 0.8%, which compares favourably against 
a pre-tax weighted investment trust industry average of 1.4%.
Discount
As mentioned above, we are very conscious that the widening of
the discount of our share price to net asset value has a deleterious
effect on our share price performance.
We firmly believe that we should continue to concentrate our
efforts on striving to ensure that NAV per share continues to
outperform the market. This is the best way over the medium and
long term of meeting our financial aims of total shareholder return
outperformance. One of the actions that aids our NAV per share
performance is, when the opportunity arises, to buy our own shares
into treasury when there is a significant discount. This we have
done in a small way during March when 40,000 shares were bought
in at an average price of 1976p. In order that such opportunities
can also be exploited to the benefit of our shareholders during the
close period from our year end to the announcement of our results,
we have given, within certain pre-set parameters, irrevocable
instructions to our brokers, JPMorgan Cazenove, to purchase shares
on our behalf. On 11 May 2007, 30,000 shares were thereby
purchased at a price of 2130p.
In addition to the above, we also believe that continuing 
to improve the awareness of Caledonia amongst retail investors
should prove beneficial. To this end, we have programmes in 
place to present the company to private client stockbrokers 
and leading IFAs.
Outlook
Although at the time of writing economies around the world still
seem to be buoyant and we continue to see a healthy flow of
investment opportunities, we remain conservative in our approach
and are particularly careful not to overpay for new investments.
Economic cycles will continue and we believe it is in our
shareholders’ interests for us to remain cautious in our investment
policies. We have liquidity on our balance sheet and would expect
to remain ungeared with continuing liquidity at the end of the
current financial year.
By carefully selecting the right opportunities where there are
strong management teams, by continuing our active involvement
in investee companies and by being careful to avoid over-
exuberance, we seek to maintain our distinctive outperformance.

“We seek to maintain our

Tim Ingram
Chief Executive Caledonia is a self-managed investment
trust. We are a long term, supportive
investor. We identify opportunities through
our extensive network, invest in significant
stakes for the longer term and involve
ourselves with the managements of
investee companies. We back proven
management teams and look for
opportunities where our investment style
and involvement will be welcome. Our
initial investments range typically between
£10m and £25m, although we may invest
up to £100m in exceptional circumstances.
06 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Business review
Our business Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 07
Identify
investment
opportunities
Our reputation, size and extensive network give 
us a flow of investment opportunities that are not
always available to others. This enables us to be
highly selective in the businesses that we back. 
We use our experience and expertise to analyse
potential investments and we will take particular
care in appraising the track record and commitment
of potential investee management teams.
Invest
in signiﬁcant stakes
for the longer term
We hold an investment portfolio of significant
stakes in listed and unlisted companies. We are
opportunistic, with investments in a range of
sectors and territories. We usually seek substantial
minority stakes but will invest in a majority
holding if we believe this to be in the best interests
of shareholders.
Involve
ourselves with investee
management teams
We are a supportive investor, working in
partnership with the management teams of
investee companies to help them to maximise 
the potential of their businesses. We usually 
seek a seat on the boards of investee companies. Objectives
Caledonia aims to achieve a long term total shareholder return in
excess of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index, whilst maintaining 
a progressive annual dividend, through a focused portfolio of
significant stakes in companies where we believe there to be good
opportunities for building value.
Caledonia measures its performance over the long term by
comparing its total shareholder return against the FTSE All-Share
Total Return index over five and ten year periods.
In addition, Caledonia aims to achieve a positive total return
over rolling five year periods.
Strategy
Caledonia’s strategy is to invest in and actively manage significant
stakes in 30 to 40 companies and situations where we believe there
to be good opportunities for building value. Active management
will usually be achieved by working closely and constructively with
the investee management, and usually with board representation,
as a long term supportive shareholder. We self-manage our
portfolio, using in-house expertise, as well as using third party
managers who specialise in particular asset classes or geographical
areas. We will in particular seek to increase our level of investment
in Asia.
Caledonia seeks new investments with a typical size of £10m to
£25m, although we may invest up to £100m in exceptional
circumstances. Although Caledonia usually aims to have an
influential minority stake, we will, on occasion, be prepared to take
a controlling interest where we believe that this will maximise
shareholder value. When considering an investment opportunity,
we take particular care in appraising the capabilities and
commitment of the management team of the prospective investee
company. The anticipated total return from the investment, the
strategy in relation to it, and the overall risks, are carefully analysed
as part of the investment process.
Caledonia will invest part of its portfolio in third party managed
funds. Again, a core skill is our ability to assess the capabilities and
commitment of the fund management team and we will often seek
to obtain a significant stake in the management company, thereby
potentially enhancing returns to shareholders.
Caledonia seeks to work closely and constructively with the
managements of companies that it has backed and to make
available the considerable experience of our own team to help the
investee companies’ managements to address their business issues.
The strategy for each investment, including the returns and the
timing of eventual disposal, is reviewed regularly. Investments are
realised when we believe that the funds released can provide better
long term returns, but in a manner consistent with Caledonia’s
reputation as a supportive long term investor.
Whilst the source of funding for new investments generally
comes from its own resources, Caledonia may at times seek to
enhance returns by taking on moderate levels of gearing.
Tight control is exercised over costs, notwithstanding
Caledonia’s active and participative management style. Cost
containment is significantly aided by managing the large majority
of investments through our in-house management team.

Business review
Objectives and strategy The financial review discusses the results of the company for the
financial year and refers to the company’s income statement and
balance sheet. In addition to holding minority stakes in investee
businesses, the company holds majority stakes in a number of
companies. The results of these companies are included in the
consolidated financial statements. However, management view
these majority stakes as part of the company’s investment portfolio
and they are included in the discussion below in this context. Where
appropriate, the financial review refers to aspects of the
consolidated financial statements.
Key performance indicators
Our key performance indicators are as follows:
• Net asset value per share growth against the movement in the
FTSE All-Share over one year.
• Share price total return performance against the FTSE All-Share
over five and ten years.
• Absolute share price total return over five years.
• Total expenses ratio.
• Deal flow.
Net asset value
Net asset value (‘NAV’) per share, on an undiluted basis, was 2283p
at 31 March 2007, compared with 2061p at the same date in 2006
and 1543p (restated under IFRS) in 2005. The increase over the year
of 222p (10.8%) was principally driven by portfolio performance
(+11.8%), partially offset by annual dividends paid (-1.5%).
The elective special dividend paid in July 2006 added 0.3% to
undiluted NAV per share.
Table 1 shows the components of the movement in NAV per share
over the year.

The company’s NAV at 31 March 2007 of £1,323.2m
(2006 – £1,307.0m) differs from the group’s consolidated NAV of
£1,311.0m (2006 – £1,324.5m) due to the inclusion of investments
in subsidiaries at fair value in the company balance sheet as
opposed to the underlying share of net assets in the consolidated
balance sheet.
Total return
Caledonia achieved a total return for the year ended 31 March 2007
of £137.7m, which equates to 10.5% on opening equity
(2006 – 35.6%). The key components were investment gains and
investment income recorded over the year. The profit for the period
and net income recognised directly in equity together comprise the
company’s total return, summarised in table 2.

Financial review Gross portfolio return
Gross portfolio return comprises gains and losses on investments,
investment income and other items. The chart below illustrates the
gross portfolio return for the past three financial years. The
downturn in performance in 2007, compared with 2006, reflected a
slower growth in equity markets during the year. The FTSE All-Share
rose by just 7.7% in 2007, compared with 24.0% in 2006.
Net gains and losses on investments for the year were £96.5m,
compared with £352.7m for the previous year. An analysis of this
return is given in table 3.

2007 2006
£m £m
Unquoted investments 54.4 103.0
Quoted investments 42.1 249.7
96.5 352.7
Net gains on quoted investments included £14.9m in respect of
Polar Capital and Kingdom Group, which were listed in London and
Hong Kong respectively during the year.
Net gains on derivatives of £5.6m in 2007 comprised £6.0m of
gains on forward currency sale contracts taken out to hedge the 
US dollar exposure on our remaining investment in Kerzner
International, which was sold in September 2006, and a £0.4m loss
on a basket of options to hedge against fluctuations in deferred
proceeds on the sale of an investment in September 2005. Net
losses on derivatives of £9.0m in 2006 arose on forward currency
sale contracts taken out to hedge the currency exposure on our
US dollar denominated investments.
A provision of £10.0m was made in 2006 in response to a
liability that may arise as the result of a subsidiary entering
administration.
Investment income of £40.1m was 77.4% higher than the
£22.6m booked in 2006. This increase resulted from the
investment during the year in a number of new high-yielding loan
instruments, increasing income by £6.2m, and substantial
dividends received from investments in subsidiaries of £12.2m,
compared with £2.0m in 2006.
An analysis of gross portfolio returns in 2007 from our principal
investments is shown in table 4.

was underpinned by a recent third party share transaction. Oval
continued its successful integration of regional insurance brokers
and the Close Brothers Private Equity (‘CBPE’) funds benefited from
some substantial realisations during the year.

Business review
Financial review Expenses
Management expenses comprise the costs incurred in managing
the operations of the company and totalled £11.0m for the year,
compared with £10.8m in 2006.
Other expenses of £1.1m (2006 – £1.0m) comprised
transaction costs of potential and completed investments of 
£0.5m (2006 – £1.0m) and £0.6m of expenses related to the
elective special dividend.
Treasury income and expenses
Gains on money market funds and net finance income, totalling
£3.5m (2006 – £3.5m), reflected the net returns on treasury assets
during the year. The company held net liquidity in term deposits
and money market funds averaging some £100m over the year,
but, for a short period in July and August 2006, had net borrowings
to finance the elective special dividend in advance of the proceeds
from the sale of our stake in Kerzner International. Net finance
income included exchange losses of £0.7m (2006 – £0.1m), 
which arose from holding foreign currency balances.
Dividends
Interim and final dividends
During the year, we paid out dividends of 30.0p per share
(2006 – 28.6p), amounting to £18.5m (2006 – £18.2m),
representing the final dividend for 2006 of 20.5p per share 
and the interim dividend for 2007 of 9.5p per share.
Caledonia maintains a progressive dividend policy and has an
unbroken record of annual dividend increases over the last 40 years.
Elective special dividend
In June 2006, Caledonia offered shareholders the option of
participating in a return of funds of up to £128m by way of an
elective special dividend and associated reduction of capital. 
The dividend for each share elected was 1902.17p, representing 
a discount of 3% to the NAV per share of 1961p on the certification
date of 7 July 2006. The elected shares were subsequently cancelled
for nil consideration. Shareholders elected 5.411m shares, being
84.4% of the total shares eligible, resulting in a total payment 
of £102.9m.
The elective special dividend increased NAV per share for all
shares remaining by 6p, or 0.3%.
Treasury and employee trust shares
Shares held in treasury and held by the employee share trust 
are excluded from the NAV per share calculation.
At 31 March 2007, we held 140,000 shares in treasury, of which
40,000 shares were bought during the year at a cost of £0.8m.
Caledonia operates an employee share trust to hold shares
pending transfer to employees as a result of the exercise of share
options or calling of deferred bonus awards. At 31 March 2007,
703,284 shares were held by the trust, increased from
695,189 shares held at the end of the previous year. During the
year, the trust transferred 56,010 shares to staff on exercise of
share options and bought 64,105 shares. These transactions
resulted in a net payment by the trust of £0.9m.
Share price total return
We measure our longer term performance by comparing our 
share price total return against the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
over five and ten years and also by our absolute share price total
return over rolling five year periods. The total return measure
assumes the re-investment of dividends on the ex-dividend date 
at the closing share price on that date.
Whilst the share price total return provides an accurate 
measure of investors’ returns, it should be noted that it is based 
on the company’s share price, which is not within the company’s
direct control.
Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 11 The chart below shows that shares in Caledonia have produced a
total return to investors of 175% over five years and 303% over ten
years, compared with total returns of 51% and 109% respectively
from the FTSE All-Share – an outperformance of 124% and 194%.
As well as seeking to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return
index over five and ten year periods, the company also aims to
deliver an absolute return on a rolling five year basis. This measure
is illustrated in the following chart.
Over the last 14 years, we have made an absolute return over rolling
five year periods, except for a short period in late March and early
April 2003.
Total expenses ratio
The calculation of our pre-tax total expenses ratio (‘TER’) is based
on our annualised management expenses, divided by closing net
assets. For the purposes of calculating the TER, management
expenses reported in the income statement are adjusted to
expense the fair value of equity rights granted under our deferred
bonus plan in the year to which the award related. This differs from
the accounting treatment, which expenses some of the
entitlements over the three year vesting period.
The effect of this adjustment is to increase reported
management expenses by £0.1m to £11.1m in 2007 and £1.4m 
to £12.2m in 2006. The management expenses of £10.6m in 2005
were not affected.
Deal flow
Our ability to access attractive investment opportunities, through
our extensive network, is crucial to our strategy of being a long
term supportive investor. We measure our deal flow according to
the number of opportunities that have passed our initial screening
process and warrant further investigation as opportunities in which
we might be interested in investing. During the year, we actively
considered 130 new investment opportunities, compared with
125 in 2006.

of £309.5m (2006 – £323.0m) from the realisation of investments
and outflow of £290.4m (2006 – £160.2m) for the purchase of

during the year, short term borrowings were incurred and rose 
to £43.0m in August 2006, to finance in part the elective special
dividend. These borrowing were repaid between July and
September 2006 from the proceeds of planned investment
realisations.
Subsidiary companies of Caledonia had borrowings totalling
£66.0m at 31 March 2007 (2006 – £42.0m) to finance operations.

Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 13 Of these new investments, three totalling £17.2m were made
directly or indirectly in India and one for £1.2m indirectly in China.
This is in line with our strategy of increasing our investment
exposure to these markets. Included in the indirect investments 
in India is our £12.0m investment in Eredene Capital, an AIM listed
company that invests in Indian property. In addition, we made
follow-on investments directly and indirectly in Indian companies 
of £24.7m, including £12.9m in Varun Shipping, the quoted

1. The Kerzner International sale proceeds of £131.0m included £6.0m of forward
currency contract gains.
Of particular note, we sold our remaining 8% holding in Kerzner
International, the NYSE listed resorts owner and operator, to a
management-led investor group for £131.0m, resulting in a
£109.2m gain over residual cost. Kerzner International has realised
a total of £216.0m on an investment costing £43.0m, giving an IRR
of 15.2% over the 13 years we had been invested.
We sold most of our holding in Savills, the UK listed property
agency, in the year, and the balance of our holding at the beginning
of April 2007. Overall, this investment yielded an IRR of 43.9% over
the 5 years we had been invested.
Analysis
The chart below analyses the investment portfolio by business
sector. Over the year, there has been a shift in the composition of
our portfolio from consumer, with the realisation of our holding in
Kerzner International, and into oil and gas, with the acquisition of
TGE Gas Engineering and Serica Energy and an increase in our stake
in Melrose Resources.
The chart below shows the analysis by security type. The reduction
in listed equities resulted from the realisation of our holding in
Kerzner International and the increased percentage in loans and
fixed income reflected the structure of recent investments.

Business review
Financial review The analysis by currency of the investment instruments is shown in
the chart below. The principal change over the year was the move
away from the US dollar, due to the sale of our holding in Kerzner
International and the increase in pounds sterling as the proceeds
from Kerzner International were converted and most of the year’s
investments were sterling denominated.
The chart below analyses the investment portfolio value by the 
age of investments, measured from the date of initial investment.
The value of investments held for over 7 years has reduced as a
result of the realisation of our holding in Kerzner International. 
This has been replaced by new investments.
As at 31 March 2007, the weighted average age of the investment
portfolio, measured from the date of initial investment, was
8.4 years (2006 – 9.3 years).
The chart below analyses the investment portfolio value by
geographical region, based on the country of domicile and the
underlying spread of investments in funds. Over the year, there 
has been a reduction in our North American interests, with the
realisation of our holding in Kerzner International, an increase 
in Europe, with new investments in Ermitage and TGE Gas
Engineering, and an increase in our Asian interests, in line with 
our strategy of increasing our exposure in this region.

Business review
Financial review Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 17
Caledonia’s investment style and
philosophy differentiates us from 
both mainstream equity investors 
and traditional fund managers. 
We use our capital, allied to our
experience and reputation, to back
and support management teams 
to develop their businesses, whether
as listed or private companies. This
flexible approach, together with our
long term investment horizon and
supportive stance, are the hallmarks
of Caledonia and, as the following
business highlights of the year
illustrate, can generate good returns
and create interesting investment
opportunities.
Kerzner International
The year started with the announcement, in April, of a management-
led buyout of Kerzner International, the worldwide hotel and casino
operator in which we held a residual 8% stake. Our original
investment was made in 1994, when we backed Sol Kerzner, the
founder of Sun International, in his acquisition and development of
Paradise Island in the Caribbean as a world class destination resort.
Sun International was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996
and later changed its name to Kerzner International. Throughout our
period of ownership we were represented on the board. We were
therefore able to play a pivotal role in the evaluation and eventual
success of the MBO approach and work with the various parties to
ensure a realisation of our second biggest investment at an attractive
valuation of £131m thus realising over the years some £216m from 
a gross investment of £43m. This brought a long and productive
association with Sol Kerzner, the founder, to a fruitful conclusion.
Business highlights 18 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Business review
Business highlights
Ermitage TGE Gas Engineering
In May, we completed the management buyout of TGE Gas
Engineering, a German based turn-key engineering business,
investing £8.4m for a 49.9% stake. The business was acquired from
Tractebel Engineering, part of the Suez Group, to whom it had
become non-core. We were attracted by the quality of the
management team, who have spent twenty years together building
the business, and by the growth prospects for energy infrastructure
investment that will drive TGE’s performance. Our focus on
relationships, long term perspective and experience with mid-size
companies were key attractions of Caledonia to both management
and the vendor. Since investment we have provided a further £10.8m
to support the growth of the business.
In May, we invested £22.1m for a 60% stake in Ermitage, a 
well-established Jersey-based hedge fund management business.
Ermitage had been put up for sale by its South African parent 
but, with an existing agreed sale stalled, we were able to offer 
the vendors an alternative transaction. This was achieved through
quickly establishing a good rapport with the management who
recognised our credentials and track record in backing successful
asset managers. We have already helped the development of the
business, which manages $2.8bn, through providing additional
capital to invest in funds managed by Ermitage.
Since making our investment, Ermitage has been successful 
in winning a $120m contract from one of the world’s largest 
pension funds.
Caledonia’s approach and reputation delivers
results to both vendors and management teams
through investment in ‘people businesses’. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 19
Celerant Incisive Media
Another management-led buyout, which also completed in May,
was our acquisition of a 49% stake in Celerant Consulting at a total
cost of £15.9m. Celerant is a global management consulting
business which specialises in delivering operational efficiencies 
and savings to its worldwide clients, especially in the chemical and
energy sectors. Celerant was sold as a non-core asset by Novell, a
US listed software services group, which was keen to ensure that
the transaction proceeded at an acceptable price but with a high
degree of certainty. Caledonia was attractive to the management 
as a long term partner and we were able to reassure Novell that we
could complete the transaction with certainty at the agreed price.
In December, Incisive Media plc, a UK listed business publisher, 
was taken private through a management buyout financed by 
Apax Partners. Having first invested in Incisive Media in April 2004,
we were keen to continue to back the management team as we
shared their view that it would be better to grow the business
through acquisitions as a private equity backed company with the
benefit of higher gearing. We therefore worked with the company,
management and the bidder, together with their advisers, to ensure
that all Incisive Media shareholders were offered an opportunity 
to roll over their investment through a share alternative offered 
by the acquiring vehicle. We are delighted to continue, alongside
Apax and management, as an investor in Incisive Media with board
representation and look forward to the opportunity to put more
capital to work in the business as it makes further acquisitions.
Two such acquisitions have already been completed since December.
Caledonia can invest in both listed and private
companies but above all backs management to
grow their businesses. Our longer term view
means that it is not necessary to promote an
IPO, trade sale or public to private transaction as
an ‘exit’ before this optimises shareholder value. 20 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Business review
Business highlights
Begbies Traynor Polar Capital
Where we have originally backed a business and its management
team as a private company our permanent capital base and
flexibility do not oblige us to predetermine an IPO as a required
exit. An excellent example of this is Polar Capital, a fund
management business in which we were founder shareholders in
2001, providing assistance for the management team in
establishing the company and using our capital over the following
years to provide ‘seeding’ for a number of Polar Capital’s hedge and
equity funds. We have worked closely with management ever since
to facilitate an ownership structure and entrepreneurial culture
which enabled them to attract top quality fund managers to
expand their business which now manages over $3bn of assets. The
culmination of this stage in Polar Capital’s development was its
successful flotation on AIM in February which placed a value on our
16.8% holding of £20.3m (compared to our equity investment cost
of £0.7m). We continue to have board representation in the listed
company and remain as convinced as we have been from the start
of the long term potential of Polar Capital’s business.
In March 2007, we invested £1 1.4m for a 9.3% stake in Begbies
Traynor plc, the AIM listed UK corporate insolvency and recovery
specialists. We first met the management team, who founded the
business and are major shareholders, in 2006. We were impressed
by their achievements and business model and spent time
developing our understanding of the company’s management and
business. We were pleased to be able to provide a cornerstone
investment in a £22.0m equity placing and look forward to
supporting the development of this successful business.
Caledonia also backs listed companies seeking
cornerstone investors in equity fundraisings. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 21
We believe that Caledonia’s
investment model, which seeks to
identify good management teams 
and develop strong long term
relationships, is particularly well 
suited to the growing markets of India
and China. In both countries we have,
over recent years, been working with
local partners to identify companies,
usually with high levels of family or
management ownership, which are
receptive to this approach. We are
building up our investment exposure
and experience in a controlled way
which also addresses the inherent
risks of investing in commercial
environments which are less well
developed than the UK and other
industrialised economies.
India
We now have Indian investments totalling £71.8m. During the 
year, we increased our investment in three India listed companies
and provided cornerstone funding to two AIM listed funds 
investing in India.
Our India listed investments include Alok Industries, a textile
manufacturer in which we hold a 14.9% stake valued at £17.0m,
Varun Shipping, a shipping company transporting LPG, crude oil
and petroleum products in which we hold an 11.1% stake valued at
£9.6m, and Dewan Housing Finance, a provider of housing finance

Business review
Business highlights
Vietnam China
In China, we have invested or committed £13.6m. We are a
significant strategic investor in a Shanghai-based growth capital
private equity fund, Capital Today, where we helped an experienced
team establish their first fund with a £10.2m cornerstone
investment commitment, of which £1.2m was drawn at the year
end. We also invested £3.4m in 2005 in a private textile company,
Kingdom Group, which is one of the world’s leading producers of
linen yarn. Kingdom Group was floated on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange in December 2006 and we have retained our investment,
now worth £8.0m, through a 10.7% stake in the listed company.
More recently we have been researching investment opportunities
in Vietnam, working closely with local business advisors. Principal risks and uncertainties
Caledonia has a risk management framework that provides a
structured process for identifying, assessing and managing risks
associated with the company’s business objectives and strategy.
External risk
External risks arise from political, legal, regulatory and economic
changes. Failure to comply with regulations could result in the
company losing its listing and/or being subjected to UK 
corporation tax on its capital gains.
The company seeks to operate within applicable legal and
regulatory frameworks. A compliance committee meets weekly 
and reviews Caledonia’s current business for regulatory compliance,
as well as considering investment proposals from a compliance
perspective. The board receives and reviews regular reports on the
controls in place to prevent non-compliance of the company with
rules and regulations.
Strategic risk
Strategic risks arise from the concept, design and implementation
of the company’s business model and key decisions on investment
levels and capital allocations. An inappropriate investment strategy
could result in poor returns for shareholders. The board reviews
strategy periodically.
Investment risk
Investment risk occurs in respect of specific investment decisions,
subsequent performance of an investment or concentration of
exposure to an economic sector or geographical region.
In addition to financial, legal and market due diligence,
Caledonia’s investment appraisal includes a rigorous assessment 
of investee management’s track record of success and commitment
to growing their business. All potential investments are presented
to Caledonia’s investment management committee, which
comprises executive directors and other senior managers, and
meets weekly. Any individual investment of £20m or more requires
board approval.
Having made the investment decision, a process is put in 
place for managing the relationship with the investee company 
for the period through to realisation. This will usually include board
representation by a Caledonia investment executive. The executive
will make regular reports to the investment management
committee on issues relevant to the investments for which he 
or she is responsible and there is a process of cyclical reporting 
to the board.
Caledonia invests in a range of economic sectors and
geographical regions. The portfolio is monitored monthly 
against board approved guidelines to ensure that there is no 
undue exposure.
Treasury and funding risk
Treasury risks principally comprise counterparty risk, uncertainty
in market prices and rates and the requirement to access adequate
funds to meet investment needs or other obligations as they
fall due.
The main funding risks faced by Caledonia are interest rate risk
and exchange rate risk. The level of these risks is addressed by 
the overall funding objective and the board regularly reviews and
approves policies on the approach to each of these risks.
Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 23
Risks and uncertainties Caledonia’s foreign exchange risk management policy allows 
for exposure to structural and transactional currency movements.
In the event that there is an exit plan for a foreign currency
denominated investment, a view will be taken of likely currency
movements over the period to expected exit and part or all of the
exposure may be hedged using foreign currency contracts or
currency derivatives.
The exposure to interest rate movements on treasury assets 
is managed through the use of term deposits and money market
funds. Where there are group borrowings, exposure to interest 
rate movements is managed through the use of derivatives, such 
as caps and collars where appropriate.
Counterparty risk is managed through an approved list of
counterparties with maximum aggregate exposures agreed 
by the board.
Day-to-day management of treasury activities is delegated to
executive directors and to the Group Treasurer. A detailed report 
on liquid assets and cash flow projections is submitted to the
investment management committee on a weekly basis. Monthly
reports on Caledonia’s funding position and cash flow forecasts 
are considered by the board.
Operational risk
Operational risk arises from potentially inadequate or failed
processes, people and systems or from external factors.
Inadequate or failed processes could result in the
misappropriation of assets, loss of income and debtor receipts 
and mis-reporting of NAV per share. The board regularly reviews
statements on internal controls and procedures and subjects 
the books and records of the company to an annual audit.
The ability to recruit, develop and retain capable people is of
fundamental importance to Caledonia’s strategy and the loss 
of key staff could adversely affect investment returns. The company
operates in a competitive industry and aims to remunerate staff 
in line with market practice, to provide development opportunities
and to encourage staff motivation and retention.
A business continuity strategy is in place to ensure that
operations can continue in the event of disruption. This strategy 
has been assessed against a detailed business impact analysis 
and is regularly tested.

Group companies are encouraged to develop their own consultative
policies. These include regular meetings held between local management
and employees to allow a free flow of information and ideas.
The group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment 
from disabled persons, having regard to their aptitudes and abilities, and
group companies make every effort to treat disabled persons equally with
others. Where existing employees become disabled, it is the group’s policy
to provide continuing employment under normal terms and conditions and
to provide training and career development and promotion to disabled
employees wherever appropriate.
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the terms of
payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. The group will abide
by those terms provided that it is satisfied that the supplier has provided
the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.
The group does not follow any code or statement on payment practice and
Caledonia itself does not have any trade payables.
Charitable donations
Group companies support chosen community and charitable causes local
to their areas of operation. Overall, the group made charitable donations
during the year amounting to £181,000.
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the company and the group have adequate
resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the ‘going concern’ basis for preparing the
financial statements.
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc resigned as the company’s auditors on 20 November 2006
following a tender process conducted by Caledonia’s Audit Committee.
Deloitte & Touche LLP were appointed by the directors to fill the casual
vacancy and a resolution for their appointment as auditors of the company
will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
A description of how the Audit Committee ensures the objectivity and
independence of the auditors is set out on page 55 within the corporate
governance report.
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’
report confirm that, so far as each is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditors are unaware and each
director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to
make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that
the company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the
financial statements. The directors are required to prepare financial
statements for the group in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and have also elected to prepare financial
statements for the company in accordance with IFRS. Company law
requires the directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance
with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements 
present fairly for each financial year the company’s financial position,
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions 
in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets,
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors will also be
required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements of IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the
preparation of the directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report 
in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions. 30 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Independent Auditors’ report
to the members of Caledonia Investments plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’) of Caledonia Investments plc for the year ended
31 March 2007 which comprise the group and parent company income
statements, the group and parent company balance sheets, the group and
parent company cash flow statements, the group and parent company
statements of recognised income and expenses, and the related notes
1 to 33. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information
in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the
directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)
as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a 
true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is
consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the
directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the
business review that is cross referenced from the principal activities and
results section of the directors’ report.
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described 
in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group’s and
the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of the group’s
and the parent company’s profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the 
financial statements.

Accounting policies
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company domiciled in 
the United Kingdom and incorporated in England, under the Companies
Acts 1908 to 1917. The address of its registered office is Cayzer House, 
30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN. The ordinary shares of the company
are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the New Zealand Exchange.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
Caledonia operates.
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 
30 May 2007. At the date of authorisation of these financial statements,
the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied
in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and the related amendments 
to IAS 1 on capital disclosures.
• IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’.
• IFRIC 9 ‘Re-assessment of embedded derivatives’.
• IFRIC 10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’.
• IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Agreements’.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and
Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the
financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures in capital
and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury share transactions’ was adopted in
the year and has resulted in a change in the accounting policy for
share-based payments. The interpretation provides additional guidance,
where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to equity instruments
of its parent as consideration for the services provided to the subsidiary,
IFRIC 11 requires the subsidiary to recognise the expense as an equity
settled share-based payment transaction, with a corresponding increase
recognised in equity representing a contribution from the parent.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted for use in
the EU and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4
of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and its predecessor body
as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) and its predecessor body.
Caledonia is an investment trust company. However, because it holds
majority stakes and therefore has the power to control, it is required to
prepare group accounts that consolidate the results of such investments.
In order to present information that is comparable with other investment
trust companies, Caledonia also publishes financial statements of the
company, which include investments in subsidiaries regarded as part 
of the company’s investing business at fair value.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis,
except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and properties.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Comparatives
Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to
changes in presentation in the current year. In particular, the comparatives 
have been adjusted to take into account the reclassification of money
market gains, treasury interest and exchange movements as finance costs.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated
to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the
balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are
recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to the
functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair
value was determined.
Assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are measured using
their functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic
environment in which they operate.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange
rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the
group’s foreign exchange translation reserve. Such exchange differences
are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the
operation is sold.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and
translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a
purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require
delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market
concerned, and are initially measured at cost, excluding transaction costs.
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing in financial
assets are designated as measured at fair value through profit and loss in
both the consolidated financial statements and the company financial
statements. Other investments held by subsidiaries are designated as
available for sale in the consolidated financial statements. Other
investments in subsidiaries held by the company are accounted for at cost
in the financial statements of the company.
Investments designated as held at fair value through profit or loss or as
available for sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the value of investments
designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, including foreign
exchange movements, are included in net profit or loss for the period. For
available for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value are recognised directly in equity until the investment is disposed of 
or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the
period. If, in the subsequent period, the fair value of the available for sale
investments, for which impairment was previously recognised, increases 
in value, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Quoted investments are valued at bid price or the last traded price when a
bid price is not available. Unquoted investments are valued using recognised
valuation methodologies, based on the International Private Equity and
Venture Capital Guidelines, which reflect the amount for which an asset
could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arm’s
length basis. The portfolio valuation methodology is detailed on page 57.
The full amount of distributions from investment limited partnerships is
treated as disposal proceeds. Any surplus distributions after repaying any
partner’s loans are set off against previously recognised net income before
being treated as realised gains.
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue when the
shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established, normally the
ex-dividend date. Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends
receivable on or before the period end are treated as revenue for the
period. Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities, loans and non-equity shares are
recognised on an effective interest rate basis, which is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
For trading subsidiaries, revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of
goods and services, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and after
eliminating sales within the group. Sales of goods are recognised when
goods are delivered and title has passed. Sales of services are recognised in
the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to
completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual
service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
The company’s share of net income receivable by investment limited
partnerships is recognised as revenue for the period on an accrual basis.
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. Expenses of acquisition 
of an investment designated as held at fair value through profit or loss or
expenses of an aborted acquisition of an investment are presented as
transaction costs and expenses of disposal of an investment are deducted 
from the disposal proceeds.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 35
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using
tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Investment trusts which have approval as such
under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not
liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to
be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are appropriately
authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity. For interim
dividends, this will normally mean the date on which they are paid and, for
final dividends, the date on which they are approved in general meeting.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged
as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial
gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the income statement and are presented in
the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits
are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over
the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted
for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in
future contributions to the plan.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and
profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit
attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The
group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there 
is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date 
of grant and the fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to the equity
instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided to the
subsidiary, the subsidiary recognises an equity settled share-based payment
transaction expense with a corresponding increase recognised in equity
representing a contribution from the parent.
An employee share trust is used for distributing option shares and deferred
bonus awards to employees under Caledonia’s share remuneration
schemes. The trustee purchases shares with money lent interest free by
Caledonia and transfers shares to participating employees on receipt of the
requisite consideration or calling of awards.
The transactions the employee share trust undertakes are considered to be
performed by the trust as an agent for Caledonia. The transactions of the
employee share trust are included in the separate financial statements of
the parent company and, following the requirements of SIC 12, in the
consolidated financial statements as if they arose in that company. Own
shares held by the employee share trust as at the balance sheet date are
accounted for as if they were treasury shares.
National Insurance on share option scheme gains and deferred bonus awards
National Insurance contributions payable on the exercise of certain
employee share options at the date of exercise and deferred bonus awards
at the date of call have been charged as an expense spread over the
respective vesting periods. The charge is based on the difference between
the market value of the underlying shares at the balance sheet date and the
exercise price for share options or nil for deferred bonus awards and
calculated at the latest enacted National Insurance contributions rate.
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve, which it is prohibited from
distributing by virtue of its articles of association. The following items are
transferred into the capital reserve from profit or loss:
• Gains and losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
• Gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value of
investments.
• Expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation to the capital
transactions.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land 
or properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using
the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Property 25-40 years
Plant 10-15 years
Equipment 3-8 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful 
lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of
the relevant lease.
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as
the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Investment property
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for
capital appreciation, is stated at its fair value at the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment
property are included in the income statement for the period in which
they arise.
Intangible assets
Brands, trademarks, computer software and customer relationships
Brands, trademarks, computer software and customer relationships
acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. Where such items are not deemed to have an
indefinite life, amortisation is expensed on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of
acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly
controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and 
is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit
or loss on disposal.
Impairment of assets
At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its
tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, if any. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, intangible
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their 36 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Accounting policies
present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the first-in, first-out
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing,
selling and distribution.
Properties that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business or are
being developed for future sale are classified as inventories.
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value
as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are
short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes
in value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted
for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. The effective
interest method allocates the interest expense over the life of the instrument
so as to reflect a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Borrowings include a component of the company’s deferred ordinary
shares and preference shares in subsidiaries held by third parties that fall
under the definition of financial liabilities under IAS 32.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the company has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and
are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis
over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis.
Lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their
fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments,
each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to
the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating
lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs.
Where any group company and the Caledonia Investments plc Employee
Share Trust purchases the company’s equity share capital or the company
buys shares into treasury, the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from
equity attributable to the company’s equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or transferred. Where such shares are subsequently transferred,
any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity
attributable to the company’s equity holders.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered
into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Hedge accounting is not applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged
either in providing products or services (business segment), or in providing
products or services within a particular economic environment
(geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are
different from those of other segments.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
the company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries)
made up to the balance sheet date. Control is achieved where the company
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee
entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of a subsidiary are measured at fair values at the date of acquisition. Any
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired
(i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the
period of acquisition. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the
minority’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities
recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest
in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of
the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are
included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used 
by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise
significant influence, but not control or joint control, through the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee entity.
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its investments held in
associates are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, the
provisions of IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ do not apply. Such
investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.
No other group company held investments in associates.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties
undertake an economic activity that is the subject of joint control.
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its interests in joint
ventures are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, the
provisions of IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ do not apply. Such interests
are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or
loss in the period in which they occur. However, the provisions of IAS 31 do
apply to interests in joint ventures held by other companies in the group, as
set out below.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures held by subsidiaries
are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting, except when classified as held for sale. Interests in joint
ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-
acquisition changes in the group’s share of net assets of the joint ventures,
less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of the
joint ventures in excess of the group’s interest in those joint ventures are
not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the fair
values of the identifiable net assets of the joint ventures at the date of
acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of
acquisition below the group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable
net assets at the date of acquisition is credited in profit or loss in the 
period of acquisition.
Where a group company transacts with joint ventures of the group, 
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest 
in the relevant joint ventures. Losses may provide evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision 
is made for impairment. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 37

the unit has been determined on the basis of the fair value less costs to sell
based on recent forecasts from the unit management’s business plan and
comparable market transactions. 40 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007

The carrying amount of investment property was the fair value of the
property as determined by the directors of the company. In 2006, a registered
independent appraiser, having an appropriate recognised professional
qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the
property being valued, performed the valuation. Fair values were
determined having regard to recent market transactions for similar
properties in the same location as the group’s investment property.
Investment property comprised a commercial property that was leased out
for £0.3m per annum over a five year period and land let out for £0.2m per
annum over a five year period.

Share-based payments
The company currently has three executive share option schemes, an
original scheme established in 1988, a 1998 scheme and a 2005 scheme.
These schemes entitle senior employees to purchase shares in the company
at the market price of the shares at the date of grant and on similar terms,
subject to service and company performance criteria. Under the terms of
the schemes, options may be exercised between three and ten years after
the date of grant, although only one-third of the options may be exercised
after three years from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming
exercisable six years after grant. A number of grants have been made under
these schemes.
In addition, the company has special option arrangements for Mr Ingram 
and Mr May. The terms of grants under these arrangements are similar to 
those for options granted under the 1998 scheme other than in respect of 
the performance retesting criteria. Details of these options are set out in
the directors’ remuneration report on page 53.
The company also has a deferred bonus plan under which senior employees
compulsorily defer part of their annual bonus, being any bonus in excess of
50% of their basic salary for the bonus year, into shares and may voluntarily
defer up to 50% of their remaining cash bonus into shares. The company
will match the number of shares comprised in the voluntary deferral,
subject to service and company performance criteria.
Notes to the financial statements The terms and conditions of the grants outstanding as at 31 March 2007

The options outstanding at 31 March 2007 have an exercise price in the range
of 722.5p to 1878p and a weighted average contractual life of 10 years.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are
measured indirectly, by reference to the fair value of share options granted. 
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on 
the Hull-White Employee Stock Option Valuation lattice model. This takes
account of the impact of future events, such as early exercise by employees 
and employee exit rates after vesting. Also, the Hull-White model defines
the conditions under which employees are expected to exercise their
options after vesting in terms of the share price reaching a certain multiple
of the exercise price.
The weighted average fair value at the measurement date of share options
granted during the year and parameters used to derive the fair value were
as follows:
Senior Senior
employees employees
2007 2006
Fair value at measurement date 496p 264p
Share price 1878p 1580p
Exercise price 1878p 1580p

Exercise multiple 2.0 2.0
Expected dividends 1.9% 2.1%
Risk-free interest rate 
(based on national government bonds) 4.6% 4.2%
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility, calculated 
as the average volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the 
share options.
Share options are granted under a service condition and non-market
performance conditions. Such conditions are not taken into account in the
grant date fair value measurement of the services received. There are no
market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The fair value of services received in return for deferred share awards were
measured directly, by reference to the fair value of services received during
the period. This was based on the amount of annual bonus that was
compulsorily and voluntarily deferred in accordance with the rules of the
company’s deferred bonus plan.

Notes to the financial statements
21. Financial instruments
The group’s financial instruments comprise securities and other
investments, cash balances, borrowings and receivables and payables that
arise from its operations. The group’s investment portfolio includes listed
and unlisted equity investments, debt instruments and investments in
other funds that are intended to be held for the long term.
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed are market
risk and credit risk.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at the
balance sheet date and the risk management policies employed are
discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes
currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk.
The group’s strategy on the management of market risk is driven by its
investment objective, which is to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total
Return index over five and ten years and to achieve consistently a positive
return over rolling five year periods. The group invests in a range of
investments, including listed and unlisted equity securities, debt
instruments and non-equity investment funds in a range of sectors
and regions.
The board monitors the group’s investment exposure against internally 
set guidelines specifying the maximum proportion of total assets that 
may be invested in various sectors and regions. The board also reviews the
position, prospects and exit strategy for all substantial investments at least
once a year, on a cyclical basis.
Details of the group’s investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are
disclosed in the table of significant investments set out on pages 58 and
59. Individual investments in debt and equity instruments are
disclosed separately.
Currency risk
The group may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions
denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.
Consequently, the group is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its
functional currency may change relative to other currencies in a manner
that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
The group’s policy is not to enter into any structural currency hedging
transactions. However, when a decision is taken to realise a currency
denominated investment, derivatives may be used to hedge against
currency fluctuations to the expected date of realisation, depending on the
directors’ view of the likely movement in the exchange rate to anticipated
disposal. The policy has not changed over the year.
The total net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date was as follows:

Canadian dollar 1.9 3.5 1.9 3.5
Australian dollar – – 1.4 1.8
196.1 268.4 184.6 303.8
Interest rate risk
The majority of the group’s financial assets are non-interest bearing.
Interest-bearing financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities
mature or reprice in the short term, no longer than twelve months. As a
result, the group is subject to limited exposure to fair value interest rate risk
due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates. Any
excess cash and cash equivalents of the group are invested in term deposits
with the term to maturity of up to three months and money market funds.
Investments in debt securities are fixed rate instruments with the term to
maturity of up to five years. The maturity dates of the fixed income
instruments correspond to their repricing dates.

Price risk
Price risk is risk that the value of an instrument will fluctuate as a result 
of changes in market prices, whether caused by factors specific to an
individual investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments 
traded in the market.
As the majority of the company’s financial instruments are held at fair value
with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes in
market conditions will directly affect net investment income.
Price risk is mitigated by constructing a diversified portfolio of instruments
traded on various markets and direct involvement in the management of the
investment portfolio.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to
discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the
group. The group has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is
monitored on an ongoing basis.
At 31 March 2007, the financial assets exposed to credit risk were as follows:
Company Group
2007 2006 2007 2006
£m £m £m £m 
Investments in debt instruments 92.8 56.5 63.0 31.6

Cash and cash equivalents 108.6 103.8 123.2 164.7
207.9 240.3 215.5 299.9
The group invests in debt instruments as part of its investing activities. Prior 
to making investments, management has in place a process of review that,
amongst other things, evaluates a potential investee’s ability to service and
repay its debt. 
Notes to the financial statements Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 45
Management reviews the financial position of investee companies, including
their continuing ability to service and repay debt, on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables is mitigated
by performing credit evaluations on major customers.
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash equivalents 
is mitigated by spreading investments and deposits across a number of
investment grade banks with a credit rating of ‘AA3’ or better as
determined by Moody’s rating agency. The company receives a monthly
rating update, and relevant credit risks are reviewed accordingly.
All transactions in listed securities are settled on delivery using approved
brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal, as delivery of securities
sold is only made once the broker has received payment. Payment is made
on a purchase once the securities have been received by the broker. The
trade will fail if either party fails to meet their obligation.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk to counterparties 
at 31 March 2007.
Fair value
Most of the group’s financial instruments are held at fair value on the balance
sheet. Usually, the fair value of the financial instruments can be reliably
determined within a reasonable range of estimates. For certain other financial
instruments, specifically operating and other receivables and payables, the
carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the immediate or short term
nature of these financial instruments.
The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value 
of investments are disclosed on page 57.

Balance at the period end 58,795 64,206 8,000 8,000
The company has also issued share options and made deferred bonus
awards (note 19).
As at 31 March 2007, the authorised share capital of the company
comprised 107,181,309 ordinary shares (2006 – 112,592,324) and
8,000,000 (2006 – 8,000,000) deferred ordinary shares. The ordinary 
and deferred ordinary shares have a par value of 5p.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as
declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at
meetings of the company. In respect of the company’s shares that are 
held by the group, all voting rights are suspended.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not redeemable. 
They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference dividend of 1% per
annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the nominal value of such
deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or £4,000 in aggregate, for
all such shares currently in issue. The company is required to pay the dividend
to the extent that it has distributable profits. On a winding-up or other return
of capital, the deferred ordinary shares carry the right to the payment of the
amount paid up on such shares only after holders of the ordinary shares have
received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each such ordinary share. All of
the deferred ordinary shares are held by Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
These shares are considered compound financial instruments under IAS 32 and 
are required to be separated into a debt and an equity component. The debt
component, a perpetual debt, represents the present value of the fixed
cumulative dividend of 1% per annum calculated on the date the deferred
ordinary shares were issued. This component of the deferred ordinary
shares has been classified as non-current liabilities in the financial
statements of the company. The fixed cumulative dividend has been
reclassified from dividend to interest expense in the income statement 
of the financial statements of the company.
By a special resolution of the company passed on 26 June 2006 and
confirmed by an order of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales
dated 12 July 2006, the authorised and issued share capital of the company 
was reduced by £270,551, being the nominal amount of the 5,411,015 
ordinary shares on which shareholders elected to receive the special dividend
referred to in note 6, which were then cancelled.
Authority to purchase own shares
At an extraordinary general meeting held on 26 June 2006, the company
obtained shareholders’ approval for the renewal of its authority to make
market purchases of up to 6,410,500 of its own ordinary shares, being
approximately 10% of the ordinary share capital then in issue (excluding
shares held in treasury), at a price not more than the higher of: (a) 5%
greater than the average of the middle market quotations for such ordinary
shares during the five business days preceding any such purchase; and (b)
the higher of: (i) the price of the last independent trade in such ordinary
shares; and (ii) the highest current independent bid relating thereto on the
trading venues where the purchase is carried out, nor less than 5 pence,
being the nominal value of an ordinary share.
The authority expires on 1 January 2008 or, if earlier, at the conclusion 
of the next annual general meeting.
On the same date, shareholders who were not members of the Cayzer
family concert party (‘Cayzer Concert Party’) gave their approval for a waiver
by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the obligation that could arise on
the Cayzer Concert Party under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and
Mergers to make a general offer for Caledonia on the implementation by the
company of the above authority to purchase its own shares. The approval
was subject to the maximum percentage of voting rights of shares held by
the Cayzer Concert Party not exceeding 49.9% of the total voting rights of
the ordinary share capital of the company as a result of purchases by the
company. This waiver expires on 26 June 2007.
Pursuant to the above authority, the company purchased 40,000 of its
ordinary shares into treasury during the year, taking the total number of
ordinary shares held in treasury at 31 March 2007 to 140,000. Since the
year end, the company has purchased a further 30,000 ordinary shares
into treasury.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve comprises the nominal value of those
shares purchased by the company out of its own profits and cancelled. 
At 31 March 2007, the capital redemption reserve was £1.2m (2006 
and 2005 – £1.2m). There was no movement in the capital redemption
reserve in the current or prior years.

The foreign exchange translation reserve comprised all foreign exchange
differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of
foreign operations that were not integral to the operations of the group, 
as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the group’s net
investment in a foreign subsidiary.
The fair value reserve for available for sale investments included the
cumulative net change in fair value of available for sale investments until
the investment is derecognised. 
23. Acquisition of subsidiaries
On the 23 May 2006, the Group acquired 60% of the issued share capital 
of Ermitage Ltd for cash consideration of £22.1m. Ermitage Ltd is the
parent company of a group of companies involved in hedge fund
management. This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase
method of accounting. The book value of net assets acquired equates 
to fair value.

Ermitage Ltd and subsidiaries contributed £14.3m to the group’s revenue 
and £4.6m to the group’s profit before tax for the period between the date 
of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
Ermitage Ltd acquired the hedge fund operations from Liberty Group
Limited as part of a management buyout, concurrent with the investment
by Caledonia, consequently group revenues and profits attributable to
equity holders would have been the same as those reported in the primary
statements for the financial year had the acquisition been completed on
the first day of the financial year.

33. Accounting estimates and judgments
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Fair values of financial instruments
Many of the group’s financial instruments are measured at fair value on the
balance sheet and it is usually possible to determine their fair values within 
a reasonable range of estimates.
For the majority of the group’s financial instruments, quoted market prices 
are readily available. However, certain financial instruments, such as
unquoted securities, are fair valued using valuation techniques, including
reference to the current fair values of instruments that are substantially the
same (subject to the appropriate adjustments).
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on market
conditions and information about the financial instrument. These estimates 
are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgement (e.g. interest rates, volatility, estimated cash flows, etc) and
therefore cannot be determined with precision.
Notes to the financial statements Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 49
Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared to comply with the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’). The tables included in the
statements below on directors’ remuneration, pensions, share options and
deferred share awards have been audited.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a standing committee of the board 
whose members throughout the year were Mr M E T Davies (chairman),
Mr C M Allen-Jones and Mr J R H Loudon.
The Committee, whose written terms of reference are published on the
company’s website and are available on request from the company
secretary, has been established for the following purposes:
• To determine and agree with the board the framework and broad policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and such other
members of the executive management as it is requested by the board
to consider and to review the on-going appropriateness and relevance
of the remuneration policy.
• To approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance
related pay schemes operated by the company and to approve the total
annual payments made under such schemes.
• To review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the
board and shareholders and, for any such plans, to determine each 
year whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such
awards, the individual awards to executive directors and other senior
executives and the performance targets to be used.
• Within the terms of the agreed policy, to determine the total individual
remuneration packages of each executive director (and, if requested 
by the board, other senior executives) including, where appropriate,
bonuses, incentive payments, share options and other awards.
• To determine the policy for and scope of pension arrangements, 
service agreements, termination payments and compensation
commitments for executive directors and, if requested by the board,
other senior executives.
• To review and assess annually the remuneration trends across 
the company.
References to executive directors also include the chairman.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from
Towers Perrin, independent remuneration consultants appointed by the
Committee, who assessed the comparability of senior executive
remuneration packages with the market place for the purpose of setting
executive directors’ salaries for the year commencing 1 April 2007. In
addition, the Remuneration Committee received advice from Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer in relation to the company’s executive share option
scheme and deferred bonus plan. Towers Perrin only advised in relation to the
remuneration of executive directors and senior management and Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer are the company’s main legal advisers. The Remuneration
Committee also consulted with the chairman, Mr P N Buckley, and the chief
executive, Mr T C W Ingram, in relation to the remuneration of all of the
executive directors, other than their own. Internal support was provided 
to the Remuneration Committee by the company secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Remuneration Committee has adopted a remuneration policy with 
the following objectives:
• Performance related remuneration should seek to align the interests 
of the executive directors with those of the shareholders.
• A significant portion of the executive directors’ remuneration packages
should be linked to the performance of the company.
• Remuneration packages for the executive directors should be
competitive, but not excessive, in terms of market practice in order 
to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the quality 
needed to manage and grow the company successfully.
In determining executive directors’ remuneration, consideration is given to
matters specific to the company such as the performance of its net asset
value, both in absolute terms and as measured against the FTSE All-Share
index, to the experience and performance of individual directors and their
areas of responsibility and to comparable external market remuneration
data and levels of remuneration elsewhere in the company.
It is currently intended that the policy statement set out in this report will apply
for the year to 31 March 2008 and for subsequent years. However, the
Remuneration Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy
needs to be sufficiently flexible and kept under review in order to take account
of future changes in the company’s business environment and in remuneration
practice. Accordingly, the policy may be further amended in future years. Any
changes in policy for financial years after 31 March 2008 will be described in
future directors’ remuneration reports, which will continue to be subject to an
advisory vote of shareholders. All statements in this report in relation to
remuneration policy for years after 31 March 2008 should be read in this light.
Policy on individual components of executive directors’ remuneration
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference 
to the experience and responsibilities of the director concerned and taking
into account external market research. The company’s policy is to pay
salaries and other benefits which are competitive, but not excessive, in
relation to the marketplace. The company provides a range of benefits,
such as cash allowances in lieu of company cars, life insurance, permanent
health insurance and private medical cover.
Bonus
The company operates a discretionary annual bonus scheme for executive
directors, which takes into account both the performance of individual
directors and the performance of the company over the short and medium
term. At the determination of the Remuneration Committee and subject 
to the compulsory deferral provisions of the company’s deferred bonus
plan, bonuses may either be paid in cash or as an employer contribution 
to registered pension schemes.
The maximum potential bonus that may currently be awarded is 100% 
of basic salary, of which a maximum of 50% of basic salary is determined 
by reference to the company’s performance and 50% by reference to
individual performance. The company performance related element of
bonus is determined by reference to the performance of the company’s
net asset value (‘NAV’) per share compared with that of the FTSE All-Share
index over the financial year. Bonus payments commence if the
performance of the company’s NAV per share matches that of the FTSE 
All-Share index, with the maximum entitlement payable if NAV per share
outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by 6% or more. The individual
performance element is measured by reference to performance objectives
set at the start of the financial year. The Remuneration Committee however
retains the discretion to reduce the amount of bonus payable if NAV per
share growth in the financial year is negative and/or NAV per share
outperformance over the relevant financial year is greater than that of the
previous three financial years and, therefore, represents recovery from
previous underperformance. The payment of any such bonus is subject 
to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee may also award bonuses outside the terms of 
the company’s annual bonus scheme. No bonus payments are pensionable.
Deferred bonus plan
The company’s bonus arrangements are also designed to align the interests 
of directors with those of shareholders and to encourage retention by
requiring, in the Remuneration Committee’s absolute discretion, that a
proportion of any bonus paid to a director is compulsorily invested in
shares under the company’s deferred bonus plan. The Remuneration
Committee’s current policy is that any annual bonus paid, the amount of
which is above 50% of a director’s basic salary for the financial year to which
the bonus relates, must be so compulsorily invested.
In addition, the deferred bonus plan entitles directors to convert voluntarily a
proportion of any remaining cash bonus to a conditional entitlement to shares. 
The Remuneration Committee’s current policy is that up to half of any bonus
not subject to compulsory deferral may be voluntarily converted into shares.
The shares so invested are eligible for matching, on a one for one basis, subject
to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a period of three years.
Awards under the deferred bonus plan are not pensionable.
Pensions
The company’s policy on pension provision is to provide a means whereby
executive directors either receive a pension at retirement age from the
company, or are funded to operate their own money purchase pension 
plans or other arrangements. Mr P N Buckley, Mr J H Cartwright and 
The Hon C W Cayzer are members of the Caledonia Pension Scheme,
which is a defined benefits scheme and is contributory for employees
who joined the company after 1 April 1988, but which is now closed to 
new members. The scheme provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final
pensionable salary on retirement dependent on length of service and age
and also provides for dependants’ pensions. All of the executive directors
participating in the scheme, other than Mr J H Cartwright, transferred into
the scheme from The Union-Castle Line Superannuation Scheme which 
was non-contributory, and this status has been preserved. None of 
Messrs T C W Ingram, J M May or W P Wyatt participate in a company
pension scheme (although Mr Wyatt participated in the Caledonia Group
Personal Pension Plan (‘GPPP’) prior to setting up his own personal pension 50 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Directors’ remuneration report
arrangements in October 2006), but instead a fixed percentage of basic
salary is paid into personal pension arrangements or, in the case of Mr May,
as a cash supplement which is reduced by such amount as is necessary to
cover the company’s National Insurance costs. The percentage of basic
salary for the year ended 31 March 2007 was 25% for Mr Ingram and 10%
for Messrs May and Wyatt. Mr J M B Cayzer-Colvin participates in the GPPP,
a defined contribution scheme into which employer contributions of 10% 
of basic salary were made on his behalf. It is the company’s policy that any
future executive directors recruited from outside the company will be
funded to operate their own pension arrangements or offered participation
in a company sponsored defined contribution scheme and that the
company will not offer participation in any defined benefits arrangements.
Share options
A key objective of the company’s remuneration policy is to motivate
executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value. The
Remuneration Committee believes that this is best achieved through the
grant of share options, exercisable only if demanding performance
conditions are met. The grant of options is considered to be a key element
of the remuneration package, alongside annual salary, annual bonus and
the deferred bonus plan.
The maximum value of options that may be granted in any year to a
director is 150% of basic salary. The Remuneration Committee may exceed
this limit for individual directors where it considers it necessary to do so to
secure their appointment, provided that the maximum value that may be
granted in such circumstances shall not exceed 250% of basic salary.
No options are granted at a discount.
Policy on executive directors’ service contracts
It is the policy of the company that no executive director should be offered 
a service contract that cannot be terminated within one year or which
contains provision for predetermined compensation in excess of one year’s total
emoluments. All existing directors’ service contracts comply with this policy.
The Remuneration Committee has regard to compensation commitments
and believes that these are best addressed by restricting the term of the
contract. In the event of a termination, the Remuneration Committee would
consider all the relevant factors and circumstances and seek a just solution.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held by executive
directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold external
non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s business, provided 
that the time commitment required is not material. Normally the company
will retain any fees arising from such non-executive directorships, but may
permit the executive director to retain fees in certain circumstances.
Details of any such fees retained by executive directors are disclosed in the
statement on directors’ remuneration below.
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration and terms of
appointment
It is the company’s policy that non-executive directors should be appointed 
for fixed periods of no more than three years (from the next general
meeting following their initial appointment in the case of new non-
executive directors) and that re-appointment at the end of such periods
should not be automatic. Non-executive directors are paid an annual fee
determined by the board as a whole within the overall limit contained in
the articles of association, but do not receive any other benefits from the
company for their services as non-executive directors. For the year ended
31 March 2007, the basic fee for non-executive directors was £29,000
(2006 – £28,000) and fees of £3,000 (2006 – £3,000) were paid for the
chairmanships of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, with a further
£3,000 (2006 – £3,000) paid to Mr C M Allen-Jones for his role as senior
independent non-executive director and chairman of the Governance
Committee. Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees
agreed by the board where they have performed services that, in the
opinion of the board, are over and above their normal duties.
The company is entitled to terminate a non-executive director’s
appointment at any time without compensation.
Performance graph
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’)
against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index for the five financial
periods ending on 31 March 2007 and has been prepared in accordance
with the Regulations. TSR has been calculated assuming that all dividends
are reinvested on their ex-dividend date. The FTSE All-Share Total Return
index has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company
measures its delivery of shareholder value over the longer term.

2. Deferred shares, forming part of the bonus, comprise the compulsory and voluntary contributions
under the company’s deferred bonus plan and will be satisfied in shares shortly after the
announcement of the company’s preliminary results for the year, as described below.
3. In addition to the total amount for 2006 shown in the table, £50,000 was paid in respect of
Mr Buckley’s bonus award for that year as an employer pension contribution.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, Mr J M May was paid
an amount of £25,931 before tax (2006 – £nil) in lieu of contributions to 
his personal money purchase pension arrangements as described in the
statement on directors’ pensions below. For the year to 31 March 2006,
Mr Ingram was paid an amount of £51,450 before tax in lieu of contributions
to his personal pension arrangements and Mr W P Wyatt was paid an
amount of £3,460 in lieu of contributions to the GPPP, as contributions
brought forward from the previous year were paid into his plan in that year,
which meant that the group was unable to pay the full 10% of his salary into
his plan due to HMRC limits. Certain executive directors also hold external
non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s business, where 
it has been agreed that they may retain the fees arising therefrom. 
Mr T C W Ingram is a non-executive director of Sage Group, for which he
received fees during the year of £48,000 (2006 – £42,477). Mr Ingram was
appointed to the board of Sage Group before he joined Caledonia. Mr May
received a fee from Catapult Venture Managers amounting in the year to
£18,125 (2006 – £4,531). For the year to 31 March 2006, Mr May also
received a fee of £722 from Covenant Healthcare for his services as
chairman until his resignation on 14 April 2005. All of these fees were paid
to a private company owned by Mr May and his wife and both directorships
were held prior to his joining Caledonia.

Compulsory deferred share awards
The shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only vest
(together with an amount equal to the dividends that would have accrued on
those shares) if the director remains an employee of the Caledonia group for 
a three year period commencing on the first day of the financial year in which
the award is made. The vesting of these shares is not subject to a further
performance condition.
Voluntary deferred share awards
The shares comprised in a voluntary deferral are not subject to a
performance condition and will vest (together with an amount equal to the
dividends that would have accrued on those shares) at the earlier of three
years from the first day of the financial year in which the award is made or
the date the director ceases to be an employee of the Caledonia group for
any reason.
Matching share awards
The vesting of the matching shares is dependent on the company’s
performance over a three year period, by reference to two separate
performance conditions. Both performance conditions relate to the
performance of Caledonia’s NAV per share over the three financial years
starting with the year in which the award is made (the ‘Prescribed Period’).
This performance of NAV per share will be compared against different
indices as follows:
• 50% of the matching shares will only vest if NAV per share over the
Prescribed Period outperforms the Retail Prices Index by at least 9%.
• The remaining 50% of the matching shares will only vest if NAV per 
share over the Prescribed Period outperforms the FTSE All-Share 
index by at least 3%.
There will be no retesting of either performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance target if events
occur that would make the amended target a fairer measure of performance
and provided that any amended target is no more difficult to satisfy. The
Remuneration Committee will also have the ability to impose different
performance targets in the future, provided that any targets that are imposed
are no less demanding than those described above. Any such amended or
different performance targets will be described in the directors’ remuneration
report for the relevant year.

1. Except for Mr P N Buckley, the accrued pensions are the amounts which would be paid at normal
retirement age, ignoring any revaluation, if the director had left service at 31 March 2007. 
Mr Buckley reached normal retirement age on 23 September 2004 but has continued in
employment. The amount shown in row (a) for Mr Buckley represents the accrued pension
that would have been paid at 31 March 2007.
2. The increase in accrued pension, net of inflation, in row (c) is calculated by subtracting the pension
accrued to 31 March 2006 multiplied by the increase in the Retail Prices Index for the year to 31 March
2007, from the accrued pension to 31 March 2007. In the case of Mr Buckley, who has not yet drawn
any retirement benefits and remains a deferred pensioner within the scheme, the increase in accrued
pension over the year is made up entirely of increases due to the late payment of his pension.
3. The transfer value shown in row (d) represents the value of the increase in accrued pension during
the year, as set out in row (c), minus director’s contributions.
4. During the year, a part (£50,000) of Mr Buckley’s bonus award for the year ended 31 March 2006
was paid by the company as a contribution into the scheme in order to enhance Mr Buckley’s cash
lump sum benefit on retirement. The total value of such contributions, with interest, was
£265,670 at 31 March 2007 and £199,010 at 31 March 2006. The amounts in rows (a) to (d) do
not include allowance for these contributions. The transfer values set out in rows (e) and (f) do,
however, include the respective values of these contributions.

Directors’ deferred share awards
The deferred bonus column in the table above shows the amount of bonus 
to be compulsorily and voluntarily deferred into shares under the company’s
deferred bonus plan. The number of shares awarded for both the compulsory
and voluntary deferral of bonus is determined by reference to the market
value of a share at the time the award is made, which occurs shortly after the
announcement of the company’s results for the financial year to which the
bonus relates (or following the occurrence of exceptional circumstances
justifying the making of awards). In both cases, the number of shares is set
on a pre-tax basis (as the shares will be subject to income tax and National
Insurance on release). The number of matching shares is equal to the number
of shares awarded in respect of the voluntary deferral of bonus.
Deferred share awards held by directors as at 31 March 2007 are shown 
in the following table. There have been no changes in directors’ deferred
share awards up to the date of this report. 52 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Directors’ remuneration report
5. The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (g) (calculated as row (e) less row (f) and
any director’s contributions) reflects the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the control
of the company and the directors, such as movements in stock markets. These can cause transfer
values at different points in time to fluctuate significantly. Disclosed changes in value may
therefore be subject to a large degree of volatility and may even be negative.
6. The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note ‘GN11’ published
by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
During the year, the company made contributions to a money purchase
personal pension plan for the benefit of Mr T C W Ingram of £105,000 
(2006 – £36,960, together with cash payments in lieu of pension contribution
of £51,450 before tax). As described above, and in accordance with his service
contract, Mr J M May elected to receive his pension entitlement by way of a
cash payment in lieu of pension of £25,931 before tax (2006 – employer
pension contribution of £28,250). Mr J M B Cayzer-Colvin is a member of
the GPPP , a defined contribution scheme into which employer contributions
of £17,000 (2006 – £14,000) were paid during the year on his behalf.
Mr W P Wyatt was a member of the GPPP prior to establishing his own money
purchase pension arrangements in October 2006 into which the company
made employer contributions of £17,000 (2006 – £10,540 and £3,460 before
tax in cash in lieu of pension contributions).

least 2% per annum over the relevant measurement period. If TSR equals
that of the Index, none of that tranche will be exercisable and there will be
proportionate vesting of a tranche if TSR exceeds that of the Index by an
average of between zero and 2% per annum. For the one-third tranche, the
performance measure was to be first applied three years after grant, with
two re-test opportunities four and five years after grant. The performance
target for the one-third tranche was tested on 5 July 2005 and met in full,
since when Mr Ingram has exercised all of the one-third tranche (27,666
shares) in full. For the remaining two-thirds tranche, being the options over
55,334 shares shown in the table above, the performance measure will be
first applied five years after grant, with two re-test opportunities six and
seven years after grant. If Mr Ingram remains in service until retirement at
age 62, the option will remain exercisable until ten years from grant if the
performance conditions are met. Otherwise, Mr Ingram must normally be
in employment to be able to exercise the options. The shares required to
satisfy Mr Ingram’s special options either have been or will be transferred
from the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust. The remaining
terms of the special options are based on the rules of the 1998 scheme,
and include provisions that any benefits obtained from the special options
will not be pensionable and that the terms of the special options will not
normally be capable of amendment to the advantage of the option holder
without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Included in Mr May’s options granted on 20 November 2003 are options 
over 28,000 shares also granted outside the 1998 scheme. The
performance conditions and other terms of these options are the same 
as those set out above for Mr Ingram and the performance target in respect
of the one-third tranche (9,333 shares) has now been met.
As at 31 March 2007, the market price of the company’s shares was 2066p
(2006 – 1980p) and the range during the year was 1720p to 2258p.
Statement on directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’
letters of appointment
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group 
Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details of which
are summarised below:
Name Date of contract Notice period Unexpired term
P N Buckley 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
T C W Ingram 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
J H Cartwright 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
The Hon C W Cayzer 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months

J M May 01.09.03 12 months Rolling 12 months
W P Wyatt 02.06.05 12 months Rolling 12 months
Directors’ service contracts contain provisions whereby the company may
in its discretion terminate the contract without notice and make a payment
in lieu of notice to the director and whereby a liquidated sum is payable by
the company in the event of termination within one year following a
change of control. Any such payment in lieu of notice or liquidated sum
would be equivalent to no more than one year’s total emoluments.
The service contracts of Mr J H Cartwright and The Hon C W Cayzer are also
subject to provisions whereby, in the event of a payment in lieu of notice or
payment of a liquidated sum on termination, the director concerned would
also be entitled to an increase in his pensionable service equivalent to the
unexpired period of notice under his contract.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but are appointed
under letters of appointment which provide for termination without notice
or compensation.
Executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’
appointment letters are available for inspection at the registered office 
of the company.
The directors’ remuneration report was approved by the board on
30 May 2007 and signed on its behalf by:
M E T Davies
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 53
There have been no changes in directors’ options to acquire ordinary shares
up to the date of this report.
The company currently has three executive share option schemes – an
original scheme established in 1988, which expired in April 1998 for the
purposes of new option grants, a 1998 scheme approved by shareholders
in July 1998, under which option grants were made from September 1998
to May 2004, and a scheme approved by shareholders in July 2005, under
which option grants commenced in August 2005.
Under the terms of all of the above schemes, options may be exercised
between three and ten years after the date of grant, although only
one-third of the shares comprised in an option may be exercised after three
years from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable
six years after grant. Options may only be exercised if a performance target
is met.
For options granted from 1996 to 1997 under the original scheme, 
the target requires the company’s adjusted net asset value per share 
to outperform the average of the increases in the FTSE All-Share and the
FT/S&P Actuaries World Pound Sterling indices over any consecutive three
financial years prior to expiry. For options granted from 1998 to 2001
under the 1998 scheme, the target requires the company’s adjusted NAV
per share to outperform either the Retail Prices Index by 3% per annum, 
or the average of the increases in the FTSE 250 and the FT Investment
Companies indices, over any consecutive three financial years prior to
expiry. For options granted in 2002 and 2003, the performance target
requires the company’s adjusted NAV per share to outperform either the
Retail Prices Index by 3% per annum, or the FTSE All-Share index, over any
consecutive three financial years prior to expiry.
For options granted in 2004, the performance target is such that 50% of 
the shares comprised in an option will vest if the company’s NAV per share
outperforms the Retail Prices Index by at least 9% over the relevant
measurement period, with the other 50% vesting if the company’s NAV per
share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index over the relevant measurement
period. The performance measure has to be achieved either over the first
three years, or over the first four years, after the date of grant. If the
performance measure is not achieved four years after the date of grant, 
the options will lapse.
The performance target for the 2005 scheme requires that 50% of the 
shares comprised in an option will vest if NAV per share outperforms the
Retail Prices Index by at least 9% over the measurement period. The other
50% of the shares comprised in the option will vest if NAV per share
outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by at least 3% over the measurement
period. The measurement period for these purposes will be the period 
of three financial years measured at the end of the third financial year
following the date of grant of the options. There is no retesting of the
performance targets. To the extent that the performance target is not 
met over this three year period, the options will lapse.
The performance targets have been met for all options granted under up to
2004. The Remuneration Committee selected the targets referred to above
because it believed they provided an appropriate benchmark of the
company’s longer term performance.
The company has prepared its financial statements under International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) commencing with the year ending
31 March 2006. A reconciliation of the company’s audited balance sheet 
as at 31 March 2005 from UK GAAP to IFRS was undertaken and the
difference amounted to an increase in NAV under IFRS of £5.3m, equating
to approximately 0.5% of NAV. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee
does not expect the adoption of IFRS to have had a material effect on the
performance targets for options already granted under the 1998 scheme
but, if necessary, will make adjustments to the extent considered
appropriate to ensure that the basis of calculation of NAV per share is
consistent over the relevant performance measurement period.
The special options shown in the table above for Mr Ingram relate to
options over 83,000 shares originally granted to Mr Ingram on 5 July 2002
outside the 1998 scheme and subject to special performance-related
terms. As in the case of options granted under the 1998 scheme, only
one-third of the shares under these special options were exercisable three
years after grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable six
years after grant. The special options are subject to a stretching
performance condition requiring the company’s total shareholder return
(‘TSR’) to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return index (‘Index’) over
the measurement period, which commenced on the date of grant. 54 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Corporate governance report
Statement of compliance
The board recognises the importance of good corporate governance and
this report describes how the company has applied the principles of good
corporate governance as set out in section one of the Combined Code
issued in July 2003 (the ‘Combined Code’). Shareholders registered on the
company’s New Zealand branch register should note that the principles of
good corporate governance set out in the Combined Code may materially
differ from the New Zealand Exchange Limited’s corporate governance
rules and the principles of its Corporate Governance Best Practice Code.
A copy of the Combined Code is available on the website of the Financial
Services Authority at www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/ukla/lr_comcode2003.pdf.
The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is responsible for the group’s objectives and policies 
and the management of its resources. It usually has eleven scheduled
meetings a year, but also convenes at additional times when required. 
The board has adopted a Schedule of Authorities which sets out matters
specifically reserved to it for decision. Such matters include the approval 
of strategy, the annual budget, material capital and revenue transactions
and changes in business activities, treasury policies, risk management and
internal policy limits relating to the company’s investment activities. The
Schedule of Authorities also sets out the authorities that are delegated to
board committees and to executive management. The Schedule of
Authorities is reviewed annually by the board.
All directors receive appropriate and timely information to ensure that 
they are properly briefed in advance of board meetings and have unlimited
access to the advice and services of the company secretary and other
senior management should further information be required. Non-executive
directors have access to independent professional advice at the company’s
expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities
as directors.
Appointment, induction and training
All new directors appointed by the board are required to seek election 
by shareholders at the next general meeting of the company following 
their appointment and subsequently all directors are required to retire by
rotation at least every three years. Any non-executive director who has
served on the board for over nine years is subject to annual re-election. On
appointment, new directors are offered induction and training considered
appropriate by the board and subsequently as necessary. The company
secretary provides details of, and where requested arranges attendance 
at, external courses to assist in directors’ professional development.
Board composition
The directors, all of whom served throughout the year, are shown on 
pages 26 and 27.
The board currently comprises twelve directors. Excluding the chairman, 
six of the directors are executive and five non-executive. The non-executive
directors considered to be independent are Messrs C M Allen-Jones,
M E T Davies, R Goblet d’Alviella and D G F Thompson. In assessing
Mr Goblet d’Alviella’s independence, the board took account of his position
as chief executive officer of Sofina sa, which has a 4.7% shareholding in
Caledonia, but did not consider this shareholding to be significant in the
context of independence, particularly given the size of the Cayzer Concert
Party’s total interest in the company. Moreover, in the context of
Caledonia, the board regards as key in assessing independence Mr Goblet
d’Alviella’s ability, given the shareholding of Sofina sa and his past
investment banking experience, to look at the interests of the general 
body of shareholders, independent of the Cayzer Concert Party and of
Caledonia’s executive management. Collectively, the directors throughout
the year brought a wide range of experience, skills and expertise to the
stewardship of the company. The individual biographies of the directors
appear on pages 26 and 27.
The board is led by the chairman, Mr P N Buckley, whose responsibilities
have been agreed and set out in writing in the Schedule of Authorities
adopted by the board. The chairman’s primary role is to ensure that the
board and individual directors are able to operate efficiently by setting 
the agenda, style and tone of board discussions to promote constructive
debate and effective decision making. He has overall responsibility for
monitoring the development needs of the board as a whole and of
individual directors and for ensuring that the performance of the board, 
its committees and individual directors are evaluated at least once a year. 
In conjunction with the chief executive, the chairman is responsible for
ensuring effective communication with shareholders and that all board
members develop an understanding of the views of investors. This is
primarily achieved by board briefings following meetings with significant
shareholders, analysts and private client stockbrokers, some of which are
also attended by the senior independent non-executive director.
The chief executive, Mr T C W Ingram, heads the executive management
team and is primarily responsible for the implementation of the board’s
policies and strategies and for managing the activities of the company
other than in relation to those matters specifically reserved to the board 
or delegated to its committees. His responsibilities have also been agreed
and set out in writing in the Schedule of Authorities adopted by the board.
Except where the board gives specific direction otherwise, the chief
executive may delegate any of those matters to other members of the
executive management team or to executive committees, but ultimately
he is accountable to the board for the overall performance of the company.
A strong independent non-executive representation on the board is headed 
by the senior independent non-executive director, Mr C M Allen-Jones. The
role of the non-executive directors, as set out in their letters of
appointment, is to challenge constructively, and contribute to, the
development of strategy; to scrutinise the performance of management 
in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor their performance; to
satisfy themselves that financial information is accurate and that financial
controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible; to
determine appropriate levels of remuneration for executive directors;
and to have a prime role in senior management appointments and
succession planning.
The composition of the board is such that, throughout the year, the
company did not comply with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code. 
The board however believes that the main objectives of board balance 
and independence set out in the Combined Code – that the board should
include a balance of executive and non-executive directors, and in particular
independent non-executive directors, such that no individual or small group
of individuals can dominate the board’s decision taking – are met.
The board is currently broadly comprised of three categories of directors –
the four independent non-executive directors; four directors (the chairman
and three executive directors – The Hon C W Cayzer and Messrs J M B
Cayzer-Colvin and W P Wyatt) who are involved in the affairs of Cayzer
Trust, Caledonia’s largest shareholder; and three other executive directors
(Messrs T C W Ingram, J H Cartwright and J M May). Mr J R H Loudon does
not fall into any of these categories as his twelve year tenure as a
non-executive director exceeds the nine year limit specified in the
Combined Code criteria for independence (although absent the Combined
Code’s nine year limit the board would have regarded him as independent)
and, although a member of the wider Cayzer family, he is not involved in
the affairs of Cayzer Trust.
In addition to the balance on the board brought by these categories, the
Governance Committee, comprising solely independent non-executive
directors, keeps under review corporate governance and conflict of interest
issues relating to the company and the board and has authority to
recommend that any director abstains from participating in any decision 
of the board, or any board committee, where it believes that a conflict of
interest could, or could be perceived to, arise. The board believes that this
structure ensures the necessary level of board balance demanded by the
Combined Code and safeguards against any individual or small group of
individuals being able to dominate the board’s decision taking. Whilst not
in strict compliance with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code, the board
believes this structure is appropriate in the context of a company with a
large controlling shareholder whose stability and support is fundamental 
to Caledonia’s business model as a long term, supportive investor, and is
therefore in the best interests of all shareholders.
The Combined Code also requires that the members of the Remuneration
and Audit Committees should all be independent non-executive directors.
However, Mr Loudon’s membership of these Committees, given the nine
year limit on length of service as a non-executive director included in the
Combined Code’s criterion for independence, means that provisions B.2.1
and C.3.1 of the Combined Code are not met. However, the board
otherwise regards Mr Loudon as independent and considers his length of
experience with the company, as well as his business career, to be
significant assets. Accordingly, the board believes his membership of these
Committees to be in the best interests of the company.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility to the
following standing committees, the terms of reference of which are
reviewed annually and are available on the company’s website or from the
company secretary on written request. The current membership of these
committees is noted on page 61. It is also the Audit Committee’s responsibility to review and monitor the
independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the effectiveness 
of the audit process and to develop and implement policy on the
engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services. In this
regard, the Audit Committee has approved a schedule of specific non-audit
activities which may not be undertaken by the external auditors, within the
broad principles that the external auditors should not audit their own work,
should not make management decisions on behalf of the company, should
not be put into the role of advocate for the company and that no mutuality
of interest should be created between the company and the external
auditors. The Audit Committee believes that, by applying these principles,
the objectivity and independence of the auditors is maintained,
notwithstanding that non-audit work may be undertaken. On an annual
basis, the Audit Committee considers and makes a recommendation to the
board as to the appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external
auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the company’s formal
whistleblowing arrangements, whereby members of staff may raise any
issues of concern regarding possible impropriety in the conduct of the
company’s business and whereby any such concerns are properly
investigated and appropriate action taken.
The Combined Code recommends that at least one member of the Audit
Committee should have recent and relevant financial experience. The Audit
Committee considers that Mr J R H Loudon, who was formerly group
finance director of Blue Circle Industries, has such financial experience. In
addition, the chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr C M Allen-Jones, is a
member of the Financial Reporting Council.
The Audit Committee met five times during the year, including three times
without any of the executive directors present. During the year, the
business undertaken by the Audit Committee included:
• A review of the performance of the external auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, 
and the level of fees charged for its services.
• The conduct of a tender for the group audit and resultant
recommendation to the board of a change of auditors to
Deloitte & Touche LLP.
• Consideration of the scope of the annual audit and agreement with the
external auditors of the key areas of focus.
• Consideration of the reports from the external auditors concerning their
audit of the annual financial statements of the company and their
review of the interim report.
• Consideration of the financial disclosures contained in the annual and
interim reports to shareholders.
• The review of reports from management on the effectiveness of the
company’s system of internal financial control.
• Consideration of the need or otherwise for an internal audit function.
• A review of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors,
including their system of quality controls and the level and nature of
non-audit services provided by them.
• An evaluation of the performance of the Audit Committee itself.
• Assurance of the company’s compliance with the requirements 
for approval as an investment trust.
Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 55
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, chaired by Mr P N Buckley, is responsible for 
the regular review of the structure, size and composition (including the
skills, knowledge and experience) of the board and for giving consideration
to succession planning for executive directors and, if requested by the
board, for other senior executives. It is responsible for identifying, using
external search consultants where necessary, candidates to fill board
vacancies as and when they arise and for making recommendations to the
board in relation thereto and for keeping under review the leadership needs
of the company, both executive and non-executive. It reviews the time
required of non-executive directors and ensures that they receive formal
letters of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of them in
terms of time commitment, committee service and involvement outside
board meetings.
The Nomination Committee met once during the year in order to
undertake a formal review of the size and composition of the board
following the 2006 annual board performance evaluation and to consider
the contribution and commitment of the non-executive directors retiring
at the 2006 annual general meeting, prior to giving recommendations 
for their re-elections.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr M E T Davies, is responsible 
for the review of executive remuneration policy. Within that policy, the
Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration packages of
executive directors and reviews those of other senior executive
management. It is also responsible for the design of, and grant of awards
under, the company’s share incentive schemes and for the determination 
of the policy for and scope of pension arrangements, service agreements,
termination payments and compensation commitments for executive
directors and, if requested by the board, for other senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee met five times during the year. The matters
considered by the Remuneration Committee included:
• The determination of bonuses for executive directors and review of
bonuses for other senior executives for the year ended 31 March 2006.
• A review of the company’s bonus schemes to ensure consistency of
bonus increments for all levels of staff in relation to company
performance.
• The grant of options and deferred bonus awards under the company’s
executive share option scheme and deferred bonus plan.
• A review of the impact of the Employment Equality Age Regulations
2006 on the rules of the company’s executive share option scheme
and deferred bonus plan and approval of consequential minor
amendments thereto.
• The determination of basic salaries for executive directors and review 
of salaries for other senior executives for the year commencing
1 April 2007.
Further information on the company’s executive remuneration policy and
the work of the Remuneration Committee are included in the directors’
remuneration report set out on pages 49 to 53.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, chaired by Mr C M Allen-Jones, is responsible for the
monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements of the company and 
any announcements relating to the company’s financial performance and
for reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained
therein. It also reviews the company’s systems of internal financial control
and considers annually whether an internal audit function is required.
The Audit Committee believes that, in the context of the company’s
business as an investment trust, the key issues on which it has to satisfy
itself are the integrity of the application of the company’s policy for the
valuation of its investments, particularly those which are unquoted, and 
the robustness of the group’s internal financial controls. The valuations 
of the company’s unquoted investments are subject to formal six monthly
reviews by an internal challenge committee, independent of the
investment executives, whose meetings are also attended by the auditors,
and key valuations are then reviewed by the Audit Committee. A formal
report on the effectiveness of the group’s internal financial control is
prepared annually for the board by the group financial controller. It is the
Audit Committee’s current opinion that, in view of these control processes,
the size of the entities controlled by Caledonia and the relatively
straightforward control considerations in relation to other investments,
a separate internal audit function is not necessary. 56 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007
Corporate governance report
Governance Committee
The Governance Committee, chaired by Mr C M Allen-Jones, keeps under
review corporate governance issues relating to the company and is
responsible for the monitoring and review of the ability of each director 
to act in the interests of shareholders as a whole and to exercise
independence of judgement free from relationships or circumstances
which are likely to, or could appear to, affect his judgement. Where it
concludes that such criteria are not satisfied with regard to any director, it
may make such recommendations to the board as it may think fit, including
that the director abstains from participating in any decision of the board or
any of its committees on the matter concerned. The Governance
Committee met once during the year.

1. Scheduled board meetings.
Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual formal evaluation of its own performance
and that of its committees and individual directors. For the year ended
31 March 2007, the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its
committees was led by the chairman and was conducted by inviting
individual board members to complete a questionnaire regarding the
operation and effectiveness of the board as a whole and of its committees,
the responses to which were collated by the company secretary and
discussed. The evaluation of the performance of the chairman was led 
by the senior independent non-executive director and involved private
discussion with other members of the board of their views on his
performance, the results of which were then considered at meetings 
of the non-executive directors, without the chairman present, and of the
Governance Committee. The evaluation of the performance of the chief
executive was undertaken by the chairman and the non-executive
directors. The performance of the non-executive directors was reviewed by
the chairman, the chief executive and the senior independent non-executive
director, with the senior independent non-executive director absent in
respect of his own performance appraisal. As part of this review, non-
executive directors were invited to complete self-assessment questionnaires
in relation to their own effectiveness. The performance of the executive
directors, which included further consideration of that of the chief
executive and chairman, was undertaken by the Remuneration Committee
as part of the annual executive salary review process.
The results of the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its committees
for the year ended 31 March 2007 were presented in a report to the board.
The Nomination Committee reviewed the size, structure and composition
of the board in the light of this report.
Internal control
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s system of internal
control, although the review of internal financial controls is delegated to
the Audit Committee. The group’s system of internal control is designed to
manage, rather than eliminate, risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
It is recognised that such a system can only provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The board
confirms that the system of internal control operated by the group accords
with the guidance issued in September 1999 by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales (the Turnbull Committee guidelines)
and has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval 
of these financial statements.
Major business risks facing group companies, including social, ethical 
and environmental issues, are identified in conjunction with operating
management and procedures agreed to address these as appropriate. 
Risks facing the group’s material investments are identified and evaluated
through board representation or regular contact.
Key risks identified are regularly monitored at group level by members 
of the executive committee, who have clear mandates to assess and report
on risk in their particular areas of responsibility. From these assessments, 
an ongoing risk profile of the group’s activities is updated half-yearly and
reviewed by the board. The board is also provided quarterly with a list of
the key risk issues identified by executive management at that particular
time. All of the company’s larger investments are reviewed at least annually
by the board and the smaller portfolio holdings reviewed at least annually
by the executive investment management committee.
Specific control procedures are in place to ensure that the company
continually monitors and complies with the requirements for investment
trust status. The board receives monthly compliance reports evidencing
that the company is meeting the various tests for investment trust status
and also confirming that the investment activities undertaken by executive
management are within the overall policy limits set by the board.
A compliance committee, comprising the company secretary (chairman),
the finance director, three associate directors and the group financial
controller has been established, which meets weekly to review the
company’s ongoing compliance with its investment trust status and to
monitor and approve all investment activity from an investment trust
compliance perspective.
Financial performance is continuously measured by comparing total
shareholder returns and net asset value movements against the FTSE
All-Share index. Performance statistics are reported monthly to the board.
Income and expenses are monitored by the board against an approved
annual budget and regularly updated forecasts. Valuations of unquoted
investments are subject to a rigorous six monthly review process
undertaken by a challenge committee independent of the investment
executives, whose meetings are also attended by the auditors, and key
valuations are then reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Since the year end, the directors have conducted their annual review of the
operation and effectiveness of the group’s system of internal control.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with institutional shareholders in order 
to achieve a mutual understanding of objectives. The chief executive and
the finance director seek meetings with larger institutional shareholders
and private client stockbrokers after the announcement of year end and
interim results. The senior independent non-executive director attends
some of these meetings. The annual general meeting also provides a forum
for shareholders to meet the directors, both formally and informally.
The chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available to answer
questions at the annual general meeting of the company. Earnings multiple
This methodology involves the application of an earnings multiple to the
earnings of the business being valued. It is likely to be appropriate for an
investment in an established business with an identifiable stream of
continuing earnings that can be considered to be maintainable. It may 
also be applicable to companies with negative earnings, if the losses are
considered to be temporary and a ‘normalised’ level of maintainable
earnings can be identified.
When using the earnings multiple method, earnings before interest and tax
(‘EBIT’) are normally used, adjusted to a maintainable level and taxed at the
standard tax rate. Generally, the latest full year historical accounts are used
unless reliable estimated or forecast results are available. An appropriate
multiple is applied to these earnings. Normally the multiple will be the
average taxed EBIT multiple for a comparable quoted company, the
weighted average of a number of companies or the relevant sector of the
FTSE All-Share index.
Net assets
This methodology is likely to be appropriate for a business whose value
derives mainly from the underlying value of its assets rather than its
earnings, such as property holding companies and investment businesses.
This methodology may also be appropriate for a business that is not
making an adequate return on assets and for which a greater value can be
realised by liquidating the business and selling its assets. In the context of
private equity, it may therefore be appropriate, in certain circumstances,
for valuing investments in loss-making companies and companies making
only marginal levels of profit.
The net assets methodology derives an enterprise value using appropriate
measures to value the assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and
liabilities, of a business.
Marketability discount
The marketability discount relates to an investment rather than to the
underlying business and reflects the compensation that willing buyers 
will demand for the risk arising from the lack of marketability. The
marketability discount will vary from situation to situation and will
generally be between 10% and 30%.
Some of the factors that will be considered in determining the
marketability discount are the closeness to a realisation event, the
investors’ influence over the timing of realisation and the difficulty 
and risk of actions required to put the business into a saleable condition.
Investment funds
The fair value of non-equity investment funds is generally estimated from 
the latest net asset value provided by the fund manager or the fair value 
of underlying investments adjusted for other net assets or liabilities, or
contingent assets or liabilities, of the fund.
Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007 57
Portfolio valuation methodology
A description of the methodology used to value the company’s portfolio 
is set out below. The methodology is based on IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and the ‘International private
equity and venture capital valuation guidelines’ issued by the AFIC, BVCA
and EVCA.
Basis of valuation
Investments are reported at the directors’ estimate of fair value at the
reporting date. Fair value represents the amount for which the directors
consider that an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, 
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
General
In estimating fair value, we seek to use a methodology that is appropriate
in light of the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment.
Methodologies are applied consistently from period to period, except
where a change would result in a better estimation of fair value. Given 
the uncertainties inherent in estimating fair value, a degree of caution is
applied in exercising judgments and making the necessary estimates.
Quoted investments
Investments quoted in an active market are valued at their bid price on the
reporting date. When a bid price is unavailable, the price of the most recent
transaction will normally be used.
Unquoted investments
The fair value is estimated as follows:
• The enterprise value is determined using an appropriate valuation
methodology adjusted for surplus assets, excess or unrecorded liabilities 
and other relevant factors as appropriate.
• Any financial instruments ranking ahead of the highest instrument 
held by the company is deducted from the enterprise value.
• An appropriate marketability discount is applied to give the net
attributable enterprise value.
• The net attributable enterprise value is apportioned between the
relevant financial instruments according to their rankings and allocated
to the company’s holding in each of the financial instruments,
representing their fair values.
For most unquoted investments, the fair value is based on the price 
of recent investment, earnings multiple or net assets valuation
methodologies.
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was made recently, its cost will
generally provide a good indication of fair value. Where there has been any
recent investment in the investee company, the price of that investment
will provide a basis of the valuation. Where the price at which a third party
has invested is being considered as the basis of valuation, the background
to the transaction will be taken into account to indicate whether or not the
price was wholly representative of the fair value at the time.
This methodology is likely to be appropriate only for a limited period after
the date of the relevant transaction. The length of period for a particular
investment will depend on the specific circumstances of the case, but a
period of one year is usually applied. 58 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2007

1. Income in the year represents dividends received (inclusive of any overseas withholding tax) and gross interest receivable in the year to 31 March 2007.
2. Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recent audited financial statements of the investee business. The figures shown are the total earnings on ordinary activities after tax and net assets
of each business. Due to the varying rights attaching to the classes of shares held by the group, it could be misleading to attribute a certain proportion of earnings and net assets to the proportion of equity 
capital held.

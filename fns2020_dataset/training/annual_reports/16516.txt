Contents VGM is the owner of the longest
producing gold mine in Fiji.
Operating for over 75 years, the
mine has produced in excess of
seven million ounces of gold. 
VGM acquired the mine in 2008
and aims to achieve sustained
profitable production of 100,000
ounces of gold per annum. We
are currently in our next phase of
expansion at the mine, increasing our production from the
current base of approximately 50,000 ounces per annum to
100,000 ounces of gold per annum. The mine currently has 4.2
million ounces of Mineral Resources and 790,000 ounces of
Mineral Reserves.
The Vatukoula Gold Mine is located in the northern part of the
main island in Fiji, approximately ten kilometres inland from the
coast and within the Tavua Basin. The mine is located at the
foot of the hills that make up the Tavua volcanic crater. 
The mine operates within three Special Mining Leases which
covers a total area of 1,255 hectares. In addition VGM can
explore on areas outside the current mining leases via Special
Prospecting Licenses which covers over 19,000 hectares of
the surrounding Tavua volcano.
The Vatukoula Gold Mine is currently both an open pit and
underground operation, however in the medium-term it will
become predominantly an underground mine. Underground
production is sourced from four mining areas; Smith Shaft,
Philip Shaft, R1 Cayzer Shaft and Emperor Decline. The Smith
and Philip Shafts, and the Emperor Decline serve as the main
accesses to the underground workings for personnel and
materials, and are used for ore and waste haulage.
Once the ore is hauled to the surface it is crushed, enriched
and refined at our on-site treatment plant, to produce Gold
Dore. Gold Dore produced at the mine is typically 80% gold,
19% silver and 1% base metals such as copper and iron. The
Gold Dore is sold to the Perth Mint in Australia.
VGM has onsite workshops, assay labs and produces its own
power via diesel generators. 
Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc. is a UK public company with its
headquarters in London. We are listed on the AIM market of
the London Stock Exchange under the symbol VGM.
The Group reports in Pounds Sterling (£) in
accordance with IFRS as adopted
by the European Union.

Financial Highlights
� Turnover of £47.9 million (2010: £40.3 million) – variance 
driven by higher gold prices.
� EBITDA of £2.2 million (2010:£8.9 million) – lower as a 
result of development programme delivering lower grade 
ore.
� Net loss of £2.3 million (2010: Profit: £4.5 million).
� Continued capital investment of £11 million (2010: £10 
million).
� Completion of £6 million equity placing through the issue 
of 4.8 million shares in June 2011.
� Cash position of £6.9 million.
� Completion of share consolidation in November 2010 to 
realign the Company’s share structure in a manner 
favourable to a potential North American listing.
Operational Highlights
� Gold sold was 53,461 ounces for the year ended August 
2011.
� Underground ore delivered increased by 40% compared to
the previous year.
� The underground development for the year was 24,453 
metres up from 8,720 metres achieved in the previous year.
These significant increases are the result of our on-going 
development programme.
� The Appointment of David Whittle as General Manager in 
July paved the way for  a variety of operational 
improvements, including:
- Minimising waste from development with split firing 
technique to blast the ore and waste separately; 
- The introduction of truck chutes to reduce the need 
for underground loaders; and
- The introduction of water cannons in the underground 
stopes to recover more of the fines.
� Feasibility study completed on the Rarawai power project 
by the Fiji Sugar Corporation, with VGM in negotiations to 
secure off-take agreement, or joint venture the project.
Exploration Highlights
� Mineral Resource base increased by 6% to 4.2 million 
ounces, of which 790,000 ounces are classified as 
Mineral Reserves.
� Encouraging results are reported from VGM’s initial surface
exploration programme, which has been designed to 
provide a preliminary delineation of oxide/transitional 
material within the current mining leases. 21 holes returned
gold grades in excess of 3 grams of gold per tonne. 
Intersections include 5.14 grams of gold per tonne over 
17.55 metres, 12.09 grams of gold per tonne over 5 metres
and 3.45 grams of gold per tonne over 19 metres.
� Mine envelope exploration targets the Prince and 
Matanagata North East (MGNE) flat-makes. Significant 
intersections included 23.1 grams of gold per tonne over 
1.30 metres (Prince) and 9.6 grams of gold per tonne over 
0.77 metres (MGNE).

Strategic Priority
Our current production from the
Vatukoula Gold Mine to a targeted
sustained rate of 100,000 ounces of
gold per annum. 
Develop enough underground
access, or development, allowing
access to the required mining areas
and therefore tonnages and grade.
Achievements in 2011 Operational Drivers 
427,685 tonnes of waste and ore
mined, a 40% increase on last
year’s figure.
24,453 metres of operating and
capital development carried out, a
180% increase over last year.
336,085 tonnes of underground ore
delivered to the mill, a 38% increase
compared to the previous year.
The targeted production rate beyond
current Mineral Reserves. 
Further define the large Mineral
Resource inventory and converting
these to Proven and Probable
Mineral Reserves to both replace the
ounces mined and increase the
current Mineral Reserve base.
A resource and reserve drilling
programme has been developed
during the period under review, this
will be our main exploration focus
during the coming year.
Our working practices and working
relationships to target lower unit
costs on a per tonne basis. 
Target key operational drivers and
costs which have high internal rates
of return and low capital costs.
The Fiji Sugar Corporation (“FSC”)
completed its feasibility study of the
construction of a bio fuel co-
generation plant. Our involvement in
this project via an off-take
agreement on the power produced
from the plant will approximately
halve our power costs.
During the year we have constructed
a small scale bacterial leach
recovery plant. In bench tests this
has yielded 95% recovery rates of
gold from our ore. This is
considerably higher than 
the recovery rate during the year
of 81%.
We have begun the tendering
process of several of our key
consumables. This will help us 
achieve lower unit costs.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 7 The German-American economist Hans
Sennholz once said: “For more than two
thousand years gold’s natural qualities made it
man’s universal medium of exchange. In
contrast to political money, gold is honest
money that survived the ages and will live on
long after the political fiats of today have gone
the way of all paper.”
Fiat money is defined as money, either paper or coin, made
legal tender and assigned a value by government decree. This
places a huge responsibility on governments, who are inclined
to take on obligations that they are unable to fulfil and having
done so have to reduce the value of those same obligations by
reducing the value of the currency. When questioned in the
USA on the plans that the Federal Reserve Bank had to put the
economy back on its feet, Mr Bernanke (Chairman of the
Federal Reserve) said that he had a wonderful invention for that
very problem, the printing press (his words not mine).
Governments can create “fiat money” much faster than mining
companies can mine gold. Even in exceptional years the world
gold production only rises in single figure percentages,
whereas governments can increase available credit by
hundreds of percentages points. The “gold bubble” frequently
quoted is in reality the result of a paper money bubble, with
gold trying to maintain its value as against the shifting values of
the various reserve currencies. The paper currencies have
fulfilled one of the primary functions of money in providing a
medium of exchange but have singularly failed to provide the
equally important function of being a store of value. Gold has
re-entered the money world by providing a store of value. Over
the next few years the older countries of Europe are likely to be
forced to reduce their central bank gold holdings to shore up
their currencies with the gold flowing to the coffers of the
emerging markets.
I am confident that the actions our
Mine Management and Operational
Teams took this year, supported by
the Board, will help to position your
Company to meet its yearly target
of 100,000 ounces of production.
08 VATUKOULA GOLD MINES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Whilst we have taken steps to
improve our mining operation, we
have also invested in an exploration
programme designed to help find
new resources and help extend our
life of mine operations in Fiji.
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 8 Although the gold price has been buoyant over the last year,
smaller capitalised gold mining companies haven't reflected
this and I am frequently being asked why. I think the reason lies
in the creation of the Gold ETF Funds that have siphoned off a
lot of investment money into direct holdings of gold; since the
security and ease of holding gold has improved. The speed
that sizeable amounts of money can enter and leave the
market is also helpful to performance funds and bypasses the
difficulties faced in buying equity shareholdings in smaller
mining companies with their attendant risks. However this will
change when the cash flows in the industry allow the payment
of dividends to shareholders.
Following a year of consolidation, we set out our accelerated
development programme with a view to be producing 100,000
ounces of gold per year.  That objective continues to be in our
sights but as yet has not been achieved.  VGM shipped a total
of 53,461 ounces of gold in the year under review.
Following the appointment in July 2011 of our new General
Manager, David Whittle, we commenced a review of our mining
operations in consultation with the senior mine operations team.
The review was designed to see how we could re-position our
mining activities in order to both meet the targets that had been
set and optimize our operations in the short and long term. 
Toward the end of the year, we introduced a number of
initiatives to reduce dilution and increase the grade mined.
These included split-firing of development drives, improved
staff motivation, improved mining practices and the
reintroduction of sweeping teams to remove the remaining
material in mined stopes.  These methods will help reduce our
cash cost per ounce and ensure we mine less waste and
produce more gold bearing ore. 
The purchase of two development machines, one of which was
on site and operating prior to year-end, enhanced our
mechanised mining approach. This will help to overcome some
of the shortfalls we encountered in our below ground
infrastructure.  This, coupled with the condensing of the mine
development plan at the Phillip Shaft, will combine to help
create better circumstances for our operation to deliver higher
grades and production output over the medium term.
Whilst we have taken steps to improve our mining operation,
we have also invested in an exploration programme designed
to help find new resources and help extend our life of mine
operations in Fiji. 
Moving forward, I am confident that the actions our Mine
Management and Operational Teams took this year, supported
by the Board, will help to position your Company to meet its
yearly target of 100,000 ounces of production. With a
promising horizon of new ore body discoveries, such as that
announced in October 2011, we look forward to many more
years of profitable production from the Vatukoula Gold Mine.
As we go into 2012, I remain optimistic about the prospects of
our industry and in particular our company.  We need to apply
the hard lessons learned to overcome the challenges we will
face during the coming year and deliver against the potential of
our asset base. 
Once again, I take this opportunity to thank all our hard
working and dedicated staff, operations and management and
acknowledge the support provided to our company by our
various stakeholders and suppliers.

& Other Information
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 9 During the last twelve months 
we have made positive operational strides with
increased underground development rates and
large increases in underground ore mined.
However, despite these achievements, the
mining constraints we faced at the Vatukoula
Gold Mine prevented us from achieving our
production target.  
As such, resolving these issues became a top priority for our
Management team during this year, ensuring the mine enters
2012 in a position to grow and deliver to our long term targets.
The improvements, made mostly during the second half of the
year, included the recruitment of additional personnel to our
technical team, the introduction of improved mining disciplines,
and a number of Senior Management changes.  We are
confident that these actions will build a solid foundation from
which to expand our production.
Operating and Financial Performance
VGM sold 53,461 ounces of gold in the year at an average cost
of US$1,349 per ounce.  The main driver to the higher cash cost
per ounce was the increased development metres achieved
during the year which delivered lower grades to the mill.
Operating costs on a per tonne basis have increased to US$145
on an overall basis; however, this increase is primarily because
of the increased amount of underground ore mined and milled
as a percentage of the total ore mined.  The positive movement
of the gold price mitigated some of the higher cost base with our
operating cash outflow for the year being £2.3 million with a
year-end cash position of £6.9 million. During the year our
Mineral Resource base increased by 6% to 4.2 million ounces,
of which 790,000 ounces are classified as Mineral Reserves.
Development of the Vatukoula Gold Mine
The Mine Management team and Senior Team Leaders set
about an aggressive underground mining programme that
resulted in the mining this year of 427,685 tonnes of
underground ore and waste, a 40% increase over the previous
year.  As is expected, the company mined more waste and less
gold bearing ore body, principally because the quality of the
underground infrastructure necessary for us to recover higher
grades within the ore body itself was not sufficiently or
previously put in place. 
The measures we have taken
during the year and in particular
in the last quarter we believe 
will result in increased
production levels and lower 
costs in the coming year.
10 VATUKOULA GOLD MINES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 10 Any underground mine requires a huge input of infrastructure
building long before production commences. We were aware
that insufficient development was available to provide for
flexible and sustainable long-term operations. Therefore a
development catch-up programme was agreed at all levels,
and was targeted to be complete within six months.  This
objective was not realised as development rates that were
envisioned were not practically achievable.
Development, although not conducted at the rate required,
was substantial in the year under review. A total of over 24,000
metres was achieved, a threefold increase over the previous
year. Development at the mine has historically been
undertaken on the ore body, called strike drives.  This has been
considered the best practice, for a number of reasons: Firstly
the ore body at the mine is generally shallow dipping resulting
in the alternative, a footwall drive, being developed too far
away from the ore body; secondly, the development along the
ore body gives a good cross sectional ore grade evaluation,
which gives the mine a better evaluation of the ore body before
mining; and finally because less waste material is mined during
this type of mining.  
In future, using strike development, the mine will be targeting a
ratio of 30% development tonnage to 70% from mining
operations.  The rate at the beginning of the year was the
reverse. 
Because of the combination of a high rate of development to
create the infrastructure required, which resulted in diluted
grade due to development, and the dilution from development
of the up-dip stopes, the overall grade of the year under review
was below our forecast.
We have instigated a number of measures to assist mining,
and in particular grade control.  We have returned our stope
mining to traditional longwall stopes, with the addition that we
are designing new stopes to produce over a much longer time
horizon. This involves longer setting up – but we believe it will
provide smoother production when commissioned.  Added to
this is the use of truck chutes for the loading of ore, which will
assist in our heavy equipment availability.

& Other Information
Any underground mine requires a
huge input of infrastructure building
long before production commences.
Insufficient development was
available to provide for flexible and
sustainable long-term operations.
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 11 Mine Management has introduced a number of additional
initiatives to reduce dilution, including stricter control of mining
areas and split blasting in development drives.  We have also
initiated in one section on a trial basis, the use of footwall drive
development as opposed to strike development. We look
forward to assessing the results of this trial program.
Overall, I am satisfied with the progress toward the long-term
future of the mines’ underground operations.  It is
management’s objective to place the underground mine into a
continuous sustainable production level. There will be additional
capital requirements for the underground mine going forward.
We have already highlighted the 18 level decline to access new
areas in the Philip Shaft. In the medium to long term we will also
be required to upgrade and refurbish the ventilation system at
the mine, and continue to increase our knowledge of the Mineral
Resources at the Vatukoula Gold Mine.
Sustainable Power
During the period, the proposed power project to be developed
by the Fiji Sugar Corporation (“FSC”) at the nearby Rarawai
Sugar Mill was the subject of a bankable feasibility study.  The
project has been designed to produce sufficient power for both
the Rarawai Mill and VGM.  The capital cost is estimated to be
in the region of US$130 to US$160 million depending on an
owner build or construction contractor option. Construction is
scheduled to begin in calendar 2013 subject to finance.  The
FSC is currently in negotiations to secure finance, with VGM
looking to enter into a long term off take agreement and if
possible acquire an interest in the project.
We believe that a long-term power supply from a source that is
not beholden to the international hydrocarbon price would
provide a large benefit to the long-term operations at the
Vatukoula Gold Mine, through lowered operating costs.  
Exploration
In January 2011, VGM began the first exploration programme
for over a decade. The main targets for this programme were
extensions to existing as well as new surface oxide
mineralization, underground high-grade ore bodies adjacent to
existing resources, and previously drilled exploration targets on
VGM’s Special Prospecting Licenses.
12 VATUKOULA GOLD MINES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT (CONTINUED)
Drilling on the Special Prospecting
Licenses began in the latter half of
the year and post the year end we
announced preliminary results related
to the discovery of a series of new ore
bodies at the Vatukoula Gold Mine.
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 12 Encouraging progress has been made on all of these targets.
We completed a 60-hole surface oxide drill campaign which
covered approximately 520,000 m
2
.  The results from this
campaign are currently being reviewed and we aim to be able
to deliver a resource statement during the coming year. The
drilling on the underground targets also yielded positive results
indicating further extensions of both the Matanagata and
Prince flatmakes.  As part of our exploration programme in the
coming year both of these ore bodies are being targeted. 
Drilling on the Special Prospecting Licenses began in latter half
of the year and post the year end we announced the
preliminary results related to the discovery of a series of new
ore bodies at the Vatukoula Gold Mine. Further drilling of these
targets will be carried out during the year to better define the
geometry of these structures and their full economic potential.
Strengthening the Management Team
During the last quarter of the year, we began the process of
strengthening our management team at the Vatukoula Gold
Mine.
In July, Mr. David Whittle was appointed as General Manager
of the Vatukoula Gold Mine.  Mr. Whittle has vast experience in
underground mining and has managed mining operations in
the Pacific Islands.  His underground experience will assist in
placing the Vatukoula Gold Mine in the long-term sustainable
position that we are looking to achieve. Toward the end of the
year, we also made some key appointments in the Geological,
Mine Planning, Maintenance, and Supply Departments.  With
these appointments, we believe that we now have in place a
management team with the required experience, professional
skill set and hunger to develop the mine and deliver on its full
potential.
North American Listing
We still envisage that we will apply for an additional listing on a
North American market as we believe that this will provide
exposure to a market with a broad number of comparable
underground gold mining companies.  Full documentation will
be provided to the relevant exchange within the forthcoming
year subject to the mine achieving the improvements in
sustainable mining that we are expecting.
Post Balance Sheet Events
As a result of the actions taken in the last quarter of the
financial year, gold production has improved dramatically.
Higher grades delivered to the mill and lower tonnages have
resulted in the mine producing to target and at a lower cost
than forecast.
Outlook
The last year has been one of significant challenges, which I
believe we have dealt with effectively and decisively.  The
measures we have taken during the year and in particular in
the last quarter we believe will result in increased production
levels and lower costs in the coming year.  More importantly, it
will be a year of laying the solid foundation required to achieve
our strategic objectives of expansion, sustainable production,
operational optimisation, and growth.
The key business objectives and their relation to our
strategic priorities for 2012 are:
Expand
Achieve a production of 65,000 ounces
Achieve a normal and capital development metres of 26,000
metres
Sustain
Begin reserve and resource drilling programme with the
objective of increasing our Mineral Reserve base
Optimise
Continue bio-oxidation leach testing
Further negotiations with FSC with the aim a signing a
memorandum of understanding
Complete tendering process on key consumables at the mine
Grow
Complete Mineral Resource statements on surface deposits
Carry out further drilling on key target identified during the
current year
In conclusion, I would like to thank all of the operating staff at
the Vatukoula Gold Mine for their commitment enthusiasm and
enormous effort in what has been a challenging year in the
development of the business.  I would also like to thank the
Board, for their support, advice, and commitment throughout
the year.

& Other Information
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 13 Information contained in the following gold
sector market outlook is taken from the latest
statistics published by the World Gold Council
(www.gold.org), the industry body that reports
and analysis trends associated with the supply
and demand of gold.  Such information is
accurate at the time of the production of 
this report.
Demand
2010 was a strong year for the gold sector. Demand increased
to 3,812.2 tonnes (with a total value of US$150 billion), a
9% increase over 2009 figures. This performance is primarily
attributable to growth in demand from the jewellery sector,
the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in
Chinese gold demand. Equally, it should be noted that Central
Banks have become net purchasers of gold for the first time in
21 years.
Gold continues to be regarded as a trustworthy investment
product, particularly in times of great economic disturbance.
The introduction of gold backed exchange traded funds (ETFs)

accounted for 338 tonnes of physical gold in 2010, down 45%
from the 617.1 tonnes of demand recorded in 2009 as a
result of profit taking.
Global gold demand in the second quarter of 2011 was 919.8
tonnes (total value: US$44.5 billion), the second highest
quarterly value on record. Year-on-year growth was broad-
based across sectors and geographies. Again, India and China
were the major contributors to growth in both jewellery and
investment demand.
Supply
4,108 tonnes of gold came into the market in 2010,
representing a 2% increase on 2009’s figure. The underlying
components of supply were mixed. The combined effect of a
reduction in the supply of recycled gold (-19 tonnes
compared to 2009) and a shift in the official sector to modest
net purchases (-117 tonnes) were cancelled out by a 136
tonne year-on-year decline in producer de-hedging. Given that
the net effect of these changes on supply was negligible,
the 74 tonne year-on-year increase in 2010 was solely the
result of growth in mine production.
At 1,058.7 tonnes, the supply of gold in the second quarter of
2011 was 4% below the comparative period in 2010. Mine
production was the only element of the supply portfolio to
register growth (7% year-on-year). The remaining elements of
supply experienced a net volume decrease compared to Q2
2010.
Second quarter mine production of 708.8 tonnes was 49.4
tonnes above the levels of Q2 2010. Similar to the previous
quarter, the distribution of gains in mine production was
geographically widespread, with positive contributions from all
regions.
The long-term fundamentals
for gold are strong. Global
market uncertainties continue
to drive investors to increase
their gold holdings in order 
to protect their wealth.

MARKET REVIEW
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 14 Increases were particularly strong in Africa as Randgold
Resources’ Tongon mine in Cote d’Ivoire, which poured its first
gold in November, benefited from an increase in average ore
grade. Production at Nevsun’s recently established Bisha
mine in Eritrea also contributed to growth after coming on
stream in February. Operations in Ghana and Burkina Faso
also generated growth in mine production. A number of new
starts in Canada bolstered production there, while in North
America Barrick’s Cortez mine benefitted from increased mill
throughput. Higher throughput at Newmont’s Boddington
mine and significant production improvement at Catalpa
Resources’ Edna May operation both contributed to growth in
Australian gold production.
Mine Supply versus Gold Price
Further increases in mine production were seen in Russia and
Kazakhstan, as well as Turkey, Papua New Guinea,
Mexico and Chile. Net producer hedging swung back to a
negative number in the second quarter. Net de-hedging of 10
tonnes reversed just over half of the modest 18.8 tonnes of net
hedging that took place during the second quarter of 2010.
The impact on supply from hedging activity is likely to remain
insignificant over the coming quarters; the outstanding global
hedge book remains small on a historical basis and new, so far
modest, hedging activity remains largely project-based.
Central banks remained net buyers of gold in the second
quarter of the year. Although well below the first quarter’s
elevated levels, central bank purchases of gold of 69.4 tonnes
were the second highest quarter since the official sector
began buying again in the second quarter of 2009. The Central
Banks reporting net purchases were a mixture of banks
with a known, existing programme of purchasing and one or
two newcomers.
In a continuation of the recent trend, buying is concentrated
among the Central Banks of emerging economies, which
remain largely underweight in their allocation to gold.
Russia, which continues to buy local production with the
express intention of diversifying its reserves, purchased 26
tonnes during the course of the quarter. This takes Russia’s
gold holdings to around 837 tonnes, equivalent to almost 8%
of the country’s reserve assets.
In August, South Korea’s central bank announced that it had
purchased 25 tonnes of gold over the course of June and
July. Added to the existing holdings of 14.4 tonnes, South
Korea now owns 39.4 tonnes of gold, which makes it the 45th
largest holder of gold in the world according to the August
table of world official gold holdings. Elsewhere in Asia,
Thailand’s central bank made a further purchase, adding 17.0
tonnes to its reserves.
Mexico added to the buying seen in the first quarter with an
additional purchase of 5.9 tonnes. Over the year-to-date,
Mexico has added almost 100 tonnes to its reserves, boosting
total gold holdings to 106.0 tonnes. The 429.3 tonnes of
recycling activity in Q2 was subdued, 3% down year-on-year
and only slightly above the average of the last 10 quarters of
407.3 tonnes. This modest result is particularly interesting
given the record price levels reached during the quarter.
Recycling in developed markets was steady, with the decline
resulting wholly from weaker recycling levels in emerging
markets.
A number of factors appear to be behind the decline in
recycling activity, including an increasing acceptance of higher
price levels, which in turn drive bullish price expectations; the
depletion of near-market stocks; and improving economic
conditions in a number of those countries in which recycling is
prevalent (most notably India).
Outlook, Pricing and Share Price Impact
With strong fundamentals behind the current gold price we
believe that the price of gold is set to remain comfortably
above US$1,000 per ounce for the foreseeable future and
above our long term cash production cost.
The European sovereign debt crisis is serving to add to market
volatility. A flight to safe haven investment asset classes
such as gold is helping to keep the price of gold high.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 17 Operationally this year has been one of
unprecedented activity at the Vatukoula Gold
Mine, with dramatic increases in underground
tonnes mined and increased development
metres. We did however face operational
challenges which prevented us from reaching
our targeted production. Total gold produced
was 52,157 ounces, a 7% decrease on last
year’s figure.
Underground Production
During the year we mined 427,685 tonnes of ore and waste, a
40% increase on 304,959 tonnes in 2010. This increase was
primarily driven by the increased waste, and more strike drive
development associated with the accelerated development
programme.
The average grade for the year was also adversely affected by
increased strike drive development, which lowered the overall
grade from 7.46 grams of gold per tonne to 5.00 grams of gold
per tonne. Strike drives reduce the grade because they are
larger (3.5m high) access drives which follow the ore body,
while mining stopes typically are 1.1 m in height. Therefore as
more tonnes are extracted from strike drives compared to
stopes, the overall dilution of the ore body (typically 0.50m
wide) increases and therefore the grade mined decreases.
Surface Production
Processing of the oxide waste dump, previously identified as
containing treatable oxide material, was completed in the year.
As part of our exploration program we uncovered some
additional oxide material that was mineable by open pit
methods.  This was undertaken to supplement our
underground production while we are in the process of
reinstating full underground production.  In the year we
processed a total of 160,923 tonnes of material at an average
grade of 1.39 grams gold per tonne.
Ore processed for the 
year was 498,123 tonnes, 
a 13% increase compared 
to the year ending 2010
(441,924 tonnes).

Vatukoula Treatment Plant (“VTP”)
Tonnes of ore processed for the year was 498,123 tonnes, a
13% increase compared to the year ending 2010 (441,924
tonnes). The increase was driven by the increased mining
activities from underground which increased ore delivered to
the mill by 38%. This increase was off-set by a decrease in
surface ore delivered to the mill, from 198,507 tonnes in 2010
to 160,923 in 2011. 
The average grade processed decreased from 5.00 grams of
gold per tonne in 2010, to 3.78 grams of gold per tonne in
2011. The key drivers for this reduction were the lower grades
delivered from underground, which represented a larger portion
of the material processed this year. The lower grades delivered
also reduced recoveries within the processing circuit by 4% to
81.26% in the year (2010: 84.58%).
At the VTP we replaced the tertiary crusher.  We have also
refurbished and replaced where necessary large amounts of
steelwork and repaired the roofs and buildings in general.  The
fine ore bin was relined.  The plant continues to operate
satisfactorily – but does require additional refurbishment of the
secondary crushers and screens, over the coming year.
During the year we have been investigating ways of optimising
our processing plant and increasing recoveries. In particular we
have been carrying out bacteria leach test work. Preliminary
results have been very encouraging with gold dissolution of
between 95% to 98%. A larger test program has been included
in this year’s capital program.  
Cash Costs
As a result of 1) the lower underground grade delivered to the
processing plant, 2) the increased tonnages mined from
underground and 3) increases in industry cost generally, our
cash cost per ounce of gold shipped increased to US$1,349.
Overall cash cost per tonne mined and milled also increased to
US$145 (2010: US$109). 
Employees
At the year end we employed 1,144 individuals as either full
time employees or as casual labour.  Of our permanent
workforce 50% are involved in direct mining operations, with a
further 10% in underground mining support services.  We also
use the services of local contractors for ground transport, and
in that regard a further 272 individuals are directly involved in
the operations at the Vatukoula Gold Mine.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 21 In January 2011, the Group announced the
commencement of its 2011 exploration
programme, which was designed to fulfill two
primary objectives:
1. Identify and detail new areas for mining and delineate 
expansion potential within the VGM Special Mining Lease 
areas.
2. Undertake regional exploration on the company’s Special 
Prospecting Licenses
Two drill rigs were commissioned to undertake the drill
programme. The exploration teams were briefed to:
1. Establish extensions to existing as well as new surface 
oxide mineralisation
2. Discover underground high-grade ore bodies adjacent to 
existing resources
3. Examine previously drilled exploration targets on the 
Company’s Special Prospecting Licenses
Our overall objective is to increase life-of-mine operations and
to improve our understanding of the full extent of gold
mineralisation in the Tavua Caldera, using modern-day
geological and exploration tools.
The exploration results will guide the company in regards to the
potential for expansion of the current operations.  The
combination of extensive historical mining data, minimal
exploration in recent years and modern exploration techniques
provides an exceptional opportunity to make another discovery
of economic mineralisation in the Tavua Caldera.
Surface Oxide Exploration
During the year a total of 7,205 metres, were drilled as part of
the surface oxide exploration programme.  The large majority
of these holes were focused on identifying a potential resource
within the current Special Mining Leases.  Approximately 2,000
metres were drilled on our Special Prospecting Licenses to
carry out some confirmation drilling on a previously discovered
deposit.  The majority of the drilling was carried out by reverse
circulation drilling on a 100-metre grid.  Diamond drilling were
utilised to provide detail in relation to structure and orientation
of the mineralisation.
The objective of this phase of drilling was to define the strike
extensions of the vertical or near vertical mineralised
structures, which have been historically mined from surface.
The holes completed to date have confirmed the presence of
multiple mineralised structures along strike from previously
mined areas.  These structures are currently being interpreted,
and along with historical information that VGM has at its
disposal, are to be compiled with the intention to produce an
initial Mineral Resource model. 
The exploration programme is
an essential component in the
long-term operational
sustainability strategy at the
Vatukoula Gold Mine.

EXPLORATION REVIEW
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 22 Mine Envelope Exploration
A total of 7,228 metres were drilled on the mine envelope
exploration programme. All of these holes were drilled by
diamond drilling, either from surface or underground. The
drilling was designed to intersect possible down-dip and along
strike extensions of known ore bodies.
The most significant results to date have been;
1. The intersection of the Prince flatmake ore body below the 
16th level (approximately 540 metres below surface).  Four 
holes were drilled of which two intersected the Prince 
flatmake with the most significant intersection being 1.30 
metres at 23.19 grams of gold per tonne.
2. The intersection of the Matanagata flatmake between 492 
metres and 600 metres below surface.  The most 
significant intersection was a composite intersection of 
0.77 metres at 9.61 grams of gold per tonne.
Both of these intersections are an important step forward in the
mine envelope drilling as they demonstrate the existence of
mineralised structures outside our current Mineral Resource
model and at some distance from our current workings
(between 100 and 300 metres).
Special Prospecting Licenses Exploration
The Special Prospecting Licenses exploration commenced in
April 2011 and during the year 4,614 metres were drilled. No
significant results came from the initial stages of this
programme, however post year end several significant
mineralised intersections were encountered. 
Summary & Post Year end Exploration Results
We are happy with the results to date of our on-going
exploration programme, particularly with the discovery of a
new ore body.  In October, we announced the discovery, 300
metres north of the existing mine workings, of a new high-
grade ore zone, which the Company has named ‘Nilsen’.
Nilsen is the first new high-grade gold mineralised discovery at
the Vatukoula Gold Mine since the discovery of the Prince
William ore zone in the 1980s. 
The 2011 drill programme had intersected high-grade
mineralised structures with significant composite
intersections that included:
� 124.7 grams of gold per tonne over 0.46 metres
� 33.6 grams of gold per tonne over 2.86 metres
� 25.46 grams of gold per tonne over 1.07 metres
� 39 grams of gold per tonne over 0.48 metres
The ore zone has been intersected between 300 metres and
700 metres below surface (levels 11 to 23) and is open along
strike and down dip.  Further work is planned to establish the
full size and scale of the Nilsen discovery and we look forward
to defining the results of our 2011 drill programme over the
near term so as to be able to introduce new ore zone
discoveries into our future mine development plan.

detailed analysis of the Group’s consolidated
2011 results and the main factors affecting the
financial performance.The Financial Review
should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and associated notes on
pages 43 to 87.
During the year the Group benefited from the increased gold
price which resulted in a higher turnover figure, however overall
the Group’s financial results were adversely affected by the
continued accelerated development programme and some
challenging operational issues encountered during the year. 
Increased mining costs per tonne and higher volumes of material
treated combined with lower grades (grams of gold per tonne)
resulted in a loss of £2.3 million and cash outflows from
operating activities of £2.3 million. The lower grades and
increased costs also affected the cash cost per ounce sold
which increased to US$1,349.
Revenue for the year of £47.9
million was 19% higher than the
prior year period of £40.3 million.
The average realised gold price
was US$1,439 in 2011 compared
to US$1,157 per ounce in 2010.

Revenue for the year of £47.9 million was 19% higher than the
prior year period of £40.3 million. The Group’s year on year
sales volume decreased by 1,181 ounces which adversely
affected revenue, however the Group benefited from the large
increases in gold prices during the year. The average realised
gold price was US$1,439 in 2011 compared to US$1,157 per

Commodity Prices
Gold prices have a significant impact on the Group’s revenue,
net profits and its ability to generate cash flows. In 2011 the
price of Gold reached US$1,878 and traded between a range
of US$1,250 to US$1,878 per ounce. Market gold prices
averaged US$1,449 compared to our average realised gold
price of US$1,439 per ounce.
The market price of gold has been influenced by sovereign debt
concerns, low US dollar interest rates, investment demand,
government monetary policies and negative long term production
global gold production. With the continued global easing of
monetary policy and large fiscal deficits in some of the major
developed countries, there is a possibility that inflation and US
Dollar depreciation could occur in the next few years. With these
two drivers, coupled with the increased demand for gold from
investors as a result of the continued financial uncertainty, we
should see a positive influence on the price of gold.
Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses
Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses increased to £51.5
million in 2011 from £35.5 million in 2010. A 40% increase in the
waste and ore mined during the year elevated costs by £6.4
million. A 13% increase in the ore milled elevated the costs by
£1 million. The remaining £8.6 million is attributable to:
� an increase in unit mining and milling costs which 
represented £6.0 million in additional costs, 
� a  £0.8 million increase in overhead and administrative 
costs,
� an increase in the value of gold shipped which elevated the
gold duty paid to £0.2 million, 
� higher amortization and depreciation charges of £0.9 
million, and
� a decrease in unrealised foreign exchange gains on 
intercompany loans of £0.6 million.
A breakdown of the key drivers behind the increase in cost of
sales and operating expenses is shown in the graph above. 
As outlined above the variance in mining costs represented
the key driver to the increase in costs compared to the
previous year. The mining costs totalled £29.7 million for the
year. This represents an increase of £11.8 million from the
prior year period (£17.9 million). A 40% increase in the waste
and ore mined during the year elevated costs by £6.4 million.
The remaining £5.1 million is primarily attributable to:
� an increase in underground direct mining costs of £1.5 
million which can be attributed to an increased market 
prices of explosives, fuel, heavy vehicle tyres and other 
mining consumables,
� a £1.3 million increase in labour, engineering and other 
costs mainly attributable to larger higher maintenance 
costs on heavy vehicles,
� a £1.1 million increase in power, compressed air and 
pumping costs mainly due to higher pumping and 
compressed air costs associated with accessing more 
remote areas of the mine, and
� expensing the gold in circuit drawn down in the period, 
which increased compared to the previous year and 
increased costs by £1.1 million.

variances year on year for the Group are shown in the table
and graph.
Depreciation and amortisation was £6.1 million for the year.
This represents an increase of 17% from the prior year (£5.2
million). This increase is due to the higher capital investment
base employed in late 2010 and in 2011 as a result of the
accelerated development programme, capital equipment
replacement programme and the rate of depreciation when
compared to older capital development and equipment.
Cash Costs
Cash cost for the year ending 31 August 2011 were US$1,349
per ounce sold (2010: US$884 per ounce). This increase in
cash costs can mainly be attributed to lower grade of ore
delivered to the mill and consequently lower recovery rates.
The lower grades are a function of the accelerated
development programme the Group has been carrying out at
the Vatukoula Gold Mine. 
This programme results in a higher dilution of the ore body, as
we excavate the required underground infrastructure and
access required for our sustainable production target. As a
portion of the increase in cash costs per ounce the decrease in
grade and recovery represents a US$341 per ounce increase in
the cash cost.  The remaining increase of US$123 per ounce is
attributable to the increase in cash cost per tonne as previously
outlined.
The table below provides a reconciliation between cost of
sales, operating expenses and cash costs to calculate the cash
cost per ounce sold.

The Group embarked on a significant
exploration campaign during the year.
This was the first such campaign for
almost ten years and in this year we
incurred £2.7 million compared to the
£0.3 million in 2010.
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 26 Administrative Costs
Administrative expenses totalled £2.3 million for the year
ended August 2011 which was a 29% reduction in costs from
the prior year of £3.2 million. The administrative expenses are
those costs associated with maintaining the London office and
the administrative expenses in Fiji not directly attributable to
operating activities. Costs include salaries, office rent,
regulatory, audit, legal fees and investor related expenses. The
decrease is primarily due to a £1.3 million re-assignment of
Fijian administrative costs to overhead costs. The London
administrative expenses increased by £0.4 million compared to
last year as a result of increased salary expenses and
increased travel expenses associated with investor relations,
and increased site supervision in the last quarter of the year.
Exploration and Evaluation Costs
As highlighted in the exploration review, the Group embarked
on a significant exploration campaign during the year. This was
the first such campaign for almost ten years and in this year we
incurred £2.7 million compared to the £0.3 million in 2010. All
the exploration and evaluation costs were capitalised as an
Intangible Asset in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 6
Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets.
Taxation and Other Expenses
During the year the Group had a tax credit of £1.6 million
(2010: £0.8 million). This tax credit arises as a result of the
release of the deferred tax liability.  The year on year change is
predominantly due to a change in the UK corporation tax rates,
which decreased the deferred tax liability by £1.0 million in the
current year.
Other expenses amounted to £0.4 million in 2011 down from
£1.1 million in the previous year. This decrease was primarily
due to credits to inventory obsolescence and doubtful debts of
£0.4 million in this year as opposed to a debit of £0.4 during
the same period last year. A charge of £0.8 million (2010: £0.7
million) was incurred as a result of the issue of share options
issued to staff employed in Fiji and the United Kingdom.
EBITDA
EBITDA for the year ended 31 August 2011 decreased to £2.2
million from £8.9 million in the prior year. This decrease was
driven by lower grades delivered to the mill and increases in
unit mining costs; this decrease was partly offset by increase in
the average gold price achieved during the year.
A reconciliation between net profit for the period and EBITDA
is presented below.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 27 Basic Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share for the year ended 31 August 2011 was
2.76 pence compared to basic earnings per share of 6.32
pence. This decrease was driven by the net loss for the year.
Cash Flow
Net cash used in operating activities was £2.3 million for year,
an decrease of £6.4 million on the prior year (cash generated of
£4.1 million). Prior to working capital the net operating income
was £1.7 million compared to £8.6 million in the previous year,
this reduction was due to lower EBITDA. The net operating
income before changes in working capital was further reduced
by the changes in working capital which used £2.4 million
(2010 £4.4 million). These changes in working capital were a
result of an increase in store consumables, increases in the
value of the gold in circuit, increases in trade receivables and
prepayments on capital and operating expenditure.
Cash flow used in investing activities equated to £11.0 million
for the year which represents an 9% increase from the prior
year of £10.1 million. Of the £11.0 million used in investing
activities £6.5 million (2010: £6.2 million) was used in the
purchase of plant and equipment and £4.6 million (2010: £3.9
million) was used in underground development and exploration
activities. The continued investment in the Vatukoula Gold Mine
represents the continued capital expenditure required to
achieve our production growth strategy and in the long term
our expansion strategy.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended the 31
August 2011 was £7.3 million (2010: £17.7 million). The large
majority (£6 million) of this relates to a placing carried out in
June 2011 which was further increased by the exercise of
options and warrants during the year. At the 31 August 2011
the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £6.9 million (2010:
£12.8 million).
Financial Position
Intangible assets increased from £33.7 million in 2010 to £34.1
million in 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to the
increase of exploration and evaluation costs which totalled
£2.7 million. This increase was offset by the amortisation of the
intangible mining asset recognised on acquisition of the
Vatukoula Gold Mine in April 2008. The net book value of plant
property equipment and mine properties development was
£30.5 million (2010: £25.1 million). The main capital
expenditure drivers being those outlined in the cash flow used
in investing in activities section above, these were offset by
depreciation charges of £3.6 million (2010: £2.2 million). 
Total assets increased from £82.9 million in 2010 to £87.7
million in 2011. The increase is, for the large part, due to an
increased amount of tangible assets as well as increases in
inventories and trade and other receivables. These increases
were offset by decreases in the intangible asset and cash and
cash equivalents.
Total current and non-current liabilities for the year ended 31
August 2011 were £12.3 million, a decrease of £2.2 million form
the balance of £14.5 million in 2010. This decrease is mainly
due to the £1.6 million release of the deferred tax liability
recognised on the acquisition of the Vatukoula Gold mine in
April 2008.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Non-IFRS Measures
The Group has identified certain measures in this report that are not measures as
defined under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures disclosed by the directors and
management are provided to shareholders as additional information in order to provide
them with an alternative method of assessing the Group’s financial condition and
operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for IFRS,
and may be different from or inconsistent with non-IFRS measures used by other
companies. These measures are explained below.
Average realised gold price is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated by
dividing the total revenue for the year by the total ounces sold during the year and
converting the GB£ value to US$ at the average foreign exchange rate over the year.
EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. The group calculates EBITDA as (loss)/profit for the
period excluding:
� Income tax credits or expense
� Finance expense
� Finance income
� Depreciation and amortisation charges; and
� Goodwill impairment charges
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts. It does
not have a standard definition under IFRS and other companies may calculate EBITDA
differently. Refer to page 27 as part of the financial review section for a reconciliation of
profit to EBITDA.  EBITDA should not be considered a substitute or in isolation for
measures of performance as prepared in accordance with IFRS, as it excludes the
impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes and the changes of working
capital balances,
Cash cost per ounce sold / per tonne mined and milled are non-IFRS financial
measures. Cash costs include all costs associated with mining and processing the unit
of measure, inclusive of all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as royalties,
production taxes and mine overheads/administrative costs. The cash costs exclude
foreign exchange gains, depreciation and amortisation expenses, impairment charges,
inventory obsolesces, rehabilitation charges, doubtful debts and share based
payments. These cash costs are aggregated and divided by either ounces of gold sold
or the tonnes mined and milled to reach the relevant non-IFRS financial measure.
Operating cash flow per share is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated by
dividing the Net cash (used) / generated in operating activities by the weighted average
number of Ordinary Shares in issue.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Overview Performance Governance
Financial Statements
& Other Information
We need to maintain these relationships to
help us ensure a stable operating environment
and allow access to our exploration assets.
Community Relations
The Vatukoula Gold Mine has under previous owners had
some issues with its community relations. Over the course of
2011 there has been an improvement in the relationships
between our Company and our local stakeholders. The main
ways we have been doing this have been:
a) regular engagement with the local communities, allowing 
open and frank discussions and respecting  stakeholders 
concerns;
b) maximising the communities’ opportunity to benefit from 
employment and local procurement; and
c) developing a long-term plan to assist local communities to 
pursue their own socio-economic priorities.
Some of the main material contributions we make to the local
community are; the provision of subsidised power and water,
sponsorship of local sporting clubs and events, renovation or
construction of staff housing (47 houses) and the contribution
of F$6 million to the Vatukoula Social Assistance Trust Fund.
Management expect that the conclusion of the Vatukoula
Social Assistance Trust Fund is imminent, the Trust
implementation documents having been approved by the
Cabinet of the Government of Fiji.  The trustees are expected
to administer the F$6 million dollars of assistance contributed
by the Group for the benefit of those employees still redundant
after the former owners of the Vatukoula Gold Mine ceased
operations in December 2006. 
Health and Safety
Safety is a top priority for mine management.  During the year
under review we experienced a Lost Time Injury Frequency
Rate (“LTIFR”) of 13 per 1 million man hours worked. This is
extremely commendable in the high risk environment of an
underground gold mine.  Safety in the workplace is regarded as
a top priority at all times.  We insist that all our employees work
according to stringent safety practices and we are all working
toward our target of a zero LTIFR.  
Environment
Over the year we have developed a comprehensive
environmental policy, which will be implemented over the
coming year. The policy was developed and will be reviewed
by independent third parties. Current reporting systems and
procedures record all significant environmental impacts and
track our remedial and preventative measures.
One of the key consumables at the mine is energy which
currently is provided by fossil fuels. We have been examining
opportunities to reduce our reliance on diesel power
generation; in particular we are looking to establish an off-take
agreement or joint venture with the FSC. The FSC have
completed a feasibility study on the commissioning of a bio-
fuel (sugar cane waste and wood chip) co-generation power
plant. Construction is scheduled to begin in calendar 2013
subject to finance.
We believe that to operate
effectively and profitably VGM
needs to establish mutually
beneficial relationships within the
community in which we operate.

AMC Consultants Pty Ltd (“AMC”) completed a Mineral Resource
Estimate for VGM using geological and assay data available at 30
March 2011. The data supplied by VGM allowed AMC to
generate a constrained grade model and estimate a Mineral
Resource. AMC estimated the Mineral Resources using the
end of June 2011 surveyed face positions. The Mineral
Resources at 31 August 2011 were estimated by subtracting
the production for the months of July and August 2011.
The VGM Mineral Resource estimate is classified into
Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources based on
the current drillhole spacing, quality of the drilling information
and confidence in the geological controls on the gold
mineralisation and grade continuity. The Mineral Resource
estimate includes Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources
that will convert to Ore Reserves on application of modifying
factors.

COG of 2 grams of gold per tonne were applied to the 
resource models to obtain the estimated Mineral Resources.
� The Mineral Resource models were depleted for mining to 
31 August 2011, using surveyed mine outlines to 30 June 
2011 and production figures for July and August 2011 
� The Mineral Resource models use geological and assay 
data available at 15 April 2011.
� The mineralised envelope was defined using geological 
logging and assay information from diamond drillholes 
using a nominal lower gold cut-off grade of 1 m·g/t Au.
� Extrapolation of the interpreted mineralised structure was 
limited to 20m to 50m between section lines and 5m to 
25m at the ends of each section.
� Samples are prepared and analysed by fire assay using a 
25g charge at the on-site laboratory.
� In situ density data was available from drillhole sampling. 
Densities were assigned to each of the modelled structures
based on the average results from all available samples.
� The estimation method used 3D wireframe and block 
modelling projected to a 2D plane, with ordinary kriging 
interpolation. A grade variable (the product of the 
horizontal or vertical intercept width and grade) was 
estimated using modelled semi-variograms and 
geostatistical analysis to determine kriging search 
parameters. The intercept width was estimated separately 
and the grade back-calculated.
� Grade times thickness top-cutting was applied in 
calculating the grade times thickness variable.
� The metallurgical response for the orebodies is well 
understood from actual production. No recovery factors 
were applied to the Mineral Resource estimate.
Tailings Mineral Resource
The Tailings Mineral Resource estimate is an estimate
developed by CSA Global (“CSA”).  In March 2008, CSA
compiled an independent Competent Persons Report titled "An
Independent Competent Persons report for River Diamonds
PLC covering the Vatukoula Gold Mine in Fiji, the Panguma
Prospect in Sierra Leone and the Rio Novo Gold Prospect in
Brazil" ("CSA CPR"), for inclusion in the application for
readmission to trading on the Alternative Investment Market
("AIM") of the London Stock Exchange.
� The CSA CPR reported the 2006 Mineral Resources, 
including the Tailings Mineral Resource, according to the 
JORC Code. No further estimates or data is available at the
time of this report. AMC cannot verify the estimate and 
allocate a low reliability to the estimate.
� The Tailings Mineral Resource is 200,000 ounces of gold, 
and approximately 10% of the total Measured and 
Indicated Mineral Resources at VGM. AMC believes that 
the Tailings Mineral Resource may provide an opportunity 
to improve the output of the operation, but also believes 
the relevance of the Tailings Mineral Resource is low. VGM 
plans to review the tailings resource in conjunction with the 
results of exploration programmes currently under way, to 
determine the preferred means to extract the contained 
gold. VGM production plans do not include the Tailings 
Mineral Resource pending this review and conversion of 
mineral resources to ore reserves.
Overall there has been an increase in 201,000 ounces from the
2010 Mineral Resources. These changes are attributable to:
� reductions due to depletion of the models between faces – 
126,000 ounces of gold.
� additions due to reinterpretation of previously modelled 
mineralised structures – 214,000 ounces of gold.
� additions due to modelling of additional mineralised 
structures – 113,000 ounces of gold.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 34 Ore Reserve Statement
Based on the mine design generated by AMC and within the
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource portions of the
underground VGM deposits, AMC estimated a Proved and
Probable Ore Reserve of 3.3 Mt at 7.5 grams of gold per tonne
for contained gold of 0.79 Moz using a gold price of
US$1400/oz with a 4.48 grams of gold per tonne cut-off.
The methodology used to determine the 2011 ore reserve
estimate required stopes to be split into panels to allow some
stopes to be partially mined such that only the panels with
reserve classification were considered. Access development to
the reserve stopes has been added to the mine plan if the
panels meets the reserve classification. 
The VGM Ore Reserve estimate is classified and reported in
the Mineral Reserve Table below in accordance with the 2004
JORC Code.
The reduction in Ore Reserve estimate from the 2010 estimate
is mainly attributable to mining depletion over the past year,
with some minor additions due to changes in the stope
designs and cut-off grade.
Mineral Resources were converted to Ore Reserves
recognising the level of confidence in the Mineral Resource
estimate and reflecting any modifying factors. Ore Reserves
are included in the Mineral Resources estimate throughout this
report.
The metal prices, grades, recoveries and costs were used to
identify mineable blocks to be included in the Ore Reserve
estimate. The metal prices and exchange rate used in the
Ore Reserve estimate are:
� Gold: US$1400/oz
� Exchange Rate: F$1.00 = US$0.54.
The underground Ore Reserve estimates comprise the portions
of the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for which
the appropriate mine planning has been undertaken and can
be economically mined. The Ore Reserves are derived from the
Mineral Resources by application of cut-off grades, stoping
heights, dilution factors and extraction ratio.
The Proved Ore Reserve estimate is based on Mineral
Resources classified as Measured, while the Probable Ore
Reserve estimate is based on Mineral Resources classified as
Indicated after consideration of all mining, metallurgical, social,
environmental, statutory and financial aspects of the project.
The Ore Reserve statement is based on information compiled
by Mr Junior Oding under the direct supervision of Mr David
Lee. Mr Oding and Mr Lee are both Members of the
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and full-time
employees of AMC Consultants Pty Ltd. Mr Lee has sufficient
relevant experience to be a Competent Person as defined by
the JORC Code.
The following notes highlight assumptions used to estimate
the VGM Ore Reserve estimate:
� Cut-off grade of 4.48 grams of gold per tonne.
� Minimum stope mining width of 1.07m.
� 10% stope mining dilution.
� 95% development recovery
AMC estimated the Ore Reserves using the end of June 2011
surveyed face positions. The Ore Reserve at 31 August 2011
was estimated by subtracting the production for the months of
July and August 2011.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 36 The directors are pleased to present this year’s annual report together with the consolidated and company
financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2011.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group was the operation of the Vatukoula Gold Mine in Fiji as described on page 1 of the Business
Review.  The principal activity of the Company was that of a holding Company for its subsidiary undertakings, which are set
out in Note 15 of the financial statements.
Results and dividends
The loss on ordinary activities of the Group for the year ended 31 August 2011 after taxation was £2.3 million (2010:  profit of
£4.5 million).
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend.
Business review
A review of the current and future development of the Group’s business is given in the business review section of this report on
pages 3 to 42.
Given the nature of business and industry the key performance indicators are based on financial and operational objectives set
at the beginning of the year.  Performance in relation to these is highlighted on pages 16 and 17.
The Business Review sets out a comprehensive review of the development and performance of VGM's business for the year
ended 31 August 2011 and the future developments. The Business Review is set out on pages 3 to 42 of this annual report. All
information detailed in these pages is incorporated by reference into this Directors' Report and is deemed to form part of this
Directors' Report.
Corporate Governance Statement
The corporate governance statement set out on page 41 is incorporated by reference into this Directors' Report and is
deemed to form part of this Directors' Report.
Post balance sheet events
At the date these financial statements were approved, being 12 December 2011, the directors were not aware of any
significant post balance sheet events other than those set out in Note 32 of the financial statements.  
Future developments
A review of our future developments is given in the Review by the Chief Executive Officer on pages 10 to 13. 
Financial risk management 
The Group’s operations expose it to financial risks that include liquidity risk, interest rate and foreign exchange risk. The Group
does not use derivative financial instruments to manage any of these risks nor is hedge accounting applied.  
The Group depends on the Vatukoula Gold Mine for a substantial portion of its revenue and cash flow and, therefore, the
Group’s business will be harmed if VGM’s revenues are adversely affected. A review of this risk is given in our Risk
Management section on pages 30 to 32. 
Given the size of the Group, the directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to a
sub-committee of the board.  The Group’s finance department implements the policies set by the board of directors.  Further
details of the Group’s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments held are provided in note 25.
Liquidity risk
The Group actively manages its working finance to ensure the Group has sufficient funds for operations and planned
expansion. As referred to in Note 3 of the financial statements, it is for this reason that the directors believe it is appropriate to
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Interest rate cash flow risk
Interest bearing assets are only cash balances that earn interest at a floating rate. The Group does not have any variable rate
debt and therefore it is not exposed to interest rate cash flow risk on its debt.

Policy on payment of creditors
The Company seeks to maintain good terms with all of its trading partners.  It does not follow any specific code or standard on
payment practice. However, it is the company's policy to agree appropriate terms and conditions for its transactions with
suppliers, to ensure that the suppliers are made aware of those terms and, provided the supplier has complied with its
obligations, to abide by the terms of payment agreed.  Trade creditor days of the Group for the year ended 31 August 2011
were 33 days (2010: 56 days).
Related Party Transactions
Details of related party transactions during the year are set out at note 27 to the financial statements.
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a
reasonable expectation that the company and the group as a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future.  For this reason the directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.  Further details are provided in note 3.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution proposing that Mazars LLP be re-appointed will be
put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with EU endorsed
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), interpretations from the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS. Company law requires directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit and loss for that period.  In preparing the
financial statements, directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, comparable, understandable and prudent;
� ensure the financial statements comply with IFRS;
� prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper books of account which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

DIRECTOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED)
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 40 Compliance with UK Corporate Governance Code 
The directors recognise the value of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance that was issued in 2010 by the Financial
Reporting Council and whilst under AIM rules full compliance is not required, the directors believe that the Company applies
the Main Principles insofar as is practicable and appropriate for a public company of its size.
Outlined below is a summary of how the company applies the Main Principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Board of Directors
The board of directors comprises three executive directors, one of whom is the Chairman, and four non-executive directors.
The directors are of the opinion that the board comprises a suitable balance and that the recommendations of the Combined
Code have been implemented to an appropriate level.  The board, through the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director
in particular, maintains regular contact with its advisers and public relations consultants in order to ensure that the board
develops an understanding of the views of major shareholders about the company.
Board Meetings
In addition to ad hoc meetings arranged to discuss particular transactions and events and the AGM, the full board met six
times during the year ending 31 August 2011.  The board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the
Company's strategy, financial activities and operating performance.  Day to day management is devolved to the executive
directors who are charged with consulting the board on all significant financial and operational matters.  Consequently
decisions are made promptly and following consultation amongst the directors concerned where necessary and appropriate.
All necessary information is supplied to the directors on a timely basis to enable them to discharge their duties effectively, and
all directors have access to independent professional advice, at the company's expense, as and when required.
The Chief Executive Officer is available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any issues and concerns regarding
the Group's governance.  The non-executive directors can also attend meetings with major shareholders if requested.
The participation of both private and institutional investors at the Annual General Meeting is welcomed by the board.
Internal controls
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company's and the Group's systems of internal control, which are
designed to safeguard the assets of the Group and ensure the reliability of financial information for both internal use and
external publication.  Overall control is ensured by a regular detailed reporting system covering both technical progress of a
project and the state of the group's financial affairs.  The board has put in place procedures for identifying, evaluating and
managing any significant risks that face the group.
Any system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be
detected or that the risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated.  The directors, having reviewed the effectiveness of
the system of internal financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management, consider that the system of internal
control operated effectively throughout the financial year and up to the date the financial statements were signed.
Committees
Each of the following committees has its own terms of reference.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the non-executive directors.  Its terms of reference indicate at least two regular meetings per
year. The audit committee has met twice during the year.  The Audit Committee's primary responsibilities are to review the
effectiveness of the company's systems of internal control, to review with the external auditors the nature and scope of their
audit and the results of the audit, and to evaluate and select external auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Audit Remuneration Committee comprises the non-executive directors.  It plans to meet at least twice in each year.  The
Remuneration Committee has met twice during the year. 
The Company's policy is to remunerate senior executives fairly in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and
motivation of staff.  The Remuneration Committee agrees with the board a framework for the remuneration of the chairman, the
executive directors and the senior management of the company.  The principal objective of the Committee is to ensure that
members of the executive management of the Company are provided incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are,
in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.  Non-executive
fees are considered and agreed by the board as a whole.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2011
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 50 1. General information
Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc. is registered in England and Wales under number 5059077. The Company is governed by its articles
of association and the principal statute governing the Company is the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s registered office is
situated at 5th floor, Carmelite, Victoria Embankment, Blackfriars, London, EC4Y 0LS. The company is listed on the AIM market
of the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the Group’s and Company’s operations and principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 37.
2. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc. and all its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use by the European Union.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements are
presented in Pounds Sterling (GBP) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when otherwise
indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and Company in the preparation of the financial statements are set out
below.
The Board has reviewed the accounting policies set out in the financial statements and considers them to be most appropriate
to the Group’s business.
These financial statements are presented in sterling. Group revenues are in US dollars. Given that the Fijian dollar is not widely
used as a reporting currency and that the parent company is listed in the United Kingdom it is deemed appropriate for the
presentation currency of the Group to be in sterling.
Statement of Compliance with IFRS
The Group’s and Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS and IFRIC interpretations) as adopted by the European Union.
New accounting standards
The group and company adopted IFRS 2(Amended): Group Settled Share-based Payments. Share options issued by the
company to employees of a subsidiary company are expensed in the subsidiary, and not the holding company. There were no
impacts in the adoption of this standard as prior to the current year all share options were only issued to employees of the
company and not in any subsidiaries.
There was no material effect of other IFRS’s, IAS’s and IFRIC’s that came into effect in the year, as these new or amended
standards, amendments and interpretations s did not apply to operations of the Group and the Company.
The group and the company have not applied the following standard, amendments and interpretations that are applicable
and have been issued, but are not yet effective.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2011
Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 52 3. Summary of significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”).
Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to
obtain benefits from its activities.
With the exception of foreign exchange variances on inter-company finance balances, inter-company transactions, balances
and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used
in line with those used by the Group.
(b) Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set
out in the Business Review section of this report. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and
borrowing facilities are described in the financial review. In addition note 25 to the financial statements include the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives and details of its financial
instruments and it its exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
In assessing the Groups going concern the Directors have taken into account the above factors, including the financial position
of the Group and in particular its cash position, the current gold price and market expectation for the same over the medium
term, and the Groups capital expenditure and financing plans.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in gold price, mining costs and the
concentration of the gold in the ore delivered to the mill; show that the Group should be able to operate using its current cash
position. The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual
financial statements.
(c) Business combinations
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of the
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred are
expensed and included in administrative expenses. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that
meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition
date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non
Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Where there is a difference between the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities and the cost of the business combination, any excess cost is recognised in the statement of financial
position as goodwill and any excess net fair value is recognised immediately in the profit or loss as negative goodwill on
acquisition of subsidiary. The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest
proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
(d) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from
those involving estimations and assumptions, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the
consolidated financial statements:
1. Income taxes (see note 9)
The Group is subject to income taxes in the United Kingdom, Fiji and Brazil. Significant judgement is required in determining
the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from
the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in
which such determination is made
2. Mineral Resources and Reserves
Quantification of mineral resources requires a judgement on the reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
Quantification of ore reserves requires a judgement on whether mineral resources are economically mineable. These

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 53 3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
judgements are based on the assessment of mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and
governmental factors involved, in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources
and Ore Reserves. These factors are a source of uncertainty and changes could result in an increase or decrease in mineral
resources and ore reserves. This would in turn affect certain amounts in the financial statements such as amortisation,
rehabilitation provisions which are calculated on a projected life of mine figures.
3. Provisions and Contingent Liabilities (notes 21 & 28)
Judgements are made as to whether a past event has led to a liability that should be recognised in the financial statements or
disclosed as a contingent liability. Quantifying any such liability often involves judgements and estimations. These judgements
are based on a number of factors including the nature of the claim or dispute, the legal process and potential amount payable,
legal advice received, previous experience and the probability of a loss being realised. Several of these factors are a source of
estimation uncertainty.
4. Inventory Valuations
Valuations of gold stockpiles, gold in circuit and gold within the fine ore bin requires estimations of the amount contained
in, and the recovery rates from, the various work in progress gold circuits. These estimations are based on analysis of
samples and prior experience. A judgement is also applied when the gold in circuit will be recovered and what gold price should
be applied in calculating the net realisable value; these are both sources of uncertainty.
Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires the application of estimates and assumptions on future events, which
affects assets and liabilities at the reporting date and income and expenditure for the period. The estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.
The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:
5. Share-based payment transactions (see note 19)
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-
Scholes model is particularly sensitive to volatility calculation. Therefore any change in the methodology of the calculation
of volatility will impact the amount expensed as share based payments on the statement of comprehensive income.
The value expensed on the statement of comprehensive income is £808,000 (2010: £665,000)
6. Intangible assets (see note 12)
Amortisation
Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortised over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s
estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued
appropriateness. Due to the long lives of assets, changes to the estimates used can result in significant variances in the
carrying value.
The Group assesses the impairment of intangible assets subject to amortisation or depreciation whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that
could trigger an impairment review include the following:
- significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
- significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and
- significant negative industry or economic trends.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the
application of the Group’s accounting estimates in relation to intangible assets affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements, especially the estimates of the expected useful economic lives and the carrying values of those assets. If
business conditions were different, or if different assumptions were used in the application of this and other accounting
estimates, it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported in the Group’s financial statements. In particular it
would affect, the value of the intangible asset and rehabilitation provisions.
The carrying value at the reporting date of the intangible assets is £34,057,000 (2010: 33,724,000)

7. Mine Rehabilitation Provisions
Such provisions require a judgement on likely future obligations, based on assessment of technical, legal and economic
factors. The ultimate cost of environmental remediation is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many
factors, including changes in the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques and changes
to the life of mine. Changes to any of these costs will affect amounts in the financial statement such, the mine asset and
the provision for mine rehabilitation.
The carrying value at the reporting date of the mine rehabilitation provision is £4,092,000 (2010: 4,220,000)
8. Allowance for doubtful debts (see note 17)
Each receivable balance is assessed to determine recoverability. Provisions are made for those debtors where evidence
indicates that recoverability is doubtful. Amounts are written off when they are deemed irrecoverable. Any changes to
estimates made in relation to debtors recoverability may result in materially different amounts being reported by the
Group’s financial statements. In particular any changes will affect trade and other receivable as well as the statement of
comprehensive income.
The carrying value at the reporting date of the provision for doubtful debts is £2,768,000 (2010: 3,011,000)
(e) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that all of the following criteria are met:
� the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer;
� neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the 
goods sold has been retained;
� the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
� it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group; and
� the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be measured reliably.
Bullion sales
The transfer of risks and rewards for the sale of the gold bullion is assessed as taking place when the physical possession
is passed to the customer upon collection of the gold bullion from the mining premises. The customer does not have any
right of return subsequent to the physical transfer, and accordingly at this point revenue is recognised.
Finance revenue
Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest rate method. This is a method of calculating
the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective
interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the
financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
(f) Turnover and Segmental Analysis
The reportable segments identified make up all of the Group’s external revenue, which is derived primarily from the sale of
gold. The reportable segments are an aggregation of the operating segments within the Group as prescribed by IFRS 8.
The reportable segments are based on the Group’s management structures and the consequent reporting to the Chief
Operating Decision Maker, the Board of Directors. Our sector results are attributable to unallocated head office corporate
costs, gold production & exploration costs, and other costs. These reportable segments also correspond to geographical
locations such that each reportable segment is in a separate geographic location, i.e.; unattributed head office costs – UK,
gold mining – Fiji, other activities – Brazil.
Income and expenses included in profit or loss for the year are allocated directly or indirectly to the reportable segments.
Expenses allocated as either directly or indirectly attributable comprise: cost of sales, gold duty and administrative
expenses.
Non-current segment assets comprise the non-current assets used directly for segment operations, including intangible
assets, property, plant and equipment and mine properties and development.
Current segment assets comprise the current assets used directly for segment operations, including inventories, trade
receivables, other receivables and pre-payments.
Inter-company balances comprise transactions between operating segments making up the reportable segments. These
balances are eliminated to arrive at the figures in the consolidated accounts.

(g) The Company’s investments in subsidiaries
In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost, less any impairment for
permanent diminution in value. Differences arising from changes in fair values of intercompany loans receivable are treated as
an increase in the investment in the subsidiary.
(h) Foreign currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (“£”), which is the parent company’s functional
currency and the Group’s presentation currency. Each entity in the Group determines it own functional currency and items
included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc. at the rate of exchange ruling at the
reporting date and their Statements of Comprehensive Income are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The
exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. All other differences arising
on translation are included in the profit or loss except for exchange differences arising on nonmonetary assets and liabilities
where the changes in fair values are recognised directly in equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Exchange differences recognised in profit or loss of Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of
long-term monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to
the foreign exchange reserve. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign
exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the Statements of Comprehensive
Income as part of the profit or loss.
(i) Goodwill on acquisition
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or
jointly controlled entity recognised at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to
benefit from synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in
subsequent periods.
(j) Inventories
Ore stock, consisting of stocks on which further processing is required to convert them to trading stocks, is valued at the
lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using a weighted average cost model, where inventories are
valued at the weighted average cost of the closing inventory. Net realisable value is estimated selling price less the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Other inventories include:
(i) Stores, comprising plant spares and consumable stores, are valued on the basis of weighted average cost after providing 
for obsolescence.
(ii) Work in progress is valued on the basis of first in first out and includes direct costs, depreciation and amortisation.
(iii) Insurance spares are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Insurance spares are critical spare parts to 
equipment, that although may not be required on a regular basis are kept in inventory because, should a particular piece of 
equipment fail it would materially adversely affect production.
Gold in circuit
Gold in circuit is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct material, labour and
transportation expenditure incurred in getting inventories to their existing location and condition, together with an
appropriate portion of fixed and variable overhead expenditure based on weighted average costs incurred during the
period in which such inventories were produced. Net realisable value is the amount anticipated to be realised from the
sale of inventory in the normal course of business less any anticipated costs to be incurred prior to its sale.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 56 3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(k) Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets, which consist of mining rights and intangible computer software, are valued at cost less
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the units of production method which is calculated over the life
span of the mine. As at 31 August 2011, the estimated remaining life span of the mine is 8 years. This is the entire period
over which currently the mine is being amortised.
The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for exploration and evaluation costs, having regard to the requirements of
IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. All costs associated with mining development and investment are
capitalised on a project by project basis pending determination of the feasibility of the project. Such expenditure comprises
appropriate technical and administrative expenses but not general overheads.
Such exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised provided that the Group’s rights to tenure are current and one of the
following conditions is met:
(i) such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest or
alternatively by its sale; or
(ii) the activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of whether or not economically
recoverable resources exist; or
(iii) active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
When an area of interest is abandoned or the directors decide that it is not commercial, any exploration and evaluation costs
previously capitalised in respect of that area are written off to profit or loss.
Amortisation does not take place until production commences in these areas. Once production commences, amortisation is
calculated on the unit of production method, over the remaining life of the mine.
Impairment assessments are carried out regularly by the directors. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for
impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Such
indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist.
The recoverability of capitalised mining costs and mining interests is dependent upon the discovery of economically
recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of reserves
and future profitable production or proceeds from the disposition of recoverable reserves.
The assets’ residual value and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s
carrying value is written down immediately to its recoverable value if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its listed
recoverable amount.
(l) Tangible assets
(i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets to write down the cost less estimated residual value of each 
asset over its useful economic life on a units of production method or straight line basis. The estimated useful lives are 
as follows:
Freehold land Not depreciated
Plant and machinery Over 3 – 10 years
Mine Asset Life of mine basis
Motor vehicles Over 3 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment Over 4 years
Work in progress Not depreciated
The depreciation charge for each period is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the Work in Progress account. The cost comprises its purchase
price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use, at which point it is
transferred to property, plant and equipment and depreciation commences.
Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised when it is probable that future
economic benefits from the use of the asset will be increased. All other subsequent expenditure is recognised as an
expense in the period in which it is incurred.

Repairs and maintenance which neither materially add to the value of assets nor appreciably prolong their useful lives are
charged against income.
The gain or loss arising from the de-recognition of any items of property, plant and equipment is included in the profit or
loss when the item is de-recognised. The gain or loss arising from the de-recognition of an item of property, plant and
equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
(ii) Mine properties and development (“MPD”)
This represents the accumulated exploration, evaluation, development and acquisition expenditure in relation to areas 
of interest in which economically recoverable reserves exist. Development costs that can be capitalised fall into the 
following categories:
� Initial Capital Development
This includes, but is not restricted to the following:
– Shaft sinking
– Station (plant) development & underground workshops
– Pump station and dams
– Ore and waste pass systems
� Primary Capital Development
This is the development carried out on each level in the exploration and exploitation of a mining area or orebody. It 
includes, but is not restricted to the following:
– Cross cuts, haulages and drives to the orebody
– Initial rises on the orebody to effect the first holdings to facilitate production
– Main airways
� Secondary Capital Development
This is the development carried out within an area in which the primary development has been
completed and which is critical to the continued operation of the mine or mining area. It includes, but is
not restricted to the following:
– Airways, crosscuts and drives
– Pump stations
The capitalised value of mine properties is depreciated on a life of mine basis. The life of mine has been calculated on a
units of production method based on economically recoverable reserves and resources. The depreciation for the period
is calculated using the following:
Recovered gold ounces during the period X Net book value to date plus costs
Economically recoverable reserves and resources capitalised during the period
at the start of the period
The net carrying value of a mine assets is reviewed regularly and, to the extent to which this amount exceeds its
recoverable amount (based on the higher of estimated future net cash flows and the mine’s asset’s current realisable
value) that excess is fully provided against in the financial year in which this is determined.
(m) Provision for mine rehabilitation
A provision for rehabilitation is initially recognised at the present value of expected future cash flows when there exists a
constructive obligation for the entity to undertake rehabilitation at the mine site. The increase in the provision for
rehabilitation relating to the unwinding of the discount on the provision to the date of settlement of the provision and the
depreciation of the rehabilitation asset are recorded within profit or loss.

(n) Impairment of intangible and tangible assets excluding goodwill
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows
that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset’s value in use cannot be
estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash-generating unit to
which it belongs. When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset
or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. Impairment
losses of continuing operations are recognised in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired
asset unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount (in which case the impairment is treated as a revaluation decrease).
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated, a
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the
asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is
recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a
revaluation increase. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s
revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
(o) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instruments and on a trade date basis. A financial asset is derecognised when the Group’s contractual rights to future
cash flows from the financial asset expire or when the Group transfers the contractual rights to future cash flows to a third
party. A financial liability is derecognised only when the liability is extinguished.
a. Trade and other receivables and other assets
Trade and other receivables and other assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable
amounts are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when there is objective evidence that the asset is
impaired.
b. Cash and cash equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows, the Group
considers all highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and have a maturity of
three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand,
and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, all of which are available for use by the Group
unless otherwise stated.
c. Investments
Investments included as financial assets are valued at fair value and are held as available for sale. When available for sale
assets are considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to the
profit or loss in the period.
d. Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after
deducting all of its liabilities. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank loans, other
borrowings, convertible loans and obligations under finance leases. All financial liabilities, are recognised initially at their
fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability and
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, unless the effect of discounting would be
insignificant, in which case they are stated at cost.
e. Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

f. Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an
accruals basis to the Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective interest method and are added to the
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
g. Trade payables, provisions and other payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at cost. Other payables which are interest-bearing are measured
at fair value. Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past
event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations, and a reliable estimate of
the amount can be made. Provisions are measured at fair value. Provision has been made in the financial statements for
benefits accruing in respect of sick leave, annual leave, and long service leave.
h. Compound Financial Instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the group comprise convertible loan notes that can be converted to share
capital at the option of the holder, and the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that
does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair
value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly
attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying
amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to
initial recognition except on conversion or expiry.
(p) Financing costs and interest income
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings and finance lease payments and interest income which is
calculated using the effective interest rate method.
(q) Impairment of financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that financial assets, other than those at
fair value through profit or loss, are impaired. The impairment loss of financial assets carried at amortised cost is
measured as the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
(r) Share Capital
Ordinary shares are recorded at nominal value and proceeds received in excess of nominal value of shares issued, if any,
are accounted for as share premium. Both ordinary shares and share premium are classified as equity. Costs incurred
directly to the issue of shares are accounted for as a deduction from share premium, otherwise they are charged to the
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
(s) Taxation
Tax on profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for:
the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business
combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised.

(t) Share-based payments
The Company operates a share option scheme for granting share options, for the purpose of providing incentives and
rewards to eligible employees of the Group. The cost of share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value
at the date at which they are granted.
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in the assumptions about the number of options expected to
vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all the specified vesting
conditions are to be satisfied.
At the end of each reporting period, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest
based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to the original estimate, if any, in the
statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable
transactions costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
(u) Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. It can
also be a present obligation arising from past events that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of
economic resources will be required or the amount of obligation cannot be measured reliably.
A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the accounts. When a change in the probability of
an outflow occurs so that the outflow is probable, it will then be recognised as a provision.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent assets are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the accounts when an inflow of economic benefits
is probable. When an inflow is virtually certain, an asset is recognised.
(v) Leased assets
Operating lease: Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in profit or loss on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
Finance lease: Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership
of the leased item, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at
the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are recognised in finance costs in profit or loss.
(w) Employee benefits
a. Defined contribution plan
Obligations for contributions to the Fiji National Provident Fund are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as they are
due.
b. Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed in profit or loss as the
related service is provided.
c. Long-term employee benefits
Obligations in respect of long-term employee benefits such as long service leave is the amount of future benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine
its present value.
d. Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic
probability of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to
provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for
voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy,
it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be measured reliably. Benefits falling due
more than 12 months if the reporting date are discounted to their present value.

(1,618) (838)
The deferred taxation credit arises on the release of the deferred tax liability (note 31).
During the year, as a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% that was substantively enacted by the
Finance Act 2011 on 5 July 2011, the relevant deferred tax balances have been re-measured at 25%. The Finance Act 2011 has
reduced the main corporation tax rate to 26% from 1 April 2011 and to 25% from 1 April 2012. The Government have indicated
that it will continue to reduce the main corporation tax rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014, but these rates have not
yet been enacted.
The Group has estimated tax benefits in respect of tax losses of £4,595,000 (2010: £4,039,000), of which £3,313,000 (2010:
£4,244,000) will fully expire within 5 years, and other net deferred tax benefits in respect of temporary differences of £685,000
(2010: 2,821,000) which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
10. Loss for the year
The Company’s loss for the year dealt within the accounts of Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc. was £ 2,391,899 (2010 £
2,603,706). As provided by S408 of the Companies Act 2006, no Statement of Comprehensive Income is presented in
respect of Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc.
11. (Loss) / Earnings per share

Basic (loss) / earnings per share is calculated by dividing the (loss) / profit for the year from continuing operations of the Group
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. On the 21st October 2010, the Company proposed
to its shareholders a one for fifty basis consolidation of its share capital. This resolution was approved on the 8 November
2010, and the ordinary shares were consolidated on the basis of one new ordinary share of 5 pence for every existing ordinary
share of 0.1 pence. Comparative numbers for basic earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the share consolidation.
(b) Diluted
In the current year, all potential shares were anti-dilutive as the Group was in a loss making position. As a result diluted loss per
share for the year ended 31 August 2011 is disclosed as the same value as basic loss per share. The diluted weighted average
ordinary shares in issue during the period was 84,015,905.
In the prior year, diluted earnings per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding to assume the conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has two categories of dilutive
potential ordinary shares: convertible loan notes and share options / warrants. The convertible debt is assumed to have been
converted into ordinary shares, and the net profit is adjusted to eliminate the interest expense less the tax effect. For the share
options, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined
as the average annual market share price of the company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights
attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that
would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

All outstanding options and warrants were adjusted appropriately to reflect the share consolidation so that in general terms, the
options or warrants would be exercisable on the basis of one new ordinary share for each 50 existing ordinary shares subject to
the warrant or option and so that the exercise price for each such shares would be 50 times the subscription price for the
existing ordinary shares. Comparative numbers for diluted earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the share
consolidation.

The Mining rights represent the mining rights acquired on the acquisition of the Vatukoula Gold Mine in April 2008. The
amortisation of the Mining Rights is calculated on a unit of production basis, based on forecast production and the total Mineral
Reserves. At the current production, reserves and gold price, the economic useful life is expected to be 8 years. This rate will
vary from year to year and is dependant on the mineral reserves which are reassessed every year. Amortisation is included in
depreciation and amortisation in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
This year the directors carried out an impairment review. As in previous years, this was based on an estimate of discounted
future cash flows from the development and operation of the Vatukoula Gold Mine. The directors have used past experience
and an assessment of future conditions, together with external sources of information, to determine the assumptions which
were adopted in the preparation of a financial model to estimate the cashflows.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 68 12. Intangible assets (continued)
The recoverable amount of the mine is determined by using a net present value calculation based on the estimated
economically recoverable portion of the total Mineral Resource and the life of mine plan. The life of mine plan is currently 15
years (2010: 11 years). This Mineral Resource is used rather than the Mineral Reserve as the Mineral Reserve will not represent
the total recoverable amount from the mine. This is because it excludes ore deposits that are above the economic cut off grade
within the Inferred Mineral Resource category.
The key assumptions therein are those regarding discount rates, and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs
during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the mine and the rate used was 10%.
The production is based on the directors’ forecast of the mine’s maximum output and based on the mine achieving its
operating capacity. The directors believe this rate is justified based on the current progress of the mine. A deferred tax liability
of £10,757,000 arose in 2008 in respect of the intangible assets recognised on the acquisition in the prior periods. The deferred
tax liability is in respect of future taxable profits potentially generated from the exploration of the mining rights (Note 31).
The Exploration expenditure is an internally generated intangible asset, and represents costs associated with the exploration
and evaluation of mineral deposits on our mining and special prospecting licenses and are capitalised under IFRS 6. The
directors believe that there are no indicators of impairment.
The Computer Software expenditure represents the costs associated with the purchase of specialised mining and inventory software.

In April 2007, the Company acquired 1,212,121 new ordinary shares in Lesotho Diamond Corporation for £400,000. The company
was subsequently renamed Global Diamonds Resources (“GDR”). Operations ceased at the mine due to a lack of funding on the
5th of January 2010. During the prior year GDR has gone into liquidation and therefore the Directors of the Company thought it was
appropriate to continue to provide fully for this investment.

of new ordinary shares in Cambrian Forestry Products. In 2004 the Company provided fully for this investment as it was undergoing
restructuring. On 14 April 2009 Cambrian Forestry Products was dissolved.
These investments were initially measured at cost. This is because the directors consider that its fair value could not be measured

Trade receivables are amounts due from the sales of gold. The average credit period taken on sales of goods is two
weeks (2010: two weeks).
The provision for doubtful debts includes £2.5 million (2010: £2.5 million) in relation to the prepayments against the claimed tax
liabilities of F$ 11.5 million by The Fiji Islands Revenue & Customs Authority. The prepayment ceased in December 2008 and none
have been made since this date. However, given the time the court case has been outstanding and that currently there is no date in
the court diaries for this matter to be heard it was thought prudent that the Company provide for any prepayments made in relation
to this tax assessment. The Fiji Islands Revenue & Customs Authority has recognised the prepayment of the claimed tax liability.
The Group has significant concentration of credit risk with its single customer in respect of bullion sales. The Group has credit risk
management policies in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Management generally adopts
conservative strategies and tight control in credit policy.
The following table provides an analysis of trade and other receivables that were past due as at 31 August 2011, but not provided
for, followed by those past due and impaired. Subsequent to the year, all trade receivables of over 93 days have been paid. The
Group believe that all the balances are ultimately recoverable.

The total share-based payment expense in the year for the Group was £807,592 (2010: £664,554 ), and 6,347,112 (2010:
8,389,514) options are exercisable at the year end. No options were forfeited during the year (2010: NIL)
The following table lists the inputs used for the option issues which occurred during the year:

The model used to arrive at the fair value of all the options granted during the year was the Black Scholes option pricing model. The
weighted average fair value of the options granted during the current year was determined as £0.57 per option.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the 7.2 million options outstanding at the balance sheet date is 3.4 years (2010: 4
years). The weighted average share price during the year was £1.59 (2010: £1.10) per share.
The expected volatility of the options reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not
necessarily be the actual outcome. The expected life of the options is based on historical data available at the time of the option
issue and is not necessarily indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The share option scheme and the warrants on issue is an equity settled plan and fair value is measured at the grant date
of the option.

Employee related provisions include a provision for unpaid annual leave based on Fijian labour legislation, and a provision
for legally required workers compensation relating to work injuries. Based on current estimates, these are expected to
realise in approximately 10 years.
The provision for mine rehabilitation represents the current mine closure plan. The present value of the estimated cost is capitalised
as property, plant and equipment. Over time the discounted liability will be increased for the change in the present value based on
the discount rates that reflect the current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. The provision for Mine
Rehabilitation is expected to be expensed over the life of mine which is currently 11 years (2010: 12 years). The life of mine is
dependent on the economic viability of extracting the contained Mineral Resources and may vary on a year by year basis dependant
on the mining / processing costs and the price of Gold. In addition the quantum of the provision may vary on a year by year basis
dependant on the costs associated with executing the Mine Rehabilitation Plan.
Long service leave is a contractual obligation for additional leave days earned by employees with 10 years or more service. Based
on current estimates, these are expected to realise in approximately 10 years.

The Vatukoula Social Assistance Trust Fund (“VSATF”) was established for the purpose of social assistance for the employees made
redundant by the previous mine operator and the local mining community in accordance with the Trust Deed dated 18 December
2009.
The VSATF has been reclassified from a provision to a liability. There remains very little uncertainty regarding the timing and the
amounts payable; therefore a classification as a liability is regarded as more appropriate. Prior year numbers have been represented
to reflect the reclassification in the prior year. The reclassification of the total liability of £1,517,000 had no impact on the Group’s net
asset position at 31 August 2009 or 31 August 2010. As such, a Statement of Financial Position as at 31 August 2009 has not been
presented.

The VSATF is part of the Vatukoula Trust Deed, a binding contract between the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary and
the Fijian Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. A total of F$6 million is payable of which the Group paid F$1.5 million
on 10 March 2010. The remaining F$4.5 million has been allocated to Current and Non Current Liabilities as follows:

The non current portion of the liability has been discounted to the net present value of the future cash flows at £13,000.
24. Convertible loans
(i) On 26 June 2009, the Group issued a fully redeemable convertible loan note for £485,000 repayable in cash 5 years after the 
date of grant. The loan note carries a coupon rate of 11% per annum. The loan note will be convertible at £0.50 equating to 
970,000 shares in Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc. During the year £25,000 (2010: £130,000) of these convertible loan notes were 
converted to 50,000 (2010: 260,000) new ordinary shares in the Company; £2,500 (2010: £13,000) was credited to ordinary share
capital and £22,500 (2010: £117,000) was credited to share premium. £8,000 has been debited from the equity component upon
conversion.
The net proceeds from the issue of the convertible loans have been split between the liability element and an equity

Loans and receivables are measured using the amortised cost method. Available for sale financial instruments are initially
recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each year end, with any change in value recognised
directly in equity, unless the instruments are unable to be reliably fair valued, in which case they are stated at cost.
The Group and Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash
flow interest rate risk. The policies for managing these risks are regularly reviewed and agreed by the Board. It is, and
has been throughout the period under review, the Group and Company’s policy that no trading in financial instruments
should be undertaken.
(i) Currency rate risk
Loans between companies which are members of the Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc group are made in the operating
currency of the lending company. In all other respects, the policy for all group companies is that they only trade in their
principal operating currency, except in exceptional circumstances from time to time.
The Group’s revenue derives from the sale of gold bullion by its Fijian operating subsidiary. Proceeds of gold bullion sales
are received in US Dollars. As the group reports in Sterling, reported revenue is affected by the combination of changes in
the US Dollar/Fijian Dollar and Sterling/Fijian Dollar rates.

(i) Currency rate risk (continued)
The Group’s expenses in Fiji and Brazil are incurred in Fiji Dollars and Reals respectively. Any weakening in the Fijian
Dollar/Reals would result in a reduction in expenses in Sterling terms, which would be to the Group’s advantage. There is an
equivalent downside risk to the group of strengthening in the Fijian Dollar/Reals which would increase Brazilian operating
expenses in Sterling terms. The following table illustrates the allocation of financial instruments across currencies:

The board has assessed its exposure and it does not currently consider the risk of exposure to these currencies to be material.
For currency rate risk, the Company's exposure is not considered to be significant because as it does not hold any financial
instruments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore quantitative information has not been provided.

(ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate exposure arises mainly from cash holdings. Contractual agreements entered into at floating rates expose the
entity to cash flow risk whilst the fixed rate borrowings expose the entity to fair value risk.
The table below shows the Group’s financial assets and liabilities split by those bearing fixed and floating rates and those
that are non-interest bearing.
Class/categories 2011 2010

Convertible loan notes - 341 - - 332 -
The fair value of all financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their short term nature and the fact that
they bear interest at floating rates based on the local bank rate.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31
August 2011 would increase/decrease by £ 93,853 (2010: loss would increase/decrease by £ 69,675 ).
For interest rate risk, the Company's exposure is not considered to be significant as it only holds cash and cash equivalents at
a floating rate and therefore quantitative information has not been provided.
(iii) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Credit exposure is measured on a Group and
Company basis. The Group and Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk relating to its financial assets is given in Note 17.
(iv) Gold price risk
The Group’s policy is to sell gold at spot. The Group is exposed to gold price risk through gold price fluctuations.
An increase/decrease of 25% in the spot price of gold at 31 August 2011, with all other variables held constant, would
have the following impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income and equity at 31 August 2011:

(v) Liquidity risk
Responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has established appropriate liquidity risk
frameworks for the management of the Group’s and Company’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management
requirements. The Group and Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The following table details the Group’s maturity profiles of its financial assets and liabilities. The table has been drawn up
based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required
to pay. The table includes both interest and principle cash flows:

Trade and other payables 4,229 - 4,308 -
Convertible loan notes - 341 - 332

For liquidity risk , the Company's exposure is not considered to be significant as its only non-current financial liability is the
convertible loan note and the maturity profile information is provided within the Group’s analysis above.
(vi) Capital risk
The Group’s capital management objectives (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit
rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. The
Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic
objectives of the company. Given the nature of early stage mining operations, the Group has been predominantly funded by
equity. However once the mining operations are at a sufficiently advanced stage the Group may fund further expansion via debt.
The Group includes within net debt borrowings, convertible loans, trade and other payables, less cash and short term deposits.

To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares or return capital shareholders. No changes
were made in the objectives, polices or processes during the year ending 31 August 2010 and 31 August 2011. During the
year the Group funded the expansion of the operations at the mine predominantly via the issue of equity. The board
thought this was the most appropriate means of funding given the stage of development of the Group, and the risks
associated with the development of the Vatukoula Gold Mine.

£’000 £’000
Immigration bond -3
Mining bond 4 -
Bankers undertaking 207 199

Both the mining bond and the bankers undertaking are contingent liabilities to cover remediation or rehabilitation costs 
associated with any environmental breaches of the Special Site Rights. There have been no breaches to date, and 
depending on future events, it remains uncertain if these liabilities will realise or suffice.
(b) The Fiji Islands Revenue & Customs Authority (“FIRCA”) has issued taxation assessments against the Group of
F$11.5million. The Group does not believe any amounts are payable and is vigorously defending the claim. No amounts
have been provided in the accounts in respect of this claim. As at year end, advance tax payment of F$7.9m has been
made in relation to this. The government has recognised the prepayment of the claimed tax liability, however given the
period of time these debts have been outstanding, the Company has taken a prudent view and provided for the debts (Note
17). The expected timing and amounts of cash outflows remain uncertain.
(c) The Group is a plaintiff in several litigations with respect to potential claims of creditors, workers compensation and
industrial action. The directors have assessed the likelihood of these claims becoming payable and consider that
this is not likely. Therefore there are no provision or contingent liabilities disclosed for these.
31. Deferred taxation
Movements in deferred taxation during the year are as follows:
Group 2011 2010
£’000 £’000

The deferred tax liability was in respect of the intangible assets recognised in the acquisition in a prior period (Note 12).
32. Post balance sheet events
There were no significant post balance sheet events subsequent to the year end.

1. Holders of Ordinary Shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Shareholders 
are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A
Shareholder can appoint the chairman of the meeting or anyone else to be his/her proxy at the meeting. A proxy need not be a
Shareholder. More than one proxy can be appointed in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise
the rights attached to a different ordinary share or shares held by that Shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, the Form of
Proxy should be photocopied and completed for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be written on the Form of
Proxy together with the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is authorised to act. If such is the case please indicate
that the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All Forms of Proxy must be signed and, to be effective,
must be lodged with the Company’s registrar (Capita Registrars, Proxies, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent
BR3 4TU) so as to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, or in the case of an adjournment 48 hours
before the adjourned time.
2. The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a Shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes 
to do so.
3. Only Shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the 
meeting shall be entitled to attend the AGM either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered in
their respective names shall determine the number of votes such persons are entitled to cast on a poll at the AGM.
4. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that (i) if a 
corporate Shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in
accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that Shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll
those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as
corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same
corporate Shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate Shareholder has not appointed the chairman of the meeting as its
corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who
attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate
representative. Corporate Shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance
includes a sample form of appointment letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.

No directors have been appointed since the last annual general meeting and this year the following directors are required
to retire by rotation. Each, being eligible, will be proposed for re-election:
D K Paxton, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) age 57
Mr Paxton is a professional engineer with over 36 years’ experience in the mining industry, starting with mine production
at Goldfields of South Africa, and then time at their head office and culminating with 24 years as a mining analyst. As a
mining analyst he has worked for a number of Canadian and UK stockbrokers, most recently Religare Hichens Harrison
Plc.
K C Morzaria, Finance Director, age 37
Mr Morzaria holds a Bachelor of Engineering (Industrial Geology) from the Camborne School of Mines and an MBA
(Finance) from CASS Business School. He has 12 years of experience in the mineral resource industry covering gold and
diamonds. Mr Morzaria spent his first four years in exploration, mining and civil engineering working for Highland Gold,
Firestone Diamonds and CL Associates. He was appointed Finance Director of Vatukoula Gold Mines Plc. in 2004 and
since then has been overseeing the development of its mining and exploration projects in Fiji, Sierra Leone and Brazil.
Resolution 4 – Auditors
The Company is required at each general meeting at which financial statements are laid to appoint auditors who will
remain in office until the next general meeting at which financial statements are laid. This resolution will, therefore,
propose the reappointment of Mazars LLP as auditors and authorise the Directors to fix their remuneration.
Resolution 5 – Authority to allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 provides that the Directors may not allot shares unless authorised to do so by the
Shareholders. Such a power cannot be granted for longer than five years at any one time and the total nominal value of
shares which can be allotted under the authority must be specified.
To renew the Board’s powers in respect of the allotment and issue of ordinary shares, it is proposed that the Directors be
granted unconditional authority, in substitution for the existing authority granted by shareholders at the Company’s
general meeting held on 11 April 2011, to allot and issue or to agree to allot and issue Ordinary Shares up to a nominal
value of £1,475,972 (29,519,446 Ordinary Shares) at any time before the expiry of 15 months from the Annual General
Meeting, or, if earlier, on the date of the following annual general meeting. This represents approximately one third of the
Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital as at the date of this notice and which complies with the guidelines issued by
the Association of British Insurers and representative bodies of institutional investors.
Resolution 6 - Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
This resolution, which is in substitution for the authority granted to the directors at the Company’s annual general meeting
held on 11 April 2011, is to grant the power to the Directors to allot equity securities for cash without first offering such
shares pro-rata to existing Shareholders in accordance with the statutory rights of pre-emption.
This authority will allow the directors to (a) issue equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of
£1,475,972 (29,519,446 Ordinary Shares) and (b) otherwise implement an offer of equity securities, whether by the
Company or another person, open for acceptances for a fixed period without complying fully with the pre-emption
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. This represents approximately 30% of the Company’s issued ordinary share
capital as at the date of this notice and therefore exceeds the 5% disapplication recommended in the guidelines issued
by the Association of British Insurers and representative bodies of institutional investors. The proposed disapplication is
however in line with other AIM listed companies that are similar to the Company and recognises that the professional
costs of a pre-emptive share issue would be disproportionate to the net funds raised. 
If granted, the authority will expire 15 months after the annual general meeting, or, if earlier, on the date of the next annual
general meeting.

Notes
1. Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not
be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in person) of his own choice to attend and to vote in his/her place.
2. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You 
may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy you may
photocopy this form. Please indicate each proxy’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to
act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy
instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same
envelope.
3. If you wish to appoint a proxy other than the Chairman, delete the words “the Chairman of the Meeting or,” initial the alteration 
and insert the name of the person you wish to appoint as your proxy.
4. All members are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting, whether or not they have returned a form of proxy.
5. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box with an 'X'. To abstain from voting on a resolution, 
select the relevant "Vote withheld" box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the
calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his
or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put
before the meeting.
6. If a member is a corporation, this form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or by the signature of an officer or 
attorney duly authorised in writing.
7. In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one holder will be sufficient, but the names of all joint holders should be stated, 
and the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote will be accepted to the exclusion of the vote(s) of other joint holder(s),
seniority being determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members of the Company.
8. In order to be valid, this Form of Proxy, duly executed together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is 
signed, or a notarially certified or office copy of such power or authority, must be lodged at the Company’s Registrars (Capita
Registrars, Proxies, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU) not less than 48 hours before the time of
the meeting or any adjournment of the meeting.
9. The return of a completed Form of Proxy will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in 
person if he/she wishes to do so. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will
automatically be terminated. 
10. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of 
proxies will take precedence.

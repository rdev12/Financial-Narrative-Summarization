 GROWING

MARKET DRIVERS 
Large numbers of Rotork’s products are used in structural 
growth markets which provide essential infrastructure to the 
global economy. These markets have long term investment 
cycles, with new infrastructure needed to support the ever 
increasing demand arising from urbanisation, and growing 
populations that require water, food and energy. The trends 
for greater automation and new technology also drive growth 
in our markets.
Urbanisation
More people now live in cities than rural areas around the 
world and that number is climbing. The trend towards 
urbanisation, particularly in emerging markets, is increasing 
demand for water and energy. Investment in private and 
public sector infrastructure such as power stations, electricity 
grids, water supply and water treatment plants is required to 
meet this growth in demand.
Automation
Businesses and organisations around the world continue to 
require greater automation in their operations to improve 
efficiencies and safety, and increase precision in production. 
Real-time monitoring of plant allows problems to be fixed 
before they escalate, improving safety and optimising asset life. 
Population growth
The growing global population is driving increased demand 
for land, food, energy and water, in a back drop of dwindling 
resources. Investment in new power and water facilities, and 
the refurbishment of existing facilities is necessary to respond 
to this need.
New technologies
There is a growing global demand for innovative products, 
offering improved performance and reliability, and reducing 
environmental impact.

A PIONEERING PRODUCT
The Rotork Skilmatic SI self-contained electro-hydraulic 
valve actuator combines all-electric simplicity with the 
precision of hydraulic actuation and the reliability of 
mechanical fail-safe operation. Typical applications for 
Skilmatic actuators include functional safety related 
emergency shutdown (ESD), and remotely operated 
shutoff valve duties. Communication and data logging 
capabilities have been increased in response to end 
users’ desire to access more valve related data, both in 
the field and in the control room.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
In this my first year as Chairman, Rotork has 
delivered a robust set of results despite 
increasingly difficult trading conditions. 
Although we do not expect conditions to 
improve in the near term, the increasing 
diversity of our end markets and geographies, 
together with our strong market positions, 
leave us well placed to navigate the current 
turbulence, whilst continuing to put the building 
blocks in place for superior medium to long 
term growth. 
At times such as these, the fundamentals of the 
business are tested to the full. This includes the 
appropriateness and resilience of the strategy, 
the strength of our market positions, the quality 
of the management, and the cohesiveness of our 
culture and values. I have found Rotork to be in 
good shape in all these respects.
Over many years, Rotork has established clear 
leadership positions in well-defined end markets, 
based on innovative technology and excellent 
customer service, delivered by a team of highly 
motivated and experienced employees who put 
the customer at the heart of what they do. Our 
asset-light model provides considerable flexibility 
in prioritising resource according to the greatest 
need or opportunity, whilst preserving capital for 
investment in technology and innovation.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Financial highlights
Order intake was 15.2% lower than  
the prior year on an organic constant 
currency (OCC) basis but the 
contributions from acquisitions, which 
were mainly completed in the second 
half of the year, offset in part by the 
0.9% currency headwind resulted in  
a reported reduction of 11.7%. 
Revenue of £546.5m was supported 
by the order book at the start of the 
year, so reduced by less than order 
intake and was 11.9% lower on an  
OCC basis and 8.1% lower on a 
reported basis. 
Adjusted* operating profit reduced 
20.3% to £125.3m. Adjusted* operating 
margins reduced by 350 basis points 
to 22.9%, impacted by lower sales 
volumes and the mix effect of newly 
acquired businesses at lower margins, 
partially offset by a £4.0m reduction  
in overheads. The reduction at gross 
margin level to 45.7% was contained  
to 230 basis points, with only a small 
increase in overall material cost 
percentage, reflecting effective control 
over material and labour costs, and 
good pricing resilience in challenging 
market conditions.
Acquisitions
Rotork had a very active year for 
acquisitions as we continued to 
implement our strategy for growth, 
and we invested £147.6m on 
acquisitions in total. This year we 
acquired Bifold Group Ltd (Bifold), 
M&M Srl, Eltav Wireless Monitoring Ltd, 
all of which sit in our Instruments 
division, and Roto Hammer Industries 
Inc. for our Gears division. We also 
acquired our agents’ businesses  
in the south of France and Turkey.  
The acquisition of Bifold for up to 
£125m in August is the largest 
acquisition completed by Rotork to 
date and provides a platform for the 
accelerated growth of the Instruments 
division, expanding our addressable 
market by a further £750m. Bifold 
performed in line with our expectations 
during the year. 
Board composition and performance
I would like to thank my fellow 
Directors for welcoming me as  
their new Chairman and for their 
considerable support in my first  
year in the role. 
The Board currently comprises three 
executive Directors, four independent 
non-executive Directors and myself as 
Chairman. Two out of the eight 
Directors are women (25%), which 
remains the same as last year.
We are announcing today that Bob 
Arnold will retire in August this year. 
Bob has been President of Rotork 
Controls Inc. since 1988 and a member 
of the Board since 2001. I would like to 
thank Bob for his contribution since 
joining Rotork in 1978 and in particular 
his significant role in supporting the 
expansion of the business throughout 
the Americas.
The annual performance review of  
the Board is scheduled to take place 
during February and March 2016, see 
page 62 of the Corporate Governance 
Report for further details.
Corporate Governance
The Board continues to be committed 
to the highest standards of governance. 
During the year, the Board and Audit 
Committee were involved in continuing 
consideration of, and work related to, 
risk appetite, and the monitoring  
and disclosure of risk following the 
revisions in 2014 to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code). 
Further details of this work and its 
outputs, our approach to governance 
and our compliance with the Code  
are contained in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 62 to 68.
Our employees
I would like to thank all of our employees 
for their continued high level of 
commitment and professionalism during 
this challenging year.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final 
dividend of 3.1p per share, a 0.3% 
increase over the 2014 final dividend. 
Taken with the 2015 interim dividend, 
the total dividend is 5.05p per share 
(2014: 5.01p), representing a 0.8% 
increase in the total dividend on 2014. 
The final dividend will be payable on 
16 May 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on 8 April 2016.
Outlook
The challenging market conditions  
that we saw in the first half of the year 
continued for the remainder of 2015, 
with many of our key markets and 
geographies impacted by the 
weakness of the oil price, political 
instability and the slowdown in China.
 
We were encouraged by the progress 
of our accelerated cost management 
programme in 2015 and further actions 
to mitigate the effect of end market 
weakness will remain a key focus in  
the current year. We continue to see 
opportunities to gain market share by 
expanding our product portfolio and 
through both organic development 
and acquisition. By continuing to 
implement our strategy for growth  
and targeted investment we will 
ensure that Rotork is well placed to 
make further progress over the 
medium to long term.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
The challenging market conditions that we 
saw in the first half of the year continued to 
dominate for the remainder of 2015, with 
many of our key markets and geographies 
impacted by the ongoing weakness of the oil 
price, political instability and the slowdown  
in China. We saw lower overall activity levels 
and an increased number of project deferrals 
and cancellations. We continue to see 
opportunities to gain market share by 
expanding our product portfolio, and through 
both organic development and acquisition. 
By implementing our strategy for growth and 
making careful investments we will ensure 
that Rotork is well placed to make further 
progress over the medium to long term.
The end of the year usually sees an upturn in 
revenue as customers look to complete orders 
and 2015 was no exception. However, fourth 
quarter revenue was 10.7% lower than the 
record fourth quarter of 2014, despite the 
acquisitions completed in the year, and 15.1% 
lower on an organic constant currency (OCC) 
basis. Revenue for the year was 8.1% lower than 
the previous year, which on an OCC basis was 
11.9% lower.

Programme (CSP). In 2015, RSS 
opened new service centres in 
Glasgow and Korea, expanded its 
service provision in France and Turkey 
and improved existing facilities to 
accommodate the CSP and changes in 
service. With 402 directly-employed 
service engineers and other service 
technicians employed by our agents 
around the world (2014: 370),  
we provide the infrastructure to 
effectively support all of our 
customers’ service needs. 
Research and development (R&D)
Innovation continues to be a core part 
of our strategy as we work with our 
customers to find ways of reducing 
power consumption, increasing 
efficiency, lowering the costs of asset 
ownership and minimising carbon 
footprint. Following the acquisition  
of Bifold Group Ltd, Gary Jacobson 
was appointed as Group Innovation 
Director in October and will head the 
new Group Innovation Department. 
Gary brings a wealth of experience 
and technical knowledge of products 
and markets relevant to Rotork and I 
am delighted to have him leading our 
future development in this area. 2015 
saw the launch of a number of new 
products across the divisions and our 
spend on R&D for the year was £9.6m 
or 1.8% of revenue.
Order intake is usually less driven by 
this year end pattern but the fourth 
quarter nevertheless showed an 
improvement of 3.2% on the third 
quarter on an OCC basis or 12.8% with 
the inclusion of acquisitions. Full year 
order intake was 11.7% below 2014, or 
15.2% lower on an OCC basis. Lower 
revenue was the main driver of the 
20.3% reduction in adjusted* operating 
profit to £125.3m. Cost control and the 
accelerated cost management 
programme delivered more than the 
anticipated savings in the year but this 
was not sufficient to offset the 
reduction in revenue.
In 2015, we invested £147.6m in six 
acquisitions. Further details are 
contained in the Business Reviews  
on pages 30 to 37. In line with our 
strategy, together these businesses 
bring additional products that enhance 
Rotork’s product portfolio and 
technology, expand our geographical 
presence and give us access to new 
markets. Our focus in 2016 will be to 
continue to integrate the newly-
acquired businesses and drive the 
potential revenue synergies. We will 
also continue to look for acquisition 
opportunities as part of our  
growth strategy.
During the year we opened four new 
sales and services offices and started 
the move into the new Lucca (Italy) 
factory, which is due to be completed 
in the second quarter of 2016. We  
now have 31 manufacturing sites,  
73 national offices and 84 regional 
locations in 38 countries. In total  
we have over 850 sales channels in  
101 countries. Strengthening our global 
presence to provide local support to 
our customers remains a core part of 
our strategy.
Our markets
The long term drivers of our markets 
remain positive with population 
growth, urbanisation and automation 
continuing to drive increased demand 
for flow control products and services. 
Our customers are also increasingly 
focused on reducing power 
consumption, increasing efficiency, 
maximising cost reduction, improved 
safety and minimising their carbon 
footprints, which will drive long term 
growth in our markets. See page 6 for 
more details.
In the shorter term our markets 
continue to be impacted by various 
headwinds. In 2015, the oil and gas 
markets remained active despite  
the fall in the oil price. Oil and gas 
represented 53.3% of our revenue in 
2015, a decline of 360 basis points on 
the previous year. In the water and 
industrial markets, revenue was up on 
the previous year, with water showing 
a small increase of £1.3m and industrial 
showing a larger increase of £10.2m 
demonstrating that our strategy of 
diversifying our end markets is 
continuing to make progress. The 
slowdown in China’s economy also 
impacted our revenue for the year with 
sales in the power market declining by 
£7.3m (7.5%), with £6.5m of that total 
attributable to China. 
Rotork Site Services (RSS)

Corporate Social Responsibility 
During 2015, we continued to focus on 
how we do things at Rotork through 
our Rotork Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) Committee, 
which sets the standards that are 
embedded within each of our 
businesses. Our responsibilities to our 
employees and our customers, as well 
as the communities and environment 
in which we operate, are very 
important to us. 
In 2015, we donated £100,000 to 
WaterAid and Sightsavers and  
£5,000 to Freedom Matters in 
response to the earthquake in Nepal. 
We encourage our employees to 
support their local communities, with 
local charitable causes selected by  
the local charitycommittees at each  
of our operating sites. The Group 
contributed a further £172,000 to 
support these causes bringing the 
total Group contributions in the year  
to £297,000 (2014: £295,000). 
For more information about the CSR 
Committee and the work it carries out 
see pages 48 to 59.
Our people
Rotork’s culture and values are an 
integral part of our business model 
and are embedded in the day to day 
behaviour of all employees. Our 
employees act and behave as smaller 
family units, part of the larger Rotork 
family. This is supported by Rotork 
being structured as a number of 
smaller business units, with individuals 
working collaboratively across teams 
and projects.
Rotork aims to be an employer of 
choice and is considered a great place 
to work by the majority of our 
employees. We foster an open and 
honest culture based on the 
engagement of our employees. 
Our annual employee satisfaction is 
used to improve the experience of 
working at Rotork and has helped to 
drive many changes around the Rotork 
globe. Our annual survey was 
completed by 2,350 employees, with 
the response rate being slightly down 
(71% compared to 75% last year) and 
the overall satisfaction score remaining 
the same as last year at 3.6. The global 
results showed that on average people 
are most satisfied with Rotork’s 
products and services, our approach to 
health and safety and our values and 
ethics and they are planning to stay 
with Rotork for at least another year.
Rotork had a total of 3,759 employees 
at the end of 2015, an increase of 300. 
From the various acquisitions, 389 
employees joined the Rotork family. 
Excluding the acquisitions, the total 
number of employees decreased by  
89 as a result of the cost management 
initiatives that were implemented 
during the year.
In 2015, there were two changes to our 
management team, with the retirement 
of Graham Ogden in March and  
Gary Jacobson joining the Rotork 
Management Board in October 
following his appointment as Group 
Innovation Director.
The success of Rotork is down to the 
hard work and dedication of our 
people. I would like to personally thank 
each and every one of them for 
making Rotork the world-class

LEADING THE WAY  
IN TOUGH APPLICATIONS
Smart positioners allow technicians to use auto-calibration and 
simple diagnostics to commission and monitor their entire system 
at the push of a button. In many cases the valve, actuator and 
smart positioner package is exposed to extreme temperatures, 
dirty conditions and other challenges such as high vibration.  16
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
We provide high quality, technically advanced,

TOGETHER
Technological leadership
Rotork’s technological leadership is driven by our 
employees who ensure that we remain competitive by 
maintaining the technical excellence of our products and 
providing solutions to our customers’ needs. We constantly 
strive to improve quality and performance, even when we 
are the best, we strive to be even better.
Global footprint 
Our global geographic footprint is key to our continued 
business success. Local relationships with customers allow 
Rotork to understand long term value generation 
opportunities and ensure that our innovation is relevant  
to our customers’ evolving requirements. Our worldwide 
presence allows us to manage complex global projects and 
to support customers in the field. Rotork Site Services work 
with our customers by installing and commissioning our 
actuators, and by meeting our customers’ service 
requirements. Our strategic manufacturing locations 
optimise supply chain management and productivity.
Diverse end market exposure
Rotork’s actuators and flow control products are used 
most intensively in the oil and gas, power and water 
markets, but our products are used in many other markets. 
Our diverse end market exposure and participation in  
a wide range of industries means that wherever fluids  
or gases are being moved and the process requires 
automation, or to contain fail-safe controls, actuators  
and flow control products are required.
Breadth of product portfolio 
We have the broadest range of actuators on the market  
and a growing range of complementary flow control 
instruments. We continue to expand the breadth of our 
product portfolio through product development and 
acquisitions. Our extensive offering ensures that we  
have the appropriate products for the widest range of 
applications within a site or a project and increases our 
cross-selling opportunities.
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
Our global network of offices and manufacturing sites 
expands each year to ensure that we can offer local 
support to our customers. Rotork’s culture of 
collaboration, respect and excellence is a core 
philosophy which we share with new offices and 
acquired businesses to ensure our customers receive 
consistently high quality service throughout the world. 
We operate an asset-light business model, with most  
of our manufacturing sites purchasing components in  
a finished form and then assembling to order.

Asset-light business model 
Our asset-light business model allows us to focus on our 
core strengths. Over 85% of our products are built using  
an outsourced manufacturing model, with our workforce 
assembling components and configuring products to match 
customer orders. We have developed a global network of 
suppliers who manufacture the components to our designs 
and who use our tooling. Leveraging our international 
supply chain allows us to achieve and maintain profitable 
growth while supporting new market entry.
Quality
Rotork’s products have a reputation for technological 
excellence, quality and reliability: meeting or exceeding 
international technical and performance standards. The 
reliability of our products is essential as they are used in 
difficult environments and can be employed in critical 
applications where consistency of performance and safety 
is paramount. Our stringent quality control procedures, 
which also extend to cover our supply chain, are central to 
delivering this.
Talented workforce
Our innovative company is built on our talented workforce. 
Attracting, developing and retaining outstanding talented 
people has been a key part of our success. Investment in  
our employees and their continued development is a key  
part of our strategy and is essential to ensure that we  
remain competitive.  18

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Our aim is to deliver a high return on capital with 
strong and sustainable margins and consistent 
year-on-year growth in revenues and profit 
which, combined with our asset-light model, 
will deliver strong cash generation.
To provide short term focus, we  
agree an annual set of key objectives.  
The progress against these during the 
year, and objectives for the coming year 
are shown below.
GROWTH
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES ACHIEVEMENTS 2015 OBJECTIVES 2016
Sales growth
Deliver profitable sales growth by 
focusing on the customer, increasing 
international coverage, broadening 
end markets and leveraging the 
expanding product portfolio.
A regional management structure  
was introduced with an increased 
focus on sales opportunities. 
Revenue synergies were achieved 
from acquisitions. Due to the slow 
down in growth, some investment 
plans were delayed.
Further develop regional 
management structure and continue 
to develop sales channels, including 
into new end markets, and strengthen 
sales teams. Increase focus on large 
project opportunities driven by the 
new Group Project Sales Director. 
Continue to drive revenue synergies 
from new acquisitions using our 
extensive salesforce. 
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are a core part of our 
growth strategy. An acquisition will 
only be considered if it will deliver  
a new product, geographic market, 
market sector or a combination  
of these.
Acquired M&M Srl, Bifold Group Ltd 
and Eltav Wireless Monitoring Ltd 
which sit within the Instruments 
division and Roto Hammer Inc. for 
our Gears division. Also acquired our 
agents’ businesses in Turkey and the 
south of France.
Execute acquisition plan of identified 
opportunities. 
Service growth
Further develop after market services 
capability including the Client 
Support Programme.
New service centres were opened  
in Glasgow and Korea, and we 
increased the number of service 
engineers by 5%. Recent 
acquisitions extend our service 
coverage in Turkey and France. 
Continue to improve customer 
experience by developing the sales 
channels for delivering service 
support and further expanding the 
sales team. Establish new, or expand 
existing, service centres in response 
to customer demand. 
SUSTAINABILITY
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES ACHIEVEMENTS 2015 OBJECTIVES 2016
Employee development
We will invest in our people to 
support our growth strategy and 
promote diversity and inclusion 
throughout the Group.
We have increased gender diversity 
at all levels of the organisation 
throughout the year. The leadership 
training programme was rolled out. 
We expanded our online training 
courses delivered throughout  
the Group. 
Rollout the sales training programme 
and further expand the training 
opportunities throughout the Group. 
Continue to promote diversity.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
Communicate best practice 
throughout the Group, training those 
responsible and, where appropriate, 
verifying adoption in each subsidiary.
Our CSR Sub-Committees continued 
to promote improvements in health 
and safety, monitor initiatives to 
reduce CO
2
 emissions, provide 
training on ethical behaviour and  
our employees gave their time and 
money to many charities around  
the world.
Continue to drive safety 
improvements and deliver the  
CSR strategy. The CSR Report is

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES ACHIEVEMENTS 2015 OBJECTIVES 2016
Manufacturing excellence 
Continue to develop world-class 
manufacturing.
As part of the development of our 
new ERP system, we reviewed many 
of our manufacturing procedures 
with a view to developing best 
practice. The Lucca factory fit out 
was completed with the move being 
completed in 2016.
Consolidate and develop world class 
manufacturing facilities delivering 
market leading products and service. 
Complete the consolidation of 
northern Italy businesses and 
complete the consolidation of  
three existing facilities into one 
combined site in Tulsa, USA.
Supply chain management 
Rotork’s outsourced manufacturing 
model means that material costs are the 
most significant component of direct 
costs. Managing these costs has been a 
key driver to improve margins across all 
our manufacturing sites. 
Sourcing initiatives during 2015  
have resulted in savings of £2.8m  
in the year with an annualised value 
of £5.6m.
Further develop and leverage global 
supply chain for all parts of the Group, 
including newly acquired companies. 
Reduce overall cost of materials by 
investing in supply chain.
Global business systems 
We are moving from having a wide 
range of systems around the world  
to adopting a global standard  
ERP system.
The roll-out of RQM (quotation 
system) was accelerated. Good 
progress continues to be made on 
the development of the 
manufacturing solution. 
Increase the rate of roll-out of the 
global business system solution to 
sales offices and start roll-out of the 
manufacturing solution.
Cost management
We have accelerated our cost 
management programme to reflect 
market conditions.
We achieved cost savings of £2.6m 
in 2015. 
Continue to execute cost 
management programme. 30
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Order intake was £277.0m, a 13.6% 
reduction compared with the prior year. 
On an organic constant currency (OCC) 
basis the movement was very similar to the 
reported change at -13.5%, as the small 
benefit from acquisitions was offset by a 
modest currency headwind. Revenue was 
£286.7m, 11.7% lower than the prior year, 
on both a reported and OCC basis, 
resulting in a £10.7m reduction in the  
order book to £81.0m.
The lower revenue had a knock-on impact 
on profitability for the division. Adjusted* 
operating profit fell 18.4% to £85.5m, an 
adjusted* operating margin of 29.8%, 250 
basis points lower than 2014. The reduced 
margin is largely attributable to the lower 
sales volumes with the cost of components 
similar to the prior year.

developments 
Sales to the oil and gas markets were 
the most heavily impacted during the 
year, with reduced revenue across 
upstream, midstream and downstream 
applications. The proportion of 
revenue from oil and gas reduced from 
51% to 48% during the year with a 
majority of the division’s revenue now 
coming from other markets. North 
America continued to grow in total 
and across all end markets (oil and gas, 
water, power and industrial), with the 
Middle East seeing good growth in oil 
and gas and power. The gains in these 
markets were insufficient to offset the 
reduction in revenue in the Far East, 
Controls’ largest market, where all end 
markets apart from water showed a 
decline. Within this region, the reduced 
activity in China, in both the oil and 
gas and power markets, had the 
biggest impact. Latin America was 
also impacted, with sales in the oil and 
gas markets substantially down, 
particularly in Mexico. 
The integration of our Turkish sales 
and services agent’s actuator business 
acquired earlier in 2015 is progressing 
well and resulted in us opening a  
new office and expanding our team  
in Turkey. 
This will enable us to grow our market 
share in the region. The purchase of 
Servo Moteurs Service in France in 
September further extended our 
service coverage in southern France. 
We continue to focus on product 
innovation to support growth in our 
markets. During the year, we launched 
further variants of our IQ3 range to 
target profitable niche applications. 
The main variants of Centork used in 
the water and power markets were 
also launched in the year with the 
remaining variants due to be released 
in 2016. Two of our existing factories 
have been set up to produce this 
range, with a third factory due to 
commence production in 2016 as 
volumes grow. The ExMax M has been 
adapted for outside applications as 
part of the continued expansion of our 
product range in the growing HVAC 
market. A new variant of our compact 
modulating actuator (CMA) was also 
launched, adding further features to 
the current CMA range. 
Case study
Rotork CVA fail-safe electric 
process valve actuators were 
selected for a critical flow control 
application in the Australian coal 
mining industry. Salcan Process 
Technology manufactures wellhead 
skids designed for coal mine 
degassing duties. The remotely 
sited skids are used in conjunction 
with Salcan’s control and telemetry 
systems to enable methane and 
other flammable gases to be 
extracted from underground coal 
seams prior to the commencement 
of mining operations.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
As the Rotork division with the largest exposure 
to oil and gas, 2015 was a difficult year for 
Rotork Fluid Systems (RFS). Within the other 
end markets results were mixed with industrial 
process sales the largest growth area but this 
was insufficient to offset the decline in oil and 
gas. However, oil and gas continues to provide 
opportunities for RFS in some areas. Both our 
comprehensive product portfolio and other end 
market exposure, will continue to drive growth.
The second half of the year proved more 
challenging than the first. Order intake in the 
second half was 27.1% lower than the second 
half of 2014, resulting in full year order intake  
that was 23.4% lower than the prior year.  
The currency headwind was greater than the 
contribution from acquisitions, so on an organic 
constant currency (OCC) basis full year order 
intake was 22.2% lower than 2014. Revenue  
of £149.2m was 17.2% lower, with the negative 
impact of currency again greater than the 
contribution from acquisitions, resulting in a 
reduction in revenue on an OCC basis of 16.3%. 
Volume, mix and pricing all impacted the top line 
but the containment of overhead costs at all 
levels was insufficient to offset this so adjusted* 
operating profit was down 51.2% to £15.2m, a 
margin of 10.2% compared with 17.3% last year.

The division’s exposure to the oil and 
gas market reduced once again in 2015, 
down from 72% to 68% of the division’s 
revenue, with upstream, midstream  
and downstream all reporting a 
reduction. Industrial process became 
the second largest end market with 
17%, whilst power remained at 9% of  
a reduced divisional revenue figure. 
Geographically, North America is RFS’s 
largest market, and the value of its 
sales remained constant year-on-year. 
Canada continued to grow, despite the 
difficult market conditions. In the USA 
we had a good year in securing key  
Gulf Coast LNG project work, as well  
as good project activity around gas 
pipeline and compressor stations. 
Western Europe also saw some growth 
with most of the increase in industrial 
sales coming from that region. All other 
regions saw a decline in revenue, with 
the weakest performer being the  
Far East, where project deliveries in 
Australia and India fell from historically 
high levels in 2014.
The improvement and consolidation of 
our existing facilities remains a focus as 
part of our drive to manage costs  
in the current market conditions.  
Our new factory in Lucca (Italy) is due 
to be fully operational in the second 
quarter of 2016. In addition, in early 
2016 we will complete the integration of 
our three existing Milan facilities into 
one combined site in Cusago (Italy) and 
by the end of 2016 we expect to 
complete the consolidation of three 
existing Tulsa (USA) facilities into one 
combined site. The integration of 
Masso, our marine focused business 
acquired at the end of 2014, is 
progressing well and Masso is starting 
to benefit from being part of the  
Rotork Group and from our global  
sales network.
We continue to develop our supply 
chain in India, China and Malaysia for 
our higher volume products to control 
and accelerate material cost reductions. 
We also continue to realise synergistic 
initiatives with the expanding range of 
devices within the Instruments division. 
Product development continues to be a 
focus for RFS as we look to build on 
opportunities to extend or improve our 
product range to address new or 
existing market requirements. During 
the year we launched SI3, our third 
generation Skilmatic SI electric fail-safe 
actuator with IQ3 technology, and the 
CQ range of actuators. CQ can be used 
in harsh environments where safety is 
required and where space is limited. 
During the year we also expanded our 
range of K-Tork actuators (used in 
power and industrial markets) by 
introducing a wider range of sizes and 
made further progress with our nuclear 
qualification programme. 
Case study
Rotork GO gas-over-oil actuators 
were supplied for vital fail-safe 
valve control duties on a new 
cryogenic LNG pipeline in 
Venezuela. In addition to providing 
the best technical solution for the 
application, the actuators were 
selected because of the high level 
of local support available from 
Rotork’s well established company 
in Venezuela.

Roto Hammer Industries Inc. (Roto Hammer) 
in the USA. Our industry leading expertise 
enables us to deliver innovative solutions to

wide range of products. We maintained our 
focus on profitability, return on sales and 
world class service. We also continued our 
efforts to streamline production processes 
and reduce costs.
Order intake and revenue grew modestly during 
2015 on both a reported and organic constant 
currency (OCC) basis. Order intake was 0.4% 
higher than 2014, and revenue 1.3% higher, both 
on an OCC basis. Whilst currency was neutral 
for divisional revenue in the first half of the year, 
it was a headwind in the second half but the 
second half also benefited from the acquisition 
of Roto Hammer in September. Revenue was 
£58.6m, 1.4% ahead of last year, fractionally 
ahead of order intake, so the order book 
reduced 6.0% to £10.1m at the end of the  
year. Gears saw the largest adverse impact  
of currency on reported margins as a result  
of its combination of factory locations and 
supply channels.

20.5%, 200 basis points lower than 
2014, but on an OCC basis this gap 
narrows to 100 basis points. This 
margin reduction can be attributed to 
the reduction in oil and gas sales which 
were largely replaced by sales into the 
power and industrial markets, which 
are typically at a lower margin.
The £8.2m acquisition of Roto 
Hammer, a US-based manufacturer of 
custom designed chain wheel manual 
valve operators, adds a new product 
line to the Gears’ product range and 
increases our presence in the 
important US market. Gears further 
developed its global sales and service 
network, providing local support to 
our customers around the world. We 
secured new OEM accounts in the 
growth markets of Korea, Japan, 
China, India and Eastern Europe. In 
addition, we saw growth in our sub sea 
business, and in the USA we developed 
‘Factory Stores’ short lead-time sales.
Oil and gas remained our largest end 
market but reduced from 57% to 50% 
of sales, whilst sales in power, water 
and industrial all grew as we continued 
to diversify our end market exposure. 
In terms of the regional split of sales, 
North America reduced, despite the

from September, as did the Far East. 
Western Europe was the best

prior year.
Our Leeds facility is the worldwide 
headquarters of Gears. Gearboxes  
are manufactured here and also at our 
facilities in China, India, the USA and 
Continental Europe. Our Leeds based 
team is responsible for research, 
product development and  
product testing. 
We continue to work closely with our 
customers, providing them with the 
benefits of innovative, technically 
advanced, high quality products and 
associated services. Our dedicated 
R&D team are responsible for new 
product design and development, 
from concept to customer. During 
2015, we further strengthened our 
diverse product range with the launch 
of the AB550M and HOS/MPR gearbox 
ranges. The AB550M is motorised for 
quarter-turn applications, whilst the 
HOS/MPR is a hand operated spur 
gearbox offering comprehensive 
solutions for multi-turn valves.

BUSINESS REVIEW
2015 was another year of strong growth  
for the Instruments division, with the completion  
of three acquisitions doubling our addressable 
market and providing Instruments with excellent 
foundations for the future. During the year, we 
focused on: the integration of Soldo and YTC; 
continuing to widen our product range through 
synergistic acquisitions and innovating our existing 
products; leveraging our sales synergies through 
our global sales network; and delivering cost 
reduction and productivity improvements.
Order intake grew 43.0% in the year due to the 
significant contribution from acquisitions and 
supported by a currency tailwind. On an organic 
constant currency (OCC) basis order intake was 9.1% 
lower than the prior year, with Soldo and Rotork 
Midland affected by the lower oil and gas activity and 
Rotork Midland also impacted by the lumpy nature of 
its rail projects. The pattern with revenue was similar, 
being 46.5% higher as reported at £67.3m but this was 
5.8% lower on an OCC basis. Gross margins were 50 
basis points lower than the prior year on an OCC basis, 
with the mix impact of lower margin acquisitions 
reducing gross margin by a further 200 basis points, 
down to 46.3%. Adjusted* operating profit was 
£18.3m, 26.8% higher than 2014, a 27.2% adjusted* 
operating margin. OCC adjusted* operating profit was 
£12.3m, 14.5% lower than 2014, a margin of 28.5%.
In August, we completed the acquisition of Bifold 
Group Ltd (Bifold) which has operations in Manchester 
and Taunton in the UK, for up to £125m. Bifold is a 
manufacturer of pneumatic and hydraulic instrument 
valves focused on the oil and gas industry and wider 
industrial markets, with expertise in a number of niche 
sectors such as subsea and wellhead control systems 
and was a long held target of Rotork’s. It has market-
leading technology in areas that include the

development of solenoid valves with 
ultra-low power requirements. The 
combination of Bifold’s extensive 
product portfolio and leading 
technology with Rotork’s international 
sales network and geographic reach will 
support the continued growth of the 
Instruments division in the future. Bifold 
performed in line with expectations 
during the year.
In August, we also acquired M&M 
International Srl (M&M), based in 
Bergamo, Italy. M&M is a manufacturer 
of solenoid valves, piston actuated 
valves and automatic drain valves for use 
in commercial and industrial flow control 
industries, and will complement Rotork 
Midland’s range of solenoid valves.  
Our third acquisition for the year was 
Eltav Technologies. Eltav produces an 
innovative industrial wireless monitoring 
solution for actuated valves. Its 
diagnostic software enables predictive 
maintenance on actuated valves, 
reducing capital and operational 
expenses while increasing safety  
and productivity in the plant. These 
acquisitions support our strategy of 
broadening our product portfolio and 
expanding our addressable markets. 
Activities to integrate our routes to 
market, train the sales teams on the 
broader product portfolio and align our 
product development strategies are all 
well under way and progressing 
according to plan.
Instruments had less exposure than the 
other divisions to the oil and gas market 
in 2015, although it was still the largest 
end market at 44% of divisional revenue 
and that proportion will increase in the 
current year with a full year contribution 
from Bifold. There was a decline in oil 
and gas sales in some areas but these 
were offset by gains in other areas.  
We have continued to be successful in 
gaining traction in new geographic 
markets through selling our growing 
product portfolio through our 
integrated global sales channels. In 
particular, Rotork Midland and YTC  
saw good growth in India, Korea,  
China and the USA.
In 2015, each of the businesses 
developed extensions to their existing 
product ranges and new variants of 
products, supporting global expansion 
and key end markets. Soldo developed 
ECL, a multi-turn manual switch box, in 
collaboration with Rotork Gears; Rotork 
Midland developed a pioneering control 
system on a biomass wagon for the 
Drax power station that controls the 
door opening and locking process; 
YTC’s new TMP-3000 industrial 
positioner will open new markets for 
YTC in the control of piston valves; and 
Bifold continues to expand its range of 
products for the wellhead market with 
electro-hydraulic power packs and 
pressure transmitters and switches.
OPPORTUNITIES:
• Sales channel development
• Rotork synergies
• Geographic expansion
• Product range expansion
Case study
Bifold solenoid manifolds were 
supplied on a topside hydraulic

These particular solenoid manifolds 
were selected for their modular

vital in the smooth and efficient 
running of this system. Along with 
these features, they were chosen 
due to their ease of installation.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
“  THIS YEAR SAW MORE FOCUS ON 
MEASURES TO CONTAIN COSTS AND 
TO ACCELERATE COST REDUCTIONS 
IN SOME AREAS IN RESPONSE TO 
MARKET CONDITIONS.”
Jonathan Davis
Finance Director
Underlying market conditions were challenging 
in 2015 with a number of factors negatively 
impacting the Group. Despite these headwinds 
we continued to look for growth opportunities 
wherever we could, investing in new products 
and new sales channels, and continuing to 
explore opportunities for both organic 
development and acquisitions. This year also 
saw more focus on measures to contain costs 
and to accelerate cost reductions in some areas 
in response to market conditions.
The second half of the year saw a reduction in 
both order intake and revenue compared with the 
first half of the year on both a reported and 
organic constant currency (OCC) basis, with OCC 
order intake 8.6% lower in the second half and 
revenue 1.1% lower. Full year order intake of 
£526.0m was 11.7% below 2014 but on an OCC 
basis this was a 15.2% reduction as the currency 
headwind was more than offset by the 
contribution from acquisitions. Revenue of 
£546.5m was 8.1% lower than the prior year,  
or 11.9% on an OCC basis, and as this exceeded 
order intake resulted in the order book reducing  
in the year by £17.5m (9.5%). 
The reduction in revenue resulted in lower margins 
with gross margins reducing from 48.0% to 45.7%, 
although the key elements within cost of sales 
were managed closely to mitigate the effect of the 
adverse conditions during the year. Material costs 
are the largest element of cost of sales and are an 
area where sourcing initiatives have consistently 
driven savings. This year these initiatives were 
accelerated and as a result the material cost 
percentage increased by just 100 basis points.  
Our diverse product portfolio means that breaking 
this down into cost, sales price and mix impacts  
is particularly challenging but this does illustrate 
that the impact of pricing pressure was contained. 
Labour costs were managed through a 
recruitment freeze and reduced overtime and so 
remained at the same percentage of sales as in 
2014. The largely fixed cost associated with our 
factories and service facilities accounted for the 
remaining reduction in gross margins. Governance Strategic Report Directors Financial Statements Company Information

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Adjusted* operating profit was 
£125.3m, 20.3% lower than the prior 
year and the corresponding margin 
reduced by 350 basis points to 22.9%. 
The lower gross profit was offset by a 
£4.0m reduction in overheads from  
the recruitment freeze and other cost 
containment initiatives. On an OCC 
basis the overheads reduced by £7.9m 
but adjusted* operating profit fell 
23.4% to £120.4m. Net finance costs 
rose £1.4m to £2.5m with higher net 
bank interest payable (£0.6m), larger 
net currency losses (£0.4m) and a 
higher interest charge in respect of  
the pension schemes (£0.4m) all 
contributing to the increase. This 
resulted in adjusted* profit before tax 
of £122.8m, a 21.4% reduction on the 
prior year however, a 40 basis point 
reduction in the effective tax rate  
offset some of this movement so that 
adjusted* earnings per share was 21.0% 
lower than 2014 at 10.4p.
Acquisitions
In August, we completed the 
acquisition of Bifold, the largest single 
acquisitions in our history. Taken with 
M&M, Roto Hammer, SMS, Eltav and  
the purchase of the sales and service 
activities of our agent in Turkey, 
acquisition spend was £136.7m in  
the year with a further £10.9m of 
contingent consideration most of  
which is in respect of Bifold. Each of 
these acquisitions provides a new 
product range, access to a new 
end-user market or access to a  
new geographic market or some 
combination of these benefits in line 
with our stated acquisition strategy.
Taking all these acquisitions together, 
£66.7m of the consideration was 
attributed to intangible assets which 
will be amortised and £74.5m is 
goodwill which will be subject  
to an annual impairment review.  
The increased value of acquisitions this 
year, and last year, led to a rise in the 
amortisation charge related to acquired 
intangible assets to £20.9m  
(2014: £14.9m). In order to adjust  
the income statement to show a 
like-for-like period for each acquisition, 
2015 revenue has to be reduced by 
£26.8m and adjusted* operating  
profit by £6.0m. The profit margin  
of the acquired business was slightly 
dilutive in aggregate, at 22.2%. The 
professional fees associated with  
the acquisitions amounted to £1.3m 
(2014: £0.6m) and are included in 
adjusted* operating profit.
Accelerated cost 
management programme
At our half year results in August  
we presented an accelerated cost 
management programme as part of  
our response to the changing market 
conditions. The programme identified 
£8m of annualised savings, split equally 
between material costs and overheads 
with £2m of these savings due to be 
realised in 2015. The sourcing initiatives 
launched in 2015 have been 
implemented quicker than anticipated, 
with annualised savings of £5.6m 
identified and introduced, and with a 
material cost benefit of £2.8m in the 
year. This helped contain the material 
cost percentage so that the net impact 
of pricing, mix, and material cost was 
only an 80 basis point increase.
The initiatives to reduce overheads also 
delivered greater savings in the year 
than anticipated with the income 
statement benefiting from £2.6m of 
savings which when annualised will be 
£4.6m. Not replacing leavers and 
consolidating roles led to a net 
headcount reduction of 89 people in 
the year, including some senior posts, 
before the 389 people added with 
acquisitions are reflected. This was the 
largest contributor to both the savings 
in the year and the annualised total. 
Facility consolidation is under way in a 
number of locations and is most 
advanced in Milan. As these moves 
were completed in early 2016, the 
benefit will only start to be felt in the 
current year.
Overall, the accelerated cost 
management programme produced 
savings of £5.4m in 2015 which on  
an annualised basis will increase to 
£10.2m. In addition to these savings, 
2015 benefited from a reduction in 
variable pay as bonuses at all levels of 
the organisation were lower than the 
prior year. Excluding the impact of 
acquisitions and removing the benefit 
of the specific cost management 
programme changes identified above, 
the like-for-like payroll cost decreased 
marginally but the cost of bonuses  
and similar variable benefits reduced 
by £11m. 
Currency
The overall impact of currency on our 
reported results for 2015 was closer to 
neutral than in 2014. This was 
particularly true in the first half of the 
year when the adjustment to revenue 
to restate it at 2014 rates was a net nil. 
In the second half of the year both the 
US dollar and euro strengthened 
relative to sterling, resulting in a £4.3m 
(0.8%) headwind to revenue for the  
full year. Within this our two main 
currencies fared very differently, with 
US dollar average rates strengthening 
7.2% and the euro weakening 11.0%  
for the year. Amongst the other  
16 currencies that are home currencies 
to one or more of our subsidiaries, 
there was a net weakening of 
currencies with seven of the currencies 
weakening by more than 10%.
The impact of currency on the Group  
is both translational and transactional. 
Given the locations in which we have 
operations and the international nature 
of our supply base and sales currencies, 
the impact of transaction differences 
can be very different from the 
translation impact. We are able to 
partially mitigate the transaction 
impact through matching supply 
currency with sales currency, but 
ultimately we are still net sellers of both 
US dollars and euros. It is the net sale of 
these currencies which we principally

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
address through our hedging policy, 
covering up to 75% of trading 
transactions in the next 12 months and 
up to 50% between 12 and 24 months. 
Net of these mitigating actions 
adjusted* operating profit was £1.1m 
(0.7%) lower than it would have been  
at 2014 rates. 
In order to estimate the impact of 
currency, at the current exchange  
rates we consider the effect of a  
1 cent movement versus sterling.  
A 1 euro cent movement now results in 
approximately a £235,000 adjustment 
to profit and for US dollar, and dollar 
related currencies, a 1 cent movement 
equates to approximately a £400,000 
adjustment. Both these adjustments 
were lower compared with the 
equivalent figures in 2014 as a result of 
the lower underlying currency flows.  
If current exchange rates were to apply 
for the whole of 2016, this would be a 
7% tailwind to both revenue and profit 
compared with the average rates  
for 2015. 
Return on capital employed (ROCE)
Our asset-light business model and 
strong profit margins mean Rotork 
generates a high ROCE. Our definition 
of ROCE is based on adjusted* 
operating profit as a return on the 
average net assets excluding net debt 
and the pension scheme liability net  
of the related deferred tax. This means 
that as we make acquisitions our capital 
base grows when the associated 
intangible assets and goodwill are 
recognised. During the year intangibles 
and goodwill increased by a net £119m 
in total which, after allowing for the 
related deferred tax, accounted for 
more than 23% of the increase in capital 
employed, which rose 31% to £496m. 
With the larger acquisitions taking 
place in the second half of the year and 
therefore only contributing a part year 
profit together with the lower organic 
sales, ROCE reduced to 28.6%. 
Group tax policy
The Group’s approach to tax continues 
to be to operate on the basis of full 
disclosure and co-operation with all tax 
authorities and, where possible, to 
mitigate the burden of tax within the 
framework of local legislation.  
This approach to tax balances the 
various interests of shareholders, 
governments, employees and the 
communities in which we operate and 
is aligned with our strategy, enhancing 
shareholder value whilst protecting the 
Group’s reputation. In an increasingly 
complex international environment and 
with the broad geographic spread of 
our businesses, a degree of tax risk is 
inevitable. We manage and control 
these risks proactively seeking local 
professional advice where needed.
The Group’s effective tax rate reduced 
from 26.9% to 26.5%. The Group 
continues to operate in many 
jurisdictions where local profits are 
taxed at their national statutory rates, 
ranging from nil to over 35%, compared 
to a UK statutory rate of 20.25% for the 
year. In the year, the change in profit 
mix across the Group resulted in a 
decrease in the effective tax rate of  
0.4 percentage points. In contrast,  
the Group benefitted from the 
reduction in the UK Corporation Tax 
rate, generating a one off 0.6% rate 
benefit. In addition, the Group 
continues to benefit from the UK patent 
box regime and R&D tax relief.

Cash generation
Following the acquisition of Bifold our 
net debt position at the end of the year 
was £71.1m compared with net cash  
at the start of the year of £25.2m.  
The three largest categories of cash 
expenditure were: £138.4m on 
acquisitions, £43.8m of dividends and 
£35.7m of tax paid. The increase in 
acquisition spend, from £82.7m last 
year, was the largest increase and  
was funded by a £98.3m net increase  
in bank borrowing during the year.  
Capital expenditure was £11.8m 
compared with £17.5m in 2014, with the 
£3.8m spent on the fit out of the new 
Lucca facility the only major project 
during taking place during the year. 
Our cash generation KPI shows a 
conversion of 115.4% of operating profit 
into operating cash. Control of working 
capital as defined in the cashflow 
statement, using average exchange 
rates and excluding acquisitions, is key 
to achieving this performance measure. 
Looking at the balance sheet figures, 
inventory increased £6.1m to £87.2m  
in the year and represented 16.0% of 
annual revenue but on an OCC basis 
was a decrease of £0.7m, 15.3% of 
revenue. Trade receivables fell £9.7m as 
reported, with debtor days outstanding 
increasing 2 days to 62 days. In total, 
net working capital increased to 31.0% 
of annual revenue compared with 
28.5% in December 2014.This year the 
combination of acquisitions taking 
place late in the year and currency 
movements at the end of the year 
affecting the balance sheet values of 
working capital impacted this measure 
in 2015.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Credit management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to trade receivables, with 
the risk spread over a large number  
of countries and customers, and no 
significant concentration of risk. Credit 
worthiness checks are undertaken 
before entering into contracts or 
commencing trade with new customers 
and in companies where the insurance 
cover operates, the authorisation 
process works in conjunction with  
the insurer, taking advantage of their 
market intelligence. We actively 
expanded the coverage of the credit 
insurance policy during the year and 
have cover in place for 94% of 
receivables in those companies now 
using the policy. Where appropriate,  
we use trade finance instruments such 
as letters of credit to mitigate any 
identified risk.
Treasury
The Group operates a centralised 
treasury function managed by a 
Treasury Committee chaired by the 
Group Finance Director and also 
comprising the Chief Executive, Group 
Legal Director, Group Financial 
Controller and Group Treasurer. The 
Committee meets regularly to consider 
foreign currency exposure, control over 
deposits, funding requirements and 
cash management. The Group 
Treasurer monitors compliance with the 
treasury policies and is responsible for 
overseeing all the Group’s banking 
relationships. A subsidiary treasury 
policy restricts the actions subsidiaries 
can take and the Group treasury policy 
and terms of reference define the 
responsibilities of the Group Treasurer 
and Treasury Committee. 
The Group uses financial instruments 
where appropriate to hedge significant 
currency transactions, principally 
forward exchange contracts and 
swaps. These financial instruments are 
used to reduce volatility which might 
affect the Group’s cash or income 
statement. In assessing the level of cash 
flows to hedge with forward exchange 
contracts, the maximum cover taken is 
75% of forecast flows. The Board 
receives monthly treasury reports 
which summarise the Group’s foreign 
currency hedging position, distribution 
of cash balances and any significant 
changes to banking relationships.
During the year, triggered by the 
acquisition of Bifold, we restructured 
our committed facilities with a view  
to not only providing a higher total 
borrowing capacity but also to extend 
the tenor of the loans. In August, we 
established three committed facilities 
with two different lenders comprising  
a one year £20m facility expiring in 
August 2016, a £90m three year facility 
expiring in August 2018 and a five year 
£60m facility expiring in August 2020. 
Dividends
The Board is proposing a 0.3% increase 
in the final dividend to 3.1p per share. 
When taken together with the 1.95p 
interim dividend paid in September,  
this represents a 0.8% increase in 
dividends over the prior year, having 
taken into account the 10 for one share 
split which took place in May 2015.  
This gives dividend cover of 1.7 times 
(2014: 2.4 times), with the reduction in 
cover reflecting the reduction in profits 
in 2015. Our long-standing dividend 
policy is to grow core dividends in  
line with earnings and supplement  
core dividends with additional 
dividends when the Board considers  
it appropriate to do so, having 
considered the near term expected 
cash requirements of the Group.
Retirement benefits
The Group accounts for post-
retirement benefits in accordance with 
IAS19, Employee Benefits. The balance 
sheet reflects the net deficit of these 
schemes at 31 December 2015 based 
on the market value of the assets at 
that date, and the valuation of liabilities 
using year end AA corporate bond 
yields. We have closed both the main 
defined benefit pension schemes to 
new entrants; the UK scheme in 2003 
and the US one in 2009, in order to 
reduce the risk of volatility of the 
Group’s liabilities.
The most recent triennial valuation  
for the UK scheme took place as at  
31 March 2013 and was adversely 
affected by the lower yield on long-
dated gilts at that date, which is the key 
driver behind the value of the scheme’s 
liabilities. As a result, despite better 
than expected investment returns and 
the agreed past deficit contributions, 
the funding level was lower than at the 
previous valuation. A recovery plan was 
been agreed with the Trustees resulting 
in required contributions from the 
Company of £5.2m during 2014, £5.5m 
in 2015 and £5.5m in 2016, at which 
time the next valuation will take place.
During the year the deficit on the 
schemes reduced from £36.1m to 
£23.3m and the funding level improved 
from 81% to 87%. The company paid 
total contributions of £8.3m in the year 
but the scheme assets decreased 
slightly in value, offsetting this however 
the largest drivers of the reduced 
deficit were the higher discount rate 
and new mortality assumptions coming 
from the latest projections.

Comments on results
The challenging market 
conditions experienced in 
the year were the result of  
a number of significant 
headwinds. Despite our 
diversified end market  
and geographic market 
exposure, these headwinds 
affected all divisions, and as 
a result revenue was lower 
than the prior year.
The reduction in revenue 
during the year was 
mitigated to an extent by 
cost control measures but 
these were not sufficient  
to prevent a reduction in  
this KPI. 
Net working capital, 
excluding that added 
through acquisitions and 
impact of exchange rates, 
reduced during the year 
generating a net cash  
inflow which is reflected  
in this KPI. 
The reduction in adjusted* 
operating profit and an 
increase in capital employed 
as a result of the acquisitions 
in the year contributed in 
broadly equal measure to 
this reduction in return on 
capital employed. 
The reduction in the Group’s 
effective tax rate was the 
result of the lower tax rate in 
the UK but this was only a 
marginal benefit and the 
reduction in underlying 
profit led to this decline 
in EPS.
The investment in health 
and safety training, audits 
to monitor compliance  
with procedures and 
initiatives to embed safe 
working practices led to  
a further reduction in this 
KPI this year.
The reduction in revenue 
and a number of global 
weather events generated 
an increase.  We continue to 
look for ways of reducing 
energy consumption further.
The number of employees 
completing the survey was 
2,350, a 71% response rate 
(4% down on the previous 
year). The highest scoring 
questions were those on 
employees planning on 
staying at least another 
year with Rotork, being 
proud of the products and 
services we provide our 
customers, our approach to 
health and safety, and our 
values and ethics.
FINANCIAL KPIs
Growth of the business, quality of earnings and efficient use of 
resources are crucial target areas for Rotork and we employ a 
number of performance measures throughout Rotork to monitor 
them. The key performance indicators (KPIs) used to monitor the 
financial performance of the business are set out below.

ESSENTIAL TO 
LONG TERM  
 SUCCESS
HOW WE MANAGE RISK
Managing business risks
The assessment and management of 
risk is the responsibility of the Board, 
and the development and execution  
of a comprehensive and robust system 
of risk management is a high priority  
at Rotork. Managing the risks to our 
business is essential to the long term 
success and sustainability of the 
Group, and our approach to risk is 
intended to protect the interests of 
shareholders and all interested parties. 
The risk management process is an 
established way of identifying and 
managing risk, first at divisional board 
level, and then for the Group as a 
whole and it works within our 
governance framework set out in our 
Corporate Governance Statement,  
see page 62.
The Board’s role in risk management 
involves promoting a culture that 
emphasises integrity at all levels of 
business operations. This includes 
ensuring that risk management is 
embedded within the core processes 
of the Group, determining the principal 
risks, communicating these effectively 
across the businesses and setting the 
overall policies for risk management 
and control. The geographic spread of 
our activities makes communication of 
these policies and standards a key part 
of ensuring consistency across all of 
our operations.
The Group Finance Director is 
responsible for risk management 
within the Group and leads the 
development of the risk management 
process and this year has led the 
development of the Risk Appetite 
Framework. The Board approves  
risk appetite for the Group and 
considers the consequential actions  
in terms of mitigation where possible 
and appropriate. 
Determining risk appetite
The Board is responsible for 
determining the nature and extent  
of the risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives.  
This year we have implemented  
a more structured approach to 
determine and document the Board’s 
risk appetite and then to measure the 
business against this appetite through 
a quarterly Executive Risk Summary.  
The approach taken is explained in 
more detail on pages 62 to 68 of the 
Corporate Governance Statement. 
Risk management process
The major risks affecting the Group are 
first identified and considered by the 
divisional boards during their regular 
meetings. Risks are categorised on a 
matrix reflecting likelihood and impact 
on the business. The assessment of 
impact is measured before allowing for 
mitigation, such as insurance 
recoveries, whilst likelihood is 
considered after allowing for the  
effect of mitigation. The impact scale 
is determined as a function firstly of 
annual profit so that each division has 
an appropriate benchmark. Secondly, 
each risk is then reviewed on a three 
year timeframe and likelihood and 
impact reassessed for that longer  
time period. Once the assessment 
matrix is completed by each division, 
the risks are then aggregated and 
re-evaluated in relation to the Group 
as a whole using an appropriate Group 
impact scale. 
Each risk in the risk register is owned 
by one or more Director. Some risks 
are addressed at a divisional level, so 
the ownership rests with a member of 
the divisional board. These are then 
consolidated at the management 
board level and are ultimately owned 
by either the Chief Executive or Group 
Finance Director at PLC Board level.
Identified risks are discussed and the 
progress reviewed at both Rotork 
Management Board and divisional 
board meetings during the year. Senior 
management, in association with the 
Board, meets twice a year to consider 
the Group risk matrix and progress 
with mitigating actions. The external 
Auditor is invited to attend one of the 
meetings each year. Governance Strategic Report Directors Financial Statements Company Information

This is an ongoing process involving 
regular assessment of the risks, with 
clear and consistent procedures  
for monitoring, updating and 
implementing appropriate controls to 
manage the identified risks. We are 
therefore confident that we have a 
methodology for ensuring that the 
Group’s approach to dealing with 
individual risks is robust and timely.
Classification of key risks
We identify three main risk types:
Strategic – Risks that potentially  
could affect the strategic aims of the 
business, or those issues that could 
affect the strategic objectives that the 
Group is addressing;
Operational – Risks arising out of the 
operational activities of the Group 
relating to areas such as logistics, 
procurement, product development 
and interaction with commercial 
partners; and
Financial – Issues that could affect  
the finances of the business both 
externally from matters initially  
outside of our control, and from  
the perspective of internal controls 
and processes.
The risks considered during the process cover all aspects of the Group’s 
activities and cover a far wider range of areas including environmental, 
reputational and ethical risks as well as product, competitor or financial risks, but 
not all of these areas are represented in the top 10 risks which are listed on pages 
46 to 47. These are categorised by the three main risk areas identified on this 
page. Mitigation, where possible, is shown for each risk area identified. 46
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
STRATEGIC RISKS
Description Potential impact Mitigation
Competition on price, for 
example as a result of an 
existing competitor moving 
to manufacture in a lower 
cost area of the world.
Where a competitor decides to use cost 
savings to reduce their selling prices, 
this could lead to a reduction in the 
general market price. Rotork might need 
to respond to a change in market price 
levels whilst still maintaining the price 
premium currently enjoyed for some 
products. This could impact our market 
share and would impact our ability to 
grow the Group revenue.
Rotork already has a direct presence, in terms of 
production, sales and service support, in many low 
cost locations and regularly reviews opportunities in 
other countries. There is a constant drive to maintain 
differentiation from the competition both in terms 
of the quality of our products and of the service we 
provide and thus ensure that price is not the only 
means of gaining a competitive advantage.
Not having the appropriate 
products, either in terms of 
features or costs.
In order to be able to compete on a 
project, our products must meet both the 
necessary specification and pricing level. 
A failure on either count could harm our 
competitive position and result in us not 
winning the project.
Development of products, or acquisition of 
companies with products, to meet the required 
market driven specifications and broaden our 
product portfolio is an ongoing activity as is the 
drive to take cost out of our products to meet target 
pricing levels.
Lower investment in Rotork’s 
traditional market sectors.
A reduction in capital or maintenance 
expenditure in one of Rotork’s key 
market sectors would result in a smaller 
addressable market, which in turn could 
lead to a reduction in revenue from  
that sector.
Identification of potential new end markets or ones 
which are becoming more active takes place in each 
location and is coordinated at divisional level. This is 
supported by product development and innovation 
to address new markets and new applications in 
existing markets. At a Group level our geographic 
and end market diversification provides resilience to 
a reduction in any one area or market but, as we have 
seen this year, may not fully mitigate a change in the 
larger end markets.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Description Potential impact Mitigation
Volatility of exchange rates 
would impact Rotork’s 
reported results and 
competitive position.
Significant fluctuations in exchange  
rates could have an adverse impact on 
Rotork’s reported results and adversely 
affect the pricing point of our products  
in other currencies. 
A clear treasury hedging policy addresses short 
term risk and this works together with the natural 
hedging provided by the geographical spread of 
operations, sourcing and customers. Whilst this will 
protect against some of the transaction exposure 
our reported results would still be impacted by the 
translation of our non-UK operations.
Political instability in a key 
end market.
Disruption of normal business activity 
would impact our sales in that country 
and might ultimately lead to loss of any 
assets located in that country as well.
The wide geographic spread of Rotork’s operations 
and customers diminishes the impact of any one 
market on the results of the Group as a whole.
Growth of the defined 
benefit pension  
scheme deficit.
The amount of the deficit may be 
adversely affected by a number of  
factors including investment returns,  
long term interest rates, price inflation 
and members’ longevity. This in turn 
might lead to a requirement for the 
Company to increase cash contributions 
to the schemes.
Both defined benefit schemes are closed to new 
members, with the UK scheme closed in January 
2003. The Group and trustees monitor the 
performance of the scheme regularly, taking actuarial 
and investment advice as appropriate. The results of 
these reviews are discussed by the Board. Governance Strategic Report Directors Financial Statements Company Information

OPERATIONAL RISKS
Description Potential impact Mitigation
Major in field product failure 
arising from a component 
defect or warranty issue 
which might require a 
product recall.
Replacement of defective components or 
complete units would give rise to a direct 
financial cost and there could also be a 
reputational risk. This in turn could impact 
our ability to achieve premium pricing. 
A comprehensive set of quality control and new 
product introduction procedures operates over 
suppliers. These include supplier visits, audits and a 
scorecard system to measure their performance. In 
some markets, legislation determines that this risk is 
entirely passed to the end-user. Our global service 
coverage ensures that any product failure issues 
could be dealt with quickly and efficiently to minimise 
any reputational impact.
Failure of a key supplier or a 
tooling failure at a supplier 
causing disruption to 
planned manufacturing.
Where customer delivery expectations 
are not met, this could lead to financial 
penalties and damage customer 
relationships.
Dual sourcing for key components wherever possible 
provides the best mitigation for key suppliers. Regular 
monitoring and replacement of tooling at all suppliers 
reduces the risk of a tooling failure. Inventory levels 
are maintained at a sufficient level to protect against 
short term disruption.
Failure of an acquisition 
to deliver the growth or 
synergies anticipated, due 
to incorrect assumptions or 
changing market conditions, 
or failure to integrate 
an acquisition to ensure 
compliance with Rotork’s 
policies and procedures.
Whilst growth opportunities, cost savings 
and synergies are identified prior to 
completion, these may not always be 
delivered at the levels anticipated or 
to the timetable expected following 
the acquisition. Although these 
benefits are usually not priced into the 
purchase consideration, a significant 
underperformance could lead to an 
impairment write down of the associated 
intangible assets.
During the due diligence process a 100 day plan is 
prepared to manage the important initial stages of 
integration. Consideration is given to the composition 
and skills of the management team with the 
necessary training and support provided by a variety 
of Rotork personnel. This should ensure an effective 
integration and communication of Rotork’s policies 
and procedures, whilst monitoring delivery of the 
financial plan.
Failure of IT security systems 
to prevent penetration by 
unauthorised people and 
access to commercially 
sensitive data.
Sensitive data is stored and transmitted 
electronically around the world. The 
Group is therefore exposed to the risk 
of data loss by cyberattack. This data 
might contain technically or commercially 
sensitive information which would 
provide a competitor with an advantage.
Rotork has a range of measures in place to monitor 
and mitigate this risk.
Viability Statement 
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three 
year period taking account of the Group’s current position and  
the potential impact of the principal risks as documented above.  
A robust assessment of the principal risks facing this business was 
conducted through the year with the documentation of the Risk 
Appetite Framework contributing to a fuller review of those risks 
which might impact the business model or future performance. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a three year period. 
The lookout period for the analysis is three years which is aligned 
with our planning horizon at both Group and divisional level.
In making this statement, the Directors have considered each of 
the principal risks and the potential impact they could have in 
severe but plausible scenarios. Given the current position of the 
Group and the likely effectiveness of mitigating actions, the Board 
has assessed the impact these would have on the business model, 
future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.  48

The environment
Rotork is fully committed to reducing 
its impact on the environment by 
preventing pollution in all countries  
in which it operates, and to make  
sure it is compliant with any legal  
and regulatory requirements. Our 
compliance contributes to sustaining 
the environment and brings cost 
savings by reducing the consumption 
of energy, water and waste and 
recycling. The environmental 
programme is described in more  
detail on pages 50 to 53. 
Ethics and values
Ethics and values are fundamental  
to the way in which we do business. 
Respecting internationally proclaimed 
human rights, promoting an open and 
honest culture, having a zero tolerance 
to bribery and corruption worldwide, 
and selecting suppliers with sound 
reputations in the marketplace are 
important principles for the Group to 
adhere to. More details of the Group’s 
ethics and values can be found on 
pages 54 to 55. 
Health and safety
The health and safety of all employees 
and contractors is of paramount 
importance in providing a safe working 
environment. Our fundamental 
principle, ‘if you cannot do a job safely, 
we will not do the job’, is actively 
promoted to everyone. This ensures 
that our people remain safe and we 
enhance the effectiveness of our 
workforce by reducing the risk of 
injury and costs associated with injury 
or illness. The Group’s approach to 
health and safety can be found on 
pages 56 to 57.
Community involvement
We consider it important to contribute 
and engage positively in the 
communities we operate in and to be  
a good community neighbour around 
the world. One of our corporate values 
is to produce a positive and beneficial 
impact in the areas in which we 
operate. Further details on community 
involvement can be found on pages 58 
to 59.
Rotork has been a member of the  
UN Global Compact since 2003 and 
continues to be included in the 
FTSE4Good index where we maintain 
an above average score in the global 
rankings, UK rankings and industry 
sector rankings. 
Rotork believes that the approach  
it takes to CSR helps to meet the 
expectations of our stakeholders  
and contributes to the success of our 
corporate strategy by promoting an 
effective and sustainable business.
Our Chief Executive chairs the CSR 
Committee and reports progress to 
the Board. The CSR Committee is  
a management committee, which  
has four sub-committees with each 
representing one of the aspects of 
CSR described opposite. Presentations 
are given by the chairmen of the four 
sub-committees to the Board on 
activity and progress in their areas  
of CSR during the year.

HELPING THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Rotork is fully committed to the 
prevention of pollution, to comply with 
all legal and regulatory requirements 
and to reduce our environmental 
footprint by targeting key areas  
such as energy consumption, water 
consumption and waste. 
We continue with our assembly only philosophy 
in the majority of our business units where we 
utilise specialist suppliers for most of our 
manufactured components and assemblies. 
This philosophy has resulted in the majority of 
our energy being used on lighting, heating and 
cooling, and IT systems. With the acquisition  
of a number of businesses through the year  
the profile has changed to include machining 
processes. As a responsible global entity  
we continue to influence the environmental 
performance of our supply chain through our 
supplier assessment programme.

Strategy 
• We will improve our operational 
efficiency and enhance our 
environmental performance in  
order to secure the continued 
sustainability of the Group.
• We will work as a business, and in 
the local communities where we 
operate, to ensure that the 
environment on which we depend is 
maintained for future generations.
• We will continue to work in 
partnership with our regulatory 
bodies and respect the regulatory 
framework in which we work.
• As an environmentally responsible 
business, we will be open and 
transparent and report regularly to 
all relevant stakeholders on our 
environmental performance.
Corporate objectives
Our environmental objectives fall in line 
with our reporting year. There is  
a corporate objective of a 3% reduction 
in tonnes of CO
2
 generated in scope 1 
and scope 2 emissions per £m turnover. 
Organisational boundaries
The environmental report covers all 
operations and processes within the 
physical boundaries of the facilities 
and business transportation by 
company cars or vans, or any private 
cars and hire cars used for business 
purposes only. Transportation of 
products by third parties are not 
covered by the report. Where energy 
consumption cannot be verified, 
normally due to the size of the facility, 
then an estimation on the energy use 
per square metre of floor space 
occupied will be made. This estimation 
is based on the Chartered Institution of 
Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) 
Guide F – Energy Efficiency in 
Buildings. This estimation equates to 
0.57% of total emissions declared. 
Progress
The baseline year remains at 2012.  
A number of acquisitions have 
occurred since 2012 that have affected 
the overall energy consumption, like 
for like figures have been published to 
show the underlying trends in the 
organisation. 
Energy consumption
Due to the growth through acquisition 
of the Group during 2015 absolute 
energy consumption has increased by 
10.6% on the previous year and by 
24.5% on the baseline of 2012. 
Consumption excluding acquisitions 
increased by 0.42% compared to 2014 
and increased by 13.1% on the baseline 
of 2012. Absolute gas consumption 
increased by 14.9% on the previous 
year and 48.8% on the baseline year  
of 2012. A majority of the gas that is 
consumed is for heating which can  
be linked directly to cold weather 
conditions. On sites excluding new 
acquisitions, during 2015 gas 
consumption increased by 6.8% 
compared to 2014 and increased by 
38.4% since 2012.
In 2015, Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) 
consumption increased by 5% on the 
previous year and there was an 
increase of 27.7% on the baseline of 
2012. LPG is used predominantly for 
ancillary equipment and occasionally 
on heating. Oil consumption increased 
by 195.8% on the previous year and by 
5.4% on the baseline of 2012. Excluding 
new acquisitions, oil consumption 
increased on the previous year by 118% 
but decreased by 33% on the baseline 
of 2012. Oil is used in back-up 
generators and heating systems. 
 
The energy projects that were rolled 
out during 2014 have shown a benefit 
in reduced energy consumption this 
year. Rochester (USA) has shown a 
reduction of 9.4% in their electricity 
consumption and Melle (Germany) has 
shown a reduction of 19.9% in 
electricity consumption. A number of 
other energy reduction projects which 
are currently being implemented have 
already started to show their benefits. 
Bath (UK) has already shown a 
reduction of 1.8% in electricity 
consumption against last year and 
Winston-Salem (USA) has realised a 
2.4% reduction in electricity 
consumption compared to last year. 
These projects are expected to show 
greater reductions when they have 
been completed. 52

WASTE GENERATED (tonnes) 
(Absolute)
As we develop new sites or upgrade 
our existing sites we will be 
introducing energy efficient solutions 
into the building design, and stabilising 
our energy supply to minimise the use 
of backup generators, which will help 
to reduce the environmental impact  
of our business going forward.
Water consumption
Absolute water consumption across 
the Group has increased by 11.8% on 
the previous year and by 25.4% on the 
baseline year. Consumption, excluding 
new acquisitions, has increased by 5% 
on the previous year and by 17.7% on 
the baseline of 2012. The majority of 
water consumption is for domestic 
purposes only, though there are some 
additional requirements related to 
process water in a small number of  
our sites.
Waste and recycling
There are a number of local 
programmes in place to promote 
recycling and reduce waste across the 
Group, this has resulted in a reduction 
of waste generated by 18 tonnes in 
absolute terms and an increase in 
recycling rates from 77% to 79%.

Environmental incidents 
There have been no reportable 
environmental incidents during 2015. 
Systems are in place to address any 
environmental incident that occurs  
at our facilities and the robustness of 
these emergency systems are included 
as part of our internal audit system. 
Greenhouse gas reporting
In January 2016, EEF undertook an 
assurance audit of the greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions report. The business 
reports on GHG emissions in line with 
the GHG Emissions Protocol 
developed jointly by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development and the World Resource 
Institute. No significant issues were 
identified during the assurance audit. 
GHG is measured across three 
different scopes:
Scope 1: Emissions that are direct GHG 
emissions from sources that are owned 
or controlled by Rotork, these include 
emissions from fossil fuels burned on 
site, emissions from owned or leased 
vehicles, and other direct sources.
Scope 2: Emissions that are indirect 
GHG emissions resulting from the 
generation of electricity, heating and 
cooling, or steam generated off-site 
but purchased for heating.
Scope 3: Emissions include indirect 
GHG emissions from sources not 
owned or directly controlled by the 
entity but related to the entity’s 
activities. Scope 3 GHG emission 
sources currently required for GHG 
reporting include transmission and 
distribution (T&D) losses associated 
with purchased electricity, and steam 
and well-to-tank emissions for all 
energy, business travel and transport. 
Absolute scope 1 and scope 2 
emissions have increased by 9.2% on 
2014 and by 26.6% on 2012. Excluding 
new acquisitions, scope 1 and 2 
emissions have increased by 14.5% on 
2014 and by 18.9% on 2012. Emissions 
per £m revenue have increased from 
19.2TnCo
2
e to 22.8TnCo
2
e which is an 
increase of 18.8%.
Conclusions
A number of global weather events 
have impacted on the energy 
consumption of the Group over the 
previous year. 
High temperatures across Central and 
Southern Europe in June and July 
caused an increase in electricity 
consumption by approximately 
14,000kWh that was linked to having 
to run additional air conditioning. 
Continuing cold starts to the year  
have seen a further increase of gas 
consumption in our facilities in the 
northern areas of USA and Canada. 
Since 2012, gas consumption has 
increased in these areas by 46%. 
Overall emissions have increased as 
the size of the Group has increased. 
Whilst there are a number of projects 
that will start to show benefit through 
2016, this work needs to accelerate to 
gain greater savings. 
2016 targets 
To support the increase in the number 
of energy related projects that are 
occurring across the Group the 
following targets have been set for all 
of our large energy consuming sites:
• A full energy balance will be 
required for each large facility.
• All ‘easy wins’ and low effort/high 
impact projects will be 
implemented.
• A further large energy saving 
project will be scoped and, where 
practicable, implemented at each 
large facility.
Local more stringent targets can be 
set where needed to support the 
energy reduction programme of  
the Group.
Absolute scope 1 and scope 2 
emissions have increased by 9.2%  
on 2014 and by 26.6% on 2012. 
Excluding new acquisitions, scope 1 
and 2 emissions have increased by 
2.8% on 2014 and by 19.2% on 2012. 54
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
ETHICS  
AND VALUES
Ethics and values are central 
to the way we do business. 
Rotork’s Ethics and Values 
Statement can be viewed on 
our website, in a number of 
languages, at www.rotork.
com/en/master-record/4433. 
Our ethics and values can be 
split into four strands:
Human Rights and Ethical Business
Rotork is fully committed to respecting 
internationally proclaimed human 
rights as defined in the International 
Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Labour Organisation’s 
standards. Rotork does not accept any 
form of child or forced labour and 
embraces the UN Global Compact 
principles throughout the business 
demonstrating this commitment.  
During the year the Board has 
considered the content of the Modern 
Slavery Act and associated guidance.  
Rotork recognises that an open and 
honest culture is key to understanding 
concerns within the business and will 
investigate any potential wrongdoing. 
Rotork has a whistleblowing policy 
(which can be found on Rotork’s 
website), with an independent external 
whistleblowing hotline, to facilitate the 
reporting of any concerns of 
wrongdoing confidentially.
Employees
Rotork has a firm commitment to all its 
employees regarding wellbeing and 
development. Some of Rotork’s offices 
provide health checks for their 
employees, as well as encouraging 
participation in sports teams or 
one-off charitable events. More details 
regarding charitable activities can be 
found in the Community Involvement 
section (see pages 58 to 59).
Rotork has an objective and fair 
recruitment process which promotes 
equal opportunities across the Group 
in line with the ‘Respect at Work and 
Equality of Opportunity’ policy. Rotork 
is committed to the principle of equal 
opportunities in employment to ensure 
that no employee or job applicant 
receives less favourable treatment 
because of their age, race, nationality, 
ethnic origin, disability, sex, sexual 
orientation, religion, belief or marital 
status. All employees have 
responsibilities to ensure that the 
policy is successfully implemented 
including, ensuring that selection for 
hiring, promotion, training and work 
allocation is carried out in a non-
discriminatory manner.
Employee views and direct 
communication are part of our values 
and we run employee suggestion 
schemes, an annual Group wide 
employee satisfaction survey (ESS) 
and several locations have employee 
forums where employees can raise 
issues to be further considered  
by management.
Employees are briefed by management 
on various matters, including the 
Company’s performance, at regular 
intervals as well as the employee 
bonus performance which is profit 
related. Most locations participate in 
the Company’s employee profit linked 
share schemes.
Rotork has built a strong partnership 
with the Institution of Mechanical 
Engineers (IMechE) to support its 
engineers in gaining incorporated and 
chartered accreditation. Rotork also 
continues to work with IMechE.  
Leeds which has an IMechE industrial 
liaison team who support members of 
the Institution and help to promote it 
internally and to the wider  
engineering community.
Rotork supports apprenticeship 
schemes for young men and women 
which helps to increase access into all 
aspects of Rotork’s business.
Rotork is committed to improving 
diversity across the Group. 
We currently have eight Board 
Directors of which six are male and 
two are female. As at 31 December 
2015, we had a total of 3,759 
employees of which 3,030 were male 
and 729 were female. We also had  
93 senior managers (excluding Board 
directors), 88 of which were male and 
five were female. Full details of 
Rotork’s diversity policy and targets 
can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 67.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Bribery and corruption
Rotork has a zero tolerance policy on 
bribery and corruption worldwide, 
irrespective of country or business 
culture. Rotork’s Ethics and Values 
Statement makes it clear that our 
employees will never offer, pay or 
solicit bribes in any form. Rotork does 
not make political contributions in cash 
or kind anywhere in the world.
Rotork’s whistleblowing policy gives 
whistleblowers various ways to alert 
senior management, anonymously if 
required, to any suspected bribery or 
corruption. All whistleblowing 
concerns, however received, are 
investigated and reported to the Audit 
Committee. During 2015, the 
whistleblowing hotline received nine 
calls covering issues related to health 
and safety, employment and dishonest 
behaviour issues. All were resolved 
satisfactorily. The ESS for 2015 showed 
a continuing trend of increased 
understanding of how to raise a 
wrongdoing concern using the 
whistleblowing hotline. During the year 
further steps were taken to publicise 
and promote the hotline.
Rotork frequently makes use of 
detailed background checks provided 
by specialist bribery and corruption 
due diligence consultants before 
dealing with unknown third parties 
(including agents, on prospective 
acquisitions and suppliers) particularly 
where they are operating in higher risk 
jurisdictions or market sectors.  
Rotork also makes use of objective 
guidance on country risk, such as the 
Corruption Perception Index by 
Transparency International. When 
working with  unknown third parties, 
after the initial detailed background 
checks, Rotork continues to screen 
these third parties via a large number 
of international sources, which can 
detect unethical behaviour including 
watchlists, sanctions lists and the 
media, using its due diligence 
consultants’ proprietary databases.
Rotork has developed and delivered 
anti-bribery and corruption training, 
including an assessment, to all 
employees working in sales and 
purchasing roles, as well as to senior 
accountants, all managers and 
directors (including executive and 
non-executive directors). The anti-
bribery and corruption training is 
delivered as an e-learning module.  
The course has been made available in 
numerous languages and almost 100% 
of employees required to complete the 
course have done so within the 
required period, including new 
employees from acquisitions.  
During 2016, those employees who 
have completed the course over 12 
months ago will receive a refresher 
course.  Last year, all the Company’s 
agents received a bribery and 
corruption booklet which is required  
to be read by all employees of the 
agent working on the Rotork account. 
The relevant manager for the agent is 
required to sign off that this has  
been done.  
Suppliers
Rotork operates an outsourced 
manufacturing model, selecting 
suppliers with sound reputations in  
the marketplace. Many of the suppliers 
have a long term working relationship 
with the Company, ensuring ingrained 
product knowledge within the  
supply chain.
Suppliers are subject to continuous 
automated online monitoring against 
sanctions lists, watchlists, regulatory 
and court records, and a large number 
of national and international media 
sources and the Company is alerted 
where any information is uncovered.
The supplier assessment programme 
includes CSR themed questions 
associated with equal rights and  
equal pay, anti-bribery and  
corruption policies, charitable giving, 
environmental impact and anti-
compulsory or child labour practices. 
These surveys consider current and 
prospective suppliers. The assessments 
are discussed directly with the 
suppliers and any corrective action 
plan is agreed between the Company 
and the supplier.
Rotork Controls Limited and Rotork UK 
Limited, the Group’s main UK trading 
companies, and Rotork plc, are 
signatories to the Prompt Payment 
Code. This ensures suppliers are paid 
according to the terms agreed and this 
encourages good practice to be 
passed down supply chains.
Progress
• All new suppliers to Rotork’s Bath manufacturing  
facility were assessed and passed the approval 
system satisfactorily. 
• Membership of FTSE4Good and UN Global Compact 
was maintained.
• Presentations relating to bribery and corruption were 
given by Rotork’s legal department to general managers 
and sales managers.
• The whistleblowing policy was communicated to 
all employees in each edition of the internal Rotork 
e-newsletter. 
• Bribery and corruption training was provided to relevant 
employees in Dutch and Turkish, in addition to French, 
Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Thai, English, 
Korean, German, Spanish and Chinese.
• Awareness of bribery and corruption issues were further 
increased by circulating information to agents in the form 
of a tailored booklet.
2016 targets
• Continue to make progress in increasing diversity 
across Rotork.
• Ensure Rotork’s diversity policy in its broadest sense  
is communicated across the Group.
• Continue to communicate the whistleblowing policy 
regularly through the Rotork e-newsletter.
• Provide a refresher course in 2016 to all employees who 
have received online bribery and corruption training over 
12 months ago. 
• Ensure agents confirm in writing they have read and 
understand the information in the bribery and corruption 
booklet tailored for agents.
• Ensure a Group wide bribery and corruption risk 
assessment exercise is undertaken in 2016. 56
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
HEALTH 
AND SAFETY
Rotork is fully committed 
to the health, safety and 
well-being of its employees 
and contractors. We ensure 
compliance to all relevant 
legal and regulatory 
requirements, and strive to 
continuously improve our 
health and safety 
performance. 
Policies, procedures and systems of 
safe working are in place, supported 
with training to ensure the health, 
safety and well-being of our 
employees during their working day. 
Fundamental principles
As the business continues to grow 
both organically and through 
acquisition, the fundamental principle 
of ‘If we cannot do a job safely, we will 
not do the job’ is maintained and 
communicated to all those who work 
for, or on behalf of, Rotork.  
Progress
The objective for 2015 was to have an 
Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) below 
a target of 0.37. The actual AFR for 
2015 was 0.25 which is a decrease of 
19% on the previous year and a 
decrease of 55% since 2009.
The AFR is a calculation of accidents 
resulting in over three days lost time, 
divided by the average hours worked, 
multiplied by 100,000.
The number of days lost due to 
workplace injuries has increased by 
0.3%. This has been significantly 
impacted by an incident that occurred 
in 2014 where lost time continued  
into 2015.
The number of minor injuries has 
increased by 9.6% and near misses 
have increased by 38%. These 
increases are believed to be due to 
improved reporting of minor injuries 
and near misses rather than a decrease 
in health and safety performance. 
Occupational health
There have been no occupational 
diseases reported during 2015. 
Rotork continues to promote the 
well-being of its employees.  
For example, in Chennai (India) a 
welfare camp was run with a particular 
focus on bone mineral and bone 
density checks. 120 employees 
participated in the camp which aimed 
to identify those at risk of developing 
osteoporosis in later life. Lifestyle 
advice was given by a therapist and 
some employees had a consultation 
with an appointed doctor. 
Awards and recognition
To ensure high standards of health  
and safety performance, a number of 
businesses within the Rotork Group 
have gained or have maintained 
certification to OHSAS18001. These 
include facilities in Bergamo (Italy), 
Leeds (UK), Wolverhampton (UK)  
and Singapore.

Assurance Activities
In 2015, the audit protocol was 
rebalanced to ensure a greater 
consistency in scoring and to focus on 
risk management processes and 
control. As a result, 51 subsidiaries 
were subject to a compliance audit 
during 2015. It was expected that the 
audit rebalancing would cause 
subsidiaries to have a reduced  
audit score (by between 5% and 10%) 
for previously audited sites.  
At manufacturing facilities, the 
average audit score dropped from 84% 
to 78% which is within the predicted 
scoring range. Sales and service 
subsidiaries performed better than 
expected with the audit score falling 
from 84% to 81%, a reduction below 
the predicted fall. The average overall 
score for existing subsidiaries dropped 
from 84% to 80% which is better than 
predicted. With new subsidiaries 
added into the audit score the average 
has fallen from 84% to 78%. 
No immediate actions were identified 
at any of the audits that were 
conducted. Corrective action plans are 
in place to ensure that issues raised 
during the internal audit process are 
tracked to closure.
Dave Boulton, Alison Cox MBE, June Boulton and 
John Inverdale for Cardiac Risk in the Young
Employee satisfaction Survey
During 2015, 71% of the workforce 
completed an employee satisfaction 
survey. For the question ‘I believe that 
Rotork cares about my health and 
safety’ overall satisfaction was at 81%, 
this was a slight increase of 1% on the 
previous year. For the question ‘In the 
last year, I have seen actions taken to 
maintain safety at my workplace’ there 
was an increase from 76.8% to 79.2%.
Conclusions
Throughout the year we continued  
to keep health and safety as a priority 
for employees and contractors which 
can be seen by the positive results in 
the employee satisfaction survey.  
We continue to learn from events, 
audits and inspections which enables 
us to continually improve our health

COMMUNITY 
INVOLVEMENT
Rotork considers it important 
to contribute to, and engage 
positively with, stakeholders  
in the communities in which 
we operate and to be a good 
community neighbour around 
the world. We regard this  
as part of our ongoing 
responsibilities as a good 
corporate citizen. 
This links into our corporate values 
which include producing a positive and 
beneficial impact in the areas in which 
we operate. One of the ways Rotork 
does this is by having local charity 
committees at each of our sites which 
donate to local charitable causes. This 
empowers local employees to decide 
how to distribute the funds in their 
local communities. Rotork aims to 
contribute 0.1% of profits to local 
charitable causes. 
Local community involvement 
highlights from the year include:
• Leeds (UK) engaged in the Right to 
Read project that assisted pupils at 
a local primary school with reading. 
• Dallas (USA) employees organised 
a food drive for North Texas Food 
Bank that raised a total of 737lbs of 
canned foods and non-perishable 
items. Their contribution provided 
access to over 600 meals for 
hungry children, families and 
seniors in north Texas.  
• Shah Alam (Malaysia) deployed 
volunteers to the east coast of 
Malaysia for a relief mission 
following the worst flood the 
country had seen in 30 years.  
The volunteers distributed  
food and helped clean local  
community homes. 
• Wolverhampton (UK) employees 
donated £250 to local charity 
Compton Hospice, which provides 
care and support to people with life 
limiting conditions.  
• Winston-Salem (USA) employees 
raised more than US$4,000 for the 
Hospice & Palliative Care Center of 
Forsyth County by fundraising and 
participating in the Annual Hospice 
Hope Run. 
Apprenticeship programmes are now 
well established throughout Rotork’s 
global network of subsidiaries. Bath’s 
apprenticeship scheme has run since 
the Company began nearly 60 years 
ago and similar established 
programmes now exist at several 
Rotork locations. Rotork values its 
apprentices and believes in investing  
in its own talent in order to succeed. 
We have also forged links with local 
universities, colleges and schools in  
a number of the locations where  
we operate. 
In addition to local charitable and 
educational activities, Rotork has 
supported two major charities in 2015, 
WaterAid and Sightsavers. Following 
the progress of the Jeldu Woreda 
Project in Ethiopia which we 
supported in 2014, a new project, 
situated in the South East Asian state 
of Timor-Leste, was selected for 2015.
 
Our selected project (supported with a 
donation of £60,000) aims to improve 
the lives of families living in 12 
communities in rural Timor-Leste over 
three years. WaterAid will work with 
the communities to build gravity flow 
systems to deliver clean, safe water to 
the communities. They will run hygiene 
programmes to raise awareness about 
handwashing and provide support for 
the communities to build handwashing 
facilities such as tippy taps. They will

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Sightsavers
provide training about the importance 
of toilets to health, inspiring community 
members to build their own toilets with 
guidance from local partners. 
In addition to our ongoing support for 
WaterAid, we have also continued our 
support for Sightsavers, an international 
charity that works with partners in the 
developing world to combat avoidable 
blindness. Last year, we focused our 
support on two regions in Ghana, 
specifically the trachoma and river 
blindness programmes. This year 
Rotork has supported their Urban Eye 
Project in Kolkata.
Furthermore, following the devastating 
Nepal earthquake and aftershocks in 
April and May, the CSR Committee 
made a donation of £5,000 to 
Freedom Matters. Freedom Matters is a 
charity working on the ground in Nepal 
to deliver relief supplies to people who, 
before the earthquake had very little, 
and afterwards had virtually nothing. 
They are delivering basic food supplies, 
their strategy being that if a family can 
be provided with enough basic food to 
meet their immediate needs, they can 
spend their time rebuilding the other 
parts of their lives, step-by-step. 
Progress
• £60,000 contributed by the Group to WaterAid.
• £40,000 contributed to Sightsavers. 
• £5,000 contributed to Freedom Matters. 
• Variety of donations made to charitable causes relevant to 
the local communities of Rotork’s operating sites.
2016 targets
• Donate 0.1% of Group profits to Rotork’s nominated 
international charity.
• Donate 0.1% of Group profits to charitable causes  
local to Rotork’s operating site.
• Continue to support WaterAid, and in particular the  
Timor-Leste Project.
• Continue to support Sightsavers, specifically urban  
based projects in India.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Statement from the Chairman
I am pleased to set out our Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 62 to 68. The aim of this report is to provide a 
clear and comprehensive explanation of Rotork’s 
governance framework and how it is applied day to day. 
Whilst ensuring we provide detailed reporting in our 
Corporate Governance Report, we have sought to place 
emphasis on explaining how the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) are applied across 
our Group.
As Peter France describes in his Chief Executive’s Statement 
on pages 12 to 14, 2015 presented challenges for Rotork as a 
result of difficult trading conditions across most of Rotork’s 
key markets and geographies. I believe strong corporate 
governance has a key role to play in protecting our business 
and its long term success, especially in challenging 
conditions. It is clear from the conversations I have had with 
a range of key shareholders since becoming Chairman, that 
the strength of the Board and its approach to corporate 
governance remains a highly valued component of Rotork’s 
overall investment proposition. 
There has been a natural focus by the Board on broader 
strategic issues throughout the year – these strategies 
encompass both short term measures designed to manage 
the current downturn in the Group’s markets (such as the 
acceleration of planned cost saving measures), but also 
longer term strategies to effectively position the Group in 
changing markets. 
Our consideration of strategy has been aided by the 
significant work undertaken by the Board on both risk 
assessment and risk appetite during the course of the  
year, ensuring that not only do we, as a Board, accurately 
identify and quantify the risks faced by the Group, but  
that the Board’s appetite for risk informs decision making 
throughout the Group, so we can prudently take advantage 
of the opportunities that those changing markets will 
inevitably present. This work is explained in more  
detail below.
Rotork is subject to the Code, which was revised in 2014. 
The revised version of the Code applied to this financial 
year, and I am happy to report that throughout 2015 Rotork 
has complied with the revised Code, save in two respects.
First, the annual performance review of the Board is 
scheduled to take place during February and March 2016, 
shortly after the end of the financial year covered by this 
report. I felt it was important for me to have sufficient time 
to deepen my understanding of the dynamics and operation 
of the Board and its individual members before formulating, 
in conjunction with an external facilitator, an expanded 
review process from that adopted in recent years. 
Second, in line with the revised Code, we have taken further 
steps during the year to facilitate improved ongoing 
oversight by the Board of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control processes. The new reporting structures 
have been designed and were implemented during the 
fourth quarter of the year under review. Accordingly, the 
Board believes that the Company was in compliance with 
this element of the Code during the fourth quarter of 2015.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Governance Strategic Report
A number of initiatives to further strengthen the 
governance and internal controls within Rotork were 
undertaken during the course of the year. First, the Audit 
Committee undertook a detailed review of the Group’s 
internal audit function, supported by an independent 
quality assessment by PwC. This review resulted in the 
identification of the need for a new Head of Risk and 
Internal Audit, who has been recruited and will start in  
April 2016. Further information on this review is set out  
in the Audit Committee Report on pages 69 to 72.  
Second, as noted above, significant focus was placed  
on risk management by the Board. This comprised two 
principal elements: 
• the adoption of a Risk Appetite Framework and 
improved risk reporting procedures; and
• a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group in accordance with the requirements of the Code. 
The centrepiece of the Board’s work on risk was a risk 
workshop following both the March and April Board 
meetings, which was externally facilitated by Deloitte, with 
additional sessions throughout the year during which the 
outcomes from the initial workshop were analysed and 
refined. The principal output of the risk workshop was the 
Risk Appetite Framework, which is discussed in more detail 
below. This framework was developed by the full Board 
working together as a group, and I am grateful to them for 
their full engagement in the process; I believe this has led  
to a qualitatively better assessment and understanding of 
the risks facing our business, and improved procedures to 
ensure that a prudent analysis of risk is incorporated into 
our decision making processes. Further information on  
the risk review process is set out on pages 44 to 45, and a 
description of the principal risks facing the Group, and how 
the Board seeks to mitigate these risks, is set out on pages 
46 to 47.
Finally, the Audit Committee has led the Board’s work on 
the new longer term viability statement introduced by the 
revised Code, which looks at the prospects for the Group 
over the next three years. The statement is set out on  
page 47.
A summary of the business the Board considered during 
2015 is set out page 64. However, I firmly believe that 
corporate governance does not stop at the boardroom 
door. It is important that the strong governance principles 
demonstrated by the Board are carried on throughout the 
Group at every level and in every location. As we continue 
to grow through acquisition, it becomes increasingly 
important to ensure that the culture of sound governance is 
applied worldwide in a consistent and unified way to ensure 
Rotork’s unique culture is retained and developed. 64

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Governance Strategic Report
UK Corporate Governance Code Compliance Statement
The following section on pages 65 to 68 is a summary of  
the system of corporate governance adopted by Rotork. 
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2015, Rotork fully 
complied with the Code, save in two respects, which are set 
out below. 
Formal Board evaluation 
The formal performance evaluation of the Board in 
accordance with Code Provision B.6 is scheduled to take 
place in February and March 2016, falling outside the 
financial year under review. The review was delayed until 
after the end of the financial year to enable the Chairman to 
have sufficient time, following his appointment in April 2015, 
to formulate a clear understanding of the dynamics of the 
operation of the Board under his Chairmanship, together 
with his own assessment of the strengths and weaknesses 
of individual Board members. These insights were used to 
develop an improved performance review. 
Ongoing monitoring of risk management and  
internal controls
Provision C.2.3 of the revised Code states that the Board 
should monitor the Group’s risk management and internal 
controls. This represents a shift in emphasis to ongoing 
oversight by the Board as a whole. Existing oversight has 
been improved by new reporting structures, including a 
new quarterly Executive Risk Summary, which have been 
implemented with effect from the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Further information on the new reporting structures is set 
out below.
The Code is available to download at www.frc.org.uk.
The Board of Directors
The Board has a duty to promote the long term success of 
Rotork for its shareholders; accomplished by entrepreneurial 
leadership, within a framework of prudent and effective 
controls. Its role therefore includes approval of strategy,  
risk reviews, finance matters, and internal control and risk 
management, including major contract approvals.
The terms and conditions of appointment of Directors are 
available for inspection during business hours at the 
registered office of Rotork plc and at the AGM.
Board composition 
Rotork is led by an effective Board which consists of eight 
members: the Chairman, four independent non-executive 
Directors and three executive Directors. Apart from the 
Chairman, all non-executive Directors are considered to be 
independent from Rotork and are appointed for an initial 
term of three years. Upon the completion of this term, the 
appointment is reviewed and, if appropriate, extended. 
Rotork is compliant with the recommendations of 
Lord Davies’ ‘Women on Boards’ initiative, with female 
representation on the Board standing at 25% as at 
31 December 2015.
The biographies of the Directors and details of Board 
committee membership are set out on pages 60 to 61.
All Directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGM in 
line with the Code.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Roles and responsibilities
There is a documented clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive to ensure 
that there is a balance of power and authority between 
leadership of the Board and executive leadership. The 
division of responsibilities was reviewed and updated 
during 2015 following MJ Lamb’s appointment as Chairman.
All Directors are entitled to seek independent, professional 
advice at the Company’s expense in order to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors. Rotork maintains appropriate 
directors and officers’ insurance cover.
How the Board operates effectively
Board Activities
As part of Rotork’s Board effectiveness, day-to-day 
responsibility for the running of the Company is delegated 
to executive management. However, there are a number of 
matters where, because of their importance in the context 
of the Group’s operations, it is not considered appropriate 
to do this. The Board therefore has a formal and 
documented schedule of matters reserved for its decision. 
The schedule of reserved matters can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.rotork.com. 
In 2015, the Board met 10 times at scheduled meetings and 
three times at additional meetings.
The Chairman, through the Company Secretary, ensures 
that the Board agenda and all relevant information is 
circulated to the Directors sufficiently in advance of the 
meeting. During 2015, the Company transitioned to a new, 
secure, web-based platform for the hosting of Board 
information, including Board packs, relevant documentation 
and minutes of previous meetings of the Board and its 
Committees. This has greatly improved the availability of 
information for the Directors, and the platform also 
facilitates rapid communication between all members of the 
Board. The Chairman and the Company Secretary discuss 
the agenda in detail ahead of every meeting and the 
Chairman and Chief Executive hold a review meeting ahead 
of each Board meeting.
At least once annually, the Board travels to and meets at 
one of Rotork’s locations, other than its head office in 
Bath. This allows the Board, and in particular the non-
executive Directors, the opportunity to gain a deeper 
understanding of overseas businesses and their markets 
and to interact with local management and staff, as well as 
to view new capital investments and acquisitions. In 2015, 
the Board visited Rotork’s manufacturing facility in 
Shanghai, China and met with and received presentations 
from local management.
■ 2015 – Shanghai, China
■ 2014 – Winston-Salem, USA
■ 2014 – Leeds, UK
■ 2013 – Lucca, Italy
■ 2012 – Chennai, India
■ 2011 – Houston, USA
Location of Board meetings
All Directors constructively challenge executive 
management at Board meetings and are entitled to 
unfettered access to information and management across 
the Group. Rotork’s executive directors understand the 
distinction between their roles as executive managers and 
as Board directors. Rotork Board members come from a 
variety of professional backgrounds including engineering, 
legal, accountancy and international sales, and collectively 
possess significant managerial experience, as well as 
experience of being company directors of other public 
limited companies.
At each Board meeting, the Board receives presentations 
from senior management regarding that senior manager’s 
area of responsibility. The principal purpose of the 
presentations is to consolidate the Board’s understanding 
of the Group’s operations, and in particular current strategic 
and operational issues facing divisional management. The 
presentations are structured such that the Board has the 
opportunity to ask questions and constructively challenge 
senior management following their presentations. 
Management presentations normally take place 
immediately before the meeting so that any issues raised in 
them can be considered in wider Board discussions, 
particularly around strategy and risk. In 2015, the Board 
received presentations from management of all four 
business divisions, together with the management from 
Group business functions, including sales and IT.

Governance Strategic Report
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director present to 
the Board the content of full and half year results 
announcements, together with all trading updates issued 
by the Company, and the Board is invited to comment on 
and approve those announcements.
Induction and development 
New Board members receive a suitable and tailored 
induction. This is facilitated by the Company Secretary 
under the direction of the Chairman. No new Director 
appointments were made in 2015. However, additional 
induction activities were undertaken by MJ Lamb as a result 
of his appointment as Chairman in April 2015. This included 
a number of site visits to Rotork facilities in both the UK and 
overseas, together with meetings with investors. 
Directors are encouraged to continually update their 
professional skills and knowledge. During 2015, 
development activities for the Directors included 
participation in external training seminars.
The Chairman is responsible for reviewing the level and 
nature of training given to the Directors at least annually.
Performance evaluations
During February 2016, the Board commenced a detailed 
review of its performance. As noted in the statement from 
the Chairman on page 62, the annual performance review 
was delayed until after the end of the financial year to allow 
MJ Lamb additional time to assess the performance and 
operation of the Board in his role as Chairman. As in 
previous years, the review process was externally facilitated 
by Vivienne Cassley of Useful Thinking, an independent 
external consultancy. This year, the written questionnaire 
which formed the basis of previous performance reviews 
was augmented by a series of one-on-one interviews 
between Vivienne Cassley and the Directors, held during 
February 2016, during which the performance of the Board 
and each of its members was critically examined.
The Chairman is due to formally report on the outcome of 
the evaluation process at the March Board meeting, with 
individual feedback meetings with Directors being held in 
March ahead of that meeting.
JE Nicholas is the current Senior Independent Director. 
As part of his role, he annually arranges a meeting of the 
non-executive Directors to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance. This feedback is used by him to discuss 
with the Chairman his performance.
Diversity on the Board
Rotork currently has 25% female representation on the 
Board, in line with the recommendations of Lord Davies’ 
'Women on Boards' initiative. The Board is cognisant of 
the 'next step recommendations' set out in Lord Davies’ 
five year summary report published in October 2015 and, 
as part of the Group’s continuing commitment to fostering 
diversity in its business (described in more detail in the 
report of the Nomination Committee on page 73), will 
continue to pursue initiatives designed to increase diversity 
at all levels within the Group. 
Internal controls and risk management
The Board has placed considerable focus on risk 
management and mitigation during the year, partly in 
response to the current market conditions and partly  
as a result of the changes to the Code and associated  
new guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) in relation to risk management, internal control and 
related reporting.
Details of the principal risks faced by the Group during the 
year and details of the processes to manage these risks, 
including the Board’s approach to the principal risks the 
Group is willing to take in achieving its specific objectives 
(its ‘risk appetite’), can be found on pages 44 to 47. 
The Board is responsible for Rotork’s system of internal 
control and risk management, and meets at least annually 
to review the effectiveness of it. This risk management 
process has been improved throughout the year as 
described below.
Adoption of Risk Appetite Framework and improved 
monitoring of risk management and internal controls
The Group has adopted a risk review process at a divisional 
level for many years, resulting in a 'bottom up' assessment 
and consolidation of the risks facing the Group. This 
process fed into a biannual review and assessment by the 
Board of the principal risks facing the Group. This existing 
risk management structure has been revised during the 
course of the year, aided by external consultancy provided 
by Deloitte. The key outputs of this process were:
• the adoption of a new Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), 
designed to:
 – Enhance the incorporation of risk into strategic 
decision making at Board and divisional  
management levels;
 – Improve quantitative and qualitative insight into 
principal risks and associated trends;
 – Enable the Board to lead by example in creating a 
risk-aware culture and ensure consistency in decision 
making; and
 – Facilitate proactive risk mitigation.
• the implementation of new quarterly Executive Risk 
Summary, in order to ensure continuous oversight by the 
Group’s risk management and internal controls, with 
quarterly reporting being supplemented as necessary by 
monthly reporting to the Board by the executive 
management team on new or evolving risks.
In addition to the new reporting framework described 
above, all members of the Board receive full Audit 
Committee papers and prior meeting minutes, which 
contain the Audit Committee’s assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems. All non-executive Directors attend Audit 
Committee meetings. Additionally, the Audit Committee 
Chairman briefs the Board on the main business of the 
previous Audit Committee meeting, as well as making 
recommendations from the Audit Committee to the Board. 
Board members therefore receive information and updates 
on the work of the Audit Committee in reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and 
internal control systems throughout the year. 
In the course of its activities during the year, the internal 
audit team identifies improvement recommendations at all 
locations visited. These are discussed with local management 
at the end of the audit and they are charged with 
implementing the agreed improvements. The issues  68
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
identified during the year did not have a material impact on 
the financial statements but the Board continues to look for 
ways to strengthen the Group’s control environment.
This includes the recruitment of a new Head of Risk and 
Internal Audit and the appointment of regional finance 
managers in more regions. These regional finance 
managers have a focus on internal controls, as well as 
operational performance, and will provide an increased 
level of review and contact for the finance teams operating 
within the sales subsidiaries.
Main features of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems
Risk management and internal control can only provide 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, as it is designed to manage the risks 
rather than remove them altogether.
The systems cover controls which enable Rotork to respond 
appropriately to financial, operational, compliance and any 
other risks. Key elements include:
• Robust assurance processes and controls over financial 
reporting procedures;
• A formal schedule of reserved matters for the Board 
including responsibility for reviewing Group strategy;
• Clearly defined levels of authority and a division of 
responsibilities throughout the Group;
• Formal documentation procedures;
• A formal whistleblowing policy with an external 
whistleblowing hotline; and
• An internal audit function made up of accountants from 
head office and across subsidiaries, supported by training 
in internal audit, best practice and control procedures to 
monitor and identify weaknesses in internal controls.
The systems have been augmented throughout the year by 
the improved processes described above in order to comply 
with the revised Code and the FRC’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. The Board considers that it was in 
compliance with the revised Code and the Guidance with 
effect from the fourth quarter of 2015.
Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is a priority for Rotork 
and the Company maintains a regular dialogue with its 
major shareholders. In 2015 the Board, and in particular the 
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, have engaged 
with shareholders in a number of ways including:
• Hosting conference calls;
• Hosting webcasts;
• Attending shareholder events, including a Capital 
Markets Day held in November in Leeds;
• Hosting investor site visits;
• Attending conferences;
• Hosting and participating in roadshows; and
• Arranging ad hoc meetings with shareholders.
The Chairman ensures that all Directors are made aware of 
major shareholder issues and concerns by ensuring the 
Board receives reports from the Chief Executive on 
meetings with analysts and fund managers as well as 
shareholders. In addition, the Board receives reports from 
its brokers which give anonymised feedback from investors.
During the year MJ Lamb had a series of individual 
meetings with current and potential principal shareholders 
in his new capacity as Chairman. Full written reports on 
these meetings were provided to the Board.
Rotork makes constructive use of its AGM as an opportunity 
for the Board to communicate with, and answer questions 
from, those shareholders who attend in person. The entire 
Board is normally available during the meeting and for 
lunch following the meeting to allow direct interaction 
between the Directors and the shareholders.
Rotork also maintains a comprehensive investor relations 
section on its website which provides a variety of resources 
for investors including current webcasts, presentations  
and press releases. The website can be accessed at  
www.rotork.com/en/investors.
Electronic communications are also used by Rotork to 
communicate with its shareholders. All shareholders have 
been asked whether they would like to receive the Annual 
Report and Accounts in electronic form rather than in hard 
copy form. Any shareholders wishing to receive corporate 
documents electronically can do this by registering for the 
service at www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on ‘Register’ 
under the ‘Portfolio’ section. Rotork also make available 
electronic proxy appointment for shareholders who wish to 
appoint a proxy online to vote at the Company’s AGM.
Board Committees
The Board has Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees. Each Committee has formal, written  
Terms of Reference which are available to download from 
the Rotork website at www.rotork.com/en/investors/index/
committees. All Board Committees have four independent 
non-executive Directors within their composition. The 
Group Company Secretary advises and acts as secretary to 
the Committees.
The Committees have authority to take external, 
independent professional advice at Rotork’s expense for 
matters relating to the discharge of their duties.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
During 2015, in addition to its usual schedule of work,  
the Committee focused on three key elements:
• The effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit processes, 
which was supported by an independent quality 
assessment by PwC;
• Contribution to the Risk Appetite Framework and wider 
review of the Group’s risk management and internal 
controls; and
• Consideration of the longer term Viability Statement 
mandated by the revised version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code).
The membership of the Committee was unchanged during 
the year, save for the resignation of MJ Lamb from the 
Committee following his appointment as Chairman in  
April 2015. All Committee members are independent 
non-executive directors. LM Bell and JE Nicholas hold 
professional accounting qualifications and the Board 
considers both to have recent and relevant financial 
experience. Biographies of each member of the Committee 
can be found on pages 60 to 61. The Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Financial 
Controller, Internal Audit Coordinator and external Auditor 
also regularly attend meetings by invitation. 
The Committee operates under formal Terms of Reference 
which are reviewed annually. A copy of the Terms of Reference 
is available on the Rotork website at www.rotork.com. 
Principal responsibilities are to review and report to the 
Board on:
• The integrity of financial reporting;
• Significant accounting policies and judgements;
• Internal control and risk management systems including 
monitoring the effectiveness of internal audit; 
• The appointment, independence and effectiveness of the 
external Auditor, including the policy relating to non-
audit work and policy relating to employment of former 
staff of the external Auditor;
• The external Auditor’s remuneration; and
• Whistleblowing and other Group policies as relevant.
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year
The Audit Committee maintains a rolling programme of 
activities which is kept under review and forms the basis of 
its scheduled meetings throughout the year. This rolling 
programme is supplemented by consideration of specific 
issues as and when they arise. The Committee met six times 
during the year (once in February, April, July and August 
and twice in November). Meetings of the Committee are 
arranged to coordinate with the Group’s financial reporting 
timetable to ensure appropriate scrutiny by the Committee 
of such announcements, including, in particular, review of 
year end and interim financial reports, in addition to other 
trading updates made during the year. A summary of its 
principal activities is set out on page 70.

Financial reporting
A key role of the Committee in relation to financial 
reporting is to review the quality and appropriateness of 
the half year and year end financial statements with a 
particular focus on:
• Accounting policies and practices;
• The clarity of disclosures and compliance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, UK 
company law and the Code;
• Material areas in which significant judgements have been 
applied or, where there has been discussion with the 
external Auditor; and
• Upon request of the Board, advising the Board on 
whether the Annual Report and financial statements are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance as a whole.
To assist the Committee, the Group Finance Director and 
Group Financial Controller present a detailed report at each 
meeting outlining significant matters and the external 
Auditor presents a report on the work they have 
undertaken on the half year and year end financial 
statements. They also present on the scope for the next full 
year audit for consideration by the Committee.
The principal matters of judgement considered by the 
Committee in relation to the 2015 accounts and how they 
were addressed were:
• Goodwill impairment testing: The year end balance sheet 
includes goodwill of £222.1m, this represents 
approximately 31.7% of the Group’s assets. The 
Committee reviewed the carrying value of goodwill by 
examining a report from the Group Financial Controller 
which set out the values attributable to each cash 
generating unit, the expected value in use, based on 
projected cash flows and the key economic assumptions 
related to growth and discount rates. The Committee 
also considered the work undertaken by Deloitte in 
testing the assumptions. The Committee discussed the 
appropriateness of the assumptions used and compared 
expected growth rates to historical averages and the 
discount rate to the Group weighted average cost of 
capital and appropriate risk premiums. The Committee 
also considered whether it was possible that a 
reasonable change in assumptions might indicate 
impairment. Following discussion, the Committee were 
satisfied that the approach taken by management was 
appropriate and that there was no requirement to record 
any impairments in the accounts; Directors Financial Statements Company Information

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Governance Strategic Report
• Acquired intangible assets: During 2015, the Group 
acquired a number of businesses, the largest of which 
was Bifold Group Ltd, which was acquired in August.  
The Committee reviewed the accounting and reporting 
in relation to these acquisitions, in particular the 
determination and valuation of intangible assets 
prepared by the Group Financial Controller. The 
Committee considered this report together with 
comments from Deloitte; it also examined the disclosures 
in the Annual Report and Accounts and concluded the 
judgements made were reasonable and that the 
reporting was accurate;
• Retirement benefit schemes: The Group operates two 
defined benefit retirement plans which are still open to 
future accrual. The valuations are prepared by 
independent actuaries and are reviewed by Deloitte.  
The Committee considered the report and the comments 
by Deloitte and was satisfied the assumptions used were 
appropriate. The detailed disclosure for these schemes 
under IAS19 are shown in note 24 and the Committee is 
satisfied they are complete and accurate; and
• Valuation of inventory: The Group has £87.2m of 
inventory which is spread across all of the Group’s  
global locations. The provisions made to write down 
slow-moving and obsolete inventory are based on an 
assessment of market developments and on an analysis 
of historic and projected usage. The calculation of  
the provisions requires application of judgement by 
management. Management confirmed to the Committee 
that there have been no significant changes to the 
approach used to estimate inventory provisions 
compared with the prior year. Deloitte explained the 
work that they have performed and confirmed that 
based on this work no material inconsistencies or 
misstatements were found. Following discussion,  
the Committee was satisfied that the judgements that 
had been exercised and valuation methodology were 
appropriate and that the provisions were appropriately 
stated at year end.
External Auditor
The year under review marks the second year during  
which Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s external Auditor. 
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external 
audit process, the scope of the Group audit and the quality 
of the audit work throughout the year.
The assessment considers:
• Any issues arising from the prior year audit;
• The proposed audit plan including identification of risks 
specific to Rotork; 
• Audit scope and materiality thresholds;
• Staffing continuity and experience;
• The delivery of the audit in line with the plan;
• Matters arising during the audit and the communication 
of these to the Committee;
• Feedback from executive management;
• Private meetings with the Auditor without management 
being present;
• The independence, objectivity and scepticism of the 
auditor; and
• The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) audit quality 
review (AQR) report on selected audits undertaken  
by Deloitte.
Having completed this review, the Committee agreed that 
the audit process, independence and quality of the external 
audit were satisfactory. 
During the year, the 2014 external audit of the Group was 
subject to review by the FRC’s AQR team. There were no 
significant findings and only one issue was formally 
reported. The final report and the action to address the 
reported finding was discussed and agreed at the 
November Committee meeting, and has been addressed in 
the 2015 external audit. The Committee is satisfied that 
there was nothing arising from the FRC review which 
impacted the proposed reappointment of Deloitte as 
external Auditors. 
Consideration was given to the possibility of retendering 
the external work during the course of the year. The Audit 
Committee has recommended that Deloitte LLP be re-
appointed Auditors for the 2016 financial year and Deloitte’s 
continuing appointment will be subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2016 AGM.
Statement of compliance 
The Company confirms that it has complied with the terms 
of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014 (the Order) throughout the year. 
In addition to requiring mandatory audit retendering at 
least every 10 years for FTSE 350 companies, the Order 
provides that only the Committee, acting collectively or 
through its Chairman, and for and on behalf of the Board, 
is permitted:
• To the extent permissible by law and regulations, to 
negotiate and agree the statutory audit fee and the 
scope of the statutory audit;
• To initiate and supervise a competitive tender process;
• To make recommendations to the Directors as to the 
auditor appointment pursuant to a competitive tender 
process;
• To influence the appointment of the audit engagement 
partner; and
• To authorise an auditor to provide any non-audit services 
to the Group, prior to the commencement of those 
non-audit services.
Non-audit services
In order to safeguard the independence and objectivity of 
the external Auditor, the Board has adopted a policy on 
non-audit services which restricts the work and fees 
available to the external audit firm and the policy is 
reviewed by the Committee annually to ensure it remains 
appropriate and in line with applicable requirements.
The policy specifies certain activities which the external 
Auditor may not undertake, such as work relating to 
financial statements which may be subject to external 
audits or management, or significant involvement with 
internal audit services.
For work within the policy scope, namely anything other 
than audit, half year review or tax compliance work, 
authority has been delegated to the Group Finance Director 
to approve fees of up to £10,000 per project or £40,000 in 
aggregate for general work, £50,000 in aggregate for tax 
work and £10,000 for acquisition related work. Non-audit 
work above these levels requires the prior approval of the 
Committee Chairman or the Committee as a whole.
At each Committee meeting, a summary is provided of all 
non-audit services awarded to the external Auditor during 
the year. 72
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
An analysis of fees paid to Deloitte, including the split 
between audit and non-audit is included in note 8 of the 
report and accounts. The total non-audit fees for 2015 
represent 8.9% of the total Deloitte audit fee. 
Risk management 
The Committee has responsibility for reviewing and 
monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s control 
environment, internal audit and risk management process. 
As explained in the Corporate Governance Report, this year 
has seen particular focus on the Group’s approach to risk 
and its internal control environment.
In the final quarter of 2014, the Audit Committee 
commenced work with the Board on a review of the Group’s 
internal control and risk management systems in order to 
comply with the Code, which provides that the Board 
should undertake a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group and monitor the Group’s risk management 
and internal controls.
This work continued into 2015, and was led by me, as Chair 
of the Audit Committee in conjunction with the Group 
Finance Director. The key outputs of the work, comprising a 
Risk Appetite Framework and new reporting procedures are 
summarised in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 
62 to 68, with the result that both the Audit Committee and 
the Board are satisfied that the Company was in compliance 
with the requirements of the revised Code with regard to 
risk management during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
The Audit Committee will be primarily responsible for 
oversight and review of the new reporting frameworks 
which have been introduced in order to ensure that these 
operate effectively during their first full year of 
implementation.
Internal controls
The second area of focus was on improving the quality of 
the Group’s internal control procedures. The steps taken to 
improve the Group’s internal controls during the year are 
summarised on pages 67 to 68.
During the year, the Committee considered reports on 
internal control from the Group Finance Director as well as 
reports on procedures to prevent bribery and corruption 
and whistleblowing events from the Company Secretary. 
Internal audit 
The final area of focus was on improving the quality of the 
Group’s internal audit processes. PwC was commissioned to 
produce an independent quality assessment into the 
Group’s internal audit function. PwC’s review was 
undertaken through a series of one to one interviews with 
relevant personnel, peer comparison and review of internal 
audit procedure documentation. 
The PwC report highlighted a number of improvements 
which could be made to the methodology and structure of 
the internal audit, including the appointment of a new Head 
of Risk and Internal Audit. These recommendations are 
being implemented, including the recruitment of a new 
Head of Risk and Internal Audit. This recruitment has been 
completed and the position will be filled in April 2016. The 
Head of Risk and Internal Audit will be supported by the 
Internal Audit Coordinator who was appointed in 2014. 
During the year, the internal audit coordinator has initiated 
improvements to the reports to the Committee and the 
reports issued to management on completion of an audit as 
well as introduced a risk based assessment to setting the 
audit visit plan. These improvements will be developed 
further in the coming year.
The Group does not have an independent internal audit 
function but does have a well established internal audit 
approach, using staff from one division to undertake audits 
in a different division. This arrangement encourages the 
sharing of best practice and provides career development 
for the staff involved. External resource was used during the 
year to supplement the internal team where specific 
technical or language expertise was required. 
Whilst the Audit Committee is satisfied that this 'peer 
review' model remains appropriate for the Group’s current 
internal audit objectives, it has noted PwC’s observations 
that an independent function may be warranted in the 
future. Accordingly, the Audit Committee will, as in previous 
years, keep the need for an internal audit function under 
close review. The Head of Risk and Internal Audit will, 
however, provide increased independence and strategic 
direction whilst the peer review model is retained. 
Alongside the PwC review and oversight of the 
implementation of its recommendations, the Committee 
continued to receive a report at each meeting on internal 
audit activity, any significant matters arising and the 
management response. 
Other matters
In accordance with its Terms of Reference, the Committee, 
led by the Chairman, carried out a review of its effectiveness 
by way of a questionnaire, including how it discharged its 
responsibilities and Terms of Reference. Following this 
review, a number of actions will be undertaken during 2016 
to improve the Committee’s effectiveness.
The Committee’s activities were also reviewed as part of the 
Board evaluation process referred to on page 67.
Throughout the year, the Committee also considered 
relevant accounting and corporate governance 
developments, in addition to those in relation to risk and 
internal controls discussed above.
Areas of focus for 2016
In the coming year, further development of the internal 
control environment and risk management processes will 
remain a priority. Increasing the resources and expertise in 
this area through the appointment of a Head of Risk and 
Internal Audit is the next step in this evolution.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
During the year, the Committee recommended to the Board 
the appointment of MJ Lamb as Chairman, with the 
appointment taking effect from the conclusion of the AGM 
held in April following Board approval of the appointment. 
MJ Lamb did not attend the Committee meeting at which 
his appointment was considered. 
MJ Lamb’s appointment as non-executive Director in  
2014 was externally facilitated by Korn Ferry, an external 
search consultancy, in a process which contemplated  
his subsequent appointment as Chairman, subject to 
satisfactory performance. Korn Ferry has no other 
connection with the Company.
The Committee also considered succession planning in 
order to satisfy itself that plans are in place for an orderly 
succession for appointments to the Board and senior 
management to maintain an appropriate balance of skills 
and experience within the Group and to ensure progressive 
refreshing of the Board. 
Further action on succession planning in the context of the 
Group’s strategic objectives will constitute the main focus 
for the Committee in 2016, with constructive initial dialogue 
between the non-executive Directors having taken place 
following the Committee meeting in November 2015, at 
which the FRC discussion paper on board succession 
planning was discussed. 
Diversity policy
As part of its commitment to maintaining an appropriate 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience, the Board 
seeks to attain a diverse mix of skills, experience, 
knowledge and background. In considering diversity, 
gender will play an important role but the Board will take 
account of ethnicity, nationality, background, profession 
and personality.
Rotork currently has 25% female representation on the 
Board, in line with the recommendations of Lord Davies’ 
'Women on Boards' initiative. The Board is cognisant of the 
'next step recommendations' set out in Lord Davies’ five 
year summary report published in October 2015.
The Board will take a number of voluntary actions to 
improve diversity, including only using external search 
consultants (where such consultants are engaged to make 
an appointment) which have signed up to the Voluntary 
Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms and assisting 
the development of the executive pipeline by encouraging 
senior employees to take on additional roles, such as 
seeking non-executive director roles, to gain valuable 
board experience.
The Board’s diversity policy also applies more generally 
throughout the Group and sets out other actions the Group 
will take to contribute to a more diverse pool of talent.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for leading  
the process for Board appointments and making 
recommendations to the Board: ensuring succession 
planning is in place; regularly reviewing the structure, size 
and composition of the Board, including its balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience; and making recommendations 
as appropriate.
Activities of the Nomination Committee during the year

February, March and November). A summary of principal

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN  
OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is split into two parts:
• The Policy Report, which sets out the Company’s policy 
on Directors’ remuneration. The policy was approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM for a period of three years; 
and 
• The Annual Report on Remuneration which discloses the 
payments and awards made to the Directors under the 
policy and shows the link between remuneration and the 
Group’s performance. 
The Policy Report is not subject to a shareholder vote this 
year. The Annual Report on Remuneration, together with 
this introductory statement, is subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
During 2015, the Remuneration Committee (Committee) 
continued to monitor developments relating to 
remuneration. Throughout the year, the Committee has 
considered updates on best practice from relevant 
providers of corporate governance guidance. The Group 
supports the continued drive for improvement of best 
practice and for greater focus on transparency, moderation, 
simplicity and a closer alignment of the interests of the 
Directors with those of the shareholders.
Remuneration for 2015
As set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration, following 
a challenging year, the Company’s performance against 
2015 incentive targets resulted in an annual cash bonus 
payout of 18.8% of the maximum bonus opportunity 
available and a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) vesting  
rate of nil for the 2013 award (which was based on earnings 
per share (EPS) and total shareholder return (TSR) 
performance over the three years to 31 December 2015). 
The cash bonus payment reflected the achievement of cash 
flow and accident frequency targets. 
Remuneration for 2016
The Committee continues to be mindful of employee 
remuneration conditions around the Group and salary 
increases for executive Directors in 2016 will be 1%,  
which is broadly in line with the typical increase for other 
UK employees. 
During the year, the Committee approved revised and 
simplified cash bonus criteria for the executive Directors for 
2016, within the parameters of the existing Policy Report.  
In response to the challenging conditions facing the Group, 
the revised criteria reflect an increased emphasis on annual 
profit performance, with the balance based on the strategic 
and personal performance, cash generation performance, 
and accident frequency rate. Further details of the revised 
criteria are set out on page 88. The maximum cash bonus 
potential remains 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 
100% of salary for other executive Directors.
The LTIP awards will continue to be based on EPS and  
TSR performance (each accounting for 50% of the award). 
The TSR performance condition will be the same as set for 
previous awards. The EPS performance target for the 2016 
awards will require 9% to 35% EPS growth over the three 
year performance period (for 15% to 100% vesting for this 
part of the award)
1
. The LTIP award levels for 2016 will be 
150% of salary for the Chief Executive, 125% of salary for the 
Group Finance Director and 100% of salary for the President

competitiveness of the long term incentive opportunity. The Committee is satisfied that the performance targets are 
appropriately challenging taking into account expected performance and the proposed award levels. 
Planning ahead for the 2017 AGM
During 2016, the Committee intends to review the Policy Report to ensure that it continues to support the business 
strategy, appropriately incentivises and rewards the Directors for their role in the long term success of the Group and is 
aligned to the interests of shareholders. This review will coincide with the requirement for the Company to submit the 
Policy Report to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM, and the outcome of the review and the Policy Report itself will 
be communicated in next year’s remuneration report. Any significant changes will be subject to prior consultation with 
major shareholders.
Activities of the Committee during the year 
The Remuneration Committee maintains a rolling programme of activities which forms the basis of its scheduled meetings 
throughout the year. This rolling programme is supplemented by consideration of specific issues as and when they arise. 
The Committee met five times during the year (in February, March, July, September and December). A summary of its 
principal activities is set out below:

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board at the AGM. The Auditor is required to 
report on the information concerning the single figure of remuneration, total pension entitlements, scheme interests 
awarded during the financial year, payments made to past Directors (if any), payments for loss of office (if any) and the 
statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests shown within the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
POLICY REPORT
 
This report sets out the policy of the Company on the remuneration of the Directors. The Policy Report was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM of the Company held on 25 April 2014 and took effect from that date. The Policy Report is not 
subject to a shareholder vote this year but has been reproduced here for ease of reference. The graphs on page 81 have 
been updated to reflect the current salaries of the executive Directors.
Role of the Committee 
The principal role of the Committee is to determine the framework and policy for remuneration of the executive Directors 
and the Chairman, ensuring that remuneration levels are sufficient but not excessive in order to attract, retain and motivate 
directors of the quality required to run the Company. The full Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the 
Company’s website at: www.rotork.com/en/investors/index/committees. 
Key responsibilities include:
• Within the approved policy, determining individual remuneration packages for the Chairman and executive Directors, 
including the terms of any discretionary share schemes in which executive Directors may be invited to participate, 
taking into account the level of remuneration for other Rotork Management Board members and being aware of 
remuneration conditions throughout the Group; 
• Agreeing the terms and conditions to be included in service agreements for executive Directors, including termination 
payments; and
• Selecting, appointing and setting Terms of Reference with any remuneration consultants who may advise the Committee.

 The EPS target range for the 2015 LTIP awards was RPI + 10% to RPI + 25%. Further details on the 2015 LTIP grants are set out on page 83.  76
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company 
The Committee is sensitive to employee remuneration conditions in the Group and in determining remuneration takes 
account of remuneration conditions throughout the Group. While the Committee does not consult with employees on 
remuneration, it does invite the Group Human Resources Director to its meetings to provide, amongst other things, details 
of employee remuneration conditions and metrics such as pay rises awarded to employees. 
Consideration of shareholder views 
In formulating the Policy Report, the Committee takes into account guidance issued by shareholder representative bodies, 
including the Investment Association, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (formerly the NAPF) and the 
Institutional Shareholders' Service. The Committee also takes into consideration any views expressed by shareholders 
during the year (including at the AGM) and encourages an open dialogue with its largest shareholders. Major shareholders 
would be consulted in advance about changes to the approved Policy Report or any significant proposed changes to the 
way in which it is implemented.

Framework used to assess

Base salary To attract and 
retain executive 
Directors of the 
right calibre and 
provide a core  
level of reward for 
the role.
Salary levels (and subsequent salary increases) 
are set after taking into account the 
responsibilities of the role, the value of the 
individual in terms of skills, experience and 
personal contribution, Company performance, 
internal relativities and pay conditions, and 
external market data (benchmarked against 
companies of a similar size and complexity  
and other companies in the same industry  
sector).The Committee also considers the  
impact of any increase to salaries on the total 
remuneration package.
Salaries are paid monthly and reviewed annually 
(salaries are normally reviewed in December, with 
any changes effective from 1 January). Details of 
the current salaries of the executive Directors are 
set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Any salary increase will ordinarily be in line with 
the typical increase (as a percentage of salary) 
applied to the UK workforce. However, the 
Committee retains the discretion to award a 
higher increase if appropriate. For example, where 
there is a change in responsibility, progression in 
the role or to reflect the increased experience of 
the individual.
N/A
Benefits To attract and 
retain executive 
Directors of the 
right calibre by 
providing a market 
competitive level of 
benefit provision.
The range of benefits that may be provided is  
set by the Committee after taking into account 
local market practice in the country where the 
executive is based. The executive Directors’ 
benefits currently include a car and fuel, or
car and fuel allowance, personal accident 
insurance for UK executive Directors only and 
private medical insurance. Additional benefits 
may be provided, as appropriate.
Executive Directors are also entitled to 
membership of the all-employee Rotork Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP), or Overseas Profit Linked 
Share Scheme (OPLSS), within the maximum 
limits as set by HMRC.
There is no prescribed maximum level, but the 
Committee monitors the overall cost of the 
benefit provision to ensure that it remains 
appropriately proportionate.

Annual cash 
bonus
Drives and rewards 
performance 
against annual 
financial and 
operational goals 
which are 
consistent with the 
medium to long 
term strategic 
needs of the 
business.
The maximum annual bonus potential is 125%  
of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of 
salary for other executive Directors. Bonuses  
are paid in cash.
The executive annual bonus 
is focused on the delivery  
of strategically important 
performance measures. 
These include demanding 
financial and non-financial 
measures. The financial 
measures (which account 
for the majority of the 
bonus potential) are 
currently based on annual 
profit target, three year 
profit growth, EPS and cash 
generation. The non-
financial measures currently 
include the accident 
frequency rate and CO
2
 
emissions. However, the 
Committee may use 
different measures and/or 
weightings for future bonus 
cycles to take into account 
changes in the strategic 
needs of the business.
For each measure, normally 
a sliding scale of stretching 
targets is set by the 
Committee, which apply 
from the beginning of each 
financial year. The threshold 
level of bonus under each 
financial measure varies but 
accounts for no more than 
one third of the maximum 
bonus opportunity under 
any single measure. Under 
the terms of the bonus plan, 
the Committee has the 
discretion, in exceptional 
circumstances, to amend 
previously set targets or to 
adjust the proposed payout 
to ensure a fair and 
appropriate outcome.
Policy update: as noted on 
page 74, and as permitted 
under the Policy Report, the 
Committee has approved 
revised bonus measures for 
2016. Bonuses for 2016 will 
be based on annual profit, 
cash generation, strategic 
and personal targets and 
the accident frequency rate. 78

Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)
To incentivise long 
term value creation 
and alignment with 
shareholder 
interests.
The LTIP permits an annual grant of shares which 
vest, subject to performance and continued 
employment. The LTIP awards will be granted  
in accordance with the rules of the plan, which 
were approved by shareholders in 2010, and  
the discretions contained therein. A copy  
of the rules is available on request from the 
Company Secretary.
Under the rules of the LTIP, the maximum award 
size is 150% of salary. Details of the proposed 
award level for 2016 are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Awards under the LTIP may be granted in the 
form of conditional shares, forfeitable shares, 
nil-cost options or cash (where the award cannot 
be settled in shares). Awards are currently 
structured as nil-cost options.
The executive Directors are also subject to a 
shareholding requirement to build and maintain 
a shareholding in Rotork equivalent to 150%  
of salary.
Awards under the LTIP are 
currently subject to two 
performance conditions. 
Half of the awards are 
subject to an EPS 
performance condition and 
half of the awards are 
subject to a relative TSR 
performance condition, 
each measured over three 
financial years. The TSR 
performance condition is 
also subject to an underpin 
relating to underlying 
financial performance.  
A sliding scale of targets is 
set for each measure with 
no more than 25% of the 
award (under each measure) 
vesting for achieving the 
threshold performance 
hurdle. The performance 
targets are set prior to the 
grant of each award. 
Different targets and/or 
weightings between 
measures may be set for 
future award cycles.
Under the LTIP rules 
approved by shareholders, 
the Committee has the 
discretion to amend the 
targets applying to existing 
awards in exceptional 
circumstances providing the 
new targets are no less 
challenging than originally 
envisaged. The Committee 
also has the power to adjust 
the number of shares 
subject to an award in the 
event of a variation in the 
capital of the Company.
Pension To provide a market 
competitive 
remuneration 
package to enable 
the recruitment  
and retention of 
executive Directors.
The Company may fund contributions to a 
Director’s pension as appropriate. This may 
include participation in the Company’s defined 
benefit pension schemes (which are now closed  
to new members), contributions to a money 
purchase scheme and/or payment of a cash 
allowance where appropriate.
Further details on the Company’s policy on 
pension arrangements (including maximum 
entitlements) are set out below.
Life assurance is provided for executive Directors 
based in the UK only.

Chairman and

Directors’ fees
To attract and retain 
non-executive 
Directors of the  
right calibre.
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive 
Directors are reviewed periodically.
Non-executive Director fees are determined by 
the Chairman and Chief Executive. The fees for 
the Chairman are determined by the Committee 
taking into account views of the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman excludes himself from such 
discussions.
The fees for the non-executive Directors (which 
are paid quarterly in cash) normally comprise a 
basic Board fee, with additional fees paid to the 
Senior Independent Director and for chairing a 
Committee. The fee levels set are set by reference 
to rates in companies of comparable size and 
complexity. The fee levels are reviewed 
periodically taking into account the 
responsibilities of the role and the time 
commitment of the individual.
The maximum aggregate fee level is £500,000.
N/A
Performance measures
Performance measures are used to determine the extent of any awards made under the variable elements of the executive 
Directors’ remuneration mix, being the annual cash bonus and the LTIP. The performance measures used are set out in the 
Directors’ future policy table above. The performance measures were selected because of their use as key performance 
indicators (KPIs) to assess Company performance and to align the interests of the Directors to those of the shareholders. 
Non-financial KPIs constitute part of the annual cash bonus award and these are selected to ensure that performance 
measured by financial KPIs is not delivered at the expense of important non-financial considerations, in this case the safety 
of Rotork’s people and Rotork’s impact on the environment.
Clawback and malus
The payment of any bonus is at the ultimate discretion of the Committee and the Committee also retains an absolute 
discretion to reclaim some, or all, of any annual bonus paid in exceptional circumstances, such as misstatement of results, 
an error in the calculation of the performance targets and/or award size and gross misconduct.
In terms of the LTIP, the Committee has the discretion to reclaim some, or all, of a vested LTIP award in exceptional 
circumstances (the categories for clawback being the same as for the annual bonus plan). In addition, the Committee may 
lapse or reduce an award prior to vesting where the participant is found to be guilty of serious misconduct.
Pension policy
PI France and JM Davis are active members of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (Pension Scheme), a defined 
benefit pension scheme. If they remain active members of the Pension Scheme until their normal retirement age of 60 and 
65 respectively, PI France will be entitled to a pension of 66.7% of the earnings cap and JM Davis will be entitled to a 
pension of 47.5% of the earnings cap (which is set at £149,400 per annum for 2016) but may increase in line with inflation. 
These figures ignore any benefits transferred from another pension arrangement and the tax implications of remaining in 
the Pension Scheme until normal retirement age. In addition, they receive a cash allowance on salary above the cap (22.5% 
for PI France and 18% for JM Davis). GM Ogden was a preserved member of the Pension Scheme and received a cash 
allowance of 44% of salary in lieu of pension until his retirement on 31 March 2015 when he became a pensioner. RH Arnold 
is a member of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplementary executive retirement plan, which in 
aggregate are targeted to provide a pension of 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65. The Company’s defined benefit 
pension schemes in the UK and the USA are closed to new entrants. The pension arrangement that would be offered to a 
new executive Director would be limited to a maximum 25% of salary cash allowance or contribution to one of the 
Company’s defined contribution schemes and/or continued participation in a defined benefit scheme if the executive is an 
existing member of one of the schemes.
  80
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Differences between the policy on Directors’ 
remuneration and the policy on employee remuneration
The Board recognises that it is appropriate for a significant 
proportion of executive Directors’ remuneration to be 
contingent on the performance of the Company and that 
such remuneration is at risk subject to the satisfaction of 
stretching performance conditions. Consequently, executive 
Directors are invited to participate in the LTIP where shares 
awarded will vest contingent upon performance conditions 
over a three year period. Executive Directors are also 
invited to participate in the annual cash bonus scheme 
which will result in a cash bonus payment being made if 
targets are achieved. For employee remuneration, the 
Board considers it more appropriate that employees share 
in the success of the Company through a profit based 
bonus plan which is based on the performance of their 
business unit. This is coupled with the opportunity, for 
eligible employees, to receive free shares from the 
Company, paid from the Company’s profits.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with Rotork’s 
remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and 
calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration 
package. Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary 
initially, a series of increases to salary may be given over 
subsequent years, subject to individual performance. 
Benefits will generally be provided in accordance with the 
approved policy, with relocation expenses/an expatriate 
allowance paid for if necessary.
The structure of the variable pay element will be in 
accordance with Rotork’s approved policy detailed above. 
The maximum aggregate variable pay opportunity under 
the policy is up to 275% of salary for the role of Chief 
Executive and up to 250% of salary for other executive 
Directors. Different performance measures may be set 
initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the 
responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the 
financial year that the executive joined.
In the case of an external hire, it may be necessary to 
buy-out incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which 
would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer).  
This would be provided for taking into account the  
form (cash or shares) and timing and expected value  
(i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria)  
of the remuneration being forfeited. Replacement share 
awards, if used, may be granted using Rotork’s existing 
share plans to the extent possible, although awards may 
also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and 
as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay 
awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to 
pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or non-executive Director will be 
set in line with the approved Policy Report.
Service contracts and policy on payments for loss 
of office
Under the executive Directors’ service contracts, 12 months’ 
notice of termination of employment is required by either 
party (except in the case of RH Arnold, see below). Should 
notice be served, the executives can continue to receive 
basic salary, benefits and pension for the duration of their 
notice period, during which time the Company may require 
the individual to continue to fulfil their current duties or, for 
PI France or JM Davis, may assign a period of garden leave. 
The Company applies a general principle of mitigation in 
relation to termination payments and the service contracts 
for PI France and JM Davis (which reflect the policy to be 
used for future hires) expressly include the use of monthly 
phased payments following termination in lieu of notice 
which can be reduced to the extent that alternative 
remunerated employment is found.
The service contracts for PI France and JM Davis also 
enable the Company to elect to make a payment in  
lieu of notice equivalent in value to 12 months’ base 
salary only.
RH Arnold does not have a signed service agreement  
in place. Instead the conditions of his employment are 
governed by local state law (he is resident in the USA).  
The Company may terminate his employment without 
notice or compensation (providing it meets any employer 
obligations such as the settlement of unpaid holiday 
entitlement and sick leave).
In the event of cessation of employment, the executives 
may still be eligible for a bonus at the discretion of the 
Committee, payable in cash, on a pro rata basis, but only  
for the period of time served from the start of the financial 
year to the date of termination and not for any period in  
lieu of notice. Different performance measures (to the  
other executive Directors) may be set for the bonus for the 
period up until departure, as appropriate, to reflect changes 
in responsibility.
The rules of the LTIP set out what happens to awards if a 
participant leaves employment before the end of the 
vesting period. Generally, any outstanding share awards  
will lapse when an executive leaves employment except  
in certain circumstances. If the executive ceases to be 
employed as a result of death, injury, retirement, transfer  
of employment or any other reason at the discretion of the 
Committee, then they will be treated as a ‘good leaver’ 
under the plan rules. The shares for a good leaver will vest 
subject to an assessment of performance, with a pro rata 
reduction to reflect the proportion of the vesting period 
served. For awards granted in 2013 and prior, the awards  
for a good leaver will vest on cessation of employment. For 
awards to be granted in 2014 and beyond, the awards for  
a good leaver will vest on the normal vesting date, unless 
the Committee determines that they should vest early  
(for example, following the death of the participant). In 
determining whether an executive should be treated as a 
good leaver and the extent to which their award may vest 
(up to the pro rated amount), the Committee will take into 
account the circumstances of an individual’s departure.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs 
may be provided where appropriate.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise 
claims in connection with a termination would be paid as 
necessary.

Illustration of the application of the Policy Report
The charts below illustrate how the Policy Report would function for minimum, on target and maximum performance for 
2016 for each executive Director.
Salary levels (and consequently the other elements of the remuneration package which are calculated as a percentage of salary) are based on those 
applying on 1 January 2016. Taxable benefits are shown as the cost to the Company of supplying those benefits for the year ending 31 December 2015. 
On target performance, for illustrative purposes, assumes achievement of 60% of the maximum available bonus and threshold LTIP vesting (20% of 
the maximum). Maximum performance assumes achievement of the maximum bonus and full vesting of the LTIP shares. The LTIP grant level for:  
RH Arnold is 100% of salary; PI France from 2016 is 150% of salary; and JM Davis from 2016 is 125% of salary. No share price growth has been assumed 
and for simplicity, the benefit derived from participating in the Company’s all employee SIP or OPLSS has been excluded.

LTIP
The LTIP rewards the creation of shareholder value which is a strategic priority. Performance is measured over a three year 
period using a combination of EPS, growth and TSR compared to a comparator group. The performance measures and 
weightings are summarised in the table below.
The awards granted and vesting under this plan to the executives are detailed in the table below:

 Restated to reflect subdivision of ordinary 5p shares into 0.5p shares.
(i) The 2012 awards were based on TSR and EPS performance to 31 December 2014 (each condition accounting for 50% of the award). TSR was 
measured relative to the FTSE 250 index (excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts). For the EPS condition, EPS 
growth must be at least RPI + 10% for 25% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI + 25% and above. 
Rotork’s actual TSR performance was 48% resulting in 0% of the TSR element of the award vesting. Rotork’s actual EPS growth was 28% resulting 
in 73.9% of the EPS element of the award vesting. The overall vesting of the awards was 37% and the total number of shares vesting in respect of 
all executives was therefore 193,940
1
. The shares vested on 5 March 2015 and the share price on the date of vesting was £2.50
1
.
(ii) The performance conditions for the 2013 awards are based on performance to 31 December 2015. The targets are the same as for the 2012 awards. 
Rotork’s actual TSR performance was 0% and the EPS growth was -16.4% resulting in the minimum performance criteria not being achieved. The 
awards will lapse in March 2016.
(iii) The 2014 awards were granted on 7 March 2014 and are subject to the same performance targets as the 2013 awards (albeit based on 
performance to 31 December 2016). 
(iv) The 2015 awards were granted on 6 March 2015 and are subject to the same performance targets as the 2012, 2013 and 2014 awards (albeit based 
on performance to 31 December 2017). Further details on the awards are set out in the table below. 
(v) GM Ogden retired from the Board on 31 March 2015. He had been treated as a good leaver in respect of his outstanding LTIP awards (see page 87). 
The awards continue to vest subject to performance and a time pro rata reduction. For the 2013 LTIP award, performance was measured to the 
date of cessation of employment. The TSR element of the award did not vest. The EPS element of the award vested at 52.6%. For the 2014 LTIP 
award, performance will be measured at the end of the performance period (31 December 2016).

Free SIP and OPLSS share awards (audited)
In common with all eligible employees, UK based executive Directors receive an entitlement to ordinary shares under the 
SIP which is approved by HMRC. Under the SIP and the OPLSS an aggregate total of up to 5% of profits are distributed to 
employees each year in the form of ordinary shares. The distribution is calculated by reference to years of service and basic 
salary. Details of free share awards under the SIP and OPLSS made to executive Directors in 2015 are set out below. Free 
shares awarded to all three UK executive Directors under the SIP are subject to the HMRC upper limit of £3,600 by value. 
This limit also applies to the OPLSS for the year under review.

Sharesave options granted to executive Directors (audited)
In common with all eligible UK employees, UK based executive Directors are entitled to participate in the HMRC approved 
Rotork Sharesave Scheme. Under the Sharesave Scheme, employees are permitted to save up to £500 per month for a 
term of three or five years, after which the employee is allowed to exercise the share option. The option price is determined 
in accordance with the HMRC approved Sharesave Scheme Rules and is calculated by taking an average of the share price 
over the five days preceding the invitation date.
The option exercise period is the six months following the lapse of the options.

Share retention policy statement
All executive Directors are required to maintain a shareholding of at least 150% of basic salary. The policy requires the  
use of shares vesting under the LTIP to achieve this requirement. All executive Directors have met this requirement,  
except JM Davis who, due to the share price falling during the year, is now at a shareholding of 128% of salary. There has 
been no change in the Directors’ interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company between 31 December 2015 and  
29 February 2016. 86

* Please refer to note 2 below.
1. The amounts above have been calculated in accordance with Statutory Instrument 2013 No 1981 – The Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Account and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
2. The total accrued pension in the defined benefit scheme as at 31 December 2015 is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal 
pension age, based on service to 31 December 2015, except for GM Ogden who became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life 
Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012 and began drawing his benefits from 5 April 2015. The figure shown for GM Ogden’s total benefit as at  
31 December 2015 includes deferred revaluation applied to the date he began drawing benefits and deduction for annual allowance tax charges, 
but does not include any reduction applied for early retirement or exchanging pension for a cash sum, or any subsequent pension increases 
applied before 31 December 2015.
3. The value of benefits in the defined benefit pension scheme is based on the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporating an increase 
for Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation.
4. GM Ogden became a preserved member of the scheme as at 5 April 2012 and so did not accrue any additional pension during 2015. He receives a 
cash allowance of 44% of basic salary in lieu of this pension benefit, which amounted to £22,990 in 2015 (up to the date of his retirement).
5. The pensionable salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme for PI France and JM Davis is restricted to a scheme specific 
earnings cap which was £145,800 for 2015. In lieu of this limitation on their benefits under the scheme they receive a monthly cash sum equal to 
22.5% and 18% respectively of their basic salary above the scheme’s specific cap. During 2015, this resulted in additional cash allowances of 
£63,945 and £26,339 respectively. 
6. The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive 
retirement plan so that, in aggregate, the pension arrangements for RH Arnold are targeted to provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped 
basic salary at age 65. The valuations of the benefits are affected by movements in the US dollar relative to sterling (which is the cause of the large 
increase in value over 2015) and are therefore not directly comparable with the directors in the UK scheme. If exchange rates had been unchanged 
from those used for 2014, then the increase in the value of RH Arnold’s benefit over 2015 would have been £94,060. We have assumed that  
RH Arnold does not contribute to this arrangement.
7. The accrued pension figures for PI France include a fixed transfer-in pension amount of £5,123 which is payable from his normal retirement date at 
age 60.

Percentage change in remuneration of Director undertaking the role of Chief Executive 
This shows the percentage change in remuneration (salary, benefits and bonus) between 2014 and 2015 of the Chief 
Executive, PI France, compared to percentage change for UK employees, being the group against which salary increases 
are compared, calculated on a per head basis. 
The remuneration breakdown varies from country-to-country so the best comparison should be provided by looking at 
total remuneration. Total remuneration per employee has reduced year on year by 2%. However, this comparison is 
distorted by currency movements as the average salary increase between 2014 and 2015 for overseas employees was 2.8% 
and for the UK workforce was 1.9%.

Retirement of GM Ogden
GM Ogden retired from the Company on 31 March 2015. He did not receive any compensation for loss of office. He received 
a prorated annual cash bonus for 2015 as set out in the single figure of remuneration table on page 82. The Committee has 
exercised its discretion in relation to his outstanding LTIP awards for 2013 and 2014 for them not to lapse on his retirement 
in line with the relevant scheme rules applicable for each award. The Committee considered that the use of its discretion in 
this way was justified given GM Ogden’s length of service as an employee and overall contribution to the Group. The 
awards remained eligible for vesting subject to performance and a time pro rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the 
performance period served. For the 2013 award, under the plan rules, performance was measured to the date of cessation 
of employment. This resulted in 13,600 of shares vesting to GM Ogden with respect to the 2013 award. For the 2014 award 
performance is measured until the end of the outstanding performance period being 31 December 2016 and there will be a 
pro rata vesting in the event that the performance criteria are achieved. Any outstanding Sharesave or SIP awards will vest 
in accordance with their terms.
Retirement of RH Arnold
As announced in March 2016, RH Arnold will retire from Rotork in August 2016, following 38 years' of service with the 
Group, including 28 years as President of Rotork Controls Inc.. He will not receive any compensation for loss of office. He 
will be eligible to receive a prorated annual cash bonus for 2016 based on the period worked. The Committee has exercised 
its discretion in relation to his outstanding LTIP awards for them not to lapse on his retirement in line with the relevant 
scheme rules applicable for each award. The Committee considered that the use of its discretion in this way was justified 
given his length of service and overall contribution to the Group. The awards will remain eligible for vesting (on the normal 
vesting date) subject to performance and a time pro rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the performance period 
served.  Any outstanding OPLSS awards will vest in accordance with their terms. 88
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Statement of implementation of the remuneration policy in 2016
The base salaries for the executive Directors were reviewed in December 2015 and the percentage increases shown below 
(effective from 1 January 2016) were agreed by the Committee. This is consistent with the typical increase for the UK 
workforce (which was 1%). 
The salaries from 1 January 2016 are therefore as follows:
• RH Arnold – US$393,657 (1%);
• JM Davis – £295,046 (1%); and
• PI France – £434,300 (1%).
Following a review, the Committee decided to make certain changes to the annual cash bonus for 2016. The three year 
profit growth and EPS target will be removed, and strategic and personal targets are being introduced to more 
appropriately reflect the business strategy. The annual cash bonus for 2016 will therefore be based on annual profit target 
(60%), cash generation (15%), accident frequency rate (5%), and strategic and personal target objectives (20%). As was the 
case in 2015, the maximum cash bonus potential is 100% of basic salary for executive Directors, except for the Chief 
Executive where the bonus potential is 125% of basic salary. The specific targets relating to the cash bonus have not been 
disclosed as they are considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive, but full details will be given on a 
retrospective basis in next year’s report.
The LTIP award levels for 2016 will be 150% of salary for the Chief Executive, 125% of salary for the Group Finance Director 
and 100% of salary for the President of Rotork Controls Inc. (increased from 125% for the Chief Executive and 100% for the 
Group Finance Director in 2015). These increased award levels are within the Policy Report maximum of 150% of salary and 
are designed to increase the competiveness of the long term incentive opportunity. 
Consistent with the approach used in previous years, the LTIP performance conditions will be subject to TSR and EPS 
performance conditions (each accounting for 50% of the award). TSR will be measured relative to the FTSE 250 Index 
excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts with 25% vesting at median increasing to full 
vesting for upper quartile performance or above. For the EPS condition, EPS growth must be at least 9% for 15% vesting, 
increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of 35% and above. The revised target range, which is no 
longer referenced to the UK RPI, reflects the increasingly international nature of the Company and the expected future 
outlook for the business given the uncertain macro-economic environment. The Committee is satisfied that the EPS targets 
remain appropriately challenging given the current outlook for the Group and the proposed award levels.
The fees for the non-executive Directors were reviewed in December 2015. The fee for the Chairman was reviewed in March 
2015 as part of the search process for a successor Chairman. The current fee policy is:
• Chairman: £180,000;
• Base Board fee: £47,000;
• Additional fee for chairing the Audit Committee £10,000;
• Additional fee for chairing the Remuneration Committee £8,000; and
• Additional fee for the role of Senior Independent Director £8,000.
 
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The members of the Committee are: GB Bullard (Chairman), LM Bell, SA James and JE Nicholas. MJ Lamb ceased to be a 
member when he became Chairman of the Board. The Committee invites the Group Human Resources Director to inform 
the Committee of pay awards throughout the Group when setting executive Director remuneration. The Chairman and 
Chief Executive are also invited to attend meetings except when their own remuneration is considered. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
New Bridge Street is remuneration advisor to the Committee and was appointed by the Committee in September 2013 
following a retendering process. New Bridge Street is a trading name of Aon plc and a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct. A subsidiary of Aon plc is also the scheme actuary for the Group’s USA pension plan. 
The Committee is satisfied that New Bridge Street is sufficiently independent to act as remuneration adviser to the 
Committee.
In 2015, the Company paid £54,926 (2014: £52,068) to New Bridge Street for services to the Committee. 
Statement of voting at general meeting
At the 2015 AGM of the Company, the percentages of votes cast ‘for’, ‘against’ and ‘withheld’ in respect of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report were as follows:

To approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report 99.6 0.40% 0%
‘Against’ votes cast at the AGM were a very small proportion of the overall votes and accordingly the Directors did not 
deem it necessary to take any remedial action regarding these votes.

on 31 March 2015 and 24 April 2015, respectively.
Directors’ indemnification and insurance
The Company’s articles of association provide for the 
Directors and officers of the Company to be appropriately 
indemnified, subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. The Company purchases and maintains 
insurance for the Directors and officers of the Company  
in performing their duties, as permitted by section 233 
Companies Act 2006.
Powers of the Directors
As set out in the Company’s articles of association, the 
business of the Company is managed by the Board who 
may exercise all the powers of the Company.
Appointment and removal of Directors
The Board may appoint a Director, either to fill a vacancy 
or as an additional Director. Any Director appointed by  
the Board must retire at the next AGM of the Company 
and put themselves forward for reappointment by the 
shareholders. In accordance with the recommendations of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (Code), each member 
of the Board submits themselves for re-election on an 
annual basis.
In addition to any power of removal conferred by the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution remove any Director before the expiration of  
their period of office and may, subject to the articles of 
association, by ordinary resolution appoint another person 
who is willing to act as a Director in their place.
Political donations
No political donations were made during the year. The 
Group has a policy of not making political donations in  
any part of the world.
Dividend
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 3.1p per 
ordinary share (2014: 3.09p) for the year, payable on  
16 May 2016 to shareholders on the register on 8 April 2016. 
An interim dividend for 2015 of 1.95p per ordinary share 
(2014: 1.92p) was paid on 25 September 2015.
Dividend information has been restated to reflect the 
subdivision of the Company’s ordinary share capital 
referred to below.
Information required in the Report of the Directors 
set out in the Strategic Report
Information relating to likely future developments of the 
Company and its subsidiaries and information relating to 
the R&D activities of the Company and its subsidiaries is  
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 59.
Use of financial instruments
An explanation of the Group policies on the use of financial 
instruments and financial risk management objectives are 
contained in note 26 to the accounts.
Post-balance sheet events
There have been no important post-balance sheet events.
Existence of branches outside the UK
The Company has no branches outside of the UK.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital including the rights 
and obligations attached to each class of shares and the 
ordinary shares issued during 2015 are summarised in note 
17 of the financial statements. On 18 May 2015, each of the 
Company’s ordinary shares of 5p were subdivided into 10 
ordinary shares of 0.5p each. 0.5p ordinary shares 
represent over 99.9% of the Company’s total share capital 
and £1 9.5% cumulative preference shares represent less 
than 0.1% of the Company’s total share capital.
There are no securities of the Company carrying special 
rights with regard to the control of the Company.
At the Company’s last AGM held on 24 April 2015, the 
shareholders authorised the Company to make market 
purchases of ordinary shares limited to just under 
approximately 10% of its issued ordinary share capital  
at that time and of certain issued preference shares,  
and to allot shares within certain limits approved by the 
shareholders. These authorities expire at the 2016 AGM  
and appropriate renewals will be sought.
The Company did not acquire any of its own shares in 2015.
The Company’s articles of association contain customary 
restrictions on the transfer of shares as applicable only in 
certain limited circumstances (e.g. in relation to transfers to 
a minor). Save for those provisions, there are no restrictions 
on the transfer of ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company other than certain restrictions which may be 
required from time to time by law, for example, insider 
trading law. In accordance with the Model Code, which 
forms part of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority 
(as adopted by the Company), Directors and certain 
employees are required to seek the prior approval of the 
Company to deal in its shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities and/or voting rights. The Company’s articles  
of association contain limited restrictions on the exercise of 
voting rights (e.g. in relation to disenfranchised shares 
following the issue of a notice to shareholders under section 
793 Companies Act 2006).
The Company’s share schemes each contain provisions 
providing voting rights to the scheme trustee.
Amendments to the Company’s articles of association
The Company’s articles of association may only be 
amended by special resolution at a general meeting  
of the shareholders. 90

Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
report of the Directors confirm that, so far as they are each 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s Auditors are unaware; and each Director has 
taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is 
aware of that information.
‘Going concern’ basis of preparation
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. In forming this 
view, the Directors have considered trading and cash flow 
forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book 
with customers spread across different geographic areas 
and industries and the significant net cash position.
Statement of Directors’ responsibility for preparing the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, 
the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also 
chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements 
under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and
• Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
1. The financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
2. The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
3. The Annual Report and financial statements, taken  
as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.

Opinion on financial 
statements of Rotork plc
In our opinion: 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of the Group’s and the parent 
company’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
and the related notes 1 to 30. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) including 
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the 
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 to the 
financial statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the Strategic Report on page 47. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 91 that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 44 to 47 that describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements;
• the director’s explanation on page 47 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did 
not identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have 
not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards. Governance Directors Company Information

Our assessment of risks 
of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest 
effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team:
The risks identified are the same risks as identified in the prior year:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Impairment of the carrying value of goodwill 
The gross carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2015 
was £222.1m. Details of its valuation are included by 
management in the ‘critical accounting estimates and 
judgements’ section on page 106 and note 10 to 
the accounts. 
Management perform an impairment review under IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’ on an annual basis and whenever 
an indication of impairment exists.   
Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets is a significant risk due to the quantum 
of the balance and the number of judgements involved in 
assessing impairment, in particular in relation to the 
revenue and profit growth assumptions and the discount 
rates used for each cash generating unit (‘CGU’). 
During the period management combined a number of 
the CGUs with the Instruments division to form the 
Instruments sub group. This new CGU consists of the 
Fairchild, Soldo, YTC and Midland acquisitions. Following 
changes in the businesses post acquisition, and cross 
selling of products within the division it is no longer 
possible to identify independent cash flows attributable 
to each of them. 
We challenged the reasonableness of the assumptions used 
in the forecast cashflow model with reference to the budgets 
approved by the Board. 
We performed a specific review and challenge, involving 
internal valuations specialists, of the discount rates applied 
for each CGU against the Group weighted average cost of 
capital and third party data relating to premiums applied to 
take account of cash flows arising in overseas locations.
We recalculated management’s sensitivity analysis on key 
assumptions and replaced key assumptions with alternative 
scenarios e.g. further changes in discount and 
growth rates.
We evaluated the change in identified CGUs against how 
goodwill is monitored within the business and the extent to 
which sale of products are made between the businesses. 
We also reviewed management’s assessment that there was 
no impairment of the individual CGU’s prior 
to the aggregation.
We have reviewed the disclosures made in the financial 
statements and assessed compliance with IAS 36.  
Valuation of acquired intangibles
During the year, the Group has acquired six businesses, 
Bifold, Eltav, M&M, OMAS Teknik, Roto Hammer and SMS 
for total consideration of £147.6m. £66.7m of intangible 
assets have been identified in relation to the acquisitions 
in the year. Details of their valuation are included by 
management in the ‘critical accounting estimates and 
judgements’ section on page 106 and note 3 to 
the accounts. 
The Bifold acquisition is individually significant with 
separately identifiable intangible assets valued at £53.6m.
The valuation of intangible assets represents a key 
judgement area based on a number of inputs in the 
discounted cash flow and royalty relief valuations, which 
include the discount rates, growth rates and royalty rates. 
Identified intangibles include brands, customer 
relationships, order book, intellectual property and 
product patent design. 
Our audit of the acquired intangible assets focused on 
management’s valuation model. We challenged the key 
assumptions including discount rates, growth rates and 
royalty rates. We used our internal valuation specialists to 
support our assessment of the discount rates.  
We challenged the reasonableness of underlying forecast 
cash flows through discussions with management, results of 
the business pre and post-acquisition and review of any 
related financial due diligence reports. 94
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Valuation of inventory
The Group had inventory of £87.2m at 31 December 2015, 
held in numerous global locations across several product 
lines. Details of its valuation are included by management 
in the ‘critical accounting estimates and judgements’ 
section on page 106 and note 14 to the accounts. 
There is a risk of obsolescence of stock in niche markets 
and industries where customer demand fluctuates over 
periods. Both raw materials and finished goods require 
assessment for provisions based on past and predicted 
future product usage. The calculation of the provisions 
requires application of judgement by management. 
There is a risk that local systems can present inconsistent 
data and/or management override occurs. 
Our audit work assessed the design and implementation  
of controls in relation to the valuation of inventory with  
a specific focus on the key judgements related to 
inventory provisions. 
At our in-scope components we compared the  
methodology applied in calculating the provision to the 
Group’s policy. We investigated manual overrides to the 
application of the policy and obtained evidence to support 
any significant adjustments. 
Our work on provisions included agreeing the provision 
calculations to historical inventory usage and ageing data.  
We recalculated provisions based on this data. 
Defined benefit pension liability valuation
The Group has a defined benefit pension net liability of 
£23.3m (gross liabilities of £180.4m) at 31 December 
2015. Details of the valuation of the liability is included by 
management in the ‘critical accounting estimates and 
judgements’ section on page 106 and note 24 to 
the accounts. 
There is a risk relating to judgements made by 
management in valuing the defined benefit pension plans 
as small changes in the key model input assumptions such 
as the discount rate, mortality assumption and inflation 
rate, can have a signficant effect on the valuation 
of the liability.
We challenged the key assumptions supporting 
management’s valuation of the pension liability. We used our 
internal actuarial experts to compare the discount, inflation 
and life expectancy rates against externally derived data and 
determined whether the key assumptions are reasonable. 
We challenged management to understand the sensitivity of 
changes in assumptions and quantify a range of reasonable 
rates that could be used in their calculation. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in respect of the sensitivity of the deficit to changes in these 
key assumptions. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues 
considered by the Audit Committee discussed on pages 70 and 71.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
Our application of 
materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would 
be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £5.3m (2014: £6.9m), which is 5% of pre-tax 
profit. The decrease in materiality is a result of the reduction in profit before tax compared 
to the prior year.
 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit 
differences in excess of £106,000 (2014: £138,000), as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.

An overview of the scope 
of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at a group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at 32 components. 24 components were subject to a full scope 
audit and audit procedures were performed on key account balances at the other eight 
locations where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations.
The 32 locations represent the principal business units within the Group’s four reportable 
segments across 16 countries and account for 85% of the Group’s revenues, 95% of profit 
before tax. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at these 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which 
were lower than Group materiality ranging from £1.9m to £2.9m.
Due to the significance to the group audit of the 24 components’ operations subject to full 
scope audits, a programme has been designed and implemented for senior members of the 
group audit team to visit the key components where the group audit scope was focused at 
least once every three years. As part of the 2015 audit, senior members of the group audit 
team visited key components in the United Kingdom, Italy, United States of America, China, 
Korea, Dubai and Australia.  
For each of the businesses included within the programme of planned visits, the group audit 
team also discusses audit findings with the relevant component audit team throughout the 
audit engagement and reviews relevant audit working papers. For the remaining locations 
where full audits were completed, we discuss audit findings with the relevant component 
audit team, review audit working papers in relation to key issues and discuss key matters 
with divisional management where considered necessary in forming our group audit 
opinion. In relation to the locations which were subject to an audit of key account balances, 
we discuss the results of these businesses and accounting matters arising through our 
involvement in close meetings with management. 
 
At the parent entity level, we also tested the consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining 34 
components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. None of these 
components represented more than 2% of revenue, profit before taxation or total group 
net assets individually. 96

Opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors’ for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are 
required to report by 
exception
Adequacy of explanations 
received and accounting 
records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance 
Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other 
information in the Annual 
Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee 
which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

Respective 
responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and 
Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures 
are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent  
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
Except where indicated, values in these notes are in £000.
Rotork plc is a company domiciled in England. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 
31 December 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The accounting policies 
contained below in note 1 and the disclosures in notes 2 to 30 all relate to the Group financial statements. The Company 
balance sheet, Accounting policies and applicable notes can be found following note 30. 
1. Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Rotork plc have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC 
Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items 
referred to in the derivative financial instruments accounting policy below.
New accounting standards and interpretations
The following narrow scope amendments which were issued as part of the IFRS Annual improvement cycles have been 
applied from 1 January 2015:
• Amendment to IAS19 Defined benefit plans – Employee contributions
• IFRS2 Share-based payment – Definition of vesting condition
• IFRS3 Business combination – Accounting for contingent consideration
• IFRS8 Operating segments – Aggregation of operating segments and Reconciliation of the total of reportable assets
• IFRS13 Fair value measurement – Short-term receivable and payables
• IAS24 Related party disclosure – Key management personnel services
Application of these standards and amendments has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts 
recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Recent accounting developments 
IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers has been issued but is not yet effective and has not been adopted as 
application was not mandatory for the year. The new standard requires the separation of performance obligations within 
contracts with customers and the contractual value to be allocated to the performance obligations. Once a performance 
obligation is satisfied revenue should be recognised on that element of the contract. The introduction of the standard is 
likely to have some impact on Rotork but this is unlikely to be material due to the relatively straightforward contractual 
terms and conditions with customers. An assessment will be carried out to understand the impact of this standard prior to 
it becoming effective in January 2018.
IFRS9 Financial Instruments has been issued but is not yet effective and has not been adopted as application was not 
mandatory for the year. The directors anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the 
disclosures, net assets or results of the Group.
IFRS16 Leases was issued on 13 January 2016 and has a mandatory effective date of 1 January 2019. The new standard will 
eliminate the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases and result in operating leases being treated as 
finance leases. This will result in previously recognised operating leases being treated as property, plant and equipment 
and a finance lease creditor. The introduction of the standard will increase the value of property, plant and equipment and 
the finance lease liability on the balance sheet but it is unlikely to have a material impact on the profit in any year. An 
assessment will be carried out to understand the full impact of the standard prior to it becoming effective in January 2019. 
The narrow scope amendments in the Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 cycle which are mandatory for periods 
commencing after 1 January 2016 will not have a material impact on the disclosures, net assets or results of the Group.
Going concern
After carrying out a detailed review of the viability of the business, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In forming this view, the directors have 
considered trading and cash flow forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book with customers spread 
across different geographic areas and industries and the net cash position. Governance Directors Company Information

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Financial Statements Strategic Report
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year 
to 31 December 2015. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from 
the date that control commences until the date control ceases. Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains or losses or 
income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions. Differences on 
exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the 
results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the translation reserve.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate 
component of equity. Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign 
entities are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services. Revenue is 
shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. The Group 
recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities.
Revenue from the sale of actuators, gearboxes and flow control products is recognised in the income statement when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the contracted 
shipping terms. 
Revenue from service work is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the 
transaction at the balance sheet date. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of 
the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement 
with the goods.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed are provisional for a 12 month period.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed 
as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is 
classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to 
the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and is allocated to cash-generating units (CGU). An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
value of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 104
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets 
i) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and 
understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Development costs incurred after the 
point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the 
development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost 
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of five 
years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions 
with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles 
acquired. The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired are as follows: 
Brands and trademarks  4 to 10 years 
Customer relationships  2 to 7 years
Product design patents   4 to 8 years
Order backlog   3 months to 1 year
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. 
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is not depreciated. Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the 
building where less than 50 years. Other assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated 
useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings  2% to 4%
Short leasehold buildings  period of lease
Plant and equipment  10% to 33%
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Leases
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are 
treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under 
finance leases. Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, 
which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations. 
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the 
operating profit.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are 
measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Taxation
Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax 
is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.  
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised. Governance Directors Company Information

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Financial Statements Strategic Report
Inventory and work in progress
Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In respect of work in progress and 
finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses 
which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value in respect of old 
and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term (with an original maturity less than three months) 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
consolidated statement of cash flows.
Equity
Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a 
change in equity. Repurchased shares are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Provisions
i) Warranties
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on 
historical warranty cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
ii) Contingent consideration
The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash at a 
future date, depends on uncertain future events. The amounts recognised in the financial statements represent a fair value 
estimate at the balance sheet date of the amounts expected to be paid. 
Employee benefits
i) Pension plans
Where the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, contributions are made in accordance with qualified 
actuaries’ recommendations. In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s obligation in 
respect of the plans, these are recognised in equity. Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within 
financing expenses.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes. The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred.
ii) Share-based payment transactions
The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork plc 
at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant. Details of the scheme are given in note 25. The 
fair value of the right/option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value 
is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity. The right/option reaches maturity when 
the employee becomes unconditionally entitled. The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not 
achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers. These awards 
may vest after a period of three years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met. 
Details of the grants are given in note 25. The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo 
simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.  
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share 
settled award. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of non-
market performance conditions not being met.
The Overseas Profit Linked Share Plan (OPLSS) and the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) are discretionary profit linked shares 
schemes based on the prior year profit of the participating Rotork companies. The value of the award to each employee  
is based on salary and the length of service, the value of the awards can be up to £3,600. Shares awarded under these 
schemes are issued by the trustee at the cost of purchase. The costs of providing these plans are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement over the period to which the employee has earned the award. 
iii) Long term service leave
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv) Other employee benefits
The Group offers a number of discretionary bonus schemes to employees around the world. The costs of these schemes 
are recognised in the income statement as incurred.  106
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1. Accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from 
operational and financing activities. These are the only derivative financial instruments used by the Group. In accordance 
with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue contracts for trading purposes. Forward exchange contracts that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at fair value. Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a 
hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted 
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity. Any effective 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged 
transaction. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the 
transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss 
held in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
Dividends
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid. Final dividends are recorded in the financial 
statements in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom 
equal the actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
i) Impairment of intangible assets
Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortised over their useful lives which are based on management’s estimates of 
the period over which the assets will generate revenue. The useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure they continue to 
be appropriate. Changes to the estimates used can result in significant variations in the carrying value. 
The Group assesses the impairment of intangible assets subject to amortisation whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill arising on acquisitions and 
indefinite lived assets are subject to impairment review. The Group undertakes an impairment review annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review of intangible assets include the following:
• Significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
• Significant changes in the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; or
• Significant negative industry or economic trends.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rate and growth rates. Explanations of the estimates, 
judgements and sensitivities in respect of the current year impairment review are detailed in note 10. 
ii) Valuation of acquired intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in the recognition of customer relationships, brands and trademarks, product design patents and 
order backlogs. These are valued using discounted cash flow models or a relief from royalty method. In applying these 
methodologies certain key judgements and assumptions are made over discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates and tax 
rates where a group of companies is acquired. Further details of the accounting policies are shown earlier in this note and 
the valuation of the acquired intangible assets are shown in note 11.
iii) Valuation of inventory 
The Group inventory is spread across all of the Group’s global locations. The provisions made to write down slow-moving 
and obsolete inventory are based on an assessment of market developments and on an analysis of historic and projected 
usage. The calculation of the provisions requires application of judgement by management. 
iv) Retirement benefits
The Group’s financial statements include costs in relation to, and provisions for, retirement benefit obligations. The costs and 
the present value of any pension value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy 
of the members, salary increases, inflation, the returns that the plan assets will generate and the discount rate to calculate the 
present value of the liabilities. The Group uses previous experience and impartial actuarial advice to calculate the present 
value of the liabilities. The estimates and the effects of variances in the key estimates are shown in note 24. Governance Directors Company Information

2. Operating segments
The Group has chosen to organise the management and financial structure by the grouping of related products. The four 
identifiable operating segments where the financial and operating performance is reviewed monthly by the chief operating 
decision maker are as follows: 
• Controls – the design, manufacture and sale of electric actuators.
• Fluid Systems – the design, manufacture and sale of pneumatic and hydraulic actuators.
• Gears – the design, manufacture and sale of gearboxes, adaption and ancillaries for the valve industry.
• Instruments – the manufacture of high precision pneumatic controls and power transmission products for a wide 
range of industries.
Unallocated expenses comprise corporate expenses.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with  
third parties.
Geographic analysis
Rotork has a worldwide presence in all four operating segments through its subsidiary selling offices and through an 
agency network. A full list of locations can be found at www.rotork.com.

A tax expense of £799,000 (2014: £274,000) in respect of share-based payments has been recognised directly in equity in 
the year. 
The reduction in the effective tax rate from 26.9% to 26.5% is primarily due the impact of the reduction of the UK rate of 
corporation tax substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation 
tax to be higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the USA, China, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries. 
Rotork plc controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.  
The value of temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax has not 
been recognised is £307,714,000 (2014: £292,704,000). 114

Cash generating units
Goodwill acquired through business combinations have been allocated to the lowest level of cash generating unit (CGU) 
and to the division in which it is reported. Where the acquired entity’s growth into new markets is through the Group’s 
existing sales network and/or where manufacturing of certain products is transferred to other businesses within a division 
the lowest level of CGU is considered to be at a divisional sub-group level. During the year Fairchild, Soldo, YTC and 
Midland were combined to form an Instruments sub-group.

Impairment testing
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. 
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs. These 
calculations use cash flow projections from management forecasts which are based on the budget and the three year plan. 
The three year plan is a bottom up process which takes place as part of the annual budget process. Once the budget for 
the next financial year is finalised, years 2 and 3 of the three year plan are prepared by each reporting entity’s management 
reflecting their view of the local market, known projects and experience of past performance. The annual budget and the 
three year plan are reviewed and approved by the Board each year.
The key assumptions in the annual impairment review which are common to all CGUs are set out below:
i) Long term growth rates
In the period after the three year plan growth rates are forecast at 5% per annum for the first two years and 2% thereafter 
for each CGU. The 5% rate reflects a realistic market forecast for the flow control market up until 2020. The continued need 
for our customers to improve their infrastructure by automating valves gives confidence that the growth rate of our market 
will exceed the long term growth rate of 2% used in the impairment calculations.
ii) Discount rates
The discount rates presented above are pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each of the CGUs. 
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.  Governance Directors Company Information

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable change in assumptions. 
Using the key assumptions above and applying sensitivities to these assumptions below, Bifold and the Instruments 
sub-group would be the first CGUs to trigger a potential impairment. Apart from these there is no reasonable change  
that would cause the carrying amount of any other CGU goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
The Instruments sub-group downside sensitivities have been assessed. A decrease in the growth rate by 7% in each of  
the next five years or an increase in the discount rate by 3% to 15.5% would result in the headroom being reduced from 
£44,500,000 in the base case to zero. It is anticipated that as the acquired businesses continue to leverage the sales 
network opportunities from being part of the Rotork Group the long term growth rate of the CGU should comfortably 
exceed the growth rates assumed in the impairment review.
Bifold downside sensitivities have also been assessed. A growth rate of 2% per annum from year three of the three year 
plan would result in a reduction of the headroom from £39,200,000 in the base case to zero. It is anticipated that as Bifold 
continues to develop its sales of recently launched products, brings more products to market over the next couple of years 
and at the same time develops the sales network opportunities from being part of the Group, the growth rates will exceed 
the long term growth rate of 2% used in the impairment review.

the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading, that the level of profits in the current and future years make it more 
likely than not that these assets will be recovered. 
A deferred tax asset of £1,302,000 (2014: £1,519,000) has not been recognised in relation to capital losses. This asset may 
be recovered if sufficient capital profits are made in future in the companies concerned. There is no expiry date in relation

own ordinary shares held) adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The Company has two 
categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees under the Sharesave plan 
where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and

24. Pension schemes
i) Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates two defined benefit pension arrangements the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (UK 
Scheme) and the Rotork Controls Inc. Pension Plan (US Pension plan). On retirement, leaving service or death the Schemes 
provide benefits based on final salary and length of service.
The UK Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004. A valuation of the Scheme is 
carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met. As part of the 
process the Company must agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall 
against the Statutory Funding Objective and contributions to pay for future accrual of benefits.
The UK Scheme is managed by a Trustee, with directors appointed in part by the Group and part from elections by members 
of the Scheme. The Trustee has responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and 
investing the Scheme’s assets. The Trustee delegates some of these functions to its professional advisers where appropriate.
The US Pension Plan is subject to the ERISA funding requirements. A valuation of the Plan is carried out annually to ensure 
the Funding Objective is met under ERISA by contributing at least the Minimum Required Contribution. As part of this 
process the Company must contribute to the Plan enough contributions to ensure at least the Minimum Contribution is 
deposited in the Trust to pay for the accrual of benefits.
The two defined benefit pension arrangements expose the Group to a number of risks:
• Investment risk. The Schemes hold investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and 
while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term the short-term volatility can cause additional 
funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
• Interest rate risk. The Schemes’ liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount 
the liabilities. As the Schemes hold assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the 
same way.
• Inflation risk. A significant proportion of the benefits under the Schemes are linked to inflation. Although the Schemes’ 
assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short-term could 
lead to deficits emerging.
• Mortality risk. In the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.
There were no plan amendments, curtailments or settlements during the period.

For the life expectancy sensitivity we have increased/decreased the mortality rates by a factor of 10%. Broadly speaking 
this decreases/increases the assumed life expectancy by slightly less than one year.
The sensitivity analysis shown above was determined using the same method as per the calculation of liabilities for the 
balance sheet disclosures, but using assumptions adjusted as detailed above. 
Effect of the Schemes on the Group’s future cashflows
The Group is required to agree a Schedule of Contributions with the Trustees of the UK Scheme following a valuation  
which must be carried out at least once every three years. The next valuation of the Scheme will have an effective date of 
31 March 2016. In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than expected the Group may be required to increase 
contributions above those set out in the existing Schedule of Contributions. Conversely, if the position is better than 
expected, contributions may be reduced.
The Group estimates that cash contributions to the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes during 2016 will be 
£3,029,000 for regular payments (2015: £2,900,000) and £5,500,000 of additional payments in relation to past service 
(2015: £5,500,000).
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 21 years.
ii) Other pension plans
The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for 
employees upon retirement. Total expense relating to these plans in the year was £3,703,000 (2014: £3,506,000).  Governance Directors Company Information

Volatility assumptions for equity-based payments
The expected volatility of all equity compensation benefits is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the 
weighted average remaining life of each benefit), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly 
available information.
a) Sharesave plan
UK employees are invited to join the Sharesave plan when an offer is made each year. All the offers to date were made at a 
20% discount to market price at the time. There are no performance criteria for the Sharesave plan. Employees are given 
the option of joining either the 3 year or the 5 year scheme.

2010 LTIP
Following shareholder approval of the 2010 LTIP at the Company’s AGM on 23 April 2010, awards of shares have been 
made annually to executive and senior managers. Half of these awards vest under a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance condition and half under an earnings per share (EPS) performance condition.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement. The actual number 
of shares transferred will be determined by the number of shares initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.  
The actual number of shares transferred will be 25% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
The EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is RPI + 10% over the vesting 
period up to a maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI +25%.
The performance period for the 2012 awards which ended on 31 December 2014. The TSR element of the award did not 
vest as the Company was in the 40th percentile relative to the comparator group. The EPS growth was 28.0% over the 
performance period which exceeded RPI by 20.4%.Messrs. PwC LLP as independent actuaries certified to the 
Remuneration Committee that there was a 37.0% vesting of this award. These awards vested in 2015.
The performance period for the 2013 awards ended on 31 December 2015. The TSR element of the award did not vest as 
the Company was in the 13th percentile relative to the comparator group. The EPS element also did not vest as the growth 
in EPS did not exceed RPI + 10% over the vesting period.

26. Financial instruments
Financial risk and treasury policies
The Treasury department maintains liquidity, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk, manages relations with the 
Group’s bankers and provides a treasury service to the Group’s businesses. Treasury dealings such as investments, 
borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The Group 
Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for 
which there is no underlying exposure. Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched 
where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash on deposit with 
financial institutions. 
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced 
through the use of credit insurance covering 80% to 95% of trade receivables at any time. Credit evaluations are carried out 
on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set around this depending on the 
value of the sale. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non–payment the Group may have a 
secured claim.
The Group maintains an allowance for impairment in respect of non–insured receivables where recoverability is 
considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material 
cash balance. As well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing and 
liquidity of funds.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 
the reporting date was:

Foreign exchange contracts 25 1,913
  183,253 191,763

  124,285 (5,484) 130,819 (2,347)
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage 
to the Group’s reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise 
its return on investments. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational 
expenses; it also maintains a £7m overdraft facility (2014: £7m) on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 1.5%.
During 2015, the Group refinanced its loan facilities. It extended its £20,000,000 committed 364 day facility to August 
2016 at LIBOR plus 0.35%, and it entered into a £90,000,000 term facility which matures in August 2018 at LIBOR plus 
0.8%, and a £60,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility which matures in August 2020 at LIBOR plus 0.85%. At year end 
£119,000,000 of the committed facilities were drawn, resulting in £51,000,000 being available.

c) Market risk
Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, and may affect the Group’s 
results. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the 
business unit’s functional currency. The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies 
and the euro. The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward 
exchange contracts. In respect of other non–sterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures may also be hedged up 
to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Group’s cash management some of the overseas subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their 
intra–group counterparty is in the UK. The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary so the UK holds a 
foreign currency current asset or liability which is usually hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps. At the 
balance sheet date only the ‘forward’ part of the swap remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the 
currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts (that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the 
intercompany loan and deposit balances) as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The net fair value of foreign 
exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2015 was a £4,007,000 liability (2014: £794,000 asset) comprising an 
asset of £25,000 (2014: £1,913,000) and a liability of £4,032,000 (2014: £1,119,000). Forward exchange contracts in place 
at 31 December 2015 mature in 2016 and 2017.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement. 
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal (in particular other exchange rates), a general change of one cent  
in the value of euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Group’s operating profit for the year ended  
31 December 2015 of £235,000 (2014: £325,000) and a change of one cent in the value of US dollar against sterling would 
have had an impact of the Group’s operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 of £400,000 (2014: £550,000). 
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and 
euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year:
 
 
Average rate Closing rate
2015 2014 2015 2014
US dollar 1.53 1.65 1.47 1.55
Euro 1.38 1.24 1.36 1.28 132

ii) Interest rate risk
The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area. All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and 
the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three 
months. The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling, US dollar, euro and renminbi deposits, all of which are on a 
floating rate basis.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows:
  2015 2014
Fixed rate financial liabilities 604 512
Floating rate financial liabilities 119,504 21,065
  120,108 21,577
The fixed and floating rate financial liabilities comprise finance leases, preference shares and bank loans. The floating rate 
lease obligations bear interest at rates determined by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 1.98% or 1.99% excluding the zero rate debt (2014: 
1.7% or 1.9%). The weighted average period for which (non zero) interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed 
is 1.6 years.
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows:
  2015 2014
In one year or less 50,352 20,274
In more than one year but not more than two years 30,084 237
In more than two years but not more than five years 38,975 267
In more than five years 697 799
Total 120,108 21,577
d) Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure it maintains sufficient capital in order to support its 
business and maximise shareholder value. The Group has an asset-light business model and uses cash generated from 
operations to either invest organically or by acquisition. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to 
it in light of changes in economic and market conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares. 
The Group defines capital as net funds and equity attributable to shareholders (see note 17). There are no externally 
imposed restrictions on the Group’s capital structure.

Fair value hierarchy
The fair value of the Group’s outstanding derivative financial assets and liabilities consisted of foreign exchange contracts 
and swaps and were estimated using year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the appropriate value dates, 
and gains and losses are taken to equity estimated using market foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date. All 
derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
The other financial instruments are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are valued as follows:
i) Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to 
reflect the fair value.
ii) Contingent consideration
As all the contingent consideration is contractually due for payment within 14 months (2014: 12 months), the carrying 
amount is equal to the fair value. 134

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Financial Statements Strategic Report
a) Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in 
relation to the financial statements. Notes a to k relate to the Company rather than the Group.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except that investment property is 
stated at fair value. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). The amendments to FRS 101 (2013/14 Cycle) issued in July 2014 and the amendments 
issued in July 2015 (2014/15 Cycle and minor amendments) have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements 
of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs), but makes amendments where 
necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 
disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In the transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied IFRS1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in 
compliance with FRS 101. An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101 has affected the reported financial position and 
financial performance of the Company is provided in note k.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following 
disclosures:
• A Cash Flow Statement and related notes
• Comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets 
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
• Disclosures in respect of capital management
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs
• An additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following transition (see note k) 
• Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel. 
The Company produces consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards. As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the 
Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• IFRS2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments
• The disclosures required by IFRS7 and IFRS13 regarding financial instrument disclosures have not been provided.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect,  
the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the 
Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. The Company accounts for intra group cross 
guarantees under IAS37.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and 
loss account. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date 
and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments are measured at cost less any provision for impairment and comprise investments in subsidiary companies.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Plant and machinery is depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual 
values at annual rates of between 10% and 33%. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date.
Investment property
Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
a) Accounting policies continued
Post-retirement benefits
The Company participates in a UK Group pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets 
of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company. The sponsoring employer for the UK Group pension scheme 
is Rotork Controls Ltd. No contractual agreement or policy is in place for charging to individual group entities the net 
defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole. As a result, in accordance with IAS19, the amount charged to the profit and 
loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Classification of preference shares
In line with the requirements of IAS32, Financial Instruments, the cumulative redeemable preference shares issued by the 
Company are classified as long term debt. The preference dividends are charged within interest payable.
Share-based payments
The Company’s has adopted IFRS2 and its policy in respect of share-based payment transactions is consistent with the 
Group policy shown in note 1 to the Group financial statements. Costs in relation to share-based awards made to other 
Group company employees are recharged to each subsidiary company.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: 
the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable 
profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they 
will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid. Final dividends are recorded in the financial 
statements in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
b) Personnel expenses in the Company profit and loss account

pages 74 to 88.
Share-based payments

i) Contingencies in the Company
The UK banking arrangements are subject to cross-guarantees between the Company and its UK subsidiaries. These

normal course of business. A liability would only arise in the event of the Group failing to fulfil its contractual obligations.
During 2015, the Company refinanced its loan facilities. It extended its £20,000,000 committed 364 day facility to  
August 2016 at LIBOR plus 0.35%, and it took out a £90,000,000 term facility which matures in August 2018 at LIBOR plus 
0.8%, and a £60,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility which matures in August 2020 at LIBOR plus 0.85%. These facilities are 
available to the Company, Rotork Controls Limited and Rotork Overseas Limited. At year end £119,000,000 of the 
committed facilities were drawn, resulting in £51,000,000 being available.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
k) Explanation of transition to FRS 101 continued
Notes to the reconciliation from UK GAAP to FRS 101
a) The Company holds an investment property leased to another Group company. Under UK GAAP, this was recognised as 
a fixed asset. IAS40 permits property which is leased to other group companies to be recognised as investment property 
and therefore it has been reclassified.
b) Deferred tax assets have been recalculated based on the approach required by IAS12. The adjustments made to the 
deferred tax asset are as follows:
 
1 January 
2014 Movement
31 December 
2014
UK GAAP previously reported net deferred tax balance 272 (1) 271
Revised deferred tax on plant and equipment (4) 4 –
Revised deferred tax on share-based payments 66 (98) (32)
FRS 101 net deferred tax balance 334 (95) 239
The £32,000 restatement in respect of the December 2014 balance is as result of a £62,000 credit to retained earnings at 
1 January 2014, a £97,000 credit to the income statement in 2014 and a £191,000 debit to retained earnings in 2014. 
ii) Reconciliation of profit for the year ended 31 December 2014
  £000
Amount under UK GAAP 38,528
Deferred taxation adjustments 97
Amount under FRS 101 38,625
Adjustment arising due to changes in the income tax expense resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities (see note b to the reconciliation of equity above). Governance Directors Financial Statements

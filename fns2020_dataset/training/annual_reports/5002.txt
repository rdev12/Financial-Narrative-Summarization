Business Review
Chairman’s Statement
Peter Johnson
Chairman
The Group made substantial 
progress in 2007/08 and 
faces the challenges of the 
year ahead from a strong base.
Peter Johnson
Chairman
DS Smith produced a strong set of results in 2007/08, with
proﬁts almost 50% up on the prior year. Proﬁts in Packaging
grew strongly, beneﬁting from the actions taken to increase
efﬁciency and recover signiﬁcantly higher input costs through
improved pricing. The rebuilding of proﬁts in Ofﬁce Products
Wholesaling, Spicers, is progressing well. The Board
continues to give close attention to the Group’s strategic
development. The acquisitions of New Thames Paper Mill
and Multigraphics, together with the investment programme
in our Ukrainian associate, Rubezhansk, support our plans
for longer-term growth. 
The Group’s adjusted proﬁt before tax was 49% higher at
£111.0 million and adjusted earnings per share advanced by
51% to 19.9 pence. Free cash ﬂow, before dividends and
net acquisitions, was £79.0 million (2006/07: £84.0 million,
which beneﬁted from the net cash contribution of 
£29.6 million for the sale of the Taplow site).
Across our Packaging activity, we expanded our capability 
in the value-added sectors of retail-ready packaging and
heavy-duty packaging. We extended our position in
promotional packaging, through organic growth and the
acquisition of Multigraphics, a business specialising in
printed display material. We continued to expand our fast-
growing recycling operation, Severnside, through enhanced
services to retailers and other generators of waste materials.
Our plastic returnable transit packaging business beneﬁted
from the introduction of new products. We strengthened our
presence in Packaging in central and eastern Europe; our
business in Poland continued to grow well and we
established new businesses in Slovakia and Bulgaria. 
In February 2008, we announced an investment of 
£104 million to acquire and convert the adjacent paper 
mill to our successful Kemsley operation. This will enable us
to supply high-quality lightweight corrugated case material,
helping our customers meet the growing demand to reduce
the weight of packaging.
In Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling, Spicers increased both
revenues and proﬁts. In recent years, we have developed
strong and successful positions in a number of continental
markets, and these continued to advance strongly. 
In line with its commitment to develop the Company 
to support good returns for shareholders, the Board is
proposing an increased ﬁnal dividend of 6.2 pence which,
together with the interim dividend of 2.6 pence, gives a total
dividend for the year of 8.8 pence (2006/07: 8.6 pence).
On 1 April 2008, Steve Dryden joined the Board as Group
Finance Director. Steve held the position of Finance Director
of Filtrona plc following its demerger from Bunzl plc in 2005,
having previously held other senior ﬁnance positions within
Bunzl plc. With his ﬁnancial capability and operational
experience, Steve is already making a strong impact on the
Group. Gavin Morris, the previous Group Finance Director,
stepped down from the Board by mutual agreement on 
1 April 2008. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
Mr Morris for his contributions to the Company in recent
years and wish him future success.
On 29 January 2008, George Adams was appointed as 
a non-Executive Director. George, who was, until March
2008, Managing Director, European Development and 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, UK Trade at Kingﬁsher Plc, brings 
to the Board wide international experience in distribution
and consumer-focused businesses. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our
colleagues across the world for their efforts and commitment,
without which our success would not be possible. In the 
year ahead, the Group faces a more challenging trading
environment. Our businesses are prepared for this and I 
am conﬁdent that our good market positions give us a 
strong base from which to compete.  DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 5
Chief Executive’s Review
Our strategy has strengthened 
the Group and we achieved 
a signiﬁcant advance in proﬁts.
Tony Thorne
Group Chief Executive
In 2007/08, the Group achieved a 54% advance in
adjusted operating proﬁt to £119.6 million. 
A tighter supply position for corrugated case material
(CCM) and corrugated packaging during much of the
ﬁnancial year provided good support for our price increase
programme, aimed at recovering the higher input costs we
have been incurring for some time. We also beneﬁted from
the actions taken in both our activities, Packaging and
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling, to improve the business 
mix and raise cost-competitiveness. 
Towards the end of the ﬁnancial year, we announced 
a major investment project aimed at reinforcing our position
as a leader in lighter-weight packaging, by giving us a
signiﬁcant capability in the growth segment of high-quality
lightweight CCM.
The improvement in the Group’s adjusted return on 
average capital employed in 2007/08 of 12.9%
(2006/07: 8.7%) represents good progress towards
meeting our target to exceed the Group’s estimated 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.5% 
over the business cycle.
Strategy
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s composition 
and strategy to assess that these are best able to generate
value for shareholders. We are conﬁdent that the strategy
we are pursuing will provide good opportunities for 
organic development of the Group. In instances where 
it will enable us to fulﬁl our strategic development plans 
we will acquire businesses. We remain prepared to exit
businesses which are not likely to meet our strategic
objectives in the longer-term.
The strategy has strengthened the Group, giving us a 
good base from which to compete. It is ensuring that we 
are developing strong market positions in both Packaging
and Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling and raising operational
performance across our businesses. An aim of our strategy
is to dampen the volatility of the Group’s results through our
industry’s business cycle, particularly by ensuring that there
is sufﬁcient proﬁt growth in the less cyclical parts of our
Packaging operations to achieve long-term progress. 
In the coming ﬁnancial year we are prepared for tougher
trading conditions, reﬂecting difﬁculties in the world
economies, particularly those of the UK, the rest of western
Europe and the USA. We have established a number 
of strategic priorities with the objective of continuing 
to progress the implementation of the strategy whilst
maintaining cost discipline and a strong balance sheet.
In Packaging, we will provide market-leading service to 
our customers across the product range, but concentrate 
our pursuit of growth in targeted higher value-added sectors 
of the market. In Corrugated Packaging, these include 
retail-ready and promotional packaging, mainly for the 
fast-moving consumer goods market, and heavy-duty
packaging for industrial users, while in Plastic Packaging
we have a number of good growth opportunities for our
returnable transit packaging (RTP) business in both the
industrial and retail parts of the market. We will build on
our existing positions in the faster-growing markets of central
and eastern Europe and Russia. We are targeting to extend
our recycling capability to take advantage of the demand
for increased recycling associated with the environmental
pressures to reduce the quantity of waste going to landﬁll. 
In Paper, the priority is to reinforce our position in CCM, 
by successfully completing our project to supply high-quality
lightweight CCM at Kemsley Mill, but we will also develop
further our growing position in plasterboard liner. 
In Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling, we will maintain our 
focus on rebuilding proﬁts in the UK while developing 
the considerable potential of our existing businesses in
continental Europe. We will increase further our support 
for our dealer customers by developing our fulﬁlment
services, enhancing our e-commerce and promotional 
tools and exploiting our capability to supply those 
products that resellers choose to offer but do not stock.
A fuller description of our strategy is provided on page 8. 6 www.dssmith.uk.com
Packaging
2007/08 was a relatively good year across our Packaging
activity. Despite signiﬁcant cost pressure, we advanced in
all three segments. The improved results were built around
cost recovery through better pricing but this would not have
been possible without our close attention to providing good
customer care and high service levels. It was pleasing to 
see the growth coming through in the targeted higher 
value-added sectors of our businesses, a result of our
improved product and market development capability
supported by focused capital investment. 
In the year, we made a major acquisition to support 
the development of our capability in lightweight CCM at
Kemsley Mill, we strengthened our position in promotional
packaging through the acquisition of Multigraphics and we
extended our network of packaging converting operations
in eastern Europe through establishing new manufacturing
facilities. We also strongly supported our Ukrainian
associate in its substantial development programme.
UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging
In 2007/08, the UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging
segment, which accounts for 38% of Group revenue 
and 52% of Group average capital employed, achieved 
a £32.0 million improvement in adjusted operating proﬁt 
to £68.5 million and an adjusted return on average 
capital employed of 14.3%. All three elements of the 
supply chain in this segment – Severnside Recycling, 
St Regis Paper and DS Smith Packaging – contributed 
well to the improved result.
Our programme to raise prices enabled us largely to
recover the previously incurred higher input costs although
further increases in energy costs are maintaining the
pressure on margins.
Severnside Recycling, which supplies the waste paper raw
material for our own recycled paper mills, continued to
develop the services it provides to third parties to generate
additional revenue from its waste collection network and
recycling expertise. Our UK paper business continued to
focus on raising the operational performance of its mills 
and the development of plasterboard liner sales. In our 
UK corrugated packaging business, we beneﬁted further
from our capability to service the market competitively with
value-added products from our conventional box plant
network and our group of speciality corrugated businesses.
The investment and product development effort we have
targeted at the growing retail-ready and decorative
packaging sectors contributed strongly to our success. 
In February 2008, we announced our plan to produce 
high-quality lightweight CCM at Kemsley Mill through 
the acquisition and subsequent modiﬁcation of the adjacent
New Thames Paper Mill. The entire project is expected to
cost circa £104 million, funded from the Group’s existing
debt facilities. Work is already well advanced on the
modiﬁcation of the facilities and we plan to commence
production of lightweight CCM in January 2009. This
investment will materially strengthen the long-term
competitiveness of our UK Paper and Corrugated 
Packaging business by giving us, at a very advantageous
investment cost, a signiﬁcant capability in an important
growth segment of the CCM market. It demonstrates our
commitment to developing our UK business and reinforces
the Group’s position as a leader in meeting the growing
demand for high-quality lighter-weight corrugated
packaging. The project is expected to generate good
ﬁnancial returns in its ﬁrst full year of operation (2009/10)
and provide very good returns for shareholders in the
longer-term.
Having raised the level of ﬁnancial returns in UK Paper and
Corrugated Packaging to a more satisfactory level, we are
now focused on sustaining an improved level of returns from
this segment over the business cycle. As we start the ﬁnancial
year, the strength of the euro is assisting our competitiveness
and pricing but we are faced with some slowing in demand,
continued high waste paper costs, further rises in energy costs
and lower paper prices on the continent; although we expect
margins in our Paper business to be under pressure, we will
drive for further progress in our recycling and converted
packaging operations.
Continental European Corrugated Packaging 
Despite facing signiﬁcantly higher input costs, this segment
achieved improved results with operating proﬁt increasing
to £20.3 million (2006/07: £18.2 million). Our businesses
in the established markets of France and Italy performed
creditably, assisted by their attention to raising productivity
and their focus on higher value-added sectors of the market,
such as heavy-duty packaging. As indicated at the half-year,
results were poor in Turkey, where market conditions were
tough; we are implementing an extensive action plan to
rebuild proﬁts. By contrast, our developing Polish business
made further strong progress due to a combination of good
growth and an increased proportion of higher value-added
product in our sales mix. The high-quality operation that we
have developed in Poland provides us with a good hub
from which to develop in central and eastern Europe. We
already have satellite operations in three countries and 
will be seeking to extend our network of businesses in 
this region as well as developing further in Poland.
Results at our Ukrainian associate business were adversely
affected by a major ﬁre; its performance is now recovering.
Its investment programme, designed to raise capacity 
and extend its product range, is progressing; we have
established a good capability in the fast-growing market 
of plasterboard liner. 
In Continental European Corrugated Packaging we are
faced with higher energy costs and softer demand as we
start 2008/09. We will maintain our focus on the higher
value-added sectors of the market and the opportunities
presented by our developing markets. 
Plastic Packaging
Plastic Packaging achieved a solid advance in adjusted
operating proﬁt to £10.7 million (2006/07: £10.2 million).
Good progress in RTP and the division’s two smaller
businesses was partly offset by weaker results in liquid
packaging and dispensing.
In RTP, beverage crate sales were strong as a result of 
the fulﬁlment of several large contracts and the success of
new products. The extruded products businesses recovered
some of the higher costs of polymer and beneﬁted from 
our previous actions to strengthen the sales and product
development functions; we have good opportunities for
further sales development based on new products and our
growing presence in eastern Europe. In liquid packaging
and dispensing, proﬁt margins in both taps and bags were

affected by competitive pressures. The USA business
beneﬁted from the introduction of new products and the
development of new markets; this progress was more than
offset by weaker results in the European business due to
continuing competitive pressures. The programme for
implementing the restructuring of our German bag-in-box
operations has been agreed with our employees and is 
due to be completed by April 2009.
The smaller packaging management and modiﬁed
atmosphere packaging businesses both achieved 
good proﬁt improvement.
Polymer costs have recently risen again; a priority for the
coming year will be the mitigation of these higher input
costs. We expect developments in new products and 
new market sectors to assist us in this objective. 
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling
The signiﬁcant improvement in this segment’s results was 
in line with our three-year plan, initiated in 2006/07, to
rebuild proﬁts. Adjusted operating proﬁt increased by 
£7.3 million to £20.1 million due to advances in both 
the UK and continental Europe. 
In Spicers UK, our programme of actions resulted in
improved service levels as we moved through 2007/08,
reaching a good level as we exited the ﬁnancial year. 
The strong sales growth was all in electronic ofﬁce supplies
(EOS) products, which reﬂects a deliberate move to support
our dealers in these products. The proportion of EOS in our
sales mix now more closely reﬂects that of the market as a
whole and we will look to grow our sales of both EOS and
non-EOS product as we develop the business. Costs were
lowered in the distribution network through the closure of
the Park Royal distribution centre. Our e-commerce system
has been strengthened further and is providing a good
basis for competitive advantage. Our UK action programme
is being reinforced to ensure the achievement of our
targeted further progress in this important business.
In our continental European businesses, which account 
for circa 50% of Spicers’ total revenue, the established
French and Benelux businesses again performed well, 
while our businesses in Germany, Spain and Italy each
achieved signiﬁcant goals in their development plans. 
The growth of the Italian business, ahead of its plan, 
is particularly encouraging. 
Spicers has been well received when it has entered new
continental European markets. The size of its product range,
its purchasing power and its service offering enable dealers
to compete more effectively in the market, thus boosting
sales in the dealers’ distribution channel. The performance
of our continental European development businesses has
further reinforced our conﬁdence in the potential for the
Spicers business model across Europe.
Our objective for Spicers is to maintain progress on 
two fronts: continuing the rebuilding of proﬁts at Spicers 
UK and developing further our existing continental
European network.
Our People
The considerable advances in the Group’s operational
performance and our substantially improved results have
been achieved through the skills, ideas and hard work 
of our employees. When I visit any of our businesses I 
am hugely impressed by the extent of the commitment,
enthusiasm and creativity demonstrated by our people. 
I am grateful to them for their enormous contribution to 
the success of the Group.
Outlook 
The 2007/08 result provides a good proﬁt base. The
current ﬁnancial year’s operating performance will be
affected by slowing demand and higher input costs. We
expect to partly offset the effect of this tougher trading
environment through tight cost and cash discipline 
across all our operations and continued progress in our
strengthened Packaging converting and Ofﬁce Products
Wholesaling businesses. We remain on track to commission
our new lightweight paper machine in January 2009. As
expected, proﬁt before tax in 2008/09 will be impacted 
by a non-cash increase of circa £10 million in the ﬁnance
costs related to the employment beneﬁt ﬁnance charge.

Improving operational performance and
developing our strong market positions
Group Strategy
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s composition 
and strategy to assess that these are best able to generate 
value for shareholders. Within this context, our strategy 
is to improve the operational performance of our businesses
and to develop the Group’s strong market positions in our
two activities, Packaging and Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling.
Recognising that these two activities are quite different, we
have a separate strategy for each. 
In the pursuit of our strategy and in order to deliver long-
term earnings growth, we will invest in the operational
improvement and development of those parts of our
business in which we believe we have the potential to
maintain strong competitive advantage and to earn good
returns over the medium- to longer-term. We are conﬁdent
that there are good opportunities for organic development
of the Group. In instances where it will enable us to fulﬁl 
our strategic development plans we will acquire businesses.
We remain prepared to exit businesses which are not likely
to meet our strategic objectives in the longer-term.
Packaging Strategy
In Packaging, our objective is to develop our business
based on our expertise in corrugated and plastic packaging
and recycling activities.
In converted packaging, we aim to offer innovative 
and cost-competitive products, market-leading levels of
service and supply chain solutions across our product
range, placing particular emphasis on developing our
business in higher value-added sectors of the market. In
corrugated packaging, we will continue to concentrate 
on growing our business in retail-ready packaging and
promotional packaging mainly for the fast-moving consumer
goods market, and heavy-duty packaging for industrial
users, while in plastic packaging we will especially pursue
development opportunities in returnable transit packaging.
We intend to extend our recycling capability in terms of the
services we offer and the markets in which we operate. We
aim to reinforce our position in corrugated case material
(CCM) and plasterboard liner, while remaining a net buyer
of CCM. We will look to expand the involvement of our
Packaging business in the markets of central and eastern
Europe and Russia.
In Packaging, our ﬁnancial objective is to generate an
adjusted return on average capital employed over the
business cycle in excess of the Group’s pre-tax weighted
average cost of capital, which we estimate to be 11.5%. 
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling Strategy
In Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling, our goal is to establish the
Spicers business model proﬁtably across the major markets
throughout Europe.
An immediate priority is to continue the improvement in
proﬁtability in the important UK business. In continental
Europe, we will maintain the competitiveness of our major
established positions in France and the Benelux region and
continue to grow the returns from our developing businesses
in Germany, Spain and Italy.
In order to support our dealer customers, we will especially
concentrate on developing our fulﬁlment services for those
customers who outsource their logistics, enhancing further
our e-commerce and promotional tools and exploiting our
capability to supply those products that resellers increasingly
choose to offer but do not stock.
Given the relatively lower requirement for capital in the
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling activity, our ﬁnancial objective
is to generate a return on average capital employed in
excess of 20%.
Financial Objectives
Our aim is to generate enhanced returns and cash ﬂows 
for our investors over the longer-term, while maintaining 
a strong balance sheet. We recognise that there is likely 
to be a signiﬁcant degree of cyclicality in parts of our
portfolio. We therefore look to manage our resources so 
as to dampen the volatility of the Group’s results through 
the cycle, while ensuring that there is sufﬁcient proﬁt 
growth in the less cyclical parts of our packaging 
operations to achieve long-term progress. 
We measure the ﬁnancial success of our strategy using 
the ﬁnancial key performance indicators (KPIs) described
below and we look to improve the Group’s performance 
on these KPIs within the context of the business cycle.

STRONG MARKET
POSITIONS
Targeted strengths
DS Smith Kaysersberg operates in the established markets of France
and Italy and the developing markets of Poland, central Europe and
Turkey. It has built strong positions by concentrating on higher value-
added product or customer sectors. 
It has especially strong capabilities in heavy-duty corrugated
packaging, a sector which requires specialist manufacturing equipment,
design and expertise. Heavy-duty packaging is produced from multiple-
layer board and is used to transport bulky, heavy or fragile goods. It is
designed to meet the speciﬁc, demanding requirements of customers in
the automotive, chemicals, electrical and other industries.
The Group recently enlarged its position in the rapidly-growing Polish
market by building one of the most advanced box plants in Europe 
at Kutno, west of Warsaw. It has also invested in converting operations
in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, principally to supply the
automotive and other industries in that region. 
Supply chain leader
DS Smith has built a leading position in the entire UK corrugated
packaging supply chain. 
Severnside Recycling has grown organically and through acquisition; it
provides a secure supply of waste paper to St Regis’ mills and provides
recycling and waste management services to external customers. 
St Regis has raised the efﬁciency of its mill network and invested to
reinforce its competitive positions in corrugated case material and
plasterboard liner paper. 
DS Smith Packaging has been enlarged through acquisition and
developed through continuing investment. It provides an extensive 
range of corrugated packaging from its national network of plants.
The Group’s major investment at Kemsley Mill to reinforce this segment’s
position is described on pages 20 and 21.
DS Smith Packaging is the UK’s foremost supplier of corrugated packaging. DS Smith Kaysersberg is a major supplier of heavy-duty corrugated packaging.

Principal supplier Focused positions
DS Smith Plastics has major positions in its two focused market sectors.
In returnable transit packaging (RTP), the Group is a leading European
supplier of returnable container and pallet systems, extruded sheets in
solid and multi-wall form (corrugated plastic), and injection moulded
returnable bottle crates. It has particularly strong RTP supply positions
with the beverage and automotive industries.
In liquid packaging and dispensing (LP&D), the Group has built, 
through organic growth and acquisitions, a position as the worldwide
number two producer of bag-in-box packaging. It supplies leading
international brands in the soft drinks, wine, food and other industry
sectors. The Group’s LP&D operations in Europe, the USA and
Australasia provide their customers with an extensive range of bags,
taps and other dispensing methods, and ﬁlling technologies to suit 
any bag-in-box application.
Spicers is the leading European wholesaler of ofﬁce products, with
operations in all the major western European markets. Spicers’
business model is to be a pure wholesaler of a comprehensive 
range of ofﬁce products, selling only to ofﬁce products dealers 
and resellers. Spicers services approximately 13,000 ofﬁce 
products dealers throughout Europe. In addition to enabling its
dealer customers to offer a broad range of products it assists them 
in competing effectively by providing additional tools and services.
For many of its customers, Spicers provides a complete fulﬁlment
service, often delivering goods directly to the end customer if that 
is required. Spicers also makes available to its customers innovative
e-commerce systems, catalogues and promotional material and
business development support.
Spicers works in close partnership with its customers to offer the
ofﬁce end-users an innovative, ﬂexible and responsive service which
other ofﬁce products distribution channels ﬁnd difﬁcult to match.
Most of the markets in which DS Smith operates are mature and highly competitive. In order to achieve good
returns in such markets we believe it is important to be one of the leading players. Our actions to strengthen
our positions have raised the Group’s proﬁtability and built a more resilient portfolio of businesses. We 
look continually to strengthen our market positions and our operations in order to ensure that they remain
successful. We invest in our existing operations to maintain their competitiveness and, when appropriate,
enlarge our capabilities and market positions through acquisitions.
Our strong positions in the markets in which we operate
provide a valuable basis for competitive advantage.
DS Smith Plastics has a leading European position in multi-wall sheet. Spicers processes orders for approximately 800,000 line-items each week.

223 Developing new products
DS Smith Plastics, in common with all our Packaging operations,
continually looks to grow its business by enhancing its product range
through the development of new products. These may originate from
new technical processes and from designing packaging in new ways 
or for new applications. DS Smith Plastics is beneﬁting from having
further strengthened its product development teams.
DW Plastics, our beverage crate business, continues to apply its
manufacturing expertise to the development of products for new market
sectors. A recent success has been a pallet for transporting and storing
beer kegs. Compared with traditional pallets, the injection-moulded
product is lighter-weight, stronger and safer; a locking mechanism helps
ensure the stability of the kegs during handling and when stacked.
Operating safely
Safety at work is our top priority. We have legal and ethical
responsibilities to provide a safe workplace and ensure our working
practices are safe. Safety is also an essential element in meeting our
objectives of raising the productivity of our operations and maintaining 
a high-quality and well-motivated workforce. 
DS Smith Kaysersberg, Kunheim, has set up safety checkpoints for 
each of its machines; these contain safety manuals and other safety- 
and quality-related information and equipment. Employees receive
extensive safety training and have to attest that they know the safety
rules. They are required to re-familiarise themselves regularly with this
information and to check each week that their machine’s safety systems
are in order before starting production.
Further details of our health and safety performance and actions are
provided on pages 33 and 34.

In Spicers’ transaction-intensive business, a high level of customer service
is an essential requirement for success. At Spicers UK, improving the
customer service has been an important element in the management
team’s action programme to rebuild proﬁts. Higher service levels are
being achieved and the beneﬁts of this are being reﬂected in increased
sales and lower costs.
With over 85% of customer orders at Spicers UK now being received
electronically, the customer service function is mainly focused on dealing
with product or delivery enquiries and administration questions. The time
taken to respond to telephone calls has been cut to a record low level. 
A new telephone system using the latest technology is being rolled out
and will link all of Spicers UK’s service centres across the country, thus
further increasing the ﬂexibility and efﬁciency of the service team. 
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 13
Across all our businesses, it is essential that we operate to a high standard in order to be successful
in our markets. Our strong focus on relentlessly improving our operational performance has made 
a signiﬁcant contribution to our improved results in 2007/08. We took decisive action to exit
operations that would not deliver adequate returns and have concentrated our efforts on improving
those parts of the Group which offer the best opportunities for proﬁt growth. Our drive to raise
performance permeates all aspects of our operations including: safety, new product development,
customer service and manufacturing efﬁciency.
In the tough markets in which we operate, we have
to get better at what we do every year.
Across the Group’s businesses, we place great emphasis on
continually improving performance. We look for new ways to raise
the skills of our people, the output of our machines and the quality 
of our products. We also seek to reduce our usage of energy and
other resources and minimise the amount of waste we produce
through our operations. We aim to recycle as much as possible of
any waste that we do create. Our people use their expertise and
creativity to improve our operations in these and many other respects.
DS Smith Kaysersberg, Kunheim,implemented a programme to
reduce its converting costs in order to remain competitive and 
sustain its proﬁts. A key element of this programme was a drive 
to raise output by a combination of carrying out more systematic
routine checks on the machine settings on its corrugators to ensure
optimum performance and reducing the time taken to set up its box
converting machines in readiness to manufacture each new product.
Spicers UK has improved the performance of its customer service team. Efﬁciency has been improved by systematic checks of machine settings.

INVESTING
FOR GROWTH
Enhancing our products
Demand for high-quality printed point-of-sale material and large 
scale signage on corrugated board is growing faster than the market
for corrugated packaging as a whole. This trend is attributable to
corrugated board’s versatility, competitive cost, recyclability and
environmental credentials. The Group has invested in high-quality
printing to enhance its capability to print a wide range of packaging
and display material.
The Group’s specialist design studio, Level Five, has generated new
business by creating high-impact display material for the media and
retail sectors.
In early 2008, the Group acquired Multigraphics, one of the 
UK’s leading large-format screen and digital printing businesses.
Multigraphics specialises in the design and printing of retail and
promotional display material and complements the Group’s existing
design and printing skills and resources.
Increasing our capability
European demand for high-quality lightweight corrugated case material
(CCM) has been growing at a much faster rate than the overall CCM
market and is expected to more than double over the next three years.
This trend is a result of the increased demand for lighter-weight
corrugated boxes, for cost and environmental reasons. 
DS Smith is investing £104 million in order to produce high-quality
lightweight CCM at its prime UK paper mill at Kemsley. In February
2008, it acquired the adjacent New Thames Paper Mill and is
modifying the acquired facility to produce lightweight CCM. This project,
which is described in more detail on pages 20 and 21 of the Operating
Review, will strengthen the Group’s important UK Paper and Corrugated
Packaging business by giving St Regis a signiﬁcant capability in this
growth segment of the CCM market.
Major investment will enable St Regis to supply a fast-growing part of its market. DS Smith Packaging is growing in the retail display segment of the market.

Growing geographically Expanding into new markets
DS Smith Plastics is developing its returnable transit packaging (RTP)
business in new product and market sectors.
Kaysersberg Plastics recently commissioned a new extrusion line at 
its factory in Alsace, France to produce its innovative Bubble Guard
product – a rigid polypropylene sheet comprised of three solid sheets,
the central layer of which is heat-formed to create a bubble structure.
This patented technology produces a sheet which is light-weight, has 
a ﬂat surface which can be readily printed or laminated and is ideal 
for conversion into trays, boxes, separators and sleeves for the
automotive, logistics, food, toiletries and pharmaceuticals industries.
The DS Smith Replen business has recently been established to 
provide bespoke RTP solutions for food and beverage companies 
in the European retail distribution market. It will focus on the growth
opportunity of supplying replenishment concepts that allow retailers 
to restock their stores less frequently and more efﬁciently.
DS Smith Plastics is extending its capability to support its RTP customers
in the automotive and electronics industries through its extrusion and
converting operations in central Europe.
Spicers has grown its revenue and substantially changed the shape
of its business in recent years. It has pursued a strategy to expand
from its strong market positions in the UK and France by taking its
business model into the other major European markets. It launched
green-ﬁeld businesses in Germany, Spain and Italy and acquired a
well-established business in the Benelux region.
This international development has further strengthened Spicers. 
The important purchasing function has beneﬁted from the increased
scale of the business, while the marketing, IT support and logistics
functions are able to share ideas and resources.
DS Smith mainly operates in product and geographic markets in which demand is relatively stable and growth
levels are modest. We therefore place considerable emphasis on the identiﬁcation and pursuit of opportunities
to generate revenue and proﬁt growth. Seeking out product, distribution channel or customer segments which
are growing faster than the market as a whole is a high priority for the Group’s businesses. We also look to
develop our business in geographic markets which have higher growth rates, particularly in central and
eastern Europe.
Identifying and exploiting opportunities for development
is a key requirement for our future success. 
Packaging is being developed from our new Bubble Guard product. Spicers has grown its business in continental Europe.

Business Review
Description of the Group
The Group’s activities of Packaging and Ofﬁce Products
Wholesaling are managed through a decentralised structure
covering four segments:
This segment is comprised of three businesses: Severnside
Recycling, which collects waste paper and other materials
for recycling; St Regis, which processes the waste paper to
produce recycled paper, the majority of which is corrugated
case material (CCM) used in the manufacture of corrugated
packaging; and DS Smith Packaging, which converts CCM
into corrugated board and boxes. These three businesses
operating in the corrugated packaging supply chain are
heavily interdependent, although all three maintain open-
market positions to ensure competitiveness.
Severnside Recycling is the leading UK collector and
merchant of waste paper, the principal raw material for
producing recycled paper. In total, annually it sources 
1.7 million tonnes of waste paper by means of collections
through its 17 UK depots and open-market purchases from
supermarkets and third-party waste merchants. In addition,
Severnside’s facilities management function provides
general recycling and waste disposal services for customers
in a number of sectors. Severnside’s main sources of waste
paper include large supermarket groups and other retailers,
other commercial and industrial organisations and local
authorities. The largest single source of waste paper 
accounts for 16% of the total amount sourced. Severnside
particularly concentrates on sourcing used corrugated
packaging, referred to as old corrugated containers (OCC),
which is the most suitable form of waste paper for producing
recycled CCM. Severnside supplies all of the 1.0 million
tonnes of waste paper required by the St Regis paper mills
and it sells 0.7 million tonnes on the open market.
St Regis’ four paper mills produce approximately 0.85
million tonnes of 100% recycled paper. In addition, the
recently acquired New Thames Paper Mill (NTPM) at
Kemsley produces 0.2 million tonnes of partly recycled ﬁne
uncoated paper; this machine will be converted, in winter
2008/09, to produce 100% recycled CCM (for further
details see pages 20 and 21). The following description 
of St Regis’ business excludes NTPM. St Regis is the leading
UK producer of CCM, which accounts for approximately
65% of the paper it produces, and is a leading European
producer of plasterboard liner, which accounts for over 20%
of its production; the remainder comprises other speciality
paper grades. The Group’s Corrugated Packaging
operations account for around 55% of St Regis’ CCM 
sales. St Regis’ external sales are made to around 340
customers; no single external customer accounts for more
than 5% of the Group’s total UK Paper and Corrugated
Packaging revenue.
DS Smith Packaging produces 1.1 billion square metres per
annum of corrugated packaging at 32 factories located
throughout the UK. It is the leading supplier of corrugated
packaging to the UK market with a market share of around
25%. Approximately 65% of sales go into the fast-moving
consumer goods (FMCG) sector predominantly for food 
and beverages, with the remainder being principally for 
the consumer durables and industrial sectors. DS Smith
Packaging supplies many of the leading FMCG companies;
no individual customer accounts for more than 4% of the
total UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging revenue.

launched corrugated pallets
are cost-effective replacements
for wooden pallets and are
100% recyclable.

In continental Europe, DS Smith Kaysersberg produces 
0.6 billion square metres per annum of corrugated
packaging at 12 factories located in France, Italy, Poland,
Turkey, Czech Republic and Slovakia. The bulk of its CCM
requirements are sourced from third parties. It has estimated
market shares of 6% in France, 3% in Italy, 8% in Poland
and 4% in Turkey. The business has been growing strongly
in Poland and the Czech Republic. DS Smith Kaysersberg
produces 0.2 million tonnes of recycled paper (principally
solid board for use in the manufacture of detergent boxes)
at two mills in France and one mill in Turkey. DS Smith 
also owns 49.6% of the leading paper and corrugated
packaging business in Ukraine; the results of this business
are reported under associates.
The Group’s continental corrugated packaging operations
are particularly strong in heavy-duty and litho-laminated
packaging. Approximately 30% of sales are to the FMCG
sector and the remainder is to the consumer durables,
industrial and other sectors. This segment has a large 
and diverse range of customers, none of which accounts
individually for more than 6% of Continental European
Corrugated Packaging’s total revenue.
DS Smith Plastics holds a major European position in
industrial returnable transit packaging (RTP) and is a 
leading worldwide supplier of liquid packaging and
dispensing systems (LP&D).
The Group is a leading European supplier of RTP . Its 
extensive product range includes reusable containers, 
boxes and pallet systems, injection-moulded crates and 
semi-ﬁnished extruded sheet. These products are supplied 
to the automotive, beverage, pharmaceutical and other
markets from 12 locations in the UK, France, Belgium, 
Spain, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and 
the Dominican Republic.
In LP&D, it is ranked as number two globally in bag-in-box
packaging systems and injection-moulded taps and
dispensers, which are supplied worldwide to the soft 
drinks, wine, food and other industry sectors from nine
locations in the UK, Germany, Bulgaria, the USA, Australia
and New Zealand. 
Additionally, the segment contains two small speciality
businesses: Packaging Management, which provides
logistics services, particularly for pallet and plastic layer
pad pools; and a development business, StePac, which
specialises in modiﬁed atmosphere packaging for preserving
the quality of fresh fruit and vegetables in transit.
The division purchases a wide range of polymers and
plastic ﬁlms, principally polypropylene, high density
polyethylene and polycarbonate; the largest polymer
supplier accounts for approximately 12% of raw material
costs. This segment has a widely spread customer base and
no single customer accounts for more than 5% of DS Smith
Plastics’ total revenue.
Spicers is the number one European wholesaler of ofﬁce
products; it has leading positions in each of the UK, Ireland,
France and the Benelux region, and it is building its position
in continental Europe with development businesses in
Germany, Spain and Italy. Its network of distribution centres
comprises: UK – 9; Ireland – 1; France – 6; Benelux – 1;
Germany – 2; Spain – 2; Italy – 1. 
Spicers provides a wholesaling service to its customer base
of ofﬁce products dealers and resellers, who principally
supply smaller and medium-sized ofﬁces. It supplies
approximately 13,000 dealers throughout Europe and 
no single dealer customer accounts for more than 4% of
Spicers’ total revenue. Spicers’ product range of up to
22,000 product lines comprises its own 5-Star brand and
other branded products of traditional stationery items,
electronic ofﬁce supplies, ofﬁce furniture, janitorial supplies
and ofﬁce catering and vending provisions. Its range is
communicated to its dealers and the ofﬁces they supply
through printed catalogues and electronic systems; orders
are now principally submitted to Spicers on-line or by other
electronic means.
Spicers offers its dealer customers a same-day or an
overnight, next-day delivery service; it also provides the
dealers with marketing and promotional support. The
business is highly transaction-intensive with approximately
800,000 line-items being processed weekly. The
maintenance of reliable and efﬁcient systems that are
capable of handling the high volume of customer orders
received daily, either on-line or by telephone, is a key
feature of the business. Spicers’ business model is explained

Paper and Corrugated
Market Overview
The Corrugated Packaging Market 
The European market for corrugated packaging is 
estimated to be approximately €19 billion, equivalent 
to approximately 22 million tonnes or 41 billion square
metres
1
, of which the UK market is estimated to be
approximately 9%. Demand for corrugated packaging 
is principally inﬂuenced by overall economic activity 
and manufacturing output. 
Usage of corrugated packaging (boxes) for the fast-moving
consumer goods (FMCG) sector, which accounts for
approximately two-thirds of the corrugated market, has
remained strong. Demand from the FMCG sector has
particularly beneﬁted from the continued growth of retail-
ready packaging (RRP), which can be readily converted 
from its initial role as a protective transit pack into its second
role as a box or tray that can be placed on display in the
retail store. RRP beneﬁts retailers by reducing the manual
work involved in loading goods onto store shelves and
lowering the amount of damage to goods in store, while
enabling products to be presented more attractively. RRP
requires more sophisticated packaging manufacturing
capabilities for cutting, printing and gluing the corrugated
board to form the more complicated box structures. The
increased proportion of these higher value-added boxes,
often requiring multi-passes within the production process, 
has contributed to a higher level of capacity utilisation 
across the corrugated industry.
Another consumer-focused area of usage for corrugated
packaging which is growing is promotional applications,
incorporating high-quality printing and design for RRP, 
retail and promotional display material and other uses.
Usage of corrugated packaging for the home delivery 
of products also continues to grow in association with the
development of purchasing through the internet. In contrast,
the usage of boxes in some industrial manufacturing sectors
of western Europe has been adversely affected by the
transfer of manufacturing to lower cost countries. 
In the calendar year 2007, the European market for
corrugated packaging, measured in square metres, grew 
by 2.6%
2
. Demand in western Europe grew by 1.8%
although within this the UK market fell by 1.2%. Demand
growth in eastern and central Europe continued to be 
much stronger at 7.0%. Owing to cost and environmental
pressures, there is an increasing emphasis in most markets
on reducing the average weight of packaging. As a result,
European demand growth when measured by weight was
1.6% and the UK market, which is at the forefront of the
lightweighting trend, fell by 2.9%. Across Europe, market
growth began to slow during the second half of 2007 and
recent indicators suggest that the market has continued to 
be sluggish in the early months of 2008.
Supply of corrugated board and boxes is generally
relatively local to the point of production, with a typical
operational radius of approximately 150 miles, owing to
customers’ service requirements and the proportionately
high transport costs for a low-density product. Pricing and
margins in corrugated packaging are strongly inﬂuenced 
by developments in the price of corrugated case material
(CCM), the paper that is the principal component in
corrugated packaging, and which typically accounts for
around 50% of the cost of a box.
The Corrugated Case Material Market
Whereas boxes are generally sold locally, CCM is sold 
on a pan-European basis and pricing is therefore affected
by pan-European supply and demand factors. The total
demand for CCM in Europe (including eastern and central
Europe but not Russia) is circa 25 million tonnes. The market
for CCM in Europe is dependent upon European demand
for corrugated packaging, as the imports and exports of
unﬁlled boxes are negligible. Approximately 80% of the
CCM used in Europe is made from recycled ﬁbre, with the
balance principally comprising kraftliner, made from virgin
wood pulp.
The strong trend towards the greater use of lighter-weight
corrugated packaging is being driven not only by the
continuing pressure through the supply chain to reduce the
cost of packaging but also the increased attention being
given to the quantity and type of packaging being used 
in order to reduce the amount of waste going to landﬁll.
Corrugated packaging is fully recyclable and the trend
towards use of lighter-weight boxes has been enabled 
by the increasing availability of high-quality lightweight
recycled CCM with good strength characteristics. This
lightweight CCM allows box manufacturers to produce
packaging with high performance characteristics while
reducing the weight of material used. Lightweight recycled
CCM is estimated to account for circa 7% (circa 1.8 million
tonnes) of the total European CCM market currently and 
this share is expected to rise to circa 15% (circa 4 million
tonnes) by 2010, representing a growth of circa 2 million
tonnes. Although there is strong demand for high-quality,
lightweight CCM, growth in this segment of the CCM
market will continue to be limited by the available supply 
of lightweight paper as the majority of the existing CCM
machines are unable to manufacture lightweight papers
cost-effectively or to an acceptable quality.
The European industry supply and demand position for
recycled CCM has been broadly in balance since early
2006. Although no signiﬁcant CCM capacity additions 
are expected in the second half of 2008, four European
recycled CCM producers, including DS Smith, have
announced their intentions to invest in new machines
capable of producing lightweight CCM. These four new
machines will be located in the UK, Germany, Poland and
Hungary and are due to start production during 2009.

increase in capacity of approximately 7%. It is expected
that the production from the new machines will principally
be targeted at satisfying the rapidly growing European 
demand for lightweight paper. 
CCM and Box Prices
Following a period during 2004 and 2005 of falling CCM
and box prices and sharply rising energy and waste paper
input costs, a tighter European supply and demand position
on CCM and corrugated packaging enabled CCM and box
producers to increase their prices, in several stages, during
2006 and 2007. This resulted in a recovery of the higher
input costs of energy and waste paper and improved
margins. The most recent CCM price increase occurred in
September 2007, following which box producers increased
their prices over the subsequent months to recover the
higher paper costs. Since the start of 2008, the slow-down
in demand for boxes has resulted in some softening of 
CCM prices, particularly in continental Europe. The strength
of the euro has provided support to prices in the UK.
Waste Paper 
Waste paper, the principal raw material for recycled CCM,
is a globally traded commodity. The price of old corrugated
containers (OCC), the principal grade of waste paper used
for producing CCM, rose by circa 35% between January
2007 and April 2008
3
. This was largely due to the
continuing high level of demand for it from Asia as a result
of the recent substantial investment in recycled paper
manufacturing in that region. In the UK, the higher net 
cost of our raw material has also been exacerbated by the
continuing very low value of Packaging Recovery Notes
(PRNs), which are issued as evidence that packaging has
been reprocessed, in compliance with the UK Packaging
Waste Regulations.

DS Smith’s operations play a
signiﬁcant role in the ﬁrst three
stages of the corrugated packaging
recycling process. The ﬁbres in
corrugated boxes can be back 
on the shelf in store within 14 days
of disposal; their re-use minimises
waste disposal to landﬁll. In the
UK, over 80% of corrugated
packaging is recycled.
Corrugated boxes protect products,
reduce product wastage, enable
more efﬁcient and lower-cost
handling and transportation and
are increasingly used to provide
strong visual display in store.
Approximately two-thirds are used
for food, beverages and other
fast-moving consumer goods.

UK Paper and 
Corrugated Packaging
Results advanced strongly 
2007/08 Performance
Results in the UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging segment
advanced strongly, reﬂecting good recovery of higher input
costs through better pricing and the previous actions taken 
to strengthen further the Group’s UK market positions in 
waste paper collection, recycled paper and boxes. Revenue
advanced by 10% to £753.2 million; on a like-for-like basis,
excluding the paper mill closed in October 2006 and New
Thames Paper Mill acquired in February 2008, revenue
increased by 9%. Adjusted operating proﬁt was substantially
higher at £68.5 million (2006/07: £36.5 million).
We raised our prices of CCM and boxes in order to recover
the further increases in the costs of energy and waste paper.
Although these price increases enabled us to rebuild our
margins, further increases in the cost of energy and the
continuing high cost of waste paper put pressure on our
margins during the second half of the ﬁnancial year.
Our waste collection business, Severnside Recycling, grew
strongly, assisted by the increased demand for recycling
services and government action to reduce the amount of
waste going to landﬁll. In addition to fulﬁlling its primary
role of securing the required quantities of ﬁbre for our UK
paper mills, we developed further its value-added waste
management services. Severnside and our UK box business,
DS Smith Packaging, collaborate in marketing our cradle-
to-cradle environmental capability. This encompasses the
Group’s expertise in designing packaging that will minimise
waste throughout the supply chain, our manufacturing
network for producing recycled paper and corrugated
boxes which are fully recyclable, and Severnside’s 
services for managing customers’ entire waste recycling 
and disposal needs.
St Regis, our UK paper business, increased its total 
sales volume from our ongoing mills through improved
productivity. We enhanced our margin by means of 
the recovery of higher input costs through raised prices,
reduced operating costs as a result of our previous
restructuring action, and our increased capability to
produce higher value-added products at Kemsley and
Wansbrough Mills following recent investment. Kemsley 
Mill performed well, assisted by further strong sales growth
in plasterboard liner. The mill’s sales were curtailed by a ﬁre
which incapacitated one of its machines for three weeks
towards the end of the year. The three smaller mills, which
principally produce higher value-added speciality products,
made good progress.
In February 2008, DS Smith acquired from M-real
Corporation, for a consideration of £60 million in cash, 
the New Thames Paper Mill, which is located adjacent 
to St Regis’ Kemsley Mill, as well as the 50% balance of
Grovehurst Energy, the mills’ energy and services supplier,
not already owned by DS Smith. In addition, we incurred 
a net cash cost of £7 million from a one-off payment, net 
of tax, towards the costs of the transfer of the associated
pension scheme to a third party. The acquired facility
currently produces ﬁne uncoated paper and, using the latest
papermaking technology, we intend to invest a further circa
£37 million in the modiﬁcation of the acquired facility to
enable it to produce approximately 260,000 tonnes per
annum of high-quality lightweight recycled CCM. It is
planned that the converted machine will commence
production in January 2009. The total cost of this project is
expected to be circa £104 million and will be funded from
the Group’s existing debt facilities.
This acquisition and investment will materially strengthen the
long-term competitiveness of our UK Paper and Corrugated
Packaging business. It reinforces us in our aim to be a leader
in the area of high-quality lighter-weight packaging and gives
us a signiﬁcant capability in the growth segment of high-quality
lightweight CCM. Total UK demand for lightweight recycled
CCM is expected to grow from an estimated 400,000 tonnes
in 2007 to over 600,000 tonnes by 2010. At present, UK
demand is very largely met by imports from continental 
Europe as total UK manufacturing of this product is less than
100,000 tonnes per annum. The Group currently has very
limited capacity to produce lightweight CCM, which accounts
for approximately 25% (approximately 150,000 tonnes per
annum) of the CCM usage of our UK corrugated packaging
operations. This project is expected to generate good ﬁnancial
returns in its ﬁrst full year of operation (2009/10) and provide
very good returns for shareholders in the longer-term. The ﬁrst
stage of the modiﬁcation of the acquired facility, the construction
of a new stock preparation plant, is progressing to plan.
Further details of this project are provided on page 21.
DS Smith Packaging’s revenue and proﬁt advanced as a
result of good sales growth in higher value-added converted
products and the mitigation of higher input costs through
raised prices and improved productivity. Our results
beneﬁted from our focus on the growing RRP and decorative
sectors of the market, which require greater design input
and more sophisticated manufacturing capability. In our
sheet feeding operations, which supply corrugated sheet 
to box converters, sales were adversely affected by our
emphasis on recovering the higher input costs. 
In March 2008, the Group acquired Multigraphics 
Holdings Limited from funds managed by 3i and from the
Multigraphics management team. Multigraphics specialises
in the design and printing of retail and promotional display
material. DS Smith Packaging is a substantial supplier of
high-quality printed display material. This acquisition 
further strengthened the Group’s position in this fast-
growing sector of the market.

box manufacturers to produce 
lighter-weight packaging. DS Smith
has acquired New Thames Paper 
Mill (NTPM), which is adjacent to 
St Regis’ Kemsley Mill. NTPM’s PM6
paper machine currently produces ﬁne
uncoated paper and will be modiﬁed
to produce circa 260,000 tonnes of
lightweight CCM per annum. The
principal modiﬁcations being made
are described on this page.
Production of lightweight CCM on
PM6 is due to start in January 2009.
A new stock preparation plant

300,000 tonnes of waste paper
per annum to produce stock 
of the optimum strength and
consistency to make lightweight
recycled CCM.

Entering 2008/09, energy, waste and starch input costs 
are exerting further pressure on our margins. We will 
seek to mitigate these higher costs though pricing, raised
productivity and cost reduction. A key priority is to
implement our lightweight CCM project in line with our
plan. In this segment, our strong market positions and 
our focus on the higher value-added sectors of the market
provide us with a good base from which to compete.

2007/08 Performance
DS Smith Kaysersberg achieved a good result principally
due to its programme to recover higher input costs through
better pricing and its focus on higher value-added products.
Revenue grew by 12.3% to £346.0 million. This segment,
which is a substantial net buyer of paper, was adversely
affected in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁnancial year by higher input
costs, which we recovered during the second half of the
year. Operating proﬁt increased by 12% to £20.3 million.
In our established markets, the French paper business,
which focuses on providing a high level of customer service
on speciality products, performed creditably. Our French
corrugated packaging business improved its margin through
improvements in productivity, recovery of the higher input
costs and its focus on higher value-added sectors such as
heavy-duty packaging. We restructured our commercial,
marketing and support functions to strengthen further 
the business’s approach to its market. Through capital
investment we are increasing our capability in RRP, which
should help us in the coming year. In Italy, our two highly
efﬁcient factories performed well in a particularly price
competitive market environment.
In our developing markets, the Polish business achieved 
a further strong advance through substantial sales growth, 
in excess of the rapidly expanding market, and an
increased concentration on higher value-added products.
We continued the development of our small converting
businesses in the Czech Republic and Slovakia aimed
principally at the automotive industry in central Europe.
Results at our business in Turkey, which focuses on the
brown and white goods and automotive sectors, were
depressed by slower market growth and increased price
pressure, principally as a result of the weakening of the
Turkish economy. We have implemented an extensive
programme aimed at restoring proﬁtability by widening 
the business mix and lowering costs. Results at our
Ukrainian associate business, Rubezhansk, which is
reported under associates, were affected by a ﬁre at its
paper mill. The investment project to increase its capacity
signiﬁcantly and broaden its product range is progressing.
In 2008/09, our priorities in this segment are to restore
proﬁtability in our Turkish business, improve further the
operational performance in our established markets and
continue to develop our businesses in eastern and central
Europe; we will continue to concentrate particularly on
higher value-added product sectors in all our markets.
Plastic Packaging
Proﬁt progress was held back
by competitive pressures
Market Overview
Returnable transit packaging (RTP) products are mostly 
used within the retail, automotive, electronics and beverage
sectors. Demand is heavily inﬂuenced by industry sector
activity levels. RTP is often a capital purchase for our
customers, being driven by particular projects, hence
annual demand can be uneven. The European market for
RTP, which is estimated to be approximately €1 billion, is
fragmented into many product sub-sectors and has a large
number of suppliers. In western Europe, market growth 
is estimated to be 2–3% per annum. Overall the trend
towards the use of multi-trip, reusable packaging on cost
and environmental grounds has been slower over the last
two years than was previously the case. The slow-down in
demand has been partly as a result of the higher polymer
costs and partly due to the relocation of some major
customer sectors, such as the automotive and electronics
industries, to eastern Europe, where the RTP market growth
is estimated to be approximately 15% per annum.
The global market for liquid packaging and dispensing
(LP&D) products is estimated to be approximately £400
million. The principal uses of bag-in-box packaging are 
for wine, agricultural produce (such as fruit juice and 
dairy products) and food service applications such as
carbonated soft-drink concentrate (for the hotel and

and European markets is estimated to be approximately 5%
per annum, while the market in Asia-Paciﬁc is at an early
stage of development and growing rapidly. The market for
dispensing products (principally taps), other than for 
bag-in-box systems, is fragmented across a wide range of
applications. DS Smith is a major supplier to the wine and
liquid detergent sector; the latter has grown strongly in recent
years in the USA and is now starting to develop in Europe.
2007/08 Performance
DS Smith Plastics grew its revenue by 11% to £223.4
million. There was a 5% advance in adjusted operating
proﬁt to £10.7 million, due to good performance in RTP 
and the two smaller businesses, which was partly offset 
by weaker results in LP&D. 
Revenue in RTP, which accounted for 48% of the segment
revenue, advanced by 16%. The beverage crate business
performed well, assisted by the fulﬁlment of several large
contracts, good sales of its innovative keg pallet and the
start-up of a new operation in Portugal. Sales of other 
RTP product lines in total achieved an improved result,
beneﬁting from previous actions taken to strengthen the
sales and product development functions. A new business
was launched aimed at providing bespoke RTP replenishment
solutions for food and beverage companies in the retail
distribution market. We grew RTP sales from our operations
in the Czech Republic and Slovakia which supply customers,
particularly in the automotive sector, in that region.
In LP&D, revenue, which accounted for 41% of the segment,
grew by 1%. Pressure on prices affected both the American
and European businesses and increased competition in wine
bags also held back results in Europe. Our USA operations
performed well, beneﬁting from innovative new products
and the development of new market sectors for bag-in-box
packaging. An agreement has been reached with our
employees in Germany about the proposed restructuring 
of our European LP&D operations. The injection moulding 
of taps in Europe is in the process of being consolidated 
at our Merton site in the UK. Bag production in Germany
will be consolidated at our Schwetzingen site near Frankfurt
between February and April 2009, prior to production
ceasing at our Düren site in April 2009. The total
restructuring charge, taken in 2006/07 and 2007/08 
is £3.8 million; we expect the improved results of this
business to provide a three-year payback on this charge. 
Our small packaging management business beneﬁted from
our recent investment and previous restructuring actions.
StePac, our development business which specialises in
modiﬁed atmosphere packaging, continued to grow its 
sales and proﬁt strongly.
At this early stage of the year, this segment is facing 
further increases in polymer costs as a result of the high
price of oil; we will look to mitigate any higher input costs
through raising prices and productivity improvements. 
Other priorities for 2008/09 are, in RTP, to grow proﬁtable
sales in new products and markets and, in LP&D, to 
complete the restructuring of our European operations 
and to rebuild proﬁts.
OFFICE PRODUCTS
WHOLESALING
Spicers achieved a signiﬁcantly
improved result
Market Overview 
The ofﬁce products markets of the UK, France and Germany,
in which Spicers currently has approximately 85% of its
sales, are estimated to be worth approximately €7 billion,
€6 billion and €8 billion respectively, at manufacturers’
selling prices. The demand for ofﬁce products is principally
inﬂuenced by the level of economic activity. The recent
growth in the value of the markets in which Spicers operates
is estimated to have been low or ﬂat overall, with the
traditional stationery sector being ﬂat or in decline and the
electronic ofﬁce supplies (EOS) sector showing strong growth
4
. 
The volume of products bought by ofﬁces continues to
increase, but the value of the market is being held back 
by price deﬂation caused by intense competition between
suppliers and the trend for consumers to buy lower-
speciﬁcation or own-branded products. EOS, which is a
growing sector of the market, accounts for approximately
50% of the total ofﬁce products market; it is especially 
price-competitive on the high-volume EOS products.
The relative shares of the various supply channels to the 
end-user market differ by country. Spicers principally
supplies ofﬁce products dealers and resellers; in the
countries in which Spicers operates, this channel accounts,
on average, for approximately 35% of the total ofﬁce
products market. The share of the market held by dealers
has been relatively stable in recent years. Ofﬁce products
dealers primarily sell to smaller and medium-sized ofﬁces,
generally offer a high standard of service to their customers
and source most of their products either from wholesalers or
direct from manufacturers. The distribution channels in the
ofﬁce products market are explained further on page 24.
Wholesalers, on average, account for approximately 10%
of the total market. The direct wholesaling competition that
Spicers faces varies by country. In the UK there is one other
signiﬁcant national wholesaler of ofﬁce products. In most
continental European markets competition from other
national wholesalers is limited, but there are signiﬁcant
numbers of regional and local wholesalers. The European
scale of Spicers’ business assists it in offering a broad range
of products at competitive prices relative to those of many of

its smaller wholesaling competitors. Spicers’ commitment to
supplying only the trade, and not, as some of its competitors
do, supplying end-users, gives it a competitive advantage.
Spicers competes indirectly with a number of other
distribution channels. The most signiﬁcant of these, contract
stationers, accounts for 10–15% of the total market; they
generally sell to larger ofﬁces and offer a smaller range 
of products than is stocked by Spicers. The other principal
competitor channels to market are: mail order, ofﬁce
superstores, other retailers and manufacturers selling 
direct to ofﬁces.
2007/08 Performance
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling – Spicers – achieved a
signiﬁcantly improved result due to continued progress in
the continental European businesses and an advance in the
UK. The result is in line with our three-year plan to restore
proﬁts. We increased revenue by 13% to £644.9 million,
with particularly strong growth in the UK and Italy. Adjusted
operating proﬁt advanced by 57% to £20.1 million.
Spicers UK results beneﬁted from the ongoing action
programme to raise our proﬁts in this important business
and the previous restructuring of the regional distribution
centre network. Service levels signiﬁcantly improved as we
moved through 2007/08, reaching a good level as we
exited the year. There was a substantial increase in sales.
All of this increase was in EOS products. The proportion of
EOS within our sales mix now more closely reﬂects that of
the market as a whole, which helps us in providing good
support to our dealers. We are looking to continue the
development of our sales in both EOS and non-EOS
products. Further actions to improve the longer-term
competitiveness of the UK distribution network continue 
to be reviewed. 
In continental Europe, our two well-established businesses 
in France and the Benelux region, which account for 31% 
of Spicers’ total revenue, developed further their strong
market positions and maintained their good performance. 
In France, we beneﬁted from the recruitment of new
customers and action to lower costs, while Spicers Benelux
achieved a signiﬁcant sales advance in the Netherlands 
as a result of refocusing its sales effort separately on the
Belgian and Dutch markets.
In the continental development businesses, which represent
17% of Spicers’ total revenue, Spicers Germany achieved
good progress on the back of high service levels and raised
productivity. The Spanish business grew by extending its
customer base, beneﬁting from its second distribution 
centre, which opened near Madrid in October 2006, while
in Italy sales continued to grow rapidly, ahead of our plan; 
the business is now established as a signiﬁcant supplier 
to the Italian market.
For 2008/09, we are focused on achieving a further
advance in proﬁts in the UK and maintaining progress 
in our development businesses in continental Europe.
Ofﬁce products are distributed from
the manufacturers to the end-users 
in ofﬁces through various channels.
Spicers operates in the wholesaler/
dealer channel which competes
effectively and proﬁtably by combining
the specialisation and buying power 
of the wholesaler with the low
overhead cost structure of the dealer.
Wholesalers also supply product to the
other main channels because they are
well equipped to hold stock of a large 
range of items.

Trading Results 
The Group’s results for the year to 30 April 2008, which are
summarised in Table 1, have been prepared on the basis of
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The major drivers of the 2007/08 results were: the substantial
increases in selling prices in the Paper and Corrugated
segments that were realised in order to recover the major 
rises in materials and energy costs that have taken place in
recent years; and improved results in the Ofﬁce Products
Wholesaling segment.
Revenue increased by 11.4% over the prior year; 8.5% 
higher in the ﬁrst half of the year and 14.2% higher in the
second half. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions of 
M-real New Thames Limited and Multigraphics Holdings
Limited and closures in the prior year, revenue was up 11.0%.
If, in addition, the translation effect of movements in foreign
exchange rates is excluded, revenue was up 8.4% on
2006/07 (up 9.6% in the ﬁrst half of the year and up 
7.2% in the second half). 
Adjusted Group operating proﬁt (excluding exceptional items)
in 2007/08 was £119.6 million (2006/07: £77.7 million).
The increase in adjusted Group operating proﬁt resulted from
improvements in all four reporting segments. There was a
strong advance of £32.0 million in UK Paper and Corrugated
Packaging, while Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling increased by
£7.3 million, Continental European Corrugated Packaging
progressed by £2.1 million and Plastic Packaging increased
by £0.5 million. Group adjusted operating proﬁt in the ﬁrst
half of the year was £60.4 million (2006/07 H1: £30.4
million) and in the second half was £59.2 million (2006/07
H2: £47.3 million). The Group’s adjusted return on sales was
6.1% (2006/07: 4.4%). 
The Group recorded exceptional charges before interest and
tax of £1.9 million during the year (2006/07: net exceptional
beneﬁt of £1.9 million). This net exceptional charge arose 
from the restructuring of our European liquid packaging and
dispensing operations within Plastic Packaging. Operating
proﬁt after exceptional items was £117.7 million (2006/07:
£79.6 million).
The Group’s adjusted return on average capital employed
(which is deﬁned as the adjusted operating proﬁt divided 
by the average capital employed) increased from 8.7% 
in 2006/07 to 12.9% in 2007/08, above the Group’s
estimated pre-tax cost of capital of 11.5%. The improvement 
in the Group’s adjusted return on average capital employed
reﬂects better returns in 2007/08 in UK Paper and Corrugated
Packaging and Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling, offset by lower
returns in Continental European Corrugated Packaging, whilst
returns from Plastic Packaging were broadly ﬂat. 
Interest, Tax and Earnings per Share
Net interest expense increased from £15.0 million in
2006/07 to £20.8 million in 2007/08, reﬂecting higher
interest rates and increased average net debt. Net interest
expense also increased due to a £3.1 million charge from
an increase in the fair value of put options held by minority,

non-controlling shareholders in a subsidiary of the Group.
Employment beneﬁt net ﬁnance income, which is a non-cash
item, was £8.8 million (2006/07: £8.0 million), reﬂecting
the lower opening deﬁcit of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. 
For 2008/09, given the higher discount rate used and
higher opening deﬁcit, it is anticipated that there will be 
an increase in the employment beneﬁt ﬁnance charges of
circa £10 million.
The Group included £3.4 million as the Group’s adjusted
share of associated undertakings’ after-tax proﬁts, down
from £3.9 million in 2006/07. Within this amount, £3.3
million (2006/07: £3.6 million) related to the Group’s
share of the after-tax operating proﬁt of Rubezhansk, the
Group’s associate paper and packaging company in
Ukraine; the decline in the proﬁts from associates is also
due to the Group’s lower share of proﬁts from its Japanese
packaging associate, following the disposal in the year of
the Group’s remaining share of 6.3%. 
Adjusted proﬁt before tax was £111.0 million (2006/07:
£74.6 million). Proﬁt before tax after exceptional items 
was £109.1 million (2006/07: £78.5 million). 
The Group’s effective tax rate, excluding exceptional items
and associates, at 29.4%, was lower than last year’s rate 
of 32.2%, due to the release of £2.4 million of deferred 
tax provisions following the reduction in the UK rate of
corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April
2008. Excluding the effect of the deferred tax provision
release, the effective tax rate was slightly lower than in 
the prior period due to the increased proportion of UK
generated proﬁt within the total Group proﬁt. Adjusted 
basic earnings per share were 19.9 pence (2006/07: 
13.1 pence). Basic earnings per share were 19.6 pence
(2006/07: 15.6 pence).
Dividend 
The proposed ﬁnal dividend is increased to 6.2 pence
(2006/07: 6.0 pence). The total dividend for the year 
is 8.8 pence (2006/07: 8.6 pence). Dividend cover before
exceptional items was 2.3 times in 2007/08 (2006/07:
1.5 times). Dividend cover after exceptional items was 
2.2 times (2006/07: 1.8 times).
Cash Flow 
Free cash ﬂow (which is deﬁned as the net cash ﬂow before
dividends, acquisitions and disposals) and net cash ﬂow 
are shown in Table 2. Cash generated from operations was
£179.8 million (2006/07: £128.0 million). This reﬂects 
the higher adjusted operating proﬁt, lower exceptional 
cash restructuring costs and an increased inﬂow from
working capital. The cash outﬂow in respect of exceptional
restructuring costs was £5.8 million (including cash outﬂows
related to exceptional charges made in 2006/07),
compared with a cash outﬂow from restructuring costs 
of £7.2 million in 2006/07. There was a strong focus 
on working capital management which resulted in a cash
inﬂow of £13.2 million. In respect of pension payments, 
the agreed annual contribution into the combined UK Group
Pension scheme was £14.6 million in 2007/08 (2006/07:
£14.6 million). Capital expenditure payments were £66.5
million, up from £55.8 million in 2006/07; the most
signiﬁcant investments were new printing technology in 
the UK and continental Europe and increased production
capability for plasterboard liner in the UK. The proceeds
from the sales of assets reduced by £31.7 million; the
2006/07 amount included the net cash consideration of
£29.6 million for the sale of the Taplow site. The interest
paid increased in line with the income statement charge. 
Tax payments were £27.8 million (2006/07: £15.1 million)
principally due to higher adjusted trading proﬁt described
above. Free cash ﬂow, before acquisitions, disposals and
dividends, was £79.0 million (2006/07: £84.0 million).
Excluding sales of assets, free cash ﬂow generated was
£69.7 million (2006/07: £43.0 million), an improvement 
of 62.1%.

Business Review
Financial Review continued
Cash dividend cover, deﬁned as free cash ﬂow divided by
dividends paid in the year, was 2.3 times, down from 2.6
times in 2006/07. 
The net cash outﬂow on acquisitions and disposals was
£87.2 million (2006/07: £0.2 million inﬂow) principally
accounted for by the acquisition of M-real New Thames
Limited (£67.4 million) and Multigraphics Holdings Limited 
(£6.7 million). Additionally £11.9 million was incurred 
for the purchase of further share capital in Toscana 
Ondulati SpA. 
Financial Position 
Shareholders’ funds totalled £601.7 million at 30 April
2008, up from £569.4 million at 30 April 2007. Net 
assets per share were 153.9 pence (30 April 2007: 
144.9 pence). The proﬁt attributable to the shareholders 
of DS Smith Plc was £76.6 million and dividends of 
£33.7 million were paid during the year. In addition, after-
tax actuarial losses of £51.6 million on the Group’s deﬁned
beneﬁt pension schemes were debited to reserves through
the statement of recognised income and expense. Other
items recognised directly in equity relate to currency
translation of £24.3 million, movements in cash ﬂow hedges
of £14.5 million and other movements of £2.2 million.
The Group’s closing net debt was £251.8 million, 
£70.6 million higher than at the start of the year, the 
major elements of which were the net cash outﬂow during
the year of £41.9 million (after £87.2 million of net
acquisitions) and non-cash movements, principally 
exchange differences and related fair-value movements, 
of £25.6 million. 
Gearing was 41.8% (30 April 2007: 32.0%); the
movement reﬂected the increase in borrowings resulting
from the net cash outﬂow for the year, which was
proportionally greater than the increase in shareholders’
funds. Adjusted interest cover was 5.8 times, compared 
with 5.2 times last year, the higher cover reﬂecting the
higher adjusted operating proﬁt partially offset by the
increased interest charge. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA
(before exceptional items) was 1.4 times (2006/07:1.3 times).
Energy Costs 
The high level of energy costs continued to be a signiﬁcant
factor for the Group in 2007/08. The Group’s total costs 
for gas, electricity and diesel fuel increased from £88
million in 2006/07 to £91 million in 2007/08. After
adjusting for the effects of the acquisition of New Thames
Paper Mill and the closure of Taplow mill, this represents an
underlying increase of £2 million. Market prices for energy
in the UK increased over the year, more so for electricity
than gas. The Group continued with its strategy of hedging
the energy costs with suppliers and ﬁnancial institutions.
Approximately 40% of the Group’s energy costs, principally
related to our largest energy-consuming facilities, are
incurred under supply contracts in which movements in 
our energy costs tend to lag the trends in market prices. 
Capital Structure and Treasury Management 
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of
cash: operating cash ﬂow, borrowings, shareholders’ equity
and disposals of peripheral businesses, where appropriate.
The Group’s objective is to achieve a capital structure that
results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing
ﬂexibility in immediate and medium-term funding so as to
accommodate material investments or acquisitions. The
Group also aims to maintain a strong balance sheet and 
to provide continuity of ﬁnancing by having a range of
maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources. 
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are to ensure
sufﬁcient funds are available for the Group to carry out 
its strategy and to manage ﬁnancial risks. The Group’s
treasury strategy is controlled through the Treasury
Committee, which meets regularly and includes the 
Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and 
the Group Treasurer. The Group Treasury function operates
in accordance with policies and procedures approved by
the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer. The
function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service
to operations and implements strategies for interest rate,
foreign exchange and energy exposure management. 
The Group’s main borrowing facilities comprise: a private
placement, due in 2012, of US$105.0 million and £25.0
million; a private placement of US$105.0 million due in
2014 and US$95.0 million due in 2016; and a syndicated
revolving credit facility of £250.0 million expiring in 2010.
Additionally, we have recently obtained a revolving credit
facility of £50.0 million expiring in 2010. At 30 April
2008, the Group’s committed borrowing facilities were
£526.0 million. Uncommitted borrowing facilities, including
overdrafts, totalled £123.0 million. The total gross
borrowings drawn under all these facilities at the year 
end were £274.5 million. At 30 April 2008, the Group’s
committed borrowing facilities had a weighted-average
maturity of three years and six months.
The major treasury risks to which the Group is exposed
relate to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates
and market prices for energy. The overall objective of the
Treasury function is to control these exposures whilst 
striking an appropriate balance between mitigating risks
and controlling costs. Financial instruments, including
derivatives, may be used in implementing hedging
strategies but the speculative use of ﬁnancial instruments,
including derivatives, is not permitted.

The Group manages the risks associated with its purchases
of energy in the UK through its Energy Procurement Group,
which operates under the oversight of the Treasury
Committee. UK purchases of energy represent the signiﬁcant
majority of the Group’s overall energy costs. The Group 
has ﬂexible price purchase arrangements with its suppliers 
of electricity and natural gas; it also enters into hedge
arrangements with its suppliers and ﬁnancial institutions. 
The Treasury Committee regularly reviews the Group’s
exposure to interest rates and considers whether to 
borrow on ﬁxed or ﬂoating terms. The Group has a 
policy of borrowing at ﬂoating rates, which the Treasury
Committee believes provides better value over the medium-
term. The Group has previously taken advantage of low
levels of medium- to long-term sterling interest rates to ﬁx 
the interest rate on a total of £40.8 million of sterling
denominated borrowings which is ﬁxed to 2016. Fixed-
rate borrowings, taking into account the effect of related 
swaps, comprised 16% of total borrowings at 30 April 2008
(30 April 2007: 33%). 
The Group has a net investment in major overseas
subsidiary companies’ foreign currency assets and
liabilities, in particular those whose functional currency 
is the euro or the United States dollar. The Group’s policy 
is to hedge a large part of the resulting exposure to
movements in foreign currency rates, by means of debt in
the same currency, to a level determined by the Treasury
Committee. The overseas net assets hedged through euro
borrowings increased from 73% at 30 April 2007 to 85%
at 30 April 2008 as a proportion of the Group’s euro net
investment, as a result of the increase in euro borrowings.
The Group’s foreign currency debt may be put in place
either in the currency itself or through the use of cross-
currency swaps on differently denominated borrowings. 
The Group applies hedge accounting under IAS 39 to its
hedges of its net investment of foreign currency subsidiaries
and records exchange differences arising on the net
investments and the related foreign currency borrowings
directly in equity. In addition, the Group’s operations make
product sales and purchases of raw materials in foreign
currencies; here, cash ﬂow hedges are taken out to reduce
the risk associated with these transactions.
Critical Accounting Policies 
The Group’s accounting policies are set out in note 1 to the
ﬁnancial statements. The Group has identiﬁed the following
accounting policies, and the judgements involved in their
application, as being critical to understanding the results
and position of the Group:
� Impairment: when applying IAS 36, ‘Impairment of
Assets’, the Group compares the carrying amounts of
goodwill and intangible assets with the higher of their
net realisable value and their value-in-use to determine
whether an impairment exists. The value-in-use is
calculated by discounting the future cash ﬂows expected
to be generated by the assets or group of assets being
tested for impairment. The use of different estimates,
assumptions and judgements could result in a different
assessment of the value-in-use of the assets involved and,
consequently, result in the impairment of the assets
involved. In particular, such different assessments might
arise from the estimates, assumptions and judgements
involved in (a) determining a value based on our current
estimation of future conditions and the associated cash
from the Group’s operations and (b) our determination 
of the level at which groups of assets can reasonably be
tested for impairment separately from other parts of the
business. Note 10 to the ﬁnancial statements sets out
additional information regarding the Group’s annual
impairment exercise. 
� Pension and other post-retirement beneﬁts: IAS 19,
‘Employee Beneﬁts’, requires the Group to make
assumptions including, but not limited to, future asset
returns, rates of inﬂation, discount rates and current and
future life expectancies. The use of different assumptions
could have a material effect on the accounting values 
of the relevant assets and liabilities, which in turn could
result in a change to the cost of such liabilities as
recognised in the income statement over time. The
assumptions involved are subject to periodic review.
Note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements sets out additional
information regarding the Group’s pension and other
post-retirement beneﬁts. 
� Accounting for carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions: There
are currently no accounting standards that speciﬁcally
address accounting for emission allowances. The Group,
with the agreement of its auditors, has applied a ‘net
liability’ approach.
Under a ‘net liability’ approach, no assets or government
grants are recognised when allowances are initially
received. This is because they are ascribed a nominal
value of nil. As allowances granted to the Group 
are used to offset the liability from CO
2
emissions, no
accounting entries are required so long as the related
emissions generated are within the allowance received
from the government. If such emissions are in excess of
the allowance received (known as a shortfall position) 
a provision is made at the current market price for
carbon credits. In the case where emission quotas are
acquired through an acquisition, any surplus emission
quotas are fair valued in accordance with IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations’.
The likely effect of future changes in accounting 
standards and interpretations is also set out in note 1 
to the ﬁnancial statements.  30 www.dssmith.uk.com
Business Review
Financial Review continued
Pensions 
The Group operates one deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme 
in the UK and has some small, overseas arrangements. The
aggregate gross assets of the schemes at 30 April 2008
were £721.8 million and the gross liabilities at 30 April
2008, calculated under IAS 19, were £797.7 million,
resulting in the recognition of a gross balance sheet deﬁcit
of £75.9 million (30 April 2007: £18.6 million), a net
deﬁcit of £54.5 million (30 April 2007: £13.0 million) 
after the establishment of a deferred tax asset of £21.4
million (30 April 2007: £5.6 million). The increase of
£57.3 million in the gross deﬁcit was principally due to
changing the mortality assumptions for the UK scheme to
PMA92/PFA92 medium cohort, and reduced asset values.
In order to control the future costs and ﬁnancial obligations
of these schemes, the Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme is closed to new members. The lower current service
cost in 2007/08, £8.7 million compared with £9.4 million
in 2006/07, is principally due to reduced membership 
of the scheme. The Group’s agreed annual ﬁxed cash
contributions to the combined UK scheme were £14.6
million (2006/07: £14.6 million). The triennial valuation 
of the scheme as at 30 April 2007 will be ﬁnalised by 
31 July 2008.

Risk Management
The Group has further strengthened its procedures
for understanding and managing its signiﬁcant risks.
The procedures adopted by the Group to manage its key
risks, including environmental, social and governance risks,
and to comply with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee
are described in the Corporate Governance section on
pages 40 to 42. In April 2008, a Group Risks Committee
was established. This is comprised of the Group Chief
Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Human
Resources Director, the Company Secretary, the Divisional
Chief Executives and the Head of Operational Audit and
will meet at least four times a year to review the risks faced
by the Group and the adequacy and suitability of the
mitigation arrangements in place to manage those risks.
The Group’s exposure to individual risks is limited and
diversiﬁed by the fact that it has several distinct types of
activity, with 30 business sectors operating from over 100
sites in 20 different countries, and it sells to a broad range
of customers. Any signiﬁcant commercial and other risks 
that are speciﬁc to a business segment are described within
the narrative on that segment. The principal Group-wide key
risks and the way they are managed are described below.
The Group seeks to mitigate its insurable risks through an
insurance programme that covers property and liability 
risks where it is relevant and cost-effective to do so.
Movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
These risks and the way in which they are managed 
through the Group’s Treasury Committee and its subsidiary
committees or groups are described on pages 28 and 29. 
The funding position of the Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme and the consequent impact of any deﬁcit on
corporate activity 
The funding of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is
sensitive to a number of factors. The Group faces the risk
that this funding position will deteriorate over time, in
particular if actual longevity exceeds current assumptions
and investment returns are lower than expected. The Group
and the scheme’s trustee have sought to mitigate this risk
through the scheme’s investment strategy and through
having increased the contributions made to the scheme 
by both the members and the Group. The regulatory
environment for pension schemes and their trustees has
changed in recent years, in particular with the Pensions 
Act 2004: the presence of a deﬁcit in a scheme may now
oblige the trustee or possibly the Pensions Regulator to 
seek some further funding of the scheme in the event of 
a signiﬁcant corporate action or perceived decline in the
Group’s ﬁnancial covenant. 
The continuing availability of borrowing facilities, including
compliance with borrowing covenants 
The Group’s borrowing facilities and their management
through the Treasury Committee are described on pages 
28 and 29. 
Serious breaches of the law or other regulations 
The Group’s Key Corporate Values, which are described 
in more detail in the Corporate Responsibility Review 
on page 33 and are available in full at
www.dssmith.uk.com/pages/Policies.asp, on the Group’s
website, require all employees to comply with all relevant
laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate.
The Group recognises the risk that substantial ﬁnes, or other
penalties, may be imposed for non-compliance with laws
and regulations relating to competition, environmental,
health and safety or other matters, and has control
mechanisms, ongoing programmes and systems, and
special initiatives in place for monitoring compliance. It 
also carries out training programmes for employees and 
has systems in place to share expertise and best practice 
on these matters. The Group has a Workplace Malpractice
Policy, and a process for employees to report any suspected
wrongdoing in conﬁdence, that is in place across its
international operations where such reporting is 
permitted by law. 
Political instability 
Proﬁts from the Group’s wholly-owned operations are not
subject to any signiﬁcant degree of political risk as they 
are almost entirely located in countries which are members
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), members of which are committed 
to democratic government and the market economy. 
The Group’s adjusted after tax proﬁts from associated
undertakings, which totalled £3.4 million in 2007/08, 
are currently exposed to some political risk as they are
substantially derived from Rubezhansk, a paper and
corrugated packaging business located in Ukraine, a
country which has recently experienced political instability.
The Group’s ability to manage this risk is also lessened 
since it has inﬂuence, rather than control, over these
operations. The Group maintains a close relationship with
local management and regular visits are made to Ukraine
by Group executives to ensure a good understanding of 
the business and the context in which it is operating. 
Volatility and increasing energy prices 
The Group’s exposure to energy costs is described on page
28 and is being managed in a number of ways. The Group
is looking to maximise in-house energy generation from its
combined heat and power (CHP) plants in the UK and
France and a UK waste-to-energy plant, thereby taking
advantage of the greater efﬁciency of the CHP process. 
It is also investigating the potential for the use of renewable
or low-carbon energy sources, including refuse-derived fuel.
The Group continues to undertake a wide range of energy-
saving projects aimed at increasing its energy efﬁciency
and reducing its energy usage. In 2007/08, the Group
reduced its energy usage by 2% compared with 2006/07.
The Group maintains a centralised energy-purchasing
approach in the UK and France, which enables it to obtain
economies of scale in buying and to apply specialist
expertise, including the application of hedging techniques.
Regulatory developments in the energy market are monitored
and the Group collaborates, when appropriate, with other
heavy energy users in the paper and other industry sectors
to inﬂuence government on energy policy and the operation
of energy markets.  32 www.dssmith.uk.com

Increasing costs in the medium-term related 
to climate change and carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions
As a result of its substantial energy usage, the Group is
likely, in the medium-term, to be increasingly subject to
regulation and taxation of its CO
2
emissions. The details 
of this and the actions being taken to reduce the Group’s
future energy usage and CO

the Corporate Responsibility Review on page 35 and in the
statement of the Group’s strategy for managing its energy

Changes in packaging demand as a result 
of environmental concerns 
The continuing concerns of consumers, retailers and
government about conservation of resources and waste
reduction may result in lower total usage of packaging 
or changes in the pattern of demand for certain types of
packaging. The positive role that most packaging plays
in contributing to reducing total waste in the supply chain
and the actions that the Group’s packaging businesses 
have been taking for a number of years to minimise the 
use of resources, are described in the Packaging and the
Environment section of the Corporate Responsibility Review
on pages 34 and 35. Our packaging businesses work 
with the other members of their product supply chains to
minimise the total environmental impact of the production,
distribution, use and disposal of goods. Severnside
Recycling, the Group’s UK waste collection business works
closely with DS Smith Packaging, our UK box business, in
marketing our cradle-to-cradle environmental capability
which encompasses: the Group’s expertise in designing
packaging that will minimise waste throughout the supply
chain; the environmental beneﬁts of the recyclability of
corrugated packaging; and Severnside’s capability for
managing customers’ entire waste recycling and disposal
needs. The Group also collaborates with other companies
which produce, specify or use packaging to increase the
understanding of government and other opinion-formers of
the positive role packaging does, and can in the future, play 
in achieving more sustainable consumption. 
Volatility of pricing and availability of globally traded 
raw materials 
In 2007/08, the Group purchased approximately £100
million of waste paper and approximately £85 million 
of polymers and ﬁlms as the principal raw materials in its
Paper and Plastic Packaging businesses, respectively. These
products are globally traded and subject to variations in
supply and demand which result in volatility in their pricing.
The Group endeavours to recover any raw material cost
increases through good material usage programmes and
through price rises. Approximately one-third of the Group’s
corrugated and plastic packaging customer contracts
include arrangements to link selling prices to an index of
raw material prices. The achievement of price increases 
for the majority of our Packaging business is substantially
determined by the state of supply and demand in the
relevant market at any time. Due to the variety of contractual
arrangements with customers, margins may be squeezed 
for a period of time until price increases are achieved to
recover input cost increases. 
The Group’s Severnside Recycling business collects and
trades waste paper to ensure a continuous cost-competitive
supply to the Group’s paper mills. It achieves this through
long-term contracts with major suppliers of waste paper 
and the collection of waste from smaller suppliers through 
its network of collection depots. 
Of the Group’s total polymer and ﬁlm purchases in
2007/08, polycarbonate, polypropylene and high density
polyethylene accounted for approximately 50% with the
remainder comprising a large number of different polymers
and ﬁlms. The Group has developed a good level of
knowledge in polymer purchasing and uses a number of
suppliers to ensure it is purchasing at competitive prices. 
Product liability 
The Group’s packaging products, many of which are
supplied into the food and beverage industries, may give
rise to potentially substantial product liability claims in the
event of a failure of the packaging to perform its function
when in use or from contamination of the product by its
packaging. The potential for such claims is reduced by the
fact that the majority of the Group’s packaging is used as
secondary, or transit, packaging and does not come into
direct contact with the products it ultimately protects. The
Group takes all reasonable steps to ensure the safety and
adequate performance levels of its packaging through
design, manufacturing control processes, technical testing
and other means while having appropriate product liability
insurances in place. It also looks to minimise its product
liability risk through its relevant terms and conditions 
of trading. 
Other social and environmental matters 
The Group’s management of other social and environmental
risks is described in the Corporate Responsibility Review on

Corporate Responsibility Review
Safety at work is our highest priority.
Our Principles and Approach to 
Corporate Responsibility 
DS Smith is committed to providing good sustainable returns
for its investors while maintaining high standards in the 
way we conduct our business. The Group has over 11,500
employees working at over 100 locations worldwide. Our
primary consideration is the safety of everyone involved
with our operations. We also place considerable emphasis
on fulﬁlling our responsibilities towards the environment 
and on the way we interact with our employees and local
communities. This review presents information on these 
high priority aspects of corporate responsibility (CR) 
for the Group.
The Board considers risks to the Group’s short- and long-
term value arising from CR matters as part of its regular
review of the key risks to the Group’s operations. It ensures
that the Group has in place effective policies and systems
for managing any signiﬁcant CR risks and it receives regular
reports on performance. The Group Chief Executive is the
Director responsible for CR matters and he reports to the
Board on these. It is the responsibility of the Divisional 
Chief Executives and General Managers of the individual
businesses to communicate and to apply the policies, 
to ensure compliance and to review procedures, taking
account of local legislation and potential risks. Divisional
Chief Executives are required annually to attest that the
companies for which they are responsible have complied
with relevant Group and divisional policies. 
The way in which we require our people and businesses 
to operate is deﬁned in the Group’s Key Corporate Values,
which, in summary, stipulate that all employees will at all
times act ethically and with integrity, treat their colleagues
fairly, equitably and with respect, work safely and protect
the environment. The Key Corporate Values statement is
reinforced by more detailed policies on health and safety,
the environment and other relevant topics; these documents
may be viewed on the Group’s website at:
www.dssmith.uk.com/pages/Policies.asp. The Group has 
a Workplace Malpractice Policy, under which employees
may report in conﬁdence any perceived wrongdoing within
the Group on matters relating to safety, the environment,
unethical business conduct or breaches of Group policies,
the law or other regulations. This policy is reinforced by 
a conﬁdential Employee Concern Helpline and e-mail
facility which is progressively being made available to our
employees worldwide as local legal and regulatory issues
are resolved; to date it has been extended to over 70% of
our employees, located in nine countries. Any concerns
reported are appropriately investigated.
DS Smith has been selected as a constituent of the
FTSE4Good UK Index of companies deemed to meet
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards. 
DS Smith is also a constituent of the Kempen/SNS Smaller
Europe SRI Index for smaller companies deemed to have
high social responsibility standards and practice. 
Health and Safety 
DS Smith is committed to the protection and safety of its staff
and others affected by its operations. Being our top priority,
safety at work is the ﬁrst ﬁxed agenda item at all main
Board, executive committee and divisional review meetings.
Providing a safe workplace and ensuring safe working
practices are not only legal and ethical responsibilities for
the Group but are also essential factors in achieving our
aims of attracting and retaining a high-quality and well-
motivated workforce and in carrying out our operations
productively and cost-effectively. 
We give particular attention to communicating with our
people about the importance of safety at work and involving
them closely in initiatives aimed at ﬁnding ways to improve
safety on our sites. Our campaign, launched in autumn
2006, under the slogan ‘think safe… be safe!’ continues to
be a central feature of our drive to raise further employees’
awareness of their individual responsibilities for preventing
accidents. The core theme has been reinforced and
developed through supplementary Group-wide initiatives,
including a multi-media campaign which highlighted ways
to prevent injuries from trips or falls. The core campaign
material, translated where necessary into the local
languages, is used throughout our operations worldwide 
as a basis for introducing safety programmes which
concentrate on the safety issues which are most relevant 
to each business. 
Information on safety performance, including statistics
related to our key performance indicators (KPIs), is reported
to the Board quarterly. Our divisions set improvement
targets against the KPIs, which reﬂect the nature of their
business and their previous performance. In 2007/08,  
our continuing emphasis on safety was reﬂected in a 7%
reduction in the number of accidents that resulted in one
shift or more of working time being lost and a 6% reduction
in the accident frequency rate, which measures all accidents
in proportion to the number of hours worked. Despite these
improvements, there was an increase, for the second year 
in succession, in the accident severity rate, which measures
the hours lost as a result of all accidents as a percentage of
the total hours worked. The 4% increase in this measurement
in 2007/08 reﬂects a combination of a small number of
serious accidents, which resulted in employees being unable
to work for extended periods, and a larger number of
relatively minor accidents, after which employees took a
longer time to return to work; we are addressing the underlying
reasons for the latter type of absences from work.
Our businesses use information on the performance of other
Group businesses and external health and safety statistics 
to benchmark their performance and to identify areas 
for increased attention. Site health and safety audits by
internal specialists and external consultants are also used to
measure performance and highlight areas for improvement.
Investigations are carried out of all accidents and situations
that might have resulted in accidents to ensure that we learn

Business Review
Corporate Responsibility Review continued
from these incidents and prevent recurrence. Our businesses
undertake extensive programmes of employee training,
focusing particularly on the major, or most frequent, risks 
in their operations. Training in risk assessment and root-
cause analysis features strongly in health and safety 
training programmes.
Environment
Protecting the environment is an important feature of 
DS Smith’s business. We continually seek to reduce the
impact of our own operations on the environment and 
to contribute to reducing energy usage, greenhouse 
gas emissions and waste throughout our supply chains.
Signiﬁcantly, the Group makes a major contribution to
conserving resources and reducing landﬁll waste through 
its leading positions in recycling in the UK. Our Packaging
products are made from recycled raw materials wherever 
it is practicable and 72% of the paper, polymers and ﬁlms
used to produce them in 2007/08 were recycled material.
Our Packaging businesses use their expertise in packaging
design to assist customers and retailers in optimising the 
use of resources and reducing waste in their supply chains.
In corrugated packaging, which is fully recyclable, we are
at the forefront of the trend to use lightweight paper to lower
the weight of packaging used. Spicers offers its customers
an increasingly large selection of products which are made
from recycled materials, are recyclable or have other
environmentally beneﬁcial features. We continue to carry
out work to evaluate not only the carbon footprint of our
own packaging products but to understand better the role 
of our packaging in the total lifecycle of the product for
which it is used. 
Recycling
The Group’s operations make a major contribution to 
the corrugated packaging recycling process. In the UK,
Severnside Recycling is the largest collector of waste paper
and also collects other materials for recycling. It sources
waste from major supermarkets, other retailers and
industrial operations and is providing the waste collection
services for Tesco plc’s front-of-store automated recycling
centres which are being located at an increasing number 
of its stores. All of the paper produced by the Group is
made from recycled waste paper. St Regis is the UK’s
leading recycler of packaging waste and largest producer
of recycled paper, while DS Smith Kaysersberg is a
signiﬁcant recycler of waste paper in France; in total 
the Group recycled 1.3 million tonnes of paper in
2007/08. 75% of the paper used by the Group’s
corrugated packaging operations in 2007/08 was 100%
recycled paper and a further 3% was paper made from a
mixture of recycled and virgin wood pulp. The other 22% 
of the paper used was made from 100% virgin wood pulp;
it has particular strength and appearance characteristics
which certain customers require for their packaging and 
it is sourced from producers who obtain their wood pulp
from sustainable forestry sources. 
The Group’s paper collection and recycling operations play
an important role in meeting the EU and UK government
objectives for recycling of packaging waste, as prescribed
in the EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive and
the UK Packaging Waste Regulations. Under the Directive,
the UK is required to recycle at least 60% of all paper
packaging by 2008; it is already well ahead of this target,
with 78% of paper packaging being recycled in 2006, and
DS Smith is the largest contributor to this reprocessing. 
Packaging and the environment 
The conservation of resources and the lowering of the
amount of waste being disposed of in landﬁll are important
aspects of caring for our environment. As a result of this,
there is increasing pressure from society and government 
to reduce the overall quantity of packaging in use and 
to increase the proportion of packaging that is recycled. 
The Group recognises its responsibility to contribute to 
the conservation of resources and we are fulﬁlling this
responsibility through both the provision of packaging
products which enable our customers to meet their
environmental objectives and the development of our
recycling services. 
Although packaging receives a lot of attention in the media,
it plays an important part in making modern lifestyles
possible and its signiﬁcance should be seen in perspective.
Packaging is just one, often relatively minor, aspect of the
total environmental impact of a product; ten times more
energy goes into the production of the food and goods 
that it contains than into the packaging itself. In the UK,
packaging of all types accounts for less than 5% of total
landﬁll waste and approximately 20% of household dustbin
waste
1
; approximately 60% of the packaging of all types
used in the UK is recycled
2
. 
Our packaging businesses work with their customers to
develop packaging of the optimum speciﬁcation for the
required end-use. Most packaging performs the valuable
functions of protecting products, reducing product wastage,
enabling more efﬁcient and lower-cost handling and
transportation and, in many cases, contributes to lowering
the environmental impact of the supply of goods. The 
choice of the most appropriate packaging material and
pack design for a particular product depends upon a 
wide range of factors including the nature of the product
itself, how the total supply chain for the product operates
and the requirements of retailers and consumers. 
Corrugated packaging, the Group’s principal packaging
product, is 100% recyclable and in the UK over 80% of all
corrugated packaging is recycled
3
. Although corrugated
packaging is not generally re-used, it is a fully recyclable
packaging material that is produced predominantly from
recycled paper in what is essentially a loop system, which 
is described in more detail on page 19. Used corrugated
boxes are recycled into paper; this paper is converted into
boxes which are packed with goods; retailers or consumers
discard the used boxes which are then collected for
recycling and delivered to the paper mill to be turned into
paper once again. Corrugated products are playing an
increasingly important role in the pursuit of sustainable,
environmentally-friendly packaging. The Group has been at
the forefront of the trend to lower the weight of corrugated
packaging used through the use of lightweight paper and
improved box design. DS Smith Packaging’s PackRight tool
enables all the factors relating to a particular pack to be
analysed and in many instances our design and technical
expertise enables the customer to reduce the weight of raw

readily recycled into paper
and then into new boxes. 
The ﬁbres in corrugated

materials used in a pack as well as to pack the goods more
efﬁciently; this reduces transport costs and thereby the
carbon emissions per unit. 
In circumstances where packaging is designed to be re-used
many times, plastic returnable transit packaging may be
required by customers if the packaging can be readily
recovered, transported and cleaned for re-use. Plastic bag-
in-box packaging is increasingly being used to contain
liquids in bulk as well as for consumer use. It has signiﬁcant
beneﬁts for storing and transporting beverages and other
liquids hygienically and securely, and can substantially
extend the storage life of products, thus reducing product
wastage. Bag-in-box packs use space efﬁciently and are
relatively light-weight compared with bottles or drums so
they may reduce the overall energy usage in the supply
chain because they can be transported and stored more
efﬁciently. Plastic materials may be more difﬁcult to recycle
than some other materials, due to the large variety of
polymers in use, the practicalities of separate collection and
processing, contamination from contact with food and other
technical considerations. Wherever it is appropriate, our
Plastic Packaging businesses use recycled materials and, in
2007/08, 12% of the polymer and ﬁlm raw material they
used was recycled. 
Our Packaging businesses continue to carry out work to
evaluate the carbon footprint of their products. This work 
is enabling us to collaborate with other companies in our
supply chain on analyses of the total environmental impact
of products that use our packaging. DS Smith Packaging
and Severnside Recycling are working together to help
large supermarket chains and other businesses to reduce 
the amount of waste they send to landﬁll and improve their
environmental performance with regard to packaging. 
Environmental management and regulation
The environmental performance and activities of the
divisions are reviewed at the Group Environment
Committee, which meets three times a year and is chaired
by the Group Chief Executive. Under the terms of the
Group’s Environment Policy, which may be viewed on 
the Group’s website, each of our sites is required to
implement an environmental management system (EMS)
which is appropriate to its activity. Of our total operations,
35 have been identiﬁed as having higher potential
environmental impact, due to their size or type of activity;
34 of these are accredited under the internationally
recognised ISO 14001 EMS standard and the one
remaining operation is in the process of working towards
this standard. The Group’s other 62 operations, which are
required to have in place a simpliﬁed EMS, appropriate 
to their lower level of potential environmental impact, 
review and improve these systems regularly, often with 
the assistance of external auditors. As part of their EMS, 
many Group businesses have procedures in place for
assessing their suppliers’ environmental policies and
management systems, as appropriate. 
The Group had a number of minor environmental incidents
during the year, following which prompt corrective action
and steps to prevent any recurrence were taken and, where
necessary, the appropriate agencies were informed. The
circumstances surrounding all environmental incidents 
are investigated immediately and, when appropriate, the
ﬁndings and lessons learnt are communicated throughout
the Group as part of our drive to reduce such incidents. The
Environment Agency is investigating possible procedural
breaches of the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC)
permit at St Regis Higher Kings Mill; an independent
investigation has indicated that these breaches did not 
result in any signiﬁcant environmental impact. 
The Group’s paper manufacturing operations account for
over 80% of the Group’s environmental impact, particularly
because their manufacturing process uses large quantities 
of energy and water. The UK paper mills are regulated
through PPC permits under which they each have speciﬁc
improvement programmes and targets; St Regis’ overall
compliance with its environmental permits, which now
include those under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU
ETS), was 98.4% in 2007/08. St Regis is a key participant
in the UK paper sector Climate Change Levy (CCL)
Agreement with the Department of Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs under which the industry has undertaken to
achieve energy consumption reduction targets. St Regis met
its target for the year to September 2007 and is on course
to meet its next target for the year to September 2008.
The Group’s UK and French paper operations are subject 
to the terms of their respective national schemes for
implementing the EU Emissions Trading Directive. Under 
the terms of the UK scheme, our UK mills opted out of the
ﬁrst phase of EU ETS as they are participants in the UK
paper sector CCL Agreement; they are now subject to the
second phase of EU ETS, which commenced in January
2008. During EU ETS Phase 1, our French paper mills had
an emissions allocation in excess of their actual emissions,
due to our investment in a combined heat and power (CHP)
facility. We expect the Group’s emissions allocations and
our actual emissions during EU ETS Phase 2 to be broadly
in balance. The effects of subsequent phases from 2013
onwards are likely to be more onerous, being dependent
upon the details of the emissions allocations and the market
price of carbon under future phases of the scheme. 
Environmental performance 
Our businesses undertook, in the course of 2007/08, a
wide range of projects, involving investment and changes in
operating practices, aimed at reducing their environmental
impact. The Group’s overall performance in 2007/08 is
reﬂected in the environmental performance indicators shown
in the adjacent table. A fuller report on our environmental
performance is available in the Corporate Responsibility
section of our website. 
The Group consumed 2% less energy in 2007/08 compared
with the previous year, principally as a result of the closure
of Taplow Mill in October 2006. Energy usage per £’000
of revenue was 12% lower. Excluding the effect of the paper
mill closure, energy usage increased by 1%, principally
reﬂecting increased production at our continuing UK 
paper mills. The Group’s paper mills improved their 
energy efﬁciency and reduced the energy usage per 
tonne of paper produced by 2%.
Our two largest paper mills, at Kemsley in the UK and
Kaysersberg in France, which account for approximately
65% of the Group’s energy usage, have on-site CHP plants.

Methodology: The Group is working towards collecting and reporting its environmental data in accordance with the guidelines speciﬁed by the Global Reporting
Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP), to the extent that this is currently practicable. The ﬁgures relate to all of the Group’s wholly owned or
majority-owned operations. Data on other aspects of the Group’s environmental performance are provided on the Group’s website. 
1 Energy ﬁgures relate to usage of all fuels, including diesel for freight transport.
2 CO
2
emissions have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, including for freight transport. As required by the GHGP, Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO
2
emissions are
reported separately. Scope 1 (direct) emissions are those arising from combustion of fuel in installations or vehicles owned by the Group; Scope 2 (indirect) emissions
are those arising from bought-in energy (i.e. electricity or steam) where the combustion has been carried out by another company. The 2007/08 Scope 1 emissions
included 18,000 tonnes (2006/07: 18,000 tonnes) of CO
2
which were associated with the production of electricity which was sold to the grid from one of our 
CHP plants. 
3 Waste ﬁgures relate to waste generated by our operations; waste recycled includes recycling through agricultural use as landspread and energy recovery at our
waste-to-energy plant.
Environmental Performance Indicators
These CHP facilities provide energy more efﬁciently, with
lower carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions and at signiﬁcantly
lower cost than if it were to be sourced from the external
grid. In addition, Kemsley Mill recycles, in the form of
energy recovery, a substantial proportion of the reject
material, such as plastic and polystyrene, which enters 
its process mixed in with the waste paper and is separated
out during paper manufacture; the mill’s own waste-to-
energy plant efﬁciently recovers the energy to produce
steam for use in the mill’s operations. We continue to
investigate the potential for using alternative energy 
sources, including refuse-derived fuel, particularly for 
our paper manufacturing operations. 
DS Smith Packaging became the ﬁrst UK corrugated
packaging producer to be accredited under the UK’s 
Energy Efﬁciency Accreditation Scheme, in recognition of 
its energy efﬁciency, approach to energy management and
achievements in reducing energy consumption; the scheme
is independently assessed by the Energy Institute on behalf
of The Carbon Trust.
The Group’s lower energy usage in 2007/08 resulted in 
a 2% reduction in total emissions of CO
2
. There was a 
small change in the balance between direct (Scope 1) and
indirect (Scope 2) CO
2
emissions due to a variation in the
mix of energy sources used. The Group’s total water usage
was 3% lower than in 2006/07. We reduced the total
amount of waste generated by our businesses by 12% and
the quantity of waste sent to landﬁll by 5%. As a result of
the reduction in the total waste being principally due to 
the elimination of types of waste that had previously been
recycled, the proportion of our waste that was recycled fell
by one percentage point to 83%.
Employees
We aim to create a working environment which will attract,
retain and motivate good people, and enable them to fulﬁl
their potential. The Group ensures that the divisions have 
in place appropriate structures, procedures and resources 
to implement the employee-related aspects of the Group’s
Key Corporate Values, which include: providing fair
opportunities for employment to all; treating everyone  DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 37
with dignity and respect; not tolerating any form of
harassment or discrimination; ensuring advancement is
based on merit; and providing appropriate training and 
development opportunities. 
The Group is committed to applying equal opportunities 
in all recruitment and employment practices. It is also
committed, as a minimum, to meeting the labour rights 
and legislation requirements in each of the countries in
which it operates; in practice the Group often exceeds 
the local and international requirements. As DS Smith’s
operations are almost entirely located in member countries
of the OECD, human rights matters are not perceived as 
a signiﬁcant Group risk. 
The annual turnover rate in the Group’s workforce
worldwide of 9% (2006/07: 11%) compares favourably
with the UK national average of 18.1%
4
. Recruitment and
retention of employees is not a signiﬁcant issue for most of
the Group’s operations but the situation varies depending
upon the alternative employment opportunities in any
particular location and the skills required. In common 
with many other employers, a number of our businesses
experience difﬁculty in recruiting high-calibre engineers 
and engineering managers; we have started addressing 
this through the increased provision of apprenticeships and
graduate sponsorships. A number of sponsored engineering
and information technology students are now working
within the Group.
Our divisions and businesses communicate with, and
consult, their people through newsletters, intranets, brieﬁng
meetings, local works councils, national employee forums
and a European Works Council. Employee surveys have
been carried out in certain parts of the Group. Generally
the results of these have been positive; where particular
issues have been highlighted action has been taken to
address these.
Regrettably, following a detailed strategic review of our
European liquid packaging and dispensing operation, we
proposed, during 2007, the closure of our Düren factory 
in Germany. Following consultation with the employees 
and their representatives it has been agreed that the Düren
site will close in April 2009 and its operations will be
transferred to other Group sites in Germany and the UK. 
In accordance with our usual approach to such situations,
we are endeavouring to minimise the number of compulsory
redundancies and are offering employees the opportunity 
to transfer to the other Group sites. In the case of those
employees who decide not to transfer we are making every
effort to assist them in ﬁnding alternative positions with 
other employers, including offering training and support. 
Training and development programmes are carried out 
by the Group’s businesses to meet their speciﬁc needs for
raising operational performance and career development.
The individual training needs of employees are met through
a variety of schemes including: management development
programmes, which in some cases involve external
accreditation; support for study for external vocational and
professional qualiﬁcations; and e-learning programmes. A
number of senior managers are participating in coaching
and mentoring programmes using both internal and 
external resources.
Community Involvement
We seek to develop and maintain good relations in 
the local communities in which we operate. As well as
providing signiﬁcant employment opportunities, we aim 
to make positive contributions to these communities and
build a reputation as a good neighbour and employer.
Our businesses work closely with local schools and colleges
providing training, mentoring, work experience placements
and other opportunities for pupils to learn about industry
and business. The Group is involved in a wide range of
other local community activities including sponsorship of
community projects or sports teams and provision of adult
skills training. Our businesses participate in liaison groups
with local residents, particularly at locations where there 
is a need to review ways in which we can reduce any
inconvenience to neighbours from our operations as a result
of trafﬁc movements, odour or noise. Some sites hold open
days to foster relationships with their local communities. 
The Group supports charitable fund-raising activities through
cash contributions and in the form of products and services
or staff time. The majority of the modest amount of money
donated by the Group is given by individual operating
units, principally to good causes in their local communities.
Donations by the Group headquarters are principally
focused on helping young disadvantaged people become
involved in business and working life.

Member of Remuneration Committee
# Member of Audit Committee The Company is committed to the principle and application of sound
corporate governance.
The Company has complied throughout the ﬁnancial year with all the
provisions of the Code of Best Practice set out in Section 1 of the FRC
Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in June 2006. The 
Board has an ongoing review of its corporate governance policy. Further
explanation of how the principles and supporting principles have been
applied is set out below and in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The
Company’s Auditors have reviewed the compliance with those provisions 
of the Combined Code speciﬁed for their review.
Board and Board Committees
The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting the success of the
Company by directing and supervising the Company’s affairs. The Board’s
role is to provide leadership of the Company within a framework of prudent
and effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and managed. 
The Board sets the Company’s strategic aims, ensures that the necessary
ﬁnancial and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its
objectives, and reviews management performance. 
In addition, the Board sets the Company’s values and standards and
ensures that its obligations to its shareholders and others are understood
and met. 
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, two Executive and ﬁve 
Non-Executive Directors. The ofﬁces of Chairman and Group Chief
Executive are held separately. Mr R G Beeston is the Senior Independent
Director. During the year each of the Non-Executive Directors has at all
times acted independently of management and has no relationships which
would materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement
and decision making. 
The Board meets a minimum of eight times per year. During the year under
review it met eight times. All Board members attend all Board and relevant
Committee meetings unless exceptional circumstances prevent them from
attending. During the year Mr R E C Marton did not attend the Audit
Committee meeting held in June 2007 and the Nomination Committee
meeting held in March 2008 and Mr P J-C Mellier did not attend the
additional Remuneration Committee meeting held in April 2008. There 
were no other absences from any Board or Committee meetings by any
Director. In addition to formal Board meetings, the Chairman and Group
Chief Executive maintain regular contact with all Directors and hold 
informal meetings with Non-Executive Directors to discuss issues affecting
the Company. Once a year the Board visits a business unit and receives a
presentation from local management. Individual Directors are encouraged 
to make additional site visits during the year. The Board continually reviews
the performance of all of the divisions and undertakes a strategic review 
on an annual basis. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for
consideration and approval for the Board. These include the annual Plan,
substantial acquisitions and disposals, the approval of the annual and
interim results and a review of the overall system of internal control and 
risk management. 
The Board and its Committees, as detailed below, receive timely 
information of a quality that enables them to carry out their roles effectively.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary. A procedure is in place for any Director to take independent
professional advice in the furtherance of his duties at the Company’s
expense. No such advice was sought by any Director during the year. 
The Directors are provided with opportunities for training to ensure that 
they are kept up-to-date on relevant new legislation and changing
commercial risks. On appointment, new Directors are given appropriate
induction training, including site visits to major business units. During the
year the Board carried out a comprehensive self-appraisal which was led 
by the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director. The Board concluded
that the review process showed that the Board and its Committees operated
effectively. The review resulted in a Board paper and an action plan aimed
at further enhancing the effectiveness of the Board. The review comprised
feedback from a questionnaire and individual discussions. The appraisal
included the performance of Board Committees, although a separate and
more detailed appraisal of the Audit Committee was also carried out during
the year. All Directors and the Company Secretary participated in the
exercise. The Board intends to use external support for the review process
on a periodic basis to give a degree of independence to the process. The
Non-Executive Directors meet separately at least once a year to appraise
the Chairman’s performance.
Board Committees
The principal Committees of the Board are the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. The Audit and Remuneration Committees 
comprise independent Non-Executive Directors. The Nomination Committee 
comprises a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors. All Board
Committees have written terms of reference agreed by the Board. These 
are available on the Company’s website. The Audit Committee is chaired 
by Mr C J Bunker, the Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Beeston
and the Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr P M Johnson. The
membership of each Committee and the experience of its members can 
be seen on page 39. The Board has used the criteria proposed by the
National Association of Pension Funds for determining whether a 
Non-Executive Director is independent.
Audit Committee
In addition to the Committee members listed on page 39, the Chairman, 
the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Head of
Operational Audit and the Group Financial Controller attended parts of
each meeting by invitation. Mr G M B Adams became a member of the
Committee with effect from his appointment to the Board. The Board is
satisﬁed that Mr Bunker has both current and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, which meets at least three
times a year, include all the matters indicated by the Combined Code
except the oversight of business risks which is the direct responsibility of 
the Board. The primary objective of the Audit Committee is to assist the
Board in fulﬁlling its responsibilities relating to:
• the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the 
Group’s accounts;
• external ﬁnancial reporting and associated announcements; 
• the appointment, independence, effectiveness and remuneration 
of the Group’s Auditors; 
• the resourcing, plans and effectiveness of the Operational Audit
department; 
• the adequacy and effectiveness of the ﬁnancial control environment; and 
• the Group’s compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance. 
The Committee receives and reviews regular reports from the external
Auditors, the Head of Operational Audit and the Group Finance Director. 
The Committee meets with the external Auditors to determine their
independence, objectivity and effectiveness. The Audit Committee receives
written conﬁrmation from the external Auditors as to any relationships 
that might have a bearing on their independence, whether they consider
themselves independent within the meaning of the UK regulatory and
professional requirements, and their quality control processes. 
Corporate Governance 
40 www.dssmith.uk.com
Governance The Committee’s policy on the supply of non-audit services by external
auditors is as follows. The external Auditors are permitted to undertake
some non-audit services, for example advisory services and due diligence
activities associated with potential acquisitions and disposals and major
changes in accounting regulations. Non-audit services and fees are
reported to the Audit Committee twice a year. For guidance, annual non-
audit fees payable to the external Auditors should not exceed 75% of the
annual Group audit fee without prior formal approval of the Committee:
during 2007/08, non-audit fees were less than 10% of the annual Group
audit fee. Approval for permitted non-audit services is sought as required 
by this Group policy which speciﬁes that individual projects which would
cost over £100,000 must be referred to the Chairman of the Committee 
for prior approval. 
During the year the Committee met on three occasions. Mr Marton was
unable to attend the meeting held in June 2007, but otherwise there were
no absences. On each of these occasions the Committee also met privately
with both the external Auditors and the Head of Operational Audit. The
Chairman of the Audit Committee also held separate private meetings
during the year with the external Auditors, the Head of Operational 
Audit and the Group Finance Director.
In addition to its regular business, during the year the Committee dealt 
with the following particular matters:
• it considered progress on revisions to certain elements of the Group’s
internal controls procedures; 
• it carried out an appraisal of the effectiveness of the Audit Committee,
the external Auditors and Operational Audit, the results of which were
reported to the Board. The Committee concluded that each area
operated satisfactorily during the year; and
• it oversaw the continuing development and the operation of the Group’s
Workplace Malpractice Policy.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee considers the appointment of Directors, 
reviews succession planning at Board level and makes recommendations 
to the Board as a whole. A rigorous process is in place for the appointment
of new Directors, involving the use of external recruitment consultants, 
where appropriate, followed by meetings both with the Committee and 
then with the Board. The Committee met three times during the year. 
Mr Marton did not attend the meeting in March 2008, but otherwise 
there were no absences.
Remuneration Committee
The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive attend these meetings 
by invitation, except when their remuneration is being discussed. The
Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary and
for advising on the remuneration of senior management. The Remuneration
Report is set out on pages 43 to 50. During the year the Committee met 
six times. Mr Mellier did not attend the additional meeting to the normal
timetable in April 2008, but otherwise there were no absences. 
Other Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain powers, mainly of a routine nature, to 
the General Purposes Committee, which comprises the Group Chief
Executive and the Group Finance Director under the chairmanship of the
Group Chief Executive.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company has a programme of regular meetings (which sometimes
includes the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director), site visits 
and results brieﬁngs with its major institutional shareholders, which provides
opportunities to discuss the progress of the business. The Board also
receives feedback from major shareholders in the form of independently
prepared reports. The Annual General Meeting is used as an opportunity 
to communicate with private shareholders, including a short presentation 
on the business and current trading position as well as an opportunity for
questions from investors to the Chairman of the Board and the chairmen 
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. Regular communication with
shareholders also takes place through the annual and interim reports and
via the Company’s website www.dssmith.uk.com.
Internal Control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system, however, can 
only be designed to manage rather than to eliminate risk and can therefore
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. In accordance with the Turnbull Committee guidance,
the Company established the procedures necessary to ensure that there is
an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant
risks to the Group. These procedures have been in place for the whole of
the ﬁnancial year ended 30 April 2008 and up to the date of the approval
of these ﬁnancial statements and they are reviewed regularly. With effect
from April 2008 a Group Risks Committee was established, comprised of 
the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Human
Resources Director, the Company Secretary, the Divisional Chief Executives
and the Head of Operational Audit. This Committee will meet at least four
times a year to review the risks faced by the Group and the adequacy and
suitability of the mitigation arrangements in place to manage those risks.
The Board determines the objectives and broad policies of the Group. It
meets regularly and there is a schedule of matters which are required to 
be brought to it for decision. The Board has delegated to management the
responsibility for establishing a system of internal control appropriate to the
business environments in which the Group operates. Key elements of this
system include:
• a set of Key Corporate Values which have been communicated to 
all employees;
• a clearly deﬁned divisionalised organisation structure for monitoring 
the conduct and operations of individual business units;
• clear delegation of authority throughout the Group, starting with the
matters reserved for the Board;
• a formal process for ensuring that key risks affecting all the Group’s
operations are identiﬁed and assessed on a regular basis, together 
with the controls in place to mitigate these risks. Risk consideration is
embedded in decision-making processes. The most signiﬁcant risks are
periodically reported to the Board and considered by it;
• the preparation and review of comprehensive annual divisional and
Group budgets and an annual review and approval by the Board of 
the corporate strategy;
• the monthly reporting of actual results and their review against budget,
forecasts and the previous year, with explanations obtained for all
signiﬁcant variances;
• clearly deﬁned policies for capital expenditure and investment, including
appropriate authorisation levels, with larger capital projects, acquisitions
and disposals requiring Board approval;
• procedures manuals laying down common control procedures and
policies to apply throughout the Group; and
• formal quarterly meetings between central and divisional management 
to discuss strategic, operational and ﬁnancial issues.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 41 The Group’s Operational Audit function undertakes regular reviews of the
Group’s operations and their systems of internal ﬁnancial control. The work
of the function is overseen by the Audit Committee, which regularly reviews
its plans and activities. The Directors can conﬁrm that they have reviewed
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. This included a
process of self-certiﬁcation by senior divisional management in which they
are asked to conﬁrm that their divisions have complied with Group policies
and procedures and to report any signiﬁcant control weaknesses identiﬁed
during the past year. It also involved reviewing the results of the work of 
the Group’s Operational Audit function and the risk identiﬁcation and
management processes identiﬁed above.
Going Concern
The Directors are required under the Combined Code to have satisﬁed
themselves as to the Group’s ability to continue in existence for the
foreseeable future. A review has been carried out and the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason,
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial
statements on pages 56 to 104.

Governance In accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,
shareholders’ approval of the Remuneration Report will be sought at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). The Remuneration Report
has been approved by the Board of Directors.
(a) Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee 
(‘the Committee’) 
The Committee consists entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors. The
members of the Committee are Mr R G Beeston (Chairman), Mr C J Bunker,
Mr R E C Marton and Mr P J-C Mellier. The members of the Committee have
no personal ﬁnancial interest, other than as shareholders of the Company,
in the matters to be decided by the Committee, no potential conﬂicts of
interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in
running the business. 
The Committee operates under written terms of reference agreed by the
Board and is responsible for determining the remuneration of Executive
Directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary. It also considers the
remuneration of senior executives reporting to the Group Chief Executive
(taking into account recommendations from him) and the incentives of 
senior executives. 
(b) Compliance 
The Board, in conjunction with the Committee, has taken the necessary 
steps to ensure that the Company complies with the provisions of the
Combined Code (the ‘Code’), which relate to Directors’ remuneration.
Certain disclosures in this Report fall within the scope of matters for 
review by the Auditors. 
(c) Advisers to the Committee 
Hewitt New Bridge Street has been appointed by the Committee to 
provide advice on the remuneration of Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. Hewitt New Bridge Street also provides advice to 
the Company in connection with the operation of the Company’s share
schemes. The Committee consults with the Chairman of the Company 
and with the Group Chief Executive, who may attend a meeting of the
Committee on matters which do not directly affect them, although they 
are not involved in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee is
assisted by the Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources
Director, and also receives advice from Mercer Limited, the Actuary to the
Company’s pension scheme, in relation to Executive Directors’ pensions.
(d) General policy on remuneration 
The Committee’s overall policy is to ensure that the remuneration packages
enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and
other senior managers of sufﬁcient calibre to meet the Company’s needs. 
In addition, the remuneration packages are designed to align the interests 
of executives and shareholders and to link a signiﬁcant proportion of
executives’ remuneration to performance. To achieve this, the Company
operates cash and share incentive schemes which are linked to the
achievement of short-term and long-term performance targets. During 
the year the Committee undertook a review of the incentive arrangements 
in place and at the AGM shareholders are being asked to approve the
replacement of the existing Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) 
and Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) with a new Performance Share 
Plan. Further details are contained in section (g) of this Report and in 
the Notice of AGM accompanying this Report.
Assuming the Committee’s proposals are approved by shareholders,
variable performance-related remuneration for Executive Directors will
account for approximately 58% of total target remuneration (excluding
pensions). The remuneration package is described more fully in the
remainder of this Report, but the main elements in 2008/09, assuming
shareholder approval for the new Performance Share Plan is obtained, 
will be as follows: 
• basic salary 
• pension provision 
• annual bonus scheme 
• long-term incentives, comprising the Performance Share Plan.
Basic salaries and pension provision are not linked to performance (except
when basic salaries are reviewed), whilst payments under the annual bonus
scheme and any long-term incentive scheme operated by the Company are
wholly dependent upon performance against agreed targets. Only basic
salary is pensionable.
(e) Basic salaries 
The basic salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually on 
1 August, in conjunction with other aspects of remuneration. The basic
salary for each Executive Director is targeted at the rates of salary for
similar roles within a selected group of UK businesses of similar size with
substantial overseas operations. When determining the level of salary, 
the Committee takes into account market salary levels, the relative
performance of the Group and of the individual Director, together with 
his experience in the particular job. The Committee also considers relevant
information on the remuneration of other senior executives and the pay of
employees elsewhere in the Group and, where appropriate, communicates
its views on the levels of such remuneration to the Group Chief Executive.
During its deliberations, the Committee has regard to salary levels in other
countries where this is relevant for any non-UK based senior executive. The
table of emoluments of the Directors is given on page 46. The current basic
salaries of Mr A D Thorne and Mr S W Dryden are £530,000 and
£330,000 respectively. 
(f) Annual bonus 
The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme which 
has been approved by the Committee. For the ﬁnancial year 2007/08, 
the maximum bonus payable was 100% of basic salary for Mr Thorne 
and 75% of basic salary for Mr G M Morris. Under the scheme the ﬁrst
25% of salary worth of bonus is payable in cash, with the excess split
equally between cash and deferred shares. The deferred shares vest three
years after they are awarded and are held pursuant to the Deferred Share
Bonus Plan. At that point, the Director receives the shares and a payment
equal to the value of dividends payable on the vested shares during the
deferral period. 
If the Director ceases employment with the Group during the deferral
period, he will lose his right to the shares unless he is a deﬁned ‘good
leaver’ or the Committee considers that vesting is appropriate in the
circumstances. The shares will vest in the event of a change of control 
or voluntary winding-up.
The amount of annual bonus payable to Mr Thorne and Mr Morris for the
ﬁnancial year 2007/08 was one-third based on proﬁt before tax, one-third
on return on capital employed and one-third on three strategic targets
determined by the Committee. The outcome of the results for the ﬁnancial
year 2007/08 and the achievement of strategic targets as judged by the
Committee means that Mr Thorne earned a bonus of 91.6% of salary
(£485,480) and Mr Morris earned a bonus of 75% of salary (£225,000).
Full bonus was achieved for the proﬁt before tax and return on capital
employed targets and this required the Executive Directors to exceed the 
top end of the range of the ﬁnancial targets. No deferral is being operated
in respect of Mr Morris’ 2007/08 bonus.
Mr Dryden’s bonus arrangements for 2007/08 were for maximum potential
bonus of 100% of annual salary pro-rated to his start date of 1 April 2008.
His targets were split equally between proﬁt before tax and return on capital
employed. Mr Dryden earned a bonus of 8.3% of salary (£27,500).
For 2008/09 the maximum bonus potential for the Executive Directors 
will be 100% of salary. The Committee decided to simplify the bonus for
Remuneration Report
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 43 2008/09 so that delivery of 50% of bonus will be dependent on 
achieving proﬁt before tax targets with the remainder subject to return 
on capital employed targets. The requirement for share deferral will
continue unchanged. 
The annual bonus maximum for the other most senior executives for
2007/08 was generally 70% of basic salary and was based on an
appropriate combination of Group proﬁt before tax and personal
performance for centre-based senior executives. In the case of senior
divisional executives, their bonus schemes are based on divisional proﬁt
and cash ﬂow relating to the operating performance of the division in which
they are employed. For 2008/09, the bonus maximum will be unchanged.
The annual bonus schemes are not contractual and bonuses under the
schemes are not eligible for inclusion in the calculation of the participating
executives’ pension scheme beneﬁts. 
(g) Share awards
As noted above, the Company currently operates an ESOS and an LTIP . 
The individual grant limit under each Plan is 100% of salary per annum.
However, to ensure that the aggregate award levels are not excessive, in
years when awards are made under both Plans, the maximum award under
both the LTIP and ESOS does not exceed 75% of salary. Vesting of share
options under the ESOS is dependent on achieving earnings per share (‘EPS’)
growth of 3% per annum above the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index 
over a three-year period. Awards made under the LTIP are dependent on the
Company’s total shareholder return performance relative to the constituents 
of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over a three-year period. 
In addition, no LTIP awards will vest unless EPS growth matches or exceeds
inﬂation over the same three-year period. Full details are contained in sections
(n) and (p) below.
Since the ESOS expires in September 2009, the Committee has considered
the appropriate long-term incentive plans for the future, taking account of 
the speciﬁc circumstances of the Company, as well as market practice and 
the views of institutional shareholders. The Committee is fully aware that 
DS Smith is a cyclical business where proﬁts are signiﬁcantly affected by
industry capacity, input costs and packaging prices. This means that proﬁt
performance is uneven as the Company moves through the cycle (and the
share price, which reﬂects future expectations, does not tend to move in line
with recorded proﬁts). To take account of this, the Committee considers that 
the Company’s performance should be measured in a variety of ways to
ensure that a more comprehensive view is taken of the Company’s
performance. In addition, while recognising that performance will ﬂuctuate
through the cycle, the Committee believes that senior executives should be
incentivised to minimise the reduction in ﬁnancial performance through the 
low points of the cycle, so that the Company can emerge in a stronger
position when there is an upturn. The Committee is also keen to ensure 
that the targets set under the new plan are directly relevant to senior
executives, to ensure that they are appropriately incentivised to deliver
excellent performance.
As a result of this review the Company is seeking shareholder approval at the
forthcoming AGM for a new Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) to replace the
existing ESOS and LTIP . The intention is to make the ﬁrst awards under the PSP
shortly following the AGM. Accordingly, no awards under the existing Plans
will be made in 2008.
The key reasons for not continuing with the ESOS are:
• the Committee considers that, with appropriate performance criteria, the
correlation between management performance and reward is likely to be
greater under a PSP than under an ESOS;
• options are particularly unsuitable in a cyclical industry, since the growth 
in share price and the improvement in ﬁnancial performance may not
happen concurrently, resulting in options failing to become exercisable
despite good share price performance; and
• option schemes use more shares and are usually more costly than a PSP ,
which is based on the award of whole shares.
Full details of the new PSP are set out in the notes to the Notice of AGM on
pages 108 to 109. However, the key features of the PSP will be as follows:
• annual grant of shares worth up to 150% of salary. In exceptional
circumstances this may be increased to 200% of salary. It is intended that
awards of 150% of salary will be made initially to Executive Directors and
generally at lower levels for other senior executives;
• awards will vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to the satisfaction
of performance conditions and remaining in employment;
• for initial awards to be made shortly after the AGM, the Committee wishes
to have three separate measures of performance each weighted equally. 
In each case performance will be measured over the three ﬁnancial years
starting on 1 May 2008;
• for senior executives with Group-related roles, including the Executive
Directors, the three measures will be total shareholder return (‘TSR’) relative
to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within
the FTSE 250, average adjusted EPS and average adjusted return on
average capital employed (‘ROACE’). The Committee considers that the
use of TSR, EPS and ROACE will provide a comprehensive set of
measures, which will incentivise management to focus on proﬁts and the
control of capital employed which, in turn, should ﬂow through into the
Company’s TSR. Vesting of the awards will be as follows:
Percentage vesting as Average
a proportion of that Average adjusted
element of the award Relative TSR adjusted EPS* ROACE**
100% Upper quartile 19.0p 12.5%
Between Between Between Between
25% and median and 16.5p 11.5%
100% upper quartile and 19.0p and 12.5%
25% Median 16.5p 11.5%
* Average adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report except that the Committee may adjust
this ﬁgure in exceptional circumstances.
** Adjusted Group operating proﬁt divided by the monthly average of capital employed in
the year.
• for those senior executives working in one of the four Business Segments
the Committee considers that the performance conditions should reﬂect 
the relevant segment’s performance. Therefore, for these senior executives
the three measures will be TSR, average adjusted operating proﬁt for the
relevant segment and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment.
The results for each segment are reported in the Annual Report.
The Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250 currently
contains over 60 companies and is considered to provide a better basis for
comparison than the FTSE 250 as a whole. The Committee considers there 
are too few publicly quoted competitors to DS Smith to form a more bespoke
group.
The EPS related part of each award will be based on the average adjusted
EPS for the forthcoming three ﬁnancial years, commencing with the ﬁnancial
year starting immediately prior to the award date; i.e. for awards made in
2008 this would be for the years 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11. The
Committee prefers to average the EPS result for the three years to ensure that
all years count towards the result and to avoid undue emphasis on a result in
any one year.
The Committee considers that the EPS and ROACE targets are challenging in
the context of the outlook over the next three years and are signiﬁcantly ahead
of the results achieved at a similar stage of previous cycles.
To facilitate the recruitment of Mr Dryden, he was granted a conditional 
share award over 143,404 shares as compensation for lost entitlements to

Governance to Mr Dryden was made under the Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan
which was formed speciﬁcally for this purpose and was granted under Listing
Rule 9.4.2R(2). Full details of this Plan are set out in section (r) below.
Senior executives are expected to retain in shares half of the after-tax gains 
on the vesting of long-term incentive plan awards (including share options)
until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of salary in the case of
Executive Directors and 50% of salary in the case of other senior executives.
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company and details
of options granted to date under the existing ESOS and awards made under
the existing LTIP , Deferred Share Bonus Plan and Replacement Deferred Share
Bonus Plan are shown on pages 47, 48 and 49 respectively.
(h) Beneﬁts in kind 
Mr Thorne has the provision of a company car, a driver and free fuel. 
Mr Dryden has the provision of a company car and free fuel. Mr Thorne
and Mr Dryden both receive unapproved life cover, permanent health
insurance and private medical cover. Mr Morris received a car allowance,
unapproved life cover, permanent health insurance and private medical
cover. Mr Marton received £365 in excess of the statutory HMRC
authorised mileage allowance payment. 
(i) Pensions 
Mr Thorne participates in a funded contributory deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme with death in service cover. He has a normal pension age of 60
and his pension is based on an accrual rate of one-thirtieth with reference to
basic salary less a deduction equal to the basic State pension. This is
subject to a maximum pension of two-thirds of ﬁnal pensionable pay. 
Mr Thorne’s beneﬁts from the Registered Group Pension Scheme are subject
to a Scheme speciﬁc earnings cap (the ‘Cap’) (which was introduced on 
6 April 2006 when the Government’s simpliﬁcation regulations came in 
and replaced the statutory earnings cap that had previously applied). The
Company has given a promise to provide the balance of Mr Thorne’s
pension entitlement through a non-Registered unfunded arrangement. A
charge over certain assets of the Company has been made as security
against future pension payments pursuant to this pension arrangement on
behalf of Mr Thorne. Advice was taken from the Pensions Department of
KPMG LLP on this matter. The total accumulated unfunded provision at 30
April 2008 is £5.9 million (2006/07: £5.0 million), £2.0 million of which
relates to Mr Thorne. 
Life cover of four times the Cap is provided under the Registered Group
Pension Scheme on death in service in addition to a spouse’s pension of
two-thirds of the member’s prospective pension plus dependants’ beneﬁts.
Additional life cover of four times the excess of the Cap over basic salary 
is provided. The spouse’s pension on death after retirement is two-thirds 
of the member’s pension, before any reduction for early retirement or
commutation of pension for cash. 
Pensions in payment from the Registered Group Pension Scheme are
increased annually in line with the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index,
subject to a maximum guaranteed increase of 5% each year for
pensionable service to May 2005, and 2.5% each year for service after
May 2005, with the possibility of further discretionary increases. There is 
no allowance in the transfer value calculation basis for such discretionary
increases or other discretionary beneﬁts. 
Mr Thorne contributes to the Registered Group Pension Scheme at the rate
of 15% of the Cap. 
Following the introduction of the UK Government’s simpliﬁcation regulations
with effect from 6 April 2006 under the Finance Act 2004, the Principal
Employer has agreed with the Trustee the changes to the Registered Group
Pension Scheme rules in response to the legislation. In particular, a Scheme
speciﬁc earnings cap has been retained. Prior to the change in legislation,
members of the Registered Group Pension Scheme had the option of paying
Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs). Neither the contributions nor the
resulting beneﬁts are included in the table on page 50. As there is no
longer a requirement for pension schemes to provide an AVC facility, the
Scheme closed this facility to new AVC contributors on or after 1 June 2006.
New AVCs can be facilitated via the Group’s Saver Plus arrangement.
Mr Morris was a contributing member of the Registered Group Pension
Scheme until his date of leaving. His deferred pension entitlement is shown
in the table on page 50. 
Mr Dryden has participated from 1 May 2008 in the Company’s Registered
Deﬁned Contribution Scheme with death in service cover equal to four times
basic salary. Members of this scheme are required to contribute a minimum
of 3% of their basic salary to qualify for matching Company contributions,
with higher levels of Company contributions payable (up to a maximum 
of 6%) if the members pay a higher contribution. Mr Dryden has initially
elected to pay contributions at a level that qualiﬁes for the maximum
Company contribution. Mr Dryden also receives a cash supplement of
£65,000 per annum. This payment is not pensionable and is not 
considered as salary for the purpose of calculating any bonus payment.
(j) Service contracts and compensation 
The Committee’s general policy is that the notice periods for Executive
Directors appointed in future will not exceed one year, although on
appointment it may be necessary in exceptional cases to offer a longer
initial period which reduces to one year or less after a speciﬁc date. 
The service contract for Mr Thorne is dated 28 February 2001. It may be
terminated by 12 months’ notice by the Company, and by Mr Thorne. The
Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect, in which case 
it must make a payment equating to 12 months’ basic salary, plus an equal
payment in respect of the loss of his contractual beneﬁts. 
The service contract for Mr Dryden is dated 1 April 2008. It may be
terminated by 12 months’ notice by the Company, and by Mr Dryden. The
Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect by making a
payment equal to 12 months’ basic salary. Alternatively, the Company may
make such payment in monthly instalments. These monthly payments will be
reduced to take account of alternative employment or consultancy income
during the 12 month period.
The service contract for Mr Morris was dated 5 November 2002. His
employment terminated on 30 April 2008. The terms of Mr Morris’ 
contract were the same as those for Mr Thorne as described above.
(k) Policy on external appointments 
Executive Directors are allowed to accept external appointments as a 
Non-Executive Director of up to two other companies provided that these
are not with competing companies and are not likely to lead to conﬂicts 
of interest. In normal circumstances, the Group Chief Executive may not
accept more than one external appointment. Executive Directors are
normally allowed to retain the fees paid from these appointments. 
Currently no Executive Director has an external appointment. 
(l) Fees for Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman 
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of annual fees for
their services as members of the Board and, where relevant, for their work
on selected Committees. Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment
for a term of three years whereupon they are normally renewed but for no
more than three terms in aggregate. Their respective dates of appointment
are shown on page 39. 
The Chairman’s remuneration consists of an annual fee for his service as
Chairman of the Board and his letter of appointment is for a term of three
years. His appointment may be terminated by three months’ notice by the
Company, and by the Chairman. 
Neither the Non-Executive Directors nor the Chairman are eligible for
pension scheme membership and they do not participate in any of the
Group’s annual bonus, share option or other incentive arrangements.

The amount earned under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan for Mr Thorne has been included in the table above as it was awarded in respect of the results 
for the ﬁnancial year 2007/08. Shares in DS Smith Plc to the value of the deferred bonus will be purchased in July 2008 and held in the Deferred Share
Bonus Plan. The shares are transferred to participants on the third anniversary of the award, but lapse on termination of employment. Mr Morris’ bonus for
the ﬁnancial year ended 2007/08 will be paid entirely in cash.
The total emoluments of Mr Thorne excluding the deferred bonus were £847,000 (2006/07: £798,000). Mr Dryden received an additional 
non-pensionable pension supplement payment during the year.
Mr Morris stepped down from the Board on 1 April 2008 and his employment with the Company terminated on 30 April 2008. The compensation for loss
of ofﬁce paid to Mr Morris represented a payment on termination in accordance with the terms of his contract of employment, compensation in settlement 
of his rights in respect of the ﬁnancial year 2006/07 under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, legal expenses and the costs of outplacement advice. Mr Morris
was subject to the Scheme speciﬁc earnings cap and therefore as an employee of the Company he received an additional non-pensionable payment during
the year.

All of the above options were granted for nil consideration. The market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2008 was 130.5p and the range during
the year was 128.5p to 255.25p. Aggregate gains made by Directors on exercise of share options in the year were £nil (2006/07: £nil). All options will
be exercisable from the dates stated above, subject to them satisfying the performance target. For these share options to become exercisable the growth in
the Company’s normalised EPS must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum. Share options granted in
2002 and 2003 can be retested, from a ﬁxed base, until the sixth anniversary of grant. Options granted from 2004 onwards have no retest facility. During
the transition to IFRS, the Committee ensures that a consistent basis is used to measure earnings per share performance. Based on EPS performance to 
30 April 2008 the options granted in 2002, 2003 and 2005 have become exercisable.
For this purpose, the EPS growth is based on adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report, except that the Committee may adjust this ﬁgure in
exceptional circumstances where this is appropriate. The veriﬁcation of the calculation of EPS growth has been performed by Hewitt New Bridge Street, 
in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.
As noted above, the performance condition attached to Mr Morris’ share options granted in 2002, 2003 and 2005 was met over the performance 
period to 30 April 2008. Accordingly these options will be exercisable in full for a period of six months from 26 June 2008 (the day after which the
auditors issue their report for the year ended 30 April 2008). Performance in relation to the options granted in 2006 and 2007 was tested for the period 
to 30 April 2008, the date on which he ceased employment. The performance condition attached to these options was met in full. Therefore, subject to a
time pro rata reduction to reﬂect the unexpired portion of the performance period at cessation (one-third reduction for 2006 and two-thirds reduction for
2007), these options will be exercisable for six months from 26 June 2008.

The awards made under the LTIP will vest based on the Company’s TSR (being the increase in share price and the value of reinvested dividends) compared to
the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). If the Company’s TSR is ranked at the upper quartile of the group or higher, the
full award will vest reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance. None of the award vests for below median
performance. TSR performance is measured over a single period of three ﬁnancial years starting with the year in which the award is made.
In addition to the TSR condition, no awards will vest, irrespective of TSR performance, unless the Company’s EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the
Retail Prices Index over the three-year period. For this purpose, following the introduction of IFRS, the EPS growth will be based on adjusted EPS as disclosed 
in the Annual Report, except that the Committee may adjust this ﬁgure in exceptional circumstances where this is appropriate. 
The calculation of TSR performance is performed by Hewitt New Bridge Street, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.
The performance period attached to Mr Morris’ outstanding unvested LTIP awards ended on 30 April 2008. The performance conditions in respect of the 
2005 and 2007 awards were not met. Accordingly these awards will lapse. The TSR performance condition in respect of the 2006 awards was partially
satisﬁed and the EPS test was met. Therefore 42.7% of this award may vest, subject to a time pro-rata reduction to reﬂect the unexpired portion of the
performance period at the date of cessation. Accordingly, 38,336 shares will be released after 26 June 2008 (representing 67% of the shares vesting after
applying the performance condition), with the remainder of the award lapsing.

In recognition of the loss of his entitlement to deferred share bonus awards relating to his previous employment, Mr Dryden was made an award of 143,404
shares (which is neither pensionable nor transferable) on 1 April 2008, the date on which he joined DS Smith Plc. The Committee made this award, in
exceptional circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Dryden as the new Group Finance Director. The number of shares awarded has been determined
by reference to the value of the entitlement to shares he forfeited under his previous arrangements.
In normal circumstances, these shares will vest in three tranches, as shown in the table above, subject only to Mr Dryden’s continued employment with the
Company. These dates correspond to the dates when Mr Dryden’s arrangements in his previous employment would have vested. In the event of Mr Dryden
being under notice of termination of his employment or, if earlier, actual cessation of his employment (other than in the event of death), any unvested shares 
shall lapse immediately unless the Committee determines otherwise. In the event of death, any unvested shares will vest immediately. In the event of a change 
of control any unvested shares will vest.
The number of shares subject to the award may be adjusted in the event of any variation of share capital or demerger, special dividend or other similar event.
Except for minor amendments to beneﬁt the administration of this award, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax,
exchange control or regulatory treatment, no alteration can be made to his advantage without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.

There have been no changes to the shareholdings set out above between the ﬁnancial year-end and the date of the Report. It is currently intended that any
ordinary shares required to fulﬁl entitlements under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, the Replacement Deferred Share Bonus
Plan and the proposed Performance Share Plan will be provided by the David S Smith Group General Employee Beneﬁt Trust (the ‘Trust’), which buys shares
on the market to do so. The Trust will also be used to fulﬁl certain entitlements under the Executive Share Option Scheme (along with new issue shares for
other entitlements).

Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year. Transfer values have 
been calculated in accordance with version 9.2 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession. The value of net increase (4) represents 
the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year-end. It is based on 
the accrued pension increase (2) after deducting the Director’s contribution. The change in transfer value (7) includes the effect of ﬂuctuations in the 
transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting the
Director’s contribution. 
(u) Total shareholder return performance 
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total shareholder return performance since 1 May 2003, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relative to the FTSE 250 Index. 
The Company is a member of the FTSE 250 Index and, accordingly, this index is considered to be the most appropriate comparator group for this purpose. 
This graph looks at the value, by 30 April 2008, of £100 invested in Smith (DS) over the last ﬁve ﬁnancial years compared with that of £100 invested 
in the FTSE Mid 250 Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening ﬁnancial year-ends.

The purpose of the Annual Report is to provide information to the members
of the Company and no-one else. The Annual Report contains certain
forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, performance

and developments to differ from those anticipated. The forward-looking
statements reﬂect knowledge and information available at the date of
preparation of this Annual Report and the Company undertakes no
obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Nothing in this
Annual Report should be construed as a proﬁt forecast.

Research and Development
The Group recognises the importance of continuing to invest in research 
and development. It is Group policy to develop new product speciﬁcations
commensurate with environmental needs and packaging solutions required
by customers. Research is also conducted into ways to improve product
quality and to ﬁnd more cost-efﬁcient methods of production and
distribution. Research and development is conducted within divisional
operations and expenditure is not signiﬁcant.
Directors
The biographies of the present Directors are on page 39. All the Directors
served throughout the year except as follows. Mr D R Piette retired from 
the Board on 30 May 2007. Mr G M B Adams was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director on 29 January 2008. Mr G M Morris retired 
from the Board on 1 April 2008 and Mr S W Dryden was appointed to 
the Board as Group Finance Director on the same date. Other than as
previously disclosed in this Report and in respect of existing service
agreements, no Director, either during or at the end of the ﬁnancial year,
has been materially interested in any signiﬁcant contract or arrangement 
in relation to the Group’s business.
In accordance with Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1985 (as amended
by the Companies Act 2006) the Directors disclose that the rules regarding
the appointment and replacement of Directors are contained in the
Company’s Articles of Association, which may only be amended with
shareholder approval in accordance with relevant legislation. The powers 
of the Directors are contained in the Company’s Memorandum of
Association and Articles. The Articles give the Directors powers, subject to
relevant legislation, to authorise the issue and buy-back of the Company’s  52 www.dssmith.uk.com
Financial Statements
shares by the Company, subject to authority being given to the Directors by
shareholders in general meeting. The Company annually seeks the authority
of shareholders to authorise the exercise by Directors of these powers. 
Re-election of Directors
The Articles of Association require that all Directors who have either been
appointed by the Board since the last Annual General Meeting, or who, at
the start of business on the date which is 30 clear days prior to the date
of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting, have held ofﬁce for
more than 30 months since they were appointed or last re-appointed by 
the Company in general meeting, retire from ofﬁce but they are eligible to
submit themselves for re-election by the shareholders. The only Directors in
this position are Mr Adams and Mr Dryden, who have been appointed to
the Board since the last Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, offer
themselves for election. Following formal performance evaluation, the
individual performance of the Directors offering themselves for election 
has been effective and they have demonstrated commitment to the role. 
Directors’ Interests in Shares
The interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the ordinary
shares of 10p each of the Company, including options granted but not yet
exercised under the Executive Share Option Scheme, Restricted Share Plan,
Long-Term Incentive Plan, Deferred Share Bonus Plan and Replacement
Deferred Share Bonus Plan, were as shown in the tables on pages 47 
to 49.
Directors’ Indemnities
The Company has entered into qualifying third party indemnity
arrangements for the beneﬁt of its Directors in a form and scope which
comply with the requirements of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006.
Employee Involvement and Communications
The Group is committed to frequent and effective employee communications
to promote the understanding and involvement of all its employees in the
Group’s business objectives and performance. Communications and
personnel policies have been developed to reﬂect the philosophy of
operating management. Information is regularly communicated by brieﬁngs
and newsletters. The Group operates a European Works Council, with
representatives drawn from across the entire workforce in the EU countries
in which the Group operates. Meetings are held to provide an exchange 
of transnational information and consultation with employees. At each
meeting, presentations are made on the Group’s business strategy, ﬁnancial
results, health and safety and environmental performance. The Group also
has a number of divisional national Consultation Forums which promote
information exchange, consultation and representation between the 
Group and its workforce. Business decisions concerning capital investment,
employment and training take into account the Group’s public and local
responsibilities. The Group supports the involvement of its operations in
local community activities.
Equal Opportunities
The Group is ﬁrmly committed to both the principle and realisation of equal
opportunities in employment and its policies are designed to provide such
equality irrespective of sex, creed, ethnic origin, nationality, sexual
orientation, age or disability. Every possible step is taken to ensure that
individuals are treated equally and fairly. The Group applies the same
criteria to people with disabilities as it does to other employees. Where
appropriate, facilities are adapted and retraining is offered to any
employee who develops a disability during their employment.
Pension Fund
The Group had, in the year under review, four UK pension arrangements:
one deﬁned beneﬁt scheme (which is closed to new employees), one
deﬁned contribution scheme, one Group personal pension plan and a
statutory Stakeholder arrangement. The deﬁned contribution scheme was
introduced for UK employees joining the Group on or after 1 May 2005. 
The investments of the assets of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme are managed 
on a discretionary basis by AllianceBernstein Institutional Investment
Management Limited, Majedie Asset Management Limited, Paciﬁc
Investment Management Company and Barclays Global Investors Limited.
The deﬁned contribution scheme is a trust-based arrangement offering
members a range of investments with AXA Sun Life plc and other external
investment fund managers as selected by the Scheme’s trustees. The Group
personal pension plan is a contract-based arrangement offering members a
range of investments with Norwich Union Life and other external investment
fund managers, and the Stakeholder arrangement is provided through
Investment Solutions Limited. All such assets are held independently from 
the Group. The trustees of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and the deﬁned
contribution scheme send an Annual Report to all members of the respective
schemes. The Trustee Company of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme has an
Investment Sub-Committee, established in line with the recommended
guidelines of the Myners Report. Peter Murray of Allenbridge Investment
Consultants is appointed as an independent adviser to the Investment 
Sub-Committee of the DS Smith Group Pension Scheme.
Health and Safety
The Group recognises its responsibilities and continues to promote all
aspects of health and safety in the interests of its employees and members 
of the public. A Health and Safety Policy Statement has been approved by
the Board.
Signiﬁcant Agreements
The Company is required to disclose any signiﬁcant agreements that take
effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the Company. The
Company has a number of borrowing and related derivative facilities
provided by various lenders. These facilities agreements generally 
include change of control provisions which, in the event of a change of
ownership of the Company could result in renegotiation or withdrawal 
of these facilities. 
The signiﬁcant agreements are as set out in note 19. On 3 March 2005, 
the Company, St Regis Paper Company Limited and BPB United Kingdom
Limited (now part of the Saint-Gobain Group) (‘Saint-Gobain’) entered into
a supply agreement for the manufacture and supply of plasterboard liner
paper to Saint-Gobain. Saint-Gobain may terminate the agreement if there
is a change of control in the Company. 
There are a number of other agreements that take effect, alter or terminate
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such 
as commercial contracts and joint venture agreements. None is considered
to be signiﬁcant in terms of their potential impact on the business of the
Group as a whole.
Payment to Suppliers
Although the Company does not follow any formal code or standard on
payment practice, the Company agrees terms and conditions in the UK 
with each supplier, which include terms of payment. The Company pays
each supplier accordingly, subject to all the terms and conditions of the
order being satisﬁed by such supplier. As DS Smith Plc is a holding
company, whose principal business is to hold shares in Group companies, 
it has no trade creditors.
Directors’ Report continued
Governance Charitable and Political Donations
The Group contributed £72,000 (2006/07: £71,000) to charities in the
UK. No payments were made to political parties. Donations were made 
by operating divisions to support their local communities. The Group also
supported a number of other charities across a range of causes.
Annual General Meeting
The notice of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 
3 September 2008, together with explanations of the Resolutions to be
proposed, appears at the back of this Annual Report.
Auditors
Each Director conﬁrms that:
(a) so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
(b) he has taken all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director in order
to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Resolutions to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors of the Company
and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be put to
the Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the
Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for 
each ﬁnancial year. The Directors are required by the IAS Regulation to
prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The 
Group ﬁnancial statements are also required by law to be properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS ﬁnancial statements
present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the Company’s ﬁnancial position,
ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions 
in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets,
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of
ﬁnancial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will 
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors 
are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc
requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the
entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent Company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable
law). The parent Company ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt
or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
(a) the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken
as a whole; and 
(b) the management report includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Financial Statements Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of DS Smith Plc
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 55
We have audited the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements 
(the ‘ﬁnancial statements’) of DS Smith Plc for the year ended 30 April 2008
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and parent
Company Balance Sheets, the Group Statement of Cash Flows, the Group
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes 1 to 34
in the Group ﬁnancial statements and notes 1 to 11 in the parent Company
ﬁnancial statements. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described 
as auditable.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union, and for preparing the parent Company ﬁnancial
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether, in
addition, the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the
Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information presented elsewhere 
in the Report and Accounts that is cross referred from the Principal 
Activities and Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law
regarding Directors’ Remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined
Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described
in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
ﬁnancial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of 
the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
affairs as at 30 April 2008 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
• the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation;
• the parent Company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the parent Company’s affairs 
as at 30 April 2008;
• the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
ﬁnancial statements.

1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRSs’). The Company has
elected to prepare its parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 99 to 104.
The ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling in millions, rounded to 
one decimal place, unless otherwise indicated. They are prepared on the
historical cost basis except that assets and liabilities of certain ﬁnancial
instruments, deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans and share-based payments 
are stated at their fair value.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect whether and how policies
are applied and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expenses. Judgements made by management in the application of
adopted IFRSs that have a signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnancial statements and
estimates with a signiﬁcant risk of material adjustment in the next year are
discussed in accounting policy u.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to 
all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements except for
the following new and amended IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations during 
the year. Adoption of these revised standards and interpretations did not
have any material effect on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group and the
Company. The accounting policies have been applied consistently by all
Group entities.
IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, and the complementary
amendment to IAS 1, ‘Presentation for ﬁnancial statements – Capital
disclosures’. IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures relating to ﬁnancial
instruments. This standard does not have any impact on the classiﬁcation
and valuation of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments.
IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS2’
IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’
IFRIC 10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’
IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions‘
(b) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases. Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or
income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated
in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
(ii) Associates
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the Group’s share of the total
recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis,
from the date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence commences until the date that
signiﬁcant inﬂuence ceases. 
(iii) Joint ventures
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the Group’s proportionate
share of its joint ventures’ assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses with 
items of a similar nature on a line-by-line basis, from the date that joint
control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
(iv) Minority interests
The share of proﬁt attributable to minority interests is shown as a component
of proﬁt for the period in the income statement and minority interests are
shown as a component of equity in the balance sheet net of the value of
options over interests held by minorities in the Group’s subsidiaries (refer 
to accounting policy j).
(c) Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services, net 
of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within
the Group. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income
statement when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred to the buyer. 
(d) Government grants
(i) Emission quotas
The Group participates in Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
Emission quotas received in a period are initially recognised at a nominal
value of nil. As a result, no asset or liability is recognised on the balance
sheet at initial recognition. A provision is recognised if there is any
anticipated shortfall in the level of quotas received or purchased when
compared with actual emissions in any given period, measured at the
market price of such quotas at the balance sheet date. Excess emission
quotas acquired as part of a business combination are recognised as an
intangible asset at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
(ii) Other
Other government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially 
as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that they will 
be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching 
to them. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are 
offset against the expenses in the same periods in which the expenses 
are incurred. 
(e) Dividends
Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company declared during
the year are recognised directly in equity. 
(f) Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the foreign
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are
translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of monetary assets and
liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency
are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of all the Group entities that have a functional
currency other than sterling are translated at the closing exchange rate 
at the date of the balance sheet. Income and expenses for each income
statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average 
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses 
are translated at the date of the transactions). On consolidation, exchange
differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities, and of borrowings, and other ﬁnancial instruments designated as
hedges of such investments, are recognised in the translation reserve. On
the disposal of foreign currency entities, the cumulative exchange difference
recorded in the translation reserve is taken to the income statement as part
of the gain or loss on disposal.
(g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase
method. Goodwill (positive and negative) arising on the acquisition of
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, represents the difference
between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identiﬁable
assets acquired. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses (refer to
Financial Statements DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 61
accounting policy i). The useful life of goodwill is considered to be
indeﬁnite. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested
annually for impairment. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition 
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining
new scientiﬁc or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in
the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research ﬁndings are
applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially
improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process 
is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufﬁcient
resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes 
the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of
overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income
statement as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure
is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment
losses (refer to accounting policy i).
(iii) Computer software
Computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is included
within tangible ﬁxed assets. All other computer software is treated as an
intangible asset.
(iv) Intellectual property
Intellectual property is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
(see below) and impairment losses (refer to accounting policy i).
(v) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost
less accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment losses (refer 
to accounting policy i). 
(vi) Amortisation
Amortisation of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) is charged to the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets unless such lives are indeﬁnite. Intangible assets (other
than goodwill) are amortised from the date they are available for use. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Intellectual property Up to 20 years
Computer software 3 – 5 years
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
(h) Property, plant and equipment and other investments
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (refer to accounting policy
i). The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct
labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Where an
item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property,
plant and equipment.
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant
and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is
incurred if it is probable that the future economic beneﬁts embodied within
the item will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement as an
expense as incurred.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of each item of property, plant and
equipment, and major components that are accounted for separately 
(or in the case of leased assets, the lease period, if shorter). Land is 
not depreciated. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold properties 10 – 50 years
Plant, machinery, ﬁxtures and ﬁttings (including IT hardware) 3 – 20 years
Motor vehicles 3 – 5 years
Other investments consist of available for sale investments in unquoted
equity and debt securities and are carried at cost, less any impairment.
(i) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, including tangible and
intangible non-current assets, other than inventories (refer to accounting
policy l) and deferred tax assets (refer to accounting policy t), are reviewed
at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount
of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
(i) Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is calculated as the value-in-
use, being the present value of expected future cash ﬂows, using a pre-tax
discount rate that reﬂects the current assessment of the time value of money,
or the net selling price, if greater. For an asset that does not generate
largely independent cash inﬂows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
(ii) Reversals of impairment
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. In respect of 
other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(j) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments, primarily interest rate,
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities
and the ﬁnancing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to, and
does not, undertake any speculative activity in these instruments. 
Such derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are accounted for as hedges when
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the
ﬁnancial instruments provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk. Any
gains or losses arising from the hedging instruments are offset against the
hedged items. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁed as:
– fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability;
– cash ﬂow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash ﬂows 
that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with either 
a balance sheet item or a highly probable forecast transaction; or
– hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other
derivatives are taken to the income statement. These may arise from
derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they 
are not effective as hedging instruments. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
62 www.dssmith.uk.com
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives
designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging
relationship as follows:
Fair value hedges: the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted 
for gains or losses attributable to the risk being hedged; the derivative is
remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both are taken to the
income statement. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting 
if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group
revokes the designation.
Cash ﬂow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging
instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is
recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred
to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects proﬁt or loss,
such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where the hedged item is
the cost of a non-ﬁnancial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability. 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without
replacement or rollover, the hedged transaction ceases to be highly
probable, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously
recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs
and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount
of a non-ﬁnancial asset liability as above. If a forecast transaction is no
longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are
transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity: the effective portion of the 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, 
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts
taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign
entity is sold.
The net present value of the expected future payments under options over
interests held by minorities in the Group’s subsidiaries are shown as a
ﬁnancial liability. At the end of each period, the valuation of the liability is
reassessed with any changes recognised in the proﬁt or loss for the period.
(k) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment
provisions (refer to accounting policy i).
(l) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. The
cost of inventories is based on the ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out principle and includes
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to 
their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes
an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
(m) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the
Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash
equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ﬂows.
(n) Treasury shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of 
the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised 
as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classiﬁed as treasury shares
and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(o) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are
stated at amortised cost with borrowing costs being accounted for on an
accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method. 
At the balance sheet date, accrued interest is recorded separately from the
associated borrowings within current liabilities.
(p) Employee beneﬁts
(i) Deﬁned contribution schemes
Contributions to deﬁned contribution pension schemes are recognised 
as an expense in the income statement as personnel expense, as incurred.
(ii) Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The Group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes 
is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future
beneﬁt that employees have earned in return for their service in the current
and prior periods; that beneﬁt is discounted to its present value amount and
recognised in the income statement as personnel expense; a corresponding
liability for all future beneﬁts is established on the balance sheet and the fair
value of any schemes’ assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at
the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates
approximating to the duration of the schemes’ obligations. The calculation 
is performed by a qualiﬁed actuary using the projected unit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement 
of recognised income and expense.
(iii) Long-term service beneﬁts
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service beneﬁts, other
than pension plans, is the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. 
(iv) Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant
of the options is recognised as an expense. The fair value of the options
granted is measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The total amount to
be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting
conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At
each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact 
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and 
a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the
options are exercised.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it 
is probable that an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle
the obligation. 
(r) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost.
(s) Leases
Property, plant and equipment acquired under a lease that transfers
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are
capitalised as tangible ﬁxed assets. Lease payments are apportioned
between the ﬁnance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. 
Financial Statements DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 63
The ﬁnance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so 
as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance
of the liability. 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(t) Taxation
Income tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and deferred
tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year,
using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to
tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided
for: goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither
accounting nor taxable proﬁt, and differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.
(u) Critical accounting policies 
The application of the Group’s accounting policies requires the management
of DS Smith Plc to make estimates and assumptions; these estimates and
assumptions affect the reported assets and liabilities and ﬁnancial result 
of the Group. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and
assumptions used.
The Group’s accounting policies that are most critical to an understanding 
of the results and position of the Group, and the judgements involved in
their application, are as follows:
(i) Impairments
When applying IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group compares the
carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with the higher of their net
realisable value and value-in-use to determine whether an impairment exists.
Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the cash ﬂows expected to be
generated by the asset/group of assets being tested for evidence of
impairment. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgements, 
in particular those involved in (a) determining a value based on our current
expectations of future conditions and the associated cash ﬂows from the
Group’s operations, (b) our determination of the level at which groups of
assets can be reasonably tested for impairment separately from other parts
of the business and (c) our treatment of centrally held assets, could each
result in materially different carrying values of assets and assessments of
impairment. See note 10 of the Notes to the ﬁnancial statements for
additional information regarding the Group’s annual impairment exercise.
(ii) Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
IAS 19, ‘Employee Beneﬁts’, requires the Group to make assumptions
including, but not limited to, future asset returns, rates of inﬂation, discount
rates and life expectancies. The use of different assumptions, in any of the
above calculations, could have a material effect on the accounting values 
of the relevant balance sheet assets and liabilities which could also result in
a change to the cost of such liabilities as recognised in the income statement
over time. These assumptions are subject to periodic review. See note 24 of
the Notes to the ﬁnancial statements for additional information regarding
the Group’s pension and other post-retirement beneﬁts.
(iii) Accounting for carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions
There are currently no accounting standards that speciﬁcally address
accounting for emission allowances. The Group with the agreement of its
auditors, has applied a ‘net liability’ approach. Under a ‘net liability’
approach, no assets or government grant are recognised when allowances
are initially received. This is because they are ascribed a nominal value of
nil. As allowances granted to the Group are used to offset the liability from
CO
2
emissions, no accounting entries are required so long as the related
emissions generated are within the allowance received from the
government. If such emissions are in excess of the allowance received
(known as a shortfall position) a provision is made at the current market
price for carbon credits. In the case where emission quotas are acquired
through an acquisition any surplus emission quotas are fair valued in
accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.
(v) IFRS standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
The IASB and IFRIC have issued new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these ﬁnancial statements. The Group does not
anticipate that the adoption of those standards and interpretations that are effective for the ﬁnancial year ending 30 April 2009 will have a material effect 
on its ﬁnancial statements on initial adoption; the Group is evaluating the effect of those standards and interpretations that are effective subsequently. The
standards and interpretation to be adopted include:

2. Segment reporting continued
The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is business segments based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. The secondary
format is geographical segments showing the geographical origin of the Group’s activity and net assets. Further details on these business segments are
given in the Business Review on pages 16 to 30. The Group operates in two principal geographical areas: the UK and Western Continental Europe. Two
further segments are identiﬁed: Eastern Continental Europe and the Rest of the World. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as
well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis 
year-on-year. Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level. Capital employed excludes items of a ﬁnancing nature,
taxation balances, post-retirement beneﬁt liabilities and non-current asset investments; segmental capital employed comprises identiﬁable segment assets 
less segmental liabilities. Average capital employed is the average monthly capital employed. The adjusted return on average capital employed is deﬁned
as operating proﬁt before exceptional items divided by average capital employed.

8. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 30 April 2008 is based on the net proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders of £76.6m (2006/07:
£60.6m) and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 30 April 2008 of 391.5m (2006/07: 389.5m). The
number of shares excludes the weighted average number of the Company’s own shares held as treasury shares during the year of 1.9m (2006/07: 2.2m).

Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill
The following segments have cash-generating units containing signiﬁcant carrying amounts of goodwill:

£m £m
UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging 144.2 140.6
Plastic Packaging 34.8 31.8
179.0 172.4
Segments with no cash-generating units containing individually significant goodwill 13.9 5.7
192.9 178.1
As set out in accounting policy i in note 1, the Group tests its goodwill for potential impairment annually. The recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-
generating units is calculated on the present value of their respective expected future cash ﬂows (the value-in-use) or the net selling price (fair value), if
greater. Given the limited available information on the likely fair value of the Group’s assets, the recoverable amount used is predominately the value-in-use.
The value-in-use calculations use a pre-tax discount rate derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, and discount a ﬁve-year period with
a terminal value. Value-in-use cash ﬂows are based for the forthcoming and subsequent ﬁnancial years on the Group’s Plan approved by the Board of
Directors; subsequent years’ cash ﬂows are based on estimates of future performance. Based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the
market, the key assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: long-term sales growth – up to 3.0%; capital expenditure – equal to annual depreciation;
and nominal growth in proﬁt at terminal value – up to 3.0%.

At 30 April 2008, 72% (30 April 2007: 61%) of the Group’s net borrowings, after taking into account the effect of cross-currency swaps, were
denominated in euros in order to hedge the underlying assets of the Group’s relevant continental European operations. Interest rates on ﬂoating-rate
borrowings are based on LIBOR, EURIBOR or base rates.
In April 2005, the Group entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility of £250m, which expires on 31 May 2010. In April 2008, the Group entered
into a further revolving credit facility of £50m, which expires on 30 April 2010. Advances drawn down under both facilities bear interest at a margin over
LIBOR or EURIBOR.
In November 2002, the Group entered into a note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of DS Smith Plc’s 6.24%
senior notes and £25m of 6.85% senior notes, which will mature on 14 November 2012. The Group entered into a swap transaction with a bank
counterparty under which it made a payment of US$80m in return for €81.6m. The swap counterparty also agreed to pay ﬁxed-rate dollar interest of
6.24% per annum in exchange for ﬂoating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR. In addition, swap counterparties also agreed to pay ﬁxed-rate
dollar interest of 6.24% per annum on a principal amount of $25m in exchange for ﬂoating dollar interest linked to dollar LIBOR and ﬁxed-rate sterling
interest of 6.85% per annum on a principal of £25m in exchange for ﬂoating sterling interest linked to sterling LIBOR.
In August 2004, the Group entered into a further note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of DS Smith Plc’s 5.66%
senior notes and US$95m of 5.80% senior notes, which will mature on 25 August 2014 and 25 August 2016, respectively. The Group entered into swap
transactions with a bank counterparty under which it made payments of US$105m and US$20m in return for €86.5m and €16.5m, respectively, and 
a payment of $75m in return for £40.8m.
The swap counterparty agreed to pay ﬁxed-rate dollar interest of 5.66% per annum and 5.80% per annum, respectively, in exchange for ﬂoating euro rate
interest at rates linked to EURIBOR and ﬁxed-rate dollar interest of 5.80% per annum in exchange for ﬁxed-rate sterling interest at rates of 6.21% per annum.

b) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities and the ﬁnancing of these activities. All derivatives have been designated 
as effective hedging instruments and are carried at their fair value.
The assets and liabilities of the Group as at 30 April in respect of derivative ﬁnancial instruments are as follows:

(ii) Fair value hedges
At 30 April 2008, the Group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on ﬁxed rate debt
payable by the Group. The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical for all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the
hedging is highly effective. The pre-tax gain on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was £8.8m (2006/07: loss 
of £7.5m) offset by a pre-tax loss on the fair value of the debt of £8.4m (2006/07: gain of £7.3m).
(iii) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries. At 30 April 2008, these swaps had a fair value of
£(28.1)m (2007: £(7.4)m) and the pre-tax loss on the hedges recognised in equity in the year was £20.0m (2006/07: gain of £2.1m). The gain or loss 
is matched by a similar gain or loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign subsidiary’s net assets.
d) Risk identiﬁcation and risk management
(i) Capital risk
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash ﬂow, borrowings, shareholders’ equity and disposals of peripheral
businesses, where appropriate. The Group’s objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing ﬂexibility
in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions. The Group also aims to maintain a strong balance sheet
and to provide continuity of ﬁnancing by having a range of maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources.
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufﬁcient funds are available for the Group to carry out its strategy and to manage ﬁnancial risks. 
The Group’s treasury strategy is controlled though the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the Group Chief Executive, the Group
Finance Director and the Group Treasurer. The Group Treasury Function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and
controlled by the Group Treasurer. The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for interest rate,
foreign exchange rate and energy exposure management.
(ii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument ﬂuctuate because of a change in market prices. The Group is exposed
to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

20. Financial instruments continued
d) Risk identiﬁcation and risk management continued
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both ﬁxed and ﬂoating interest rates. The risk is managed by the Group
maintaining an appropriate mix between ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated
regularly to align with expectations of changes in interest rates, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or
protecting interest rate expense through interest rate cycles. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are detailed in
the liquidity risk management section of this note.
At 30 April 2008, 16% (2007: 33%) of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings were ﬁxed for a period of at least one year. The sensitivity
analysis below shows the impact on proﬁt and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates (representing management’s assessment of the
reasonably possible change in interest rates) in all currencies in which the Group had variable rate borrowings at 30 April.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been increased
by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Group’s interest rate derivatives. The effect
on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the market values of the
Group’s interest rate derivatives. 
The results are presented before minority interests and tax.

Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on
profit total equity profit total equity
£m £m £m £m
Increase in market interest rates by 100 basis points (2.3) – (1.7) (0.1)
Under interest rate swap contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between ﬁxed and ﬂoating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed
notional principal amounts. At 30 April 2008, £1.1m (2007: £(0.1)m) (net of tax) is deferred in equity in respect of cash ﬂow hedges of interest rate risk.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur over time to 2016.
During the year, £0.3m of gains deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement (2006/07: £nil).
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk on investments
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Group’s
presentational currency. The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps. Gains
and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in reserves.
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency
swaps designated as either cash ﬂow or fair value hedges. 
Foreign exchange risk on transactions
Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales and material purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash ﬂow hedges. 
At 30 April 2008, £(0.4)m (2007: £(0.1)m) (net of tax) is deferred in equity in respect of cash ﬂow hedges. This will be recycled to the income statement in
the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years. During the year, £0.2m of losses deferred in equity
were transferred to the income statement (2006/07: £0.1m of losses).
The Group’s main currency exposures are from the euro and US dollar. The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Group’s results of a 10%
change in the year-end exchange rate of sterling against all other currencies. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change
in foreign exchange rates. The analysis is only on ﬁnancial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of ﬁnancial instruments
designated as net investment hedges. Loans that are treated as net investment hedges are not recorded within the impact on the Group’s proﬁt as the impact
of foreign exchange movements on these are offset by equal and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge.
The results are presented before minority interests and tax.

d) Risk identiﬁcation and risk management continued
Commodity risk
The Group’s main commodity exposures are to changes in UK gas and UK electricity prices. Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination
of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments. At 30 April 2008, £12.3m (2007: £(1.3)m) (net of tax) is deferred in equity in respect of cash
ﬂow hedges in accordance with IAS 39. This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income
statement, which occurs within two years. During the year, £0.5m of losses deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement (2006/07: £1.3m
of gains).
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is management’s assessment of the reasonably possible
approximation of how much markets can move, on average, over any given year. In some years prices will be less volatile and in others they may 
be more volatile. A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity. As all of the Group’s commodity ﬁnancial instruments
achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on proﬁt for either ﬁnancial year.
The results are presented before minority interests and tax.

(iii) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, causing ﬁnancial loss to 
the Group. This risk arises principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding trade receivables. The majority of the Group’s trade
receivables are due for maturity within 90 days. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base
being large and diverse. Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts
(see note 15).
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited due to the Group’s policy of restricting material deposits with banking counterparties to those with
investment grade credit ratings or better.

d) Risk identiﬁcation and risk management continued
(iv) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difﬁculty in meeting its obligations associated with its ﬁnancial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate ﬁnancial resources, by continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash ﬂows and by
matching the maturity proﬁle of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities to these risks. 
e) Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arm’s-length basis. For ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair
value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists. The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign
exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase
agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet. Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only portions of the note
purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities which bear ﬂoating-rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
For current and non-current receivables (note 15) and current and non-current payables (note 16) and provisions (note 22), fair value is estimated to be
equivalent to book value and is not included in the table below.

The tax losses above include £2.0m which do not expire and £1.6m which expire between 2009 and 2012, under current tax legislation. Deferred tax
assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the Group can
utilise the beneﬁts therefrom. Deferred tax liabilities have not been provided for in respect of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as there is no
current intention for any of the relevant overseas entities to remit their earnings. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

At 30 April 2008, deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognised for all taxable temporary differences:
– except where the deferred tax liability arises on goodwill;
– except on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither
the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and
– in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At 30 April 2008, deferred tax assets were recognised for all taxable temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses
except where it is unlikely that taxable proﬁt will be available against which to offset the loss.
In March 2007, the UK government announced an intention to amend UK tax legislation to remove tax depreciation on UK industrial buildings from 2011
onwards. At 30 April 2008, this change in legislation has not been substantively enacted and no amendment to deferred tax has been recognised in respect
of temporary differences relating to certain UK buildings. Had the legislation been substantively enacted on 30 April 2008, the Group estimates its net
deferred tax provision would have increased from £39.8m to £52.6m.

The provision for employee beneﬁts mainly represents that for long-service awards. The restructuring provision includes amounts associated with the closures
and restructuring costs described in note 4. Other provisions mainly relate to an acquired onerous service contract (see note 30) and to provisions for vacant
leaseholds and various legal claims. The timing of the utilisation of these provisions is uncertain, except where the associated costs are contractual, in which
case the provision is utilised over the time period speciﬁed in the contract.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of 
the Company. In respect of the Company’s shares that are held by the Group (see below), all rights are suspended until those shares are reissued. A
reconciliation of the movement in share capital is given in note 9 to the Company balance sheet on page 103.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the ﬁnancial statements of foreign operations, as well 
as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary. 
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash ﬂow hedging instruments related to hedged
transactions that have not yet occurred. Refer to note 20(c) for further analysis of movements in the hedging reserve.
Own shares
The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by the Group. The Group operates a General Employee Beneﬁt
Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Executive Share Option scheme, the Restricted Share Plan
(discontinued in 2004) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (established in 2004). At 30 April 2008, the Trust held 2.4m shares (2007: 1.9m shares). The
market value of the shares at 30 April 2008 was £3.1m (2007: £4.6m). Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived.
Minority interests
At the beginning of the year, the Group had a liability of £12.3m and a corresponding entry against minority interests in respect of the non-controlling
shareholders’ put option in Toscana Ondulati SpA (‘Toscana’). This amount was calculated with reference to the recent proﬁtability of the company using 
a multiple based formula. The fair value of the put options increased during the year by £3.1m. This charge was recorded within ﬁnance costs through the
income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into minority interest. 
Certain shareholders exercised their put options selling their share in Toscana to the Group for a consideration of £11.9m with £7.6m recorded in minority
interest and £4.3m recorded within goodwill.
24. Post-retirement beneﬁts 
Liability for deﬁned beneﬁt obligations
The Group operates a funded, deﬁned beneﬁt scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme (‘the Group scheme’). In 2006/07 the Group
operated a second funded, deﬁned beneﬁt scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Containers Pension Scheme (‘the Containers scheme’); the assets and liabilities
of the Containers scheme were transferred to the Group scheme on 30 April 2007, with the effect that only the Group scheme operated from 1 May 2007.
The Group made agreed annual contributions of £14.6m to the Group scheme in 2007/08 (2006/07: £14.6m). Future contributions will be in part
dependent on the results of the triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 30 April 2007 and related discussions between the Group and the Group
scheme’s trustees. The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives: these
are, in aggregate, not signiﬁcant to the Group. The ﬁnancial information given on pages 91 to 93 includes amounts related to these other arrangements,
where appropriate. A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements. The most recent
actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was as at 5 April 2004, which has been updated to 30 April 2008 by a qualiﬁed independent actuary. All UK
valuations used the projected unit method. The Group scheme is closed to new entrants. Because of this, the average age of the active members is likely 
to increase at future valuations and this may lead to an increasing current service contribution rate; this may be offset by a falling total pensionable salary
resulting from leavers and retirements.

Liability for deﬁned beneﬁt obligations
Principal actuarial assumptions are as follows:
2008 2007 2006 2005
% %%%
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.9% 5.4% 5.1% 5.3%
Inflation 3.5% 2.9% 2.7% 2.6%

Future pension increases for post 30 April 2005 service 2.3% 2.3% 2.3% 2.3%
The sensitivity of the liabilities and annual service costs in the main UK scheme to the key assumptions above is summarised below:
Increase in Increase in 
pension liability service costs
£m £m
0.25% decrease in discount rate (35.0) (1.0)
0.25% increase in inflation (35.0) (0.6)
1 year increase in life expectancy (20.0) (0.3)
Future mortality is the most signiﬁcant demographic assumption. Recent studies have disclosed a faster increase in the rate of mortality improvement than
had previously been expected. The basic mortality table used by the Group at 30 April 2008 is PMA92/PFA92 with medium cohort mortality improvement.
This means the mortality rates assumed for members of a particular age differ from those for members who will reach that age in the future. Studies have
also illustrated that the amount of pension, the location of employees and the nature of their work are signiﬁcant factors on mortality. As a result, the basic
mortality table rates are based on ages two years older than the members’ actual age for non-pensioners and three years older for pensioners.
At 30 April 2007, the Group used PMA92/PFA92 mortality tables with a three year age reduction adjustment for non-pensioners.
The current life expectancies (in years) are:
2008 2007
Male Female Male Female
Life expectancy at age 65

25. Share-based payment expense 
The Group’s share-based payment arrangements are as follows:
(i) An Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) is operated for Executive Directors and other senior executives. Approved and unapproved options are 
granted to UK and overseas executives on a phased basis. The vesting of any options granted under this Scheme is subject to the achievement of long-term
performance conditions, being that the growth in the Company’s normalised earnings per share must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices
Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three year period following grant. The base ﬁnancial year for the purposes of measuring earnings per
share growth will be the ﬁnancial year prior to the grant date. Normally, no part of the option will vest unless the long-term performance conditions have
been achieved and the vesting period of three years’ service has been attained.
(ii) In the past, Executive Directors and other senior executives received an award of shares in the Company equal in value to the participant’s annual cash
bonus, pursuant to a Restricted Share Plan (RSP). The award of these shares is dependent upon performance in the relevant ﬁnancial year. There is a 
vesting period of three years’ service. This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2004.
(iii)In September 2004, the Group established a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The key features of the plan are that: 
• awards will be made to selected Executive Directors and other senior executives over shares in the Company; performance will be measured over 
a single period of three ﬁnancial years; 
• awards will vest based on the Company’s total shareholder return (being the increase in share price and the value of reinvested dividends) compared 
to a comparator group of companies, being the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) for initial awards; 
• if the Company’s total shareholder return is ranked at the upper quartile of the comparator group or higher, the full award will vest, reducing on 
a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance. None of the award vests for below median performance; and
• additionally, no awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Company’s earnings per share growth matches 
or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.
(iv) A Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSP) is operated for Executive Directors. Shares awarded to Directors under the Plan will vest automatically if the Director
is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award.
(v) A Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan (RDSP) was awarded during the year for Mr S W Dryden. Mr Dryden was made an award of 143,404
shares on 1 April 2008, the date he joined DS Smith Plc. The award was made in exceptional circumstances due to the recruitment of Mr Dryden 
as the new Group Finance Director. The number of shares awarded was determined by reference to the value of the entitlement to shares he forfeited
under his previous arrangements with his former employer.
As discussed in section (g) of the Remuneration Report (pages 44 and 45) the Company is seeking shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting for a new Performance Share Plan to replace the ESOS and LTIP described above.

The fair value of options granted during the period, determined using a stochastic valuation model, was £2.0m (2007: £1.3m). The signiﬁcant inputs into 
the model were: share prices of £2.37 for LTIP (2007: £1.50) and £2.44 for ESOS (2007: £1.48) at the grant date; the exercise prices shown above;
standard deviation of expected share price returns of 24.1% for LTIP and 26.6% for ESOS; options life disclosed above; annual risk-free interest rate of
5.5% for LTIP and 5.4% for ESOS; and expected dividend yield of 3.6% for LTIP and 3.5% for ESOS. The volatility of share price returns measured as the
standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over a period of three to six years.

Financial Statements 30. Acquisitions and disposals
(a) New Thames and Grovehurst Energy
On 29 February 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the voting share capital of M-real New Thames Limited, which owns a paper mill in Kent, UK. On 
this date and also as part of the same acquisition, the Group acquired the balance of the voting share capital of its joint venture, Grovehurst Energy Limited,
not already owned by the Group. Grovehurst Energy provides energy and other services to the site on which the New Thames Mill operates. The joint
venture in Grovehurst Energy Limited was entered into in 1988 in connection with the Group’s acquisition of the Kemsley Mill, which is adjacent to the New
Thames Mill. The results of Grovehurst Energy have been consolidated as a subsidiary from 29 February 2008. 
The impact on the Group’s assets and liabilities was as follows:
Carrying
values before Provisional
acquisition fair values
£m £m
Intangible assets (EU emission allowances) – 5.1
Property, plant and equipment 46.8 61.2
Inventories 3.0 3.0
Trade and other receivables 1.3 12.2
Trade and other payables (2.5) (3.9)
Provisions – (7.7)
Net assets acquired 48.6 69.9
Goodwill –
Consideration 69.9
Consideration satisﬁed by:
Cash paid of £71.1m (including £1.1m of acquisition costs), being £67.4m in relation to New Thames and £3.7m for Grovehurst Energy, less cash and
cash equivalents acquired of £1.2m.
The fair value adjustments relate to the valuation of surplus EU emission allowances received as part of the acquisition; the valuation of property, plant and
equipment, as determined by an external valuation ﬁrm; recognition of a provision for an onerous service contract; and deferred and current tax assets
recognised on acquisition. Deferred tax is also recognised on the temporary timing differences created by the fair value adjustments. 
Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the year-end, the fair value adjustments are provisional; these will be ﬁnalised within 12 months of the acquisition.
New Thames and Grovehurst Energy contributed £0.1m to the Group’s proﬁt before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance
sheet date.
It is impracticable to state what the impact would have been on Group revenue and proﬁt for the year had the acquisition been completed on 1 May 2007
due to the proximity of the acquisition to the year-end and the changes to the operating arrangements of the business following its acquisition.
(b) Other acquisitions
On 4 March 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of Multigraphics Holdings Limited, a print and retail display business in the
UK, for a consideration of £6.7m. The excess of the consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired of £3.1m, which includes an intangible asset of
£2.6m recognised in relation to the value of the acquired order book (with an estimated useful life of 10 years), has been recognised as goodwill in these
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
During the year, further share capital in Toscana Ondulati SpA was acquired for £11.9m (see note 23).
On 30 September 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the voting share capital of Timmermans NV. During the year additional deferred consideration 
of £2.5m became due to the previous owners following the satisfaction of certain performance criteria of the acquired business. This amount has been
provided for in other provisions, with an equal and opposite increase to goodwill.

Company Balance Sheet Prepared in Accordance with UK GAAP
As at 30 April 2008
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 99 1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
A summary of the signiﬁcant accounting policies, which have been applied
consistently, is set out below: 
(a) Accounting basis 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable
accounting standards. 
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt
from the requirement to present its own proﬁt and loss account. 
As the results of the Company are being presented together with its
consolidated ﬁnancial statements (refer to pages 56 to 98), the Company 
has taken advantage of the exception contained in FRS 8 and has therefore
not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the
Group (or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties). 
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29
‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ not to present Company only information
as the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements comply with the requirements of this standard.
The amendment to FRS 17 ‘Retirement beneﬁts’ has been adopted for the
ﬁrst time and the disclosures it requires have been presented for both the
current and comparative period.
(b) Income recognition
Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised in the proﬁt
and loss account when declared by the subsidiary undertaking.
(c) Tangible ﬁxed assets 
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated to write
off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of all tangible 
ﬁxed assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives 
at the following rates: 
Plant, machinery, ﬁxtures and ﬁttings 3 – 5 years
(d) Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less provisions for impairment.
(e) Deferred taxation 
In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax is provided in full on timing
differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay 
more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected 
to apply when they crystallise, provided at current tax rates and based 
on current legislation. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items 
of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different
from those in which they are included in the ﬁnancial statements. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more
likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are not discounted. 
(f) Foreign currencies 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the ﬁnancial year-end.
Exchange differences arising on translation are taken to the proﬁt and  
loss account.
(g) Pension contributions 
The amounts charged to operating proﬁt in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt
arrangements are the current service costs and gains and losses on
settlements and curtailments. They are included as part of staff costs. Past
service costs are recognised immediately in the proﬁt and loss account if 
the beneﬁts have vested. If the beneﬁts have not vested immediately, the
costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs. Actuarial gains
and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised
gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured
on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a
rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond
of equivalent currency and duration to the scheme liabilities. The resulting
deﬁned beneﬁt net asset or liability, net of the related deferred tax, is
presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet. 
(h) Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are reported in accordance with FRS 26 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments, primarily interest rate,
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities
and the ﬁnancing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to, and
does not, undertake any speculative activity in these instruments. 
Such derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are accounted for as hedges when
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the
ﬁnancial instruments provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk. 
Any gains or losses arising from the hedging instruments are offset against
the hedged items. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁed as: 
– fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value
of a recognised asset or liability; and
– cash ﬂow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash ﬂows that
is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset
or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
(i) Share options 
The Company operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant
of the options is recognised as an expense. The fair value of the options
granted is measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The total amount to
be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting
conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At
each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the numbers of
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact 
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and 
a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received as a result of such options being exercised, net 
of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital
(nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.
Where applicable, the fair value of employee services received by
subsidiary undertakings within the DS Smith Plc Group in exchange 
for options granted by the Company is recognised as an expense in 
the ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiary by means of a recharge from 
the Company.

Notice of Meeting DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 107
Notes
(i) Only those Members registered in the Register of Members of the
Company as at 6 pm on 1 September 2008 shall be entitled to 
attend and vote at the Meeting in respect of the number of shares
registered in their names at that time.
(ii) Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their
rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the Meeting. A
shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual
General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the
rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.
A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. 
(iii) A Form of Proxy is enclosed. To be effective, Forms of Proxy must 
reach the Registrars at the address shown on the Form not later than 
48 hours before the time of the Meeting. Completion and return of 
the Form will not, however, prevent a Member from attending and
voting at the Meeting.
(iv) Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated
under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information
rights (a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement between them
and the shareholder by whom they were nominated, have a right to 
be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the
Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy
appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, they may, under any
such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder 
as to the exercise of voting rights.
(v) The statement of rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment 
of proxies in Notes (ii) and (iii) above does not apply to Nominated
Persons. The rights described in these paragraphs can only be
exercised by shareholders of the Company.
(vi) CREST Members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the
Meeting to be held on 3 September 2008 and any adjournment(s)
thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. 
CREST personal Members or other CREST sponsored Members, 
and those CREST Members who have appointed a voting service
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST
service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy
Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with
Euroclear’s speciﬁcations and must contain the information required 
for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message,
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the
issuer’s agent (ID 7RA01) by the latest time for receipt of proxy
appointments speciﬁed in (iii) above. For this purpose, the time of
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which 
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST
in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means. 
CREST Members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal
system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the
input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST
Member concerned to take (or, if the CREST Member is a CREST
personal Member or sponsored Member or has appointed a voting
service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular
time. In this connection, CREST Members and, where applicable, their
CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular,
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations
of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid 
a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation
35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.
(vii) As at 25 June 2008 (being the latest practicable date prior to
publication of this document), the Company’s issued share capital
consists of 393,355,893 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each.
Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 25 June 2008
are 393,355,893.
(viii)In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the 
Meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the Meeting so that 
(a) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the
Meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on 
a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate
representatives for that shareholder at the Meeting, then on a poll 
those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the
Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as 
corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and 
(b) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate
shareholder attends the Meeting but the corporate shareholder has not
appointed the Chairman of the Meeting as its corporate representative,
a designated corporate representative will be nominated from those
corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and 
the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that
designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are
referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries
and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives –
www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance
includes a sample form of representation letter if the Chairman is 
being appointed as described in (a) above.
(ix) Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection 
at the Company’s Registered Ofﬁce and at the ofﬁces of Allen & 
Overy LLP, One Bishops Square, London E1 6AO during normal
business hours and at the place of the Meeting from 11.45 am 
until its conclusion: 
(a) service contracts of the Executive Directors; 
(b) letters of appointment of the Chairman and the 
Non-Executive Directors; 
(c) the current Articles of Association; and
(d) the proposed new Articles of Association.
(x) The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees
will be available to answer relevant questions at the Meeting.

108 www.dssmith.uk.com
Resolution 3:
Approval of Report on Remuneration
As required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,
shareholder approval is sought for the Remuneration Report set out on
pages 43 to 50.
Resolutions 4 – 5:
Election of Directors
The Articles of Association of the Company require that a Director
appointed since the previous Annual General Meeting shall be subject to
election by the shareholders. Mr Adams was appointed Director with effect
from 29 January 2008 and, in accordance with the Articles, he retires from
ofﬁce at the Meeting. He is a member of the Audit Committee. Mr Dryden
was appointed a Director with effect from 1 April 2008. He is a member of
the General Purposes Committee. Being eligible they both offer themselves
for election. A biography of each Director, including those seeking election,
appears on page 39 of the Annual Report.
The Articles of Association of the Company require that all Directors who, 
at the start of business on the date which is 30 clear days prior to the date
of this Notice of Meeting, have held ofﬁce for more than 30 months since
they were last appointed or reappointed to the Company in general
meeting retire from ofﬁce but are eligible to submit themselves for re-election
by the shareholders. There are no Directors who are in this position.
Resolution 6:
Re-appointment of Auditors and Auditors’ remuneration
The auditors of a company must be re-appointed at each general meeting 
at which accounts are presented. Resolution 6 proposes the re-appointment
of the Company’s existing auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, until the next
Annual General Meeting and also gives authority to the Directors to
determine the auditors’ remuneration.
Resolution 7:
Approval of the DS Smith Performance Share Plan
The rationale for the introduction of the DS Smith Plc 2008 Performance 
Share Plan (the ‘Plan’) is set out in the Remuneration Report on page 44.
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Plan.
(a) Operation
The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company 
(the ‘Committee’) will supervise the operation of the Plan.
(b) Eligibility
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company and its
subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) will be eligible to participate in the Plan at the
discretion of the Committee.
(c) Grant of awards 
The Committee may grant awards to acquire Ordinary Shares in the
Company (‘Shares’) within six weeks of shareholder approval of the Plan
and it is intended that the ﬁrst awards will be made within this period. 
The Committee may also grant awards within six weeks of the Company’s
announcement of its results for any period and at any other time when the
Committee considers there are exceptional circumstances which justify the
granting of awards.
An award will normally be in the form of a conditional award of free Shares
which will normally vest on its third anniversary subject to the satisfaction of
performance conditions and the continued employment of the participant
within the Group. The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based
awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-
based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so. 
An award may not be granted more than ten years after shareholder
approval of the Plan.
No payment is required for the grant of an award. Awards are not
transferable, except on death. Awards are not pensionable.
(d) Individual limit
An employee may not receive awards in any ﬁnancial year over Shares
having a market value in excess of 150% of his annual base salary in 
that ﬁnancial year. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or
retention, this limit is increased to 200% of an employee’s annual base
salary. The Committee intends to grant initial awards at the 150% level 
to the Executive Directors of the Company and at generally lower levels 
for other executives.
(e) Performance conditions
The vesting of awards will be subject to performance conditions set by 
the Committee.
For the initial awards which are due to be made to those employees with
Group-related roles (which includes the Company’s Executive Directors),
each award will be subject to three equally weighted performance
measures comprising: (i) total shareholder return (‘TSR’) relative to the
constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the 
FTSE 250; (ii) average adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’); and (iii) average
adjusted return on average capital employed (‘ROACE’). In each case,
performance will be measured over three ﬁnancial years starting on 
1 May 2008. Vesting of the awards will be as follows:
Percentage vesting as Average
a proportion of that Average adjusted
element of the award Relative TSR adjusted EPS ROACE
100% Upper quartile 19.0p 12.5%
Between Between Between Between
25% and median and 16.5p 11.5%
100% upper quartile and 19.0p and 12.5%
25% Median 16.5p 11.5%
The Company’s TSR will be compared with the TSR of each of the
companies in the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the 
FTSE 250 as at the date of grant of the award. Relative TSR performance
will be assessed using a 60-day averaging period before the beginning and
the end of the three-year measurement period.
The EPS measure will be based on the average adjusted EPS as reported 
in the Annual Report over the three-year measurement period. The
Committee may adjust the EPS ﬁgure in exceptional circumstances.
The ROACE measure will be based on the average adjusted Group
operating proﬁt divided by the monthly average of capital employed 
in the year, measured over the three-year measurement period.
Executives working in one of the four separate Business Segments of the
Group will have a different set of measures, reﬂecting responsibility for
performance in their own segment. One-third of these awards will be based
on the Company’s relative TSR performance as described above, but the
remaining two-thirds will be based, as to one-third on the average adjusted
operating proﬁt for the relevant business segment, and as to the ﬁnal third
on the average adjusted ROACE for the same business segment.
The Committee may set different performance conditions from those
described above for future awards provided that, in the reasonable opinion
of the Committee, the new targets are not materially less challenging in the
circumstances than those described above.
The Committee may also vary the performance conditions applying to
existing awards if an event or events occur which causes the Committee 
to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance
conditions, provided the Committee considers the varied conditions are 
fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original
conditions would have been but for the event or events in question. While 
it is expected that this power to vary the performance conditions is most
likely to be used to reﬂect technical events such as a variation in share
capital or a change in accounting standards, if the Committee wanted 
Notice of Meeting DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 109
to use the power to take account of a signiﬁcant acquisition or disposal then
it would ﬁrst consult with the Company’s major shareholders.
(f) Vesting of awards
Awards normally vest three years after grant to the extent that the applicable
performance conditions (see above) have been satisﬁed and provided the
participant is still employed in the Group.
(g) Dividend equivalents
The Committee may decide that participants will receive a payment (in cash
and/or Shares) on or shortly following the vesting of their awards, of an
amount based on the dividends that would have been paid on those Shares
between the time when the awards were granted and the time when they
vest. The amount of the payment may take into account reinvestment of the
notional dividends. Alternatively, participants may have their awards
increased as if dividends were paid on the Shares subject to their award
and then reinvested in further Shares.
(h) Leaving employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold
employment or be a Director within the Group. However, if a participant
ceases to be an employee or Director because of his death, injury,
disability, retirement, redundancy, his employing company or the business
for which he works being sold out of the Group or in other circumstances 
at the discretion of the Committee, then his award will normally vest on 
the normal vesting date. The extent to which an award will vest in these
situations will depend upon: (i) the extent to which the performance
conditions have been satisﬁed over the normal performance period; and 
(ii) the pro-rating of the award to reﬂect any reduced period of time
between the ﬁrst day of the performance period and the date of cessation,
although the Committee can decide not to pro-rate an award if it regards it
as inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.
If a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the Group for one
of the ‘good leaver’ reasons speciﬁed above, the Committee can decide, 
in exceptional circumstances, that his award will vest on the date of leaving
employment or ofﬁce. The extent to which an award will vest in this situation
will depend upon: (i) the extent to which the performance conditions are, in
the opinion of the Committee, satisﬁed after it has taken into account past
performance and, where appropriate, expected future performance over 
the remainder of the relevant performance period; and (ii) pro-rating by
reference to the time of cessation as described above. 
(i) Corporate events
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or winding up of the
Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation) all awards will
vest early subject to: (i) the extent to which the performance conditions are,
in the opinion of the Committee, satisﬁed after it has taken into account past
performance and, where appropriate, expected future performance over the
remainder of the relevant performance period; and (ii) the pro-rating of the
awards to reﬂect any reduced period of time between the ﬁrst day of the
performance period and their vesting, although the Committee can decide
not to pro-rate an award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the
particular circumstances.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be
replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company
unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on the basis which
would apply in the case of a takeover.
(j) Participants’ rights 
Awards will not confer any shareholder rights until they have vested and 
the participants have received their Shares.
(k) Rights attaching to Shares
Any Shares allotted when an award vests will rank equally with Shares 
then in issue (except for rights arising by reference to a record date prior 
to their allotment).
(l) Variation of capital
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or in the event
of a demerger, payment of a special dividend or similar event which
materially affects the market price of the Shares, the Committee may make
such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the number of Shares subject
to an award.
(m) Overall Plan limits
The Plan may operate over new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares
purchased in the market. In any ten calendar year period, the Company
may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than:
(a) 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the
Plan and any other employee share plan adopted by the Company; and
(b) 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the
Plan and any other executive share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purposes of these
limits unless institutional investors decide that they need not count.
(n) Alterations to the Plan
The Committee may, at any time, amend the Plan in any respect, provided
that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for any amendments 
that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing
eligibility, limits on participation, the overall limits on the issue of Shares 
or the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for determining a participant’s
entitlement to, and the terms of, the Shares or cash to be acquired and the
adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not,
however, apply to any minor alteration made to beneﬁt the administration 
of the Plan, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or
maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for
participants or for any company in the Group. Shareholder approval will
also not be required for any amendments to any performance condition
applying to an award.
(o) Overseas plans
This Resolution to approve the Plan will allow the Board to establish further
plans for overseas territories, any such plan to be similar to the Plan, but
modiﬁed to take account of local tax, exchange control or securities laws,
provided that any Shares made available under such further plans are
treated as counting against the limits on individual and overall participation
in the Plan. The rules of the Plan include a schedule to allow the grant of
French tax-advantaged awards. This schedule makes minor modiﬁcations

Resolution 8:
Directors’ authority to allot shares
Authority was granted to the Directors at last year’s Annual General
Meeting, pursuant to Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, to allot 
shares in the Company without the prior consent of shareholders. Resolution
8, which will be proposed as an ordinary resolution, will, if passed, give
the Directors renewed authority to allot shares up to a maximum nominal
value of £11,013,965 (representing approximately 28% of the issued share
capital of the Company on 25 June 2008, being the latest practicable date
prior to publication of this document).
Other than in connection with any exercise of options under the Group’s
employee share option schemes, the Directors have no present intention of
exercising the allotment authority proposed by this Resolution. This authority
will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting, or, if
earlier, on 2 December 2009, except in so far as commitments to allot
shares have been entered into before that date. It is the present intention 
of the Directors to seek a similar authority annually.
Resolution 9:
Directors’ power to disapply pre-emption rights 
This Resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, supplements the Directors’ authority to allot shares in the Company (proposed by
Resolution 8). Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 requires a company
proposing to allot equity securities for cash to offer them ﬁrst to existing
shareholders pro rata to their existing shareholdings. Authority was granted
to the Directors at last year’s Annual General Meeting and the Directors
propose to seek shareholders’ approval to renew this authority, pursuant 
to Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985, to allot such securities,
notwithstanding the requirement imposed by Section 89, in two cases:
– in connection with a rights issue; and
– allotments of shares for cash up to a total nominal value of £1,966,779
(representing approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital 
at 25 June 2008, being the latest practicable date prior to publication 
of this document) although it is not intended without prior consultation 
with the investment committee of the Association of British Insurers to issue
or transfer in this way more than 7.5% of the share capital in a rolling
three-year period. This gives the Directors ﬂexibility to take advantage of
business opportunities as they arise, including the sale of any shares the
Company has purchased and held in treasury, whilst the 5% limit ensures
that existing shareholders’ interests are protected, and is in line with
guidelines issued by institutional investors’ bodies.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General
Meeting, or, if earlier, on 2 December 2009, except in so far as
commitments to allot shares have been entered into before that date. It is 
the present intention of the Directors to seek a similar authority annually.
Resolution 10:
Company’s authority to purchase shares
This Resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks to
renew the existing authority for the Company to purchase its own shares in
the market. This authority gives the Company greater ﬂexibility in managing
its capital resources. The Directors have no speciﬁc intention of using this
authority and would do so only when, in the light of market conditions, they
believed that the effect of such purchases would be to increase earnings 
per share, and that the purchases were in the interests of shareholders
generally. The Directors would also give careful consideration to gearing
levels of the Company and its general ﬁnancial position. The purchase 
price would be paid out of distributable proﬁts. Resolution 10 speciﬁes 
the maximum number of shares which may be purchased (representing
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital at 30 April
2008, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this
document), the minimum and maximum prices at which they may be 
bought and when the authority will expire, reﬂecting the requirements 
of the Companies Act 1985 and the Listing Rules of the FSA.
The maximum price at which the shares may be purchased is the higher of
5% above the average of the middle market values of those shares for the
ﬁve business days before the purchase is made and the amount stipulated
by Article 5(1) of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003.
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations
2003 enable certain listed companies to hold shares in treasury, as an
alternative to cancelling them, following a purchase of own shares by the
Company in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. Shares held in
treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used to satisfy
share options and share awards under the Company’s share schemes. 
Once held in treasury, the Company is not entitled to exercise any rights,
including the right to attend and vote at meetings, in respect of those shares.
Further, no dividend or distribution of the Company’s assets may be made 
to the Company in respect of those shares whilst held in treasury.
Accordingly, if the Directors exercise the authority conferred by Resolution
10, the Company will have the option of holding those shares in treasury
rather than cancelling them. The total number of ordinary shares that are
under option through the Company’s share option schemes at 25 June 2008
(being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice) is
7,007,554 of which 5,980,440 are options over unissued ordinary shares.
The proportion of issued ordinary share capital that the options over
unissued ordinary shares represented on this date was 1.52% and the
proportion of issued ordinary share capital that they will represent if the 
full authority to purchase shares (existing and being sought) is used is
1.38%. The authority will expire on 2 December 2009 or at the conclusion
of the next Annual General Meeting (whichever is the earlier). It is the
present intention of the Directors to seek a similar authority annually.
Resolution 11:
Adoption of new Articles
It is proposed to ask shareholders to approve, with effect from 1 October 2008,
a number of amendments to the Company’s current Articles of Association
primarily to reﬂect certain provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
‘CA 2006’).
Resolution 11 proposes to adopt new Articles of Association (the ‘New
Articles’) with effect from 1 October 2008. These update the Company’s
current Articles of Association (the ‘Current Articles’) primarily to take
account of changes in English company law brought about by certain
provisions of the CA 2006.
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are set out below.
Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature, have
not been noted.
(a) Articles which duplicate statutory provisions
Provisions in the Current Articles which reﬂect provisions contained in 
the Companies Act 1985 are amended to bring them into line with 
the equivalent provisions contained in the CA 2006. Examples of such
provisions, including provisions relating to proxies and to convening 
and notice of general meetings, are detailed below.
(b) Form of resolution
The Current Articles contain a provision that, subject to legislation 
where for any purpose an ordinary resolution is required, a special or
extraordinary resolution is also effective and that, where an extraordinary
resolution is required, a special resolution is also effective. This provision
and certain other provisions are being amended as the concept of
extraordinary resolutions has not been retained under the CA 2006.
(c) Convening and notice of general meetings
It is proposed that the provisions in the Current Articles dealing with
convening of general meetings and the length of notice required to 
convene general meetings be amended to conform to the new provisions 
in the CA 2006. In particular, a general meeting (other than an annual
general meeting) to consider a special resolution can be convened on 
14 days’ notice whereas previously 21 days’ notice was required.
(d) Quorum requirements
The CA 2006 provides that in general terms the quorum for a general
meeting be calculated by reference to the numbers of ‘qualifying persons’
who are present at the meeting, which includes an individual who is a
member of the Company, a person authorised under Section 323 of the CA
2006 to act as the representative of a corporation, and a person appointed
as proxy of a member. As before, it is proposed that the quorum for a
general meeting will be two but in line with the CA 2006, the New Articles
make clear that there will be no double counting for qualifying persons who
are representatives of the same corporation or proxies of the same member.
(e) Proxies
A proxy has a statutory right under the CA 2006 to speak at any general
meeting. Under the CA 2006, proxies are also entitled to vote on a show 
of hands whereas under the Current Articles proxies are only entitled to vote
on a poll. Multiple proxies may be appointed to exercise the rights attached
to a different share held by the shareholder. The New Articles reﬂect these
new rules, as appropriate.
(f) Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The cap on aggregate fees payable to Non-Executive Directors is being
110 www.dssmith.uk.com
Notice of Annual General Meeting 2008 continued 
Notice of Meeting increased to £750,000 per annum. The Remuneration Committee believes
that this increase will ensure that the Company will continue in the future to
have the ability to appoint and retain the best Non-Executive Directors.
(g) Electronic and web communications
Provisions of the CA 2006 which came into force in January 2007 enable
companies to communicate with members by electronic and/or website
communications. The New Articles continue to allow communications to
members in electronic form and, in addition, they also permit the 
Company to take advantage of the new provisions relating to website
communications. Before the Company can communicate with a member 
by means of website communication, the relevant member must be asked
individually by the Company to agree that the Company may send or
supply documents or information to him by means of a website, and the
Company must either have received a positive response or have received 
no response within the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which
the request was sent. The Company will notify the member (either in writing,
or by other permitted means) when a relevant document or information is
placed on the website and a member can always request a hard copy
version of the document or information. It is not currently envisaged that the
Company will utilise this authority to communicate with members by means
of website communication.
(h) Directors’ indemnities
The CA 2006 has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of a
company to indemnify directors. This is reﬂected in the New Articles. The
opportunity is also being taken to clarify that, subject to the CA 2006, the
Company may grant indemnities to directors of associated companies.
(i) Directors’ interests
The CA 2006 sets out directors’ general duties. The provisions largely 
codify the existing law, but with some changes. Under the CA 2006, from 
1 October 2008, a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or can
have, a direct or indirect interest that conﬂicts, or possibly may conﬂict with
the Company’s interests. The requirement is very broad and could apply, for
example, if a Director becomes a director of another company or a trustee
of another organisation. The CA 2006 allows directors of public companies
to authorise conﬂicts and potential conﬂicts where the articles of association
contain a provision to this effect. The CA 2006 also allows the articles of
association to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conﬂicts 
of interest to avoid a breach of duty. The New Articles, which will take
effect on and from 1 October 2008, give the Directors authority to approve
such situations and to include other provisions to allow conﬂicts of interest 
to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position.
There are safeguards which will apply when Directors decide whether 
to authorise a conﬂict or potential conﬂict. These include ﬁrstly, only
independent Directors (i.e. those who have no interest in the matter being
considered) will be able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in
taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good
faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. The Directors
will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation or
subsequently if they think this is appropriate.
It is proposed to include provisions relating to conﬁdential information,
attendance at Board meetings and availability of Board papers to protect 
a Director being in breach of duty if a conﬂict of interest or potential conﬂict
of interest arises. These provisions will only apply where the position giving
rise to the potential conﬂict has previously been authorised by the Directors.
A copy of the New Articles and a copy of the Current Articles marked to
show changes being proposed by resolution 11 are available for inspection
as noted in Note (ix) above.
Due to the phased nature of implementation of the CA 2006, it is likely that
further related changes to the Articles of Association will be proposed at a
subsequent Annual General Meeting.
Recommendation
Your Directors believe that all the proposals to be considered at the 
Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and 
its shareholders and recommend shareholders to vote in favour of the
resolutions. The Directors will be voting in favour of the resolutions in 
respect of their own shareholdings.

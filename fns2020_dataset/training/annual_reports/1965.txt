our expectations for the year.  The average
selling price of homes increased to £171,959
from £150,466 in 2005 as a result of
changes in the mix of properties sold and a
4.1% increase in the price per square foot of
units sold in the year.
One of the most significant achievements in
2006 has been the increase in the number
of plots held for future development. The
land bank has risen to 2,850 plots (2005:
2,030) with a further 209 plots under
contract. This expansion in the land bank
has been financed from our existing bank
facilities and those borrowings are
satisfactorily matched against the value of
the land held for development.
We have a strong and skilled management
team and I wish to thank all our employees
for their efforts during the past year.
Board Changes
As we have already announced both
Stephen North and Brian Leesing retired
from the Board during the year and I would
like, on behalf of the Board, to extend our
sincere thanks for their contributions to the
Company. I would also like to welcome
both Malcolm McDowell and Nick
Godfrey to the Board.  Malcolm replaces
Brian as an independent non-executive
director and chairman of the Audit
Committee, whilst Nick assumed the role
of Finance Director and Company Secretary
on Stephen North’s retirement.
Future Prospects
The housing market remains competitive in
our area of operations.  The impact of
recent rises in interest rates on the demand
for new homes is so far uncertain but it is
possible that this monetary tightening will
deter some first time buyers from entering
the market and this will have a knock on
dampening effect on the demand for all
new homes. Recent competitive tenders for
land have indicated that the cost of land is
increasing significantly faster than house
price inflation and this factor, together with
Results
Your Company has continued to grow in
2006 and has achieved record revenue,
completions of new homes and size of land
bank.
Revenue increased by 18.6% to £122.4m
from £103.2m in the previous year from
the sale of 712 homes as against 686 in
2005. 
Profit before taxation was £11.2m
compared with £12.7m in 2005, partly as a
result of an additional £1.8m interest
charge incurred in financing the significant
increase in our future land bank. At the
operating level, Operating Profits increased
to £16.4m from £16.1m, although margins
declined to 13.4% from 15.6%, as the
volume growth was achieved through the
increased use of incentives and we incurred
certain one-off costs within overheads.
As a result Earnings per Share fell by 13%
to 65.4p (2005: 75.2p).
Review of Operations
2006 was a challenging year in our region
of operations with buyers requiring a
higher level of incentives than in recent
years. Against this background the increase
in sales was hard won and slightly short of

receive the final dividend of 12p per
ordinary share on 4 May 2007. 
Strategic Review
It was announced on 21 February 2007
that the Company is considering its
strategic options, which may or may not
lead to the Company seeking an offer for
the entire issued share capital of Ben
Bailey Plc.
This review of strategic options is ongoing
and the Company is not presently in
discussions with any potential offerors.
There is no certainty that any sale process
will be undertaken or that if it is, any offer
for the Company will be forthcoming. A
further announcement will be made in
due course.
Richard Bailey 23 February 2007
Chairman
the cost of certain raw materials rising at
well in excess of the general rate of
inflation, may impact on our future
operating margins.
The continuing imbalance between the
demand for and supply of homes in the UK
appears no closer to resolution. However, the
Company has a broad range of homes sited in
attractive locations backed by a strong four
year land bank and this gives us confidence 
in the medium term in delivering satisfactory
returns to shareholders in the future. Our
forward order book for 2007 is also
encouraging - at the date of this report we
already have reservations for 41% of our
forecast output for 2007. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend for
2006 of 12p per share, which together with
the interim dividend of 6p per share paid in
September 2006, will make a total dividend
of 18p for 2006. This is an increase of 20%
compared with 2005 and is a reflection of
the Board’s confidence in the future.

Chief Executive’s Review
4
Your Company continued to move forward
in 2006 with record revenue achieved from
712 unit completions – another record
output of new homes. These achievements
have improved gross profits to £23.7m from
£22.1m in 2006, although higher finance
charges and overhead costs have reduced
our pre-tax profits to £11.2m from £12.7m
in 2006.
Our continued investment in development
land – up from 2,030 plots last year to 2,850
plots at the end of 2006 – has caused the
increased finance costs necessary to secure a
four year landholding. This will form a
solid base from which the Company can
plan ahead with greater certainty in an
increasingly complex planning
environment.
The Market
Selling became more difficult as the year
progressed and two interest rate increases
compounded the difficulty. Demand for our
new homes remained strong, but we had to
manage customers’ expectations of values
on their existing properties as they traded-
up. Increasing the use of sales incentives
and allowances to maintain throughput
became necessary as customers expected
inducements in order to trade. These costs
affected margin and coupled with plot sales
to investors caused our operating margin to
fall to 13.4% from 15.6% in 2005.
Revenue
T otal revenue for 2006, all of which was
derived from the sale of new homes, was
£122.4m, an increase of 18.6% over the
2005 figure of £103.2 m.
The Company sold 712 homes in the year
(2005: 686) an increase of 3.8%. Average
selling prices increased 14.3% to £171,959
largely as a result of the increased
proportion of larger detached houses and
fewer affordable homes. The analysis of the
change in mix is shown below.
Mix 2006 2005
4/5 Bed Detached Houses 256 193
2/3/4 Bed T ownhouses 359 403
Apartments 72 26
Affordables 19 47
Bungalows/Conversions 6 17
T otal 712 686
The average price per square foot across
the product range increased by 4.1% to
£154.
The completions of new homes in the year
came from a total of 47 sites spanning
Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire
and Derbyshire, half of which were from
developments completed during the year.
We have an established expertise and long
record of developing brownfield sites and
in 2006 72% of homes sold were from
previously brownfield sites (2005: 73 %).

Profits 
Gross profit was £23.7m - 7.0% ahead of
last year’s £22.1m but gross margin fell
from 21.4% to 19.3%.
The year was a challenging one with an
increased use of incentives being required
to achieve sales and a higher proportion of
sales to investors. Overheads increased
from £6.1m to £7.3m in 2006 partly due to
one-off costs relating to the various board
changes, higher pension costs and costs
relating to the proposed relocation of head
office. These factors coupled with rising
build costs depressed the operating margin
which fell to 13.4% (2005:15.6%).
Balance Sheet
The total capital employed at December
2006 was £124.7m, an increase of 30.5%
over the year before. Stocks, comprising
land and work in progress increased over
50% from £112.9m to £169.8m at the end
of 2006. Shareholders’ equity was £47.4m
equivalent to 396.5p per ordinary share.
Land Bank
We have been successful in building up the
land bank despite a very competitive land
market in our region, with several new
entrants trying to establish a presence in the
area.
Plots held with planning permission at the
end of 2006 totalled 2,850 compared with
2,030 at December 2005. At the 2006 level
of completions this represents 4.0 years
supply up from 3.0 years at the end of
2005. In addition we have a further 209
plots which are under contract.
Expenditure on land in 2006 totalled
£69.6m.

Ben Bailey Plc
Borrowings 
The increased investment in the land bank
was largely financed by increased
borrowings. Net debt at 31 December 2006
was £77.3m (2005: £54.8m), which equates
to net gearing of 163.0% (2005: 134.7%).
The average net debt in the year was
£72.7m.
Treasury and Interest Rate Risk
The Company finances its activities
through a mixture of shareholder funds and
debt. As part of the annual review of
facilities the Company has this month
signed a new overdraft facility which
supports the profile of the cash
requirements of the Company over the
next 12 months. On signing, the facility
increased to £45m and reduces back down
to £30m on 1 October 2007 for the balance
of the term. In addition the Company has a
committed term facility of £65m.
The Company has a policy to manage its
interest rate exposure through interest rate
swap agreements. During 2006 we have
entered into two interest rate swap
agreements which fix interest on £50m of
debt at 5.2%. The Company’s interest
expense is thus largely protected from
interest rate rises.
Risks to the Business
The Board reviews the principal risks to the
business on an ongoing basis. Major risks
that have been identified include:
• Impact of increased interest rates on
demand for new homes.
• Reduction in the level of employment
in the region of operation.
• Continued availability of land to
maintain ongoing business.
• Impact on build costs caused by
availability of skilled labour and
materials costs rising above general
inflation.

Health and Safety
The Company works hard to uphold its
good record in health and safety.
Construction management liaise closely
with our external advisers and regular
seminars are held to reinforce the
Company’s commitment.
Staff Training 
We continue to make a significant
investment in the craft based
apprenticeships of bricklaying and joinery
with a further 12 new recruits in 2006.
Time and money spent on their close
supervision in their early years with us is
repaid with loyalty through a high retention
rate.
Head Office staff are encouraged to
continue their vocational training and many
do so in their own time through evening
studies.
Design and Development
A number of new houses and apartments
have been prototyped in 2006 and now
form part of our sales product range.
The constant raising of building standards
affecting such factors as noise, energy
conservation and  sustainable drainage
solutions now means that the designs of all
our range have to be regularly revisited for
best practice to be achieved.
The Government has an increasingly green
agenda and has already asked our industry
to build carbon free homes within the next
10 years. Such demands ask a great deal of
our suppliers and sub-contractors and cost
pressures are evident.
People
The year’s results could not have been
achieved without the commitment,
enthusiasm and hard work of all our
employees, sub-contractors and
consultants, together with the continued
support of our customers and shareholders
and I would like to express the Board’s
gratitude to all those members of the team.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the persons who are directors at the time when the report is approved, the
following applies: 
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s
auditors are unaware, and
• he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that
information. 
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a
resolution that they be re-appointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
A notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company at 12 noon on 27 April 2007 at the
Doncaster Holiday Inn is set out on pages 47 to 48, and a proxy form for use in relation to such meeting
accompanies this document. Your attention is drawn to the items of special business, being resolutions
8 and 9 set out in such Notice of Meeting.
Resolution 8
Under Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985, if the directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares
for cash, they must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to the number of shares they
each hold at that time. Resolution 8, a special resolution, proposes to grant limited power to the directors
to allot shares for cash without the need to first offer them to existing shareholders. The power being
sought will permit the directors to deal with problems arising from fractional entitlements in any rights
issue, to allot shares pursuant to the Company's Executive Share Option Schemes and to allot up to
598,169 shares (representing approximately five per cent of the current issued share capital as at the date
of this document) and will expire no later than fifteen months from the passing of the resolution. The
directors intend to comply with the cumulative limits on exercise of the disapplication entitlement
which are contained in the Pre-Emption Group guidelines of the Investment Committees.
Resolution 9
This resolution seeks authority from shareholders for the Company to purchase up to 1,196,339
ordinary shares, an aggregate nominal amount of £119,634, which is equivalent to approximately 10% of
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at 31 December 2006. The authority will expire on the
earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or 27 October 2008 and the resolution
specifies the maximum and minimum prices at which the shares may be bought. Other investment
opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall financial position of the Company will be taken
into account before deciding upon this course of action. Any shares purchased in this way will be
cancelled and the number of shares in issue will accordingly be reduced. The directors have no
immediate intention of exercising the proposed authority when it becomes effective, but believe that the
ability of the Company to buy its own shares if, in the directors’ opinion, market prices do not reflect
the Company’s worth, will be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The directors
intend to exercise this power only if they believe the effect of such purchases will increase earnings per
ordinary share.

(Chairman of the Committee), A M Peacock and C M McDowell. 
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) decides the remuneration policy that
applies to executive directors and the Group’s other senior management. In determining that policy, it
has given full consideration to the principles of the Combined Code.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee considers the basic salary and benefits available to
executive directors of comparable companies both in size and within the housebuilding sector.  
The Remuneration Committee takes into account the need to attract and retain directors of an
appropriate calibre and the need to ensure the commitment of executive directors to the continued
success of the Company. No external consultants were used by the Committee in the year in advising
the Remuneration Committee on remuneration policy. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee will be available for inspection at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
These parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report are unaudited.
Remuneration of non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each receive a fee for their services which is approved by the Board,
following recommendation by the Chairman of the Company. The level of remuneration paid to non-
executive directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities required by the role.
The non-executive directors do not receive any pension or other benefits from the Company, nor do
they participate in any of the bonus or incentive schemes or share option schemes.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company . They are appointed on the
basis of serving at least a period of one year.
Remuneration policy for all executive directors
The Group provides competitive remuneration packages in order to attract, retain and motivate
executives who are expected to meet high levels of performance. The structure of the remuneration
package has been designed to:
• ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and long-term
incentives) constitute a significant proportion of an executive’s performance criteria, which are
aligned to the interests of shareholders; and
• provide employment related benefits including the provision of a company car, life assurance,
medical insurance and pension.
Salaries and benefits
The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive
directors.

Share options
Throughout the year the Company has operated an Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option
Scheme and an Unapproved Executive Scheme. These arrangements, which were established in 1998,
were approved at the 1998 Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Following changes to the relevant legislation in 1996, the maximum value of shares over which options
may be granted under an Inland Revenue approved scheme to any one individual may not exceed
£30,000. The Unapproved Scheme will enable additional options to be granted to employees and
directors on an unapproved basis in excess of this limit. However, the Remuneration Committee has
imposed a limit on the grant of options under this scheme to any one individual. T aking into account
options granted to an individual in the previous ten years, under any option scheme of the Company,
options granted under the Unapproved Scheme to that individual may not exceed four times his
remuneration for the current or preceding financial year. 
Options granted under the Approved Scheme will normally be exercisable within the period of between
three to ten years after the date of grant and, for options granted under the Unapproved Scheme, within
three to seven years. In establishing the executive schemes, the Committee has decided to subject grants
made under the Approved and Unapproved Schemes to performance criteria, such that options may
only be exercised if, over a consecutive three year period, there has been a growth in the Company’s basic
earnings per share in excess of the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% per annum. Options granted under the
Approved Scheme are not offered at a discount.
The Committee supports employee participation in the Company through employee share schemes and
believes that these schemes play a useful role in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders.
Annual and long term bonus scheme
The Company operates an annual and long term bonus scheme (“the Bonus Scheme”) for the executive
directors, including B R Bailey , the Chairman of the Company . The Bonus Scheme runs for a fixed three
year period to 31 December 2008. It is linked to the amount by which the average annual growth in the
Company’s basic earnings per share (“EPS”) exceeds the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum over the
three year period.  Basic earnings per share is believed to be an appropriate measure for growth given the
size and structure of the Company.   
The key elements of the Bonus Scheme are:
a) A discretionary annual bonus based upon the achievement of certain financial and operational
targets set by the Remuneration Committee. The amount of such bonus shall not exceed 20% of
the executive director’s basic salary for the year;
b) An annual bonus based on the percentage increase in the Group’s earnings per share. The
percentage bonus payable will be reduced by the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index for
the same period plus 3% and the resulting rate will be applied to 60% of the executive director’s
basic salary for that accounting period.  The bonus so calculated shall be reduced by the amount
of any bonus awarded under a) above; and
c) The final bonus is paid at the end of the three year period and will be based upon the average
annual EPS growth factor for the period and applied to basic annual salary , less any annual bonuses
paid under the Bonus Scheme. Over the three year period, the maximum bonus payable to any
director shall not exceed three times the executive director’s average basic salary for the three year
period.

The service contract of B R Bailey is subject to one year’s notice of termination by the Company and
one year’s notice of termination by B R Bailey.
The service contract of  P A Russell is subject to one year’s notice of termination by the Company and
six months’ notice of termination by P A Russell.
The service contracts of B R Bailey and P A Russell are rolling one year contracts.
The services of N J Godfrey are supplied under an interim management contract by Odgers Interim, a
trading division of International Resources Group Limited, which is terminable by either party giving
one month’s written notice.
Total shareholder return
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act requires the Company to publish in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report a line graph which shows the total shareholder return on a holding of the Company’s shares
against a holding of hypothetical shares measured by reference to a broad equity index.  T otal shareholder
return is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders reflecting share
price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is, therefore, considered to be a good
indicator of a company’s overall performance.
The performance chart shown below illustrates the Company’s total return over the past five years
compared to the performance of the Small Capital Index, which the Remuneration Committee believes
to be the most appropriate index to be used given the size of the Company.

Corporate Governance
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
Following the publication of the Combined Code (2003) which is appended to the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority (“the Code”), the Board has continued to review its Corporate Governance
practices and an explanation of how the Principles of Good Governance have been applied are contained in
this report and the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 12 to 16 .
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good governance and this statement describes
how the relevant principles of governance are applied to the Company and the Company’s compliance with
the code provisions set out in Part 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board considers that, throughout the period under review, the Company has complied with the
provisions recommended in Section 1 of the Combined Code with the following exception:
• B R Bailey, Chairman and executive director of the Board, has been a member of the Audit
Committee.
Group Objectives and Board of Directors
The objective of the Group is to build quality homes at realistic prices for its customers whilst securing the
optimum return from its assets for the benefit of its shareholders.
The Board comprises three Non-Executive Directors who are all considered to be independent. The Board
considers that the current composition provides an appropriate segregation of responsibilities and
independent non-executive director representation for the current size of the Group. One third of directors,
including Non-Executive Directors, are subject to retirement by rotation annually .
Individual profiles of the directors are given on page 8. The Board has the necessary knowledge and
experience to achieve the stated objectives of the Group and retain effective control over the Group.
Board Practices
The Board meets regularly on a formal basis and not less than eight times per annum to monitor the
performance of the Group, to authorise capital expenditure and purchases of land, to approve annual budgets
and to monitor business performance.  Strategy on interest rate exposures is approved by the Board.  In the
year ended 31 December 2006, the Board met sixteen times. Information is provided to the Board in a
detailed and timely manner in order to allow informed decisions to be taken on all matters.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of reserved powers as well as an agreed procedure for a director
to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense, and to have full access to the
services of the Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that the Board procedures
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. Directors’ and Officers’ Liability
Insurance is in place for directors and officers. This insurance does not cover any fraudulent or dishonest
actions.
The Board is scheduled to hold ten meetings in 2007 and ad hoc meetings may be convened to deal with
urgent matters.

The responsibilities of the Audit Committee, which meets three times a year, include the appointment of
and liaison with external auditors, the review of annual and interim financial statements and the review of
the suitability and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. The Committee reviews the findings of the
external auditors and reviews key accounting policies and judgements.  It also reviews the independence of
the external auditors on an annual basis.
The fees relating to non-audit services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are disclosed in note 6 to
the accounts. The main area of non-audit work relates to the provision of taxation compliance work and
taxation advice. The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of non-audit work and has concluded that this
level of fee does not affect the independence of the audit.

The responsibilities of the Nominations Committee include the identification and recommendation to the

Board Remuneration
The Group’s Remuneration Committee decides the remuneration policy that applies to executive directors
and senior management of the Group. In setting the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee
considers the basic salary and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies, the need to
attract and retain directors of an appropriate calibre, and the need to ensure the commitment of executive
directors to the continued success of the Group. Bonus packages for executive directors are linked to the
Group’s objective of securing optimum return from its assets for the benefit of its shareholders. No director
participates in the decision on his own remuneration.
Shareholder Communication
The majority of the shareholders of the Group are private individuals. Presentations to City Analysts have
been made in the past year by the Chief Executive and Finance Director. All shareholders are welcome to
attend the Annual General Meeting at which they have the opportunity to ask questions of the Board.
Performance Evaluation
During 2006, the Board undertook performance evaluations of the Board and its principal committees. This
process will be repeated on an annual basis.
This performance evaluation covered assessment of the working of the Board and assessment of each
individual director’s contribution to the working of the Board. The appraisals of Non-Executive Directors
were carried out by the Chairman.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director are subject to an appraisal of their performance as executive
directors which is conducted by the Chairman and the Chief Executive respectively .  
Going Concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements.
62504 Ben Bailey 09-48  12/3/07  10:37  Page 19 20 Ben Bailey Plc
Corporate Governance (continued) 
Internal Control
The Group’s control environment is the responsibility of the Group’s directors and managers at all levels.
The Board is, therefore, responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Although no control system can provide absolute protection against material mis-statement or
loss, it is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide the directors
with reasonable assurance that problems should be identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately .
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control throughout the period
and up to the date of this report. In accordance with the T urnbull Guidance, the Group has reviewed its
operations and identified risk areas, which have been assessed for their potential impact on the business.  
The size of the Group, together with the fact that virtually all of the Group’s operations derive from one
company , Ben Bailey Homes Limited, allows the Executive Directors of the Group to monitor performance,
evaluate and manage on a continual basis the risks faced by the Group. No internal audit function is
considered necessary . The need for an internal audit function is reviewed annually .
The key features of the Group’s internal controls are as follows:
• Defined authorisation levels for the purchases of land and capital expenditure.
• Defined authorisation levels for the placing of orders and contracts.
• A formalised reporting structure which includes the setting of detailed annual budgets, which are
updated on a regular basis to form forecasts and which are reviewed by the Board.
• Bi-monthly Board/Executive Meetings are held within Ben Bailey Homes Limited at which all key
aspects of the business are discussed including comparison of actual performance with budgets.
• A monthly meeting is held within Ben Bailey Homes Limited to review the production progress on
all sites, sales position, technical and development issues arising from each development.  
• All sites are visited on a monthly basis by the Group Chairman together with the Construction,
Development and Sales Directors of Ben Bailey Homes Limited to review progress on site. 
During 2006, the Non-Executive Directors have on one occasion attended these site visits.
• The Group’s reporting systems provide weekly updates on key statistics including sales, production
and gross margin analysis by development.
• Daily cash movements are reconciled and monitored by the Finance Director. The Group’s cash flow
is also monitored monthly in comparison with budget and forecast.
The Board reviews management letters prepared by the external auditors and considers the suitability of
suggested improvements to the system of internal financial controls.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.  Under that
law the directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• State that the financial statements comply with IFRSs  as adopted by the European Union.
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Group will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions
or qualifications as necessary.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial
statements.  
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act
1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The financial statements are also published on the Company’s website, the maintenance and integrity of
which is the responsibility of the directors. The work carried out by the auditors does not involve
consideration of these matters and accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that
may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions and third parties in such jurisdictions should take their
own legal or professional advice as appropriate.

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of
Ben Bailey Plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise state the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow
Statements, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been
audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985
and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information
given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement
and Chief Executive’s Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’
Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the
nine provisions of the Combined Code (2003) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the
unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Corporate Governance Statement and the other items
listed in the contents section. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any other information.

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below .
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Ben Bailey Plc have been prepared in accordance with EU
endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies
Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial
instruments.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to exercise its
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. There are no areas involving a
significantly higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the consolidated financial statements.
A number of Standards amendments and interpretations were effective in 2006 but were not relevant to the
Group.
The following Standards, amendments and interpretations are not yet effective and have not been early
adopted by the Group.
IAS 1, (Amendment), ‘Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures’.
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’.
IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary
economies.
IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006).
IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June
2006).
IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment (effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 November 2006).
IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS2 – Group and T reasury Share T ransactions’.
IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’.
The directors are currently assessing the impact of these changes on the Group. The impact is not expected
to be significant.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated income statement and balance sheet include the audited financial statements of the
Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to the year end. Intra-group sales and profits are
eliminated fully on consolidation.
Revenue
Revenue, which excludes value added tax, sales between group companies and trade discounts, represents
the invoiced value of new houses and land, less any allowances given, and relates wholly to operations in the
United Kingdom. Proceeds from the sales of part exchange houses and undeveloped land, purchased for
immediate resale, are excluded from revenue.
Revenue and profits on housebuilding sales are recognised in the financial statements on legal completion.
The purchase and disposal of land held for development is recognised when unconditional contracts have
been exchanged.
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the Year Ended 31 December 2006
62504 Ben Bailey 09-48  12/3/07  10:37  Page 28 29 Ben Bailey Plc
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of property, plant and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of
acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated at rates intended to write off the cost of property , plant and equipment to their
residual values on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. The
principal useful lives used for this purpose are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Fixtures and fittings 2 to 5 years
Showhouse furniture 2 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.  Depreciation is charged on property , plant and equipment
from when the asset is available for use.  Residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Investments
Investments are shown in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for impairment which is charged
to the income statement.
Land held for development, stocks and work in progress
Land held for development, stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct expenditure together with an appropriate proportion of production
overheads. The cost of land held for development is transferred into housing developments in progress
as building work on each unit commences.
Net realisable value represents the estimated amount at which stock could be realised after allowing for
costs of realisation. Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Interest is written off to the income statement as incurred.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12
months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are
classified as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. Bank overdrafts are
shown within financial liabilities in current liabilities on the balance sheet. Bank overdrafts have been
excluded from cash and cash equivalents as these balances are primarily borrowings that are used to fund
the ongoing investment in work in progress rather than being used to fund short term fluctuations in
working capital.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from
the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, which was
established on 1 April 1997. Pension contributions made to this and other personal pension plans, on
behalf of employees, are charged to the income statement in the year in which the contributions become
payable.
Financial Risk Management
The Group’s significant debt financing exposes it to the effects of changes in interest rates. The Group
has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial
performance of the Group by using financial instruments to fix interest rates.
a)  Interest rate risk
The Group has interest bearing liabilities. The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 50% of
interest bearing liabilities at fixed rates by utilising interest rate swaps. At the year end 65% of interest
bearing liabilities were at fixed rates.  The Group has used interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of
future interest payments, which have the effect of increasing the proportion of fixed interest debt.  
b)  Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group has implemented policies that
require full settlement for the property before the property is handed over for occupation by the
customers.
c)  Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of medium term and short term committed facilities that are
designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansion. At 31
December 2006, the Group had a short term facility of £30m, of which £8.95m remained undrawn at
that date. In February 2007, this facility was increased to £45m for the period until 30 September 2007
and reduces back down to £30m for the balance of the term.  In addition, there are other facilities
totalling £65m, expiring on 31 March 2009, of  which £11.47m remained undrawn at the year end.

62504 Ben Bailey 09-48  12/3/07  10:37  Page 30 31 Ben Bailey Plc
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities under IAS 39
Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is
entered into and subsequently measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to
the income statement except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument. The
Group designates derivatives as a hedge of the income/cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or
commitment (‘cash flow hedge’).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship
between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document
and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis. This effectiveness
testing is re-performed at each period end to assess whether the hedge remains highly effective.
Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity. Where
the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability only gains or losses previously recognised
in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects the profit or
loss. If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses
deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying income
or expenditure. The ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised in
profit and loss.
For the portion of hedges deemed ineffective or transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting
under IAS 39, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only
transferred to the income statement when the committed or forecasted transaction is recognised in the
income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in
equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised in the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the
balance sheet date if they are publicly traded.
The fair values of short term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are
assumed to approximate to their book values. In the case of bank loans and other loans due in more than
one year the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the
future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar
financial instruments.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in
a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using
tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and that are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Share based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees. In accordance with IFRS 2,
‘Share based payments’, equity-settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of
grant, in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested at 31 December
2004. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled ‘share based payments’ is expensed
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will
eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that
are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any,
in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital
(nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.
2    SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS BY CLASS OF BUSINESS
The Group’s revenue, profit before taxation and net assets relate wholly to housebuilding in the United
Kingdom.

______ ______
1,911 1,790
______ ______
In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending 31

will be paid on 4 May 2007 to shareholders who are on the register at 10 April 2007.
10 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
The calculation of earnings per share on the net basis is based on the profit for the year attributable to
ordinary shareholders of £7,823,000 (2005: £8,963,000) and on 11,950,266 (2005: 11,926,088) ordinary
shares, being the weighted average of the number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend
during the year.
Diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of all the ordinary shares issuable under the

20 OPTIONS IN SHARES OF BEN BAILEY PLC
Executive Share Option Scheme
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, directors and senior employees of Group Companies have
options to subscribe for ordinary shares of 10p each. Share options were exercised by two senior
employees for 20,000 shares during the year. No options were granted in the year. Including options held
by the directors, options outstanding in respect of senior employees under the share option scheme at
31 December 2006, together with the option prices and dates, were as follows:
2006 2005 Date 
Date of Number of Number of Exercise from which Expiry
Grant Options Options Price Exercisable Date
_______ _______ _______ _______ ___________ _______
04.09.01 10,000 10,000 59.5p 04.09.04 04.09.11

19.04.04 84,168 92,949 464.0p 19.04.07 19.04.14
The mid-market share price at 31 December 2006 was 635.0p per share and the range during 2006 was
376.0p to 635.0p per share. The interests of the directors in share options are disclosed on page 16 in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
21    SHARE BASED PAYMENTS 
Options are granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme and are exercisable at a price equal to the
average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period of the grant
is 3 years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options
expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The fair value per option granted
and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
Date of Grant 07.08.2003 19.04.2004
Share price at grant date 273.5p 464.0p
Exercise Price 273.5p 464.0p
Number of employees 1 28
Shares under option 8,793 84,168
Under option vesting period (years) 3 3
Expected volatility 43% 47%
Option life (years) 10 10
Expected life (years) 3 3
Risk Free Rate 5.0% 5.0%
Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 3.3% 3.3%
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting nil nil
Expectations of meeting performance criteria 90% 90%
Fair value per option 94.7p 172.8p
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over
the previous 3 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimates, for the
effect of non-transferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

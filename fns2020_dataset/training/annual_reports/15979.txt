CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
 
 
 
Company Number 05452547 
 
 
 
4 
 
 
 
I am pleased to report that Trakm8’s strategy of reinvesting in the business in order to drive long 
term growth is bearing fruit.  
 
Trakm8 has successfully introduced a number of new products and software solutions that have been 
well received by the market.  
 
The strength of the Trakm8 financial model where little profit is taken on the original sales is 
demonstrated by the improvement in cash balances to £1.41m and rising recurring revenues which 
continues to be the key focus of our strategy. 
 
I am encouraged by the outlook for the business. The Group is well positioned with a strong balance 
sheet in a growing market. With the increasingly advanced solutions offered by the Company’s 
technology, I am confident that the business will continue to grow profitably and take advantage of 
opportunities as and when they arrive. 
 
As announced separately today, I have decided to step down after seven years as Chairman and non-
executive Director of Trakm8.  John Watkins, currently our Chief Executive, has become Executive 
Chairman, a new role.  At the same time we are appointing Keith Evans, a former partner of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, as non-executive director.  It has been a pleasure contributing to the 
development of the Trakm8 story and I am confident that its future is bright and secure.       
 
 
Dawson Buck 
Chairman  Trakm8 Holdings PLC 
 
CEO’S STATEMENT 
 
 
5 
Company Number 05452547 
 
 
I am pleased with the progress summarised in the Chairman’s Statement. 
 
The decision was taken last year and implemented early in the second half, to make a game changing 
investment in engineering, sales and support staff.  This increased our operating costs by 
approximately £50,000 per month. This decision has also negatively impacted the profit and loss 
during the period as our revenues have as expected lagged these investments. 
 
Due to delays on some product sales which took longer to complete than expected, overall revenues 
declined somewhat; although disappointing, this is a reflection of the increased emphasis on solutions 
sales and engineering services. The transition from the hardware supplier Trakm8 was five years ago 
to the full solutions supplier of today has made the revenue line move from one off sales today to 
long term recurring service revenues. As a result the top line can be strongly influenced by individual 
major contracts but the underlying revenue security of the Group continues to improve.  
 
Trakm8 has enjoyed a significant improvement in sales of complete solutions and engineering services 
during the period. This has resulted in strong growth in recurring revenues and higher margins.  
 
The Group revenues are accounted for in three segments: 
 
Products  
 
This is the segment where Trakm8 supplies other Telematics Service Providers with hardware 
solutions. In most cases this also includes our market leading unit configuration firmware. This has 
been a year of transition. Many of our UK customers for our products in the past have migrated to 
alternative suppliers that do not compete with them in the solutions market. This migration is perhaps 
a validation of our success in competing at the end user level. 
 
Following the appointment of an International Business Development Manager early in the year, we 
have increased our international sales of hardware. This has taken some time to build traction as 
customers conduct extensive trials to ensure that the hardware meets their requirements. New 
customers have started to buy units from us in North and South America. Overall, the total number of 
units sold to third parties declined during the year, but the trend towards year-end was positive. The 
highlight of the year was the significant sales of hardware to Motorola as announced on 2 July 2012. 
 
Whilst the sales of hardware to third party integrators help us to ensure our manufactured cost of 
products are as low as can be achieved, these revenues are at lower margins and have no on-going 
recurring revenues. As such they remain important to us but not the most strategically important 
segment. 
 
Solutions  
 
This segment is where Trakm8 supplies customers with a fully integrated service provision. Customers 
include the AA, Eon and Jewson. This solution is also provided through a partner in South Africa.  
 
The number of units reporting to Swift has continued to grow steadily throughout the year and this 
has increased the base of recurring monthly revenue, which provides the improved security and 
predictability to future income. By the end of the financial year the monthly recurring revenue had 
increased by 9.9% on the previous year to an annualised £2.15m. The majority of these revenues are 
not taken as upfront payments ensuring our cash receipts are close to sales booked.  
 
 
  Trakm8 Holdings PLC 
 
CEO’S STATEMENT (continued) 
 
 
 
 
Company Number 05452547

We were pleased to announce on 25 April 2013 the completion of a product transfer agreement with 
Visilink, a Cheshire based Telematics Service Provider.   Under the agreement Visilink’s entire 
customer base was offered the opportunity to transfer to our Swift solution. This process proved that 
we could communicate with third party hardware via our Stream servers. No revenues accrued during 
the year to March 2013 but we expect over 500 units to eventually migrate onto Swift, providing a lift 
in recurring revenues for the new financial year. 
 
During the year the Company enhanced the engineering investments in new solutions and launched 
updated versions of Swift and eco
N
.  We also launched a new fleet management routing and 
scheduling package called Logistics. This package has three early adopters and has an encouraging 
number of other inquiries. 
 
Another new product developed during the year but launched in the last month is the Tachograph 
range of solutions that integrate the digital tachograph information into mobile applications for driver 
and operator status reporting and provide operators with the legal compliance data required to meet 
the driver hours regulations. Again early adopters have expressed positive feedback and the pipeline 
of opportunities is growing. 
 
We have also undertaken a considerable amount of development to white label our eco
N
 solution for a 
new customer. This has been a considerable engineering task and no solutions revenues were derived 
during the period. There are, however, good opportunities as a result of this development.  It is 
encouraging that this product is taking market share from more established competitors. 
 
The Solutions segment is the core value enhancing activity of the Group and, overall our revenues 
grew by 9.3% during the period. 
 
Engineering Services  
 
This is the segment where Trakm8 undertakes bespoke software development for customers. The 
customer specific application engineering has been a major feature of the product development team 
as the larger customers have demanded their particular requirements. This has also helped improve 
our core products.  
 
These engineering projects provide profitable consultancy activities in themselves, but also help to 
integrate customers to Trakm8 solutions, and provide on-going support and maintenance revenues. 
Projects for Jewson, St Gobain and others have been undertaken in the past 12 months and whilst 
this activity remains a small percentage of the Group revenues it is considered a key differentiator, 
skill and value added capability. 
 
This segment increased by £0.19m over the previous year to £0.41m. 
  
Outlook 
 
The Board is confident that our investments in new products and sales resources will positively impact 
the second half of new financial year and beyond. In the meantime we have a strong pipeline of new 
products and solutions and we are confident that our recurring revenues will carry on growing.  We 
continue to receive inquiries for increasing levels of engineering services work. 
 
The new solutions and agreements we have announced since the year end will provide additional 
revenues and opportunities in the current financial year and after the first two months of trading our 
revenues are ahead of last year.   Trakm8 Holdings PLC 
 
CEO’S STATEMENT (continued) 
 
 
 
 
Company Number 05452547 
 
 
 
7 
 
With our strong balance sheet, good cash generation, and robust business model Trakm8 is in a 
position to consider augmenting growth through selective acquisitions alongside our current organic 
growth strategy. Any acquisition will need to meet our narrow market segment objectives and 
financial criteria.  
 
Finally, I would like to thank all the Trakm8 staff for their tremendous hard work over the past twelve 
months.

is committed to involving them in the performance and development of the Group.  
 
DISABLED EMPLOYEES 
 
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the 
requirements of the job can be adequately fulfilled by a disabled person.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
The following are identified as the principle risks and uncertainties facing the Group:- 
 
Technology risk - The Group invests in research and development to enable the delivery of new and 
enhanced products and services. 
 
Liquidity risk - The Group operates a long-term business, and its policy is to finance it primarily with 
equity and short to medium-term borrowings. Short-term flexibility is achieved by cash balances and 
overdraft facilities. 
 
Credit risk - The Group aims to minimise its exposure to credit risk through a mixture of credit 
insurance, credit limits and credit checks on new customers. 
 
Foreign currency risk - Historically the Group has not used hedging instruments to minimise currency 
risk as the exposure is limited. If foreign currency exposure increases, the use of foreign currency 
hedging instruments will be reviewed as necessary.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE PREPARATION OF 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
13 
Company Number 05452547 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
  
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each 
financial year.  The Directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare 
group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS")  as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected under company law to prepare the Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
  
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the 
financial position and performance of the Group; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such 
financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a 
true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation. 
 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period.  
  
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
  
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 
b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 
c. for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS adopted by the EU and for the Company financial statements state whether applicable UK 
accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Group and Company financial statements; and 
 
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the Company will continue in business. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group’s and the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Trakm8 Holdings PLC website. 
 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
 
As more fully explained in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 13, the Directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for

adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the year ended 31 March 2013 
 
 
 
 
20 
Company Number 05452547 
1.     GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
Trakm8 Holdings PLC (“Company”) is a public limited company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom (registration number 05452547). The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and 
its registered address is Lydden House, Wincombe Business Park, Shaftesbury, Dorset, SP7 9QJ. 
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. 
 
The Group’s principal activity is the manufacture, marketing and distribution of vehicle telematics 
equipment and services. The Company’s principal activity is to act as a holding company for its 
subsidiaries. 
 
2. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS 
 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRIC”) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
 
3. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
The accounting policies set out in note 4 have been applied consistently to all periods presented 
in these consolidated financial statements. 
 
These financial statements are presented in sterling as that is considered to be the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.  This decision was based on the 
Group’s workforce being based in the UK and that sterling is the currency in which management 
reporting and decision making is based. 
 
4. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
 
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and 
the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  If in the future 
such estimates and assumptions which are based on management’s best judgement at the date 
of the financial statements, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and 
assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change.  
Where necessary, the comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously 
reported results to take into account presentational changes.

4.    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and 
entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year.  Control is 
achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
 
The trading results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the 
consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from the effective date of acquisition or up to 
the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the 
Group.  The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity 
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.  Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority 
interest.  The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair values of the Group’s share of identifiable 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.  Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the 
fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is recognised directly in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income.   
 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group. 
 
 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.  In accordance with 
the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2006. 
 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
 
The fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. No expense is 
recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.

4.     ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at their 
amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment.  A provision 
for impairment is made where there is objective evidence, (including customers with financial 
difficulties or in default on payments), that amounts will not be recovered in accordance with 
original terms of the agreement.  A provision for impairment is established when the carrying 
value of the receivable exceeds the present value of the future cash flow discounted using the 
original effective interest rate.  The carrying value of the receivable is reduced through the use of 
an allowance account and any impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject 
to an insignificant risk of change in value.  For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cash 
and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts.  
 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into.  An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to 
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. 
 
GOODWILL  
 
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recorded as an intangible asset and is the surplus of the cost 
of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.  
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.  Any impairment identified as a result of the review 
is charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  Negative goodwill is written off in the 
year in which it arises. 
 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.  Trakm8 Holdings PLC

4.    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL 
  
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits 
attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably.  Such 
intangible assets are carried at cost less amortisation.  Amortisation is charged to ‘Administrative 
expenses’ in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the intangible 
assets’ useful economic life (1-10 years). 
 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is 
incurred.   
 
Development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset only if the following conditions are 
met: 
 
• an asset is created that can be identified; 
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefit;  
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably; 
• it meets the Group’s criteria for technical and commercial feasibility; and 
• sufficient resources are available to meet the development to either sell or use as an asset. 
 
 Development expenditure thus capitalised is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life.  
Where the criteria are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the 
‘Administrative expenses’ line of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
 
 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation 
or impairment losses.  With the exception of freehold buildings held at 31 March 2006 (the date 
of transition to IFRS), cost represents purchase price together with any incidental costs to 
acquisition.  As permitted by IFRS 1, the cost of freehold buildings at 31 March 2006 represents 
deemed cost, being the market value of the property for existing use at that date. 
 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, at rates 
calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value over its expected useful life, 
as follows: 
 
Buildings 2%  straight line 
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 25% reducing balance 
Computer equipment 33% straight line 
 
Assets held under finance leases or hire purchase arrangements are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the 
relevant agreement. 
 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
adjusted if appropriate.  The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.  Trakm8 Holdings PLC

4.     ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
INVENTORIES 
 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In general cost is determined 
on a first in first out basis and includes all direct expenditure and production overheads based on 
a normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the price at which the stocks can be sold in the 
normal course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation and where appropriate for 
the costs of conversion from its existing state to a finished condition. Provision is made for 
obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks. 
 
LEASES 
 
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the asset have been transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance 
sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives.  The asset is 
recorded at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at 
the inception of the lease.  The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases are 
included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current and non-current 
amounts.  The interest elements of future obligations under finance leases are charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income over the periods of the leases and represent a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective 
interest rate method. 
 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as operating leases.  The cost of operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) 
is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the periods 
of the leases. 
 
FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
 
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are converted to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 
the end of the financial year. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to sterling at the 
rates of exchange ruling at the transaction date. All of the resulting exchange differences are 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise. 
 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the 
Group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.  
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.  
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s reserves.  
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the 
operation is disposed of.

4. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
TAXATION 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.  Taxable profit differs from net 
profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method.  
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted.  
 
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
 
Revenue represents the total of amounts receivable for goods and services provided excluding 
value added tax.  Revenue is recognised on the delivery of the goods to the customer.  Where a 
service is provided covering a future period the applicable revenue is shown as Deferred Income 
under Current Liabilities. 
 
WARRANTY CLAIMS 
 
Provision is made for liabilities arising in respect of expected warranty claims. 
 
GOVERNMENT GRANTS 
 
Government grants towards research and development projects are recognised as income over 
the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are included within Other 
Income.

5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY  
 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 4, 
management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which 
are dealt with below). 
 
Valuation of intellectual property 
 
In assessing the fair value of the intellectual property, management have considered the 
underlying value of the income streams.  Attention has been paid to the potential introduction of 
new products and services and the return anticipated from these and existing product sales.  The 
Directors believe that the fair value of the intellectual property is both appropriate and a realistic 
assessment of its long term value to the Group. 
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at 
the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. 
 
Recoverability of internally-generated intangible asset 
 
During the year, management reconsidered the recoverability of its internally generated 
intangible asset which is included in the balance sheet at £237,281.  The costs relate to the 
development of the Group’s portfolio of hardware and software products and management 
continue to believe that the anticipated revenues will enable the carrying amount to be 
recovered in full.  Assumptions have been made on the number of years over which the costs will 
be recovered based on management’s best expectations and these could turn out to be longer or 
shorter although any subsequent adjustment is not expected to be material. 
 
 
Recoverability of trade debtors 
 
The withdrawal or reduction of credit facilities from Banks and leasing companies is affecting a 
wide range of businesses.  Management are particularly conscious of the financial weakness of 
some companies and is closely monitoring its outstanding debtor book in order to minimise the 
risk associated with future bad debts.  Weekly cash receipts are analysed and future supplies are 
stopped if accounts remain overdue.  An increasing number of customers taking the Group’s 
services pay by direct debit and this is reducing the Group’s exposure to the non-recoverability of 
trade debtors in the future.

6.     SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS 
 
The format of segmental reporting is based on the Group’s management and internal reporting 
of the segments below which carry different risks and rewards and are used to make strategic 
decisions.  Products is the sale of hardware through the Group’s distributors.  Solutions 
represents the sale of the Group’s full vehicle telematics service direct to customers.  Engineering 
services comprises bespoke professional services and mapping solutions. 
 
The Board review the revenue results by segment and the gross margin.  Cost of sales comprise 
hardware costs and have been allocated to the segments based on the number of units sold.  
Administration costs and assets and liabilities are not separated out by segment.

The share price was 13.5 pence on 1 May 2012 being the date of exercise of the above 550,000 
options.  The weighted average exercise price of share options which were outstanding as at 
31 March 2013 was 13.5 pence.   
 
The exercise of all share options is the closing market price on the day of grant.  A vesting period 
of 1 to 3 years is applicable according to the terms of each scheme. 
 
The fair value of the equity settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant 
using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the options were granted.  The volatility has been based on historic share prices and the 
dividend yield has been assumed to be 0% for all schemes. 
 
The Group charged £19,659 to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of Share-
Based Payments for the financial year ended 31 March 2013 (2012: £5,537). 
 
Share options exercisable at the 31 March 2013 were 400,000.

26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk 
and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.  Where appropriate, the Group seeks to 
mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance. 
 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity and flexibility of funding 
through the use of borrowings and financial assets with a range of maturities.  Borrowing 
facilities are monitored against the Group’s forecast requirements and it is the Group’s policy to 
mitigate the risk by maintaining undrawn overdraft facilities and cash reserves. The bank 
overdraft facility is £250,000 and as at 31 March 2013 this facility was not being utilised.   
      
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and the Group attaches 
considerable importance to the collection and management of trade receivables.   The Group 
minimises its credit risk through the application of appropriate credit limits to customers based on 
an assessment of net worth and trading history with the Group.  Standard credit terms are net 30 
days from date of invoice.  Overdue trade receivables are managed through a phased escalation 
culminating in legal action.   
 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. 
 
Significant accounting policies 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for 
recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expense are 
recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, liability and equity instrument are disclosed 
in note 4 to the financial statements.

26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued) 
 
Capital risk management 
 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders 
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to 
reduce debt. 
 
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing 
ratio.  This ratio is calculated as debt divided by total capital.  Debt is calculated as total 
borrowings including “current and non-current borrowings” as shown in the consolidated balance 
sheet.  Total capital is calculated as “equity” as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus 
debt. 
 
The Group’s strategy has been to reduce gearing and to increase cash and cash equivalents.  
This has been successfully achieved through the profits generated during the year.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
 
 The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance 
with the applicable accounting standards. 
 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
 
The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payments. In accordance 
with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2006.  
 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
 
The fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. No expense is 
recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.  
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into. Instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
 
INVESTMENTS 
 
 Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less impairment against the cost of investments. The 
carrying values of investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
 
FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
 
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are converted to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 
the end of the financial year. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to sterling at the 
rates of exchange ruling at the transaction date. All of the resulting exchange differences are 
recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise. 
  
DEFERRED TAXATION 
 
 Provision is made for deferred taxation in respect of all material timing differences that have 
originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date. Timing differences represent differences 
between gains and losses recognised for tax purposes in periods different from those in which 
they are recognised in the financial statements. No deferred tax is recognised on permanent 
differences between the Company’s taxable gains and losses and its results as stated in the 
financial statements.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included without discounting.

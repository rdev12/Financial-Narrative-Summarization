Our divisions
Housebuilding
We	are	one	of	the	UK’s	leading	housebuilders.	
Our housebuilding	division	includes	Linden	Homes,	
which	develops	private	and	affordable	homes	for	
sale,	and	Galliford	Try	Partnerships,	our	specialist	
affordable	housing	business.
Linden	Homes
We develop bespoke homes in prime locations, primarily in 
the South of England and the eastern counties. Our homes 
complement their surroundings and we take pride in their quality 
and attention to detail. 
We often build on brownfield sites and use our construction 
division to help us deliver the most complex developments, 
differentiating us in the market. We have a strong focus on meeting 
our customers’ needs and our success has been recognised 
through numerous industry awards in recent years.
Linden Homes currently delivers around 3,000 houses and 
apartments each year, the majority of which are for private sale.
Galliford	Try	Partnerships
Partnerships provides specialist contracting services to housing 
associations and local authorities. We have a strong presence in 
the South and North East of England and a growing business 
across the rest of the country. 
Partnerships also develops mixed tenure projects, producing 
private housing on sites that are predominantly affordable 
developments. We draw on Linden Homes’ expertise in housing 
development and sales to successfully deliver these projects. 
Partnerships delivered 220 private units in the year.
“	 Our	prime	sites,	bespoke	designs	and	
southern	focus	give	Linden	Homes	a	strong	
platform	to	deliver	disciplined	revenue

A	diverse	construction	
business
We are seeing encouraging 
signs in construction markets. 
Over the coming years, 
we expect to see attractive 
opportunities to grow, 
particularly through framework 
contracts, in the private sector 
and by taking on more major 
projects. Examples include the 
Queensferry Crossing over the 
Firth of Forth in Scotland 
(above) and Flow, an office 
development in Staines, 
Middlesex (right). 
	 	 P24
A	premium	housebuilder
Linden Homes is positioned for further growth, 
benefiting from its record landbank of prime sites, 
rising profit margins, and by building more houses and 
fewer apartments. Pictured left, the Swallowhurst 
development in Cranleigh near Guildford sets a new 
benchmark, featuring Linden Homes’ highest priced 
home sold to date. Below, Thornbury Park is set in the 
prime location of Isleworth, Middlesex.
	 	 P18
People	are	vital	to	our	success
To achieve our growth plans over the period 
to 2018, we will need to retain and develop 
our people, and to recruit more than 1,000 
new employees. We are therefore delighted 
to be joined by around 600 experienced 
staff following the acquisition of Miller 
Construction in July 2014. More information 
about how we manage our people can be 
found on pages 36 and 37.

Chairman’s	statement
Continuing to deliver for shareholders
Our	successful	strategy	
has	once	again	delivered	
record	results	and	created	
value	for	shareholders,	
allowing	us	to	propose	
a further	significant	
increase	in	the	dividend.
Performance	and	dividend
Galliford Try’s performance has been strong for a number of years. 
Our hybrid business model meant the Group coped well during the 
recession, when our growth in housebuilding more than made up 
for a difficult construction market.
We are now in a period of housing market recovery, which has 
helped our performance over the last 12 months. Our strategic 
decision to reinforce our landbank while the market is favourable 
means we now hold the equivalent of around 14,000 units, 
positioning us well for the next few years.
Construction has not yet benefited from a market recovery but 
the signs are encouraging, with increased enquiries and tenders 
coming through and a number of major project wins. We continue 
to take a prudent approach to this market, with a focus on risk, 
margin and cash.
Overall, we are confident about the future and this is reflected in 
our continuing progressive dividend policy. This year, the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 38 pence per share, an increase 
of 52%. This follows a 25% increase in the interim dividend, to 
15 pence per share, giving a total dividend of 53 pence, up 43%.
With earnings per share increasing by 32% to 94.6 pence per share, 
the total dividend is covered approximately 1.8 times by earnings, 
in line with our objective. The final dividend will be paid on 28 
November 2014 to shareholders on the register at 17 October 2014.
Strategy
Our overarching aim is to create value for shareholders. We 
were therefore pleased to set out our new strategic objectives 
in February 2014 (see pages 12 and 13), which include detailed 
targets for the Group and each of our divisions. By 2018, we plan 
to more than double profit before tax and earnings per share over 
those delivered in 2013, with even greater growth in the dividend.
To reach these objectives, we will continue to follow the same 
fundamental strategy as before, focusing on disciplined growth 
across our businesses. One notable change is our decision to 
move our Galliford Try Partnerships affordable housing business 
from our construction division into housebuilding, in order to 
enhance its development capabilities and refocus the 
management team. 
The UK has underinvested in affordable housing for decades and 
we see significant opportunities for a regeneration and land-led 
contractor/developer model. Realigning Galliford Try Partnerships 
with our housebuilding division reinforces our leading position in 
this market and is highly attractive to clients.

Governance
Galliford Try continues to have robust governance, which we 
see as vital to our long-term success. In the last year, we have 
further strengthened our Board with the appointment of two new 
non-executive directors, Ishbel Macpherson and Terry Miller. 
They joined the Board on 1 February 2014, adding significant 
skills and experience.
Amanda Burton retired from the Board on 16 September 2014. 
She has been an excellent senior independent director and chair 
of our Remuneration Committee. We thank her for her contribution 
and wish her well for the future. She is being succeeded by Peter 
Rogers as senior independent director and Ishbel Macpherson as 
chair of the Remuneration Committee.
Galliford Try complies with all the latest governance guidelines and 
codes, and we look to adopt new practices that will strengthen our 
governance. During the year, prompted by the prospective rotation 
of our audit partner, we undertook a review of the appointment of the 
auditors before we were required to do so. The Board was satisfied 
that the current auditors clearly demonstrate independence and 
provide value, and hence recommended the reappointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . However, we will review the 
appointment ahead of compulsory rotation and it will be subject 
to shareholder approval annually. 
People
The Group has a very strong senior team, led by our chief 
executive, Greg Fitzgerald. We also enhanced the team through 
internal promotion and external appointments. In particular, 
Andrew Richards moved from our PPP Investments business 
to head up Linden Homes from the start of the financial year.
Greg has recently indicated his wish to retire as chief executive 
no later than the end of 2015 and is committed to ensuring a 
smooth transition to his successor. The Board thanks Greg for his 
excellent leadership and vision over the last nine years in his role 
as chief executive.
The Group’s performance and ability to deliver for customers 
and shareholders depends on our people’s skill and dedication. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them for their 
continued commitment to Galliford Try.
Conclusion	and	outlook
The economy and housing market are in a period of growth. In most 
parts of the country, house prices are only now getting back to 2007 
levels. The need for more housing is reflected in the pace of growth 
across the industry and the next three years look good as a result.
In construction, we are seeing more enquiries and larger scale 
bids being let. Longer term, the Government also has some major 
projects in the pipeline, such as nuclear power, education, highways 
and HS2, which play to our strengths in building and infrastructure. 
Overall, the outlook in construction is promising, although it is much 
earlier in the recovery cycle than housebuilding. We are also excited 
by Miller Construction joining the Group in July 2014. 
The Group is looking forward to delivering disciplined growth 
across its business.

Chairman
Leadership
We strengthened the Board 
and enhanced its diversity 
through two new non-
executive appointments. We 
also filled senior positions in 
our management team by 
promoting from within and 
through recruitment.
Effectiveness
The Group’s performance 
reflects the quality of its 
leadership and governance.  
An internal Board evaluation 
confirmed that the Board is 
strong and functions 
effectively, building on the 
Board’s first external 
evaluation in 2013. 
Strategy
The Board reviewed and 
approved our new strategic 
objectives, which we 
believe will drive substantial 
growth and create value for 
shareholders over the 
period to 2018.
Risk
We look to continuously 
improve our risk management. 
During the year, we put in 
place a new Risk Committee 
chaired by our finance director.
Shareholders
Galliford Try has a strong 
shareholder register. During 
the year, we offered meetings 
with the chairman and senior 
independent director.

Positive markets support further disciplined growth
We	see	positive	signs	
in all our	markets,	
allowing us	to	plan	for	
disciplined	growth.	By	
2018	we	aim	to	more	than	
double	our	profits	and	
earnings	per	share	
compared	to	2013, with	
corresponding	increases	
in	shareholder	value.
People	and	culture
Our people give us a competitive advantage. I believe that getting 
our people strategy and recruitment right will be the biggest single 
factor in achieving our 2018 objectives.
After five years of relative stability, the market recovery is creating 
demand for talented people throughout the industry. Galliford Try’s 
success makes our employees desirable to our competitors and 
we are taking necessary steps to retain our key people.
We always look to promote from within but our growth strategy 
to 2018, announced with our half year results in February 2014, 
requires us to recruit more than 1,000 people over the next 
four years, at all levels and particularly in Partnerships and 
Construction. We are therefore delighted to have brought some 
600 experienced people into the Group through our acquisition of 
Miller Construction in July 2014. We expect to require fewer new 
people in Linden Homes, as our growth will not initially be driven 
by a large increase in units.
Our performance, ambition and culture make Galliford Try an 
attractive employer. Our growth provides opportunities for our 
people and we empower them to deliver, so the Group is an 
exciting place to work. We are also increasing our intake of 
graduates and apprentices, so we have the people and skills 
we need for the longer term.
As discussed below, supply chain conditions mean that building 
anything is as difficult as I have ever known. This makes our 
day-to-day operations much tougher for our people. I want to 
thank everyone in Galliford Try for their efforts, without which 
we would not have been able to deliver such strong results.
Strategy
For the first time in several years, our markets in housebuilding, 
affordable homes and construction are all showing signs that they 
can grow. This allows us to look forward and expand the business. 
In February this year, we therefore announced a new set of strategic 
objectives (see pages 12 and 13). These will see us deliver 
disciplined growth in Linden Homes and Partnerships, and 
grow construction back to its pre-recession level.
In setting these objectives, we were mindful of both the external 
and internal benefits. We want to be as transparent as possible for 
our investors, so they understand how we view our business and 
markets, and what we believe is achievable over the next few 
years. We also perform better when we have clear goals, as was 
apparent when we set our target in 2009 to double the size of our 
housebuilding business by 2012. These objectives show the scale 
of our ambition, helping us to motivate and retain our people and 
to attract new employees.

Outlook
Our landbank in housebuilding is at record levels. We own or 
control all the land we need for the current year and have a very 
strong position for the year after. At 30 June 2014, we had a record 
carried forward position, with 34% of sales for 2015 already 
reserved or exchanged. The land market continues to provide 
attractive opportunities for us and we increased our hurdle rate 
from 22% to 23% on 1 July 2014.
At 30 June 2014, we had already secured 84% of our projected 
workload for 2015 in construction. We are seeing opportunities 
coming through at improving margins, allowing us to remain 
selective about the work we take on.
We are delighted to welcome Miller Construction to the Group 
following its acquisition on 9 July 2014. Integration is proceeding 
very well and ahead of our expectations. The acquisition brings 
together two construction businesses with a clear strategic fit 
and together makes our construction division stronger.
Tight supply chain conditions mean that one of the key challenges 
will be carrying out the work we are planning. We continue to 
manage our supply chain relationships carefully, to minimise this 
risk and ensure we achieve our objectives for the coming year. We 
will also focus on attracting and retaining the people we will need 
to achieve our objectives. 
Greg	Fitzgerald	
Chief	executive
As part of the strategy, we have realigned Partnerships to our 
housebuilding division. This will allow us to use Linden Homes’ 
expertise to grow our mixed tenure and land-led developments, 
strengthening our unique position in this market. Partnerships’ 
growth will be funded by cash from the rapid expansion of its 
contracting side. Overall, we expect Partnerships to achieve 
revenue in excess of £350 million by 2018, up from around 
£100 million in 2013 and £243 million in 2014.
We will continue to seek opportunities for intra-Group trading, 
using our combined capabilities in housebuilding and construction 
to provide a compelling offer to clients. We have also ensured 
we have the finance to fund our growth, with a new five year 
£400 million unsecured credit facility in place.
Sustainability
Sustainability has long been part of our strategy and is the 
cornerstone of our vision ‘to be leaders in the construction of a 
sustainable future’. We are further integrating it into our operations, 
by asking our director of health and safety to also take 
responsibility for sustainability. 
The long recession shrunk both the housebuilding and construction 
supply chains. The introduction of Help to Buy in April 2013 
contributed to a rapid housing market recovery, which has led to 
shortages of materials and subcontractors. This has also had a 
short-term effect on the construction supply chain. Whilst rising 
costs in the housebuilding supply chain are being offset by sales 
price increases, in construction we have contracts that were priced 
12 to 18 months ago, which assumed no cost increases. This has 
put additional pressure on construction margins this year. We 
believe we are through the most difficult period with the position 
stabilising but we expect supply chain conditions to remain tough 
for at least the next financial year. In the meantime, we continue to 
work hard to engage and support our supply chain partners, so that 
we are an attractive customer for them.
Keeping our people healthy and safe is a priority. After an 
outstanding performance in 2013, disappointingly our internally 
measured Accident Frequency Rate rose slightly this year for 
the first time in over five years. We remain highly focused on 
the behavioural aspects of safe working.
We have set stringent Group targets for reducing carbon 
emissions and achieving the corresponding energy and cost 
savings. A strong environmental performance also helps us to 
win work in construction and to attract the next generation 
of employees.
Working closely with our communities is important to us. We 
create jobs, boost local economies and ensure we keep our 
communities informed about our projects and their progress. As 
well as being the right thing to do, our approach recognises that it 
is easier to do business in communities where we are welcomed.
Delivering	in	partnership	
Our experience of producing exceptional housing 
developments, such as City Glade in Exeter, Devon, will also 
help us to deliver strong growth in our Partnerships affordable 
housing business.

Our business model
Our	hybrid	business	model	encompasses	
both	housebuilding	and	construction.	
This gives	us a	unique	set	of	competitive	
strengths	that benefit	us	throughout	the	
economic	cycle.
This	section	explains	our	business	model	
and	the	advantages	we	derive	from	it.	Pages	
12	and	13	set	out	our	strategy	for exploiting	
these	advantages	and	the	financial	
objectives	we	aim	to	achieve	as a result.
Complementary	businesses
Having both housebuilding and construction divisions is 
rare in our industry. This hybrid business model gives us a 
competitive advantage.
Our construction division can remediate land, enable the 
site infrastructure and build public and commercial buildings. 
Housebuilding can then develop private and affordable homes 
on the same site. This means we can offer a complete package 
to our development partners.
Construction and housebuilding also work together, so we 
can build mixed-use projects with significant commercial 
elements and create homes on attractive but complex sites. 
Housebuilding also benefits from construction services that 
prepare sites for development.
Strategic	strengths
Reduced	reliance	on	any	one	market
Housebuilding and construction primarily work separately, 
serving different customers with different requirements and 
different sources of financing. This makes us less reliant on any 
particular market.
Complementary	financial	profiles
Construction generates cash from clients’ regular payments, 
while housebuilding uses cash to pay for land and development, 
until the homes are sold. These complementary cash flow 
profiles minimise our need for external debt and lead to a 
stronger balance sheet. 
Reduced	impact	of	economic	cycles
Housebuilding adapts quickly to economic changes, 
particularly during a recovery, while long contracts and lead 
times make construction late cycle. This means that if one 
business turns down, the other remains strong, reducing the 
economic risk to the Group. Strategic report Financials Governance

Housebuilding P18
Prime	locations
We have a sizeable landbank in prime locations, with good 
amenities and transport. We identify each area’s housing needs 
to create prestigious and sustainable developments, including 
both private and affordable homes. Our expertise in brownfield 
sites enables us to consider attractive locations that other 
housebuilders cannot tackle, while Linden Homes’ development 
and sales skills help Partnerships to develop mixed-tenure sites 
that appeal to housing associations.
Individual	design
We create bespoke designs for our private and affordable 
homes, complementing local styles and collaborating with 
some of the industry’s leading architects, to produce distinctive 
developments with unique attention to detail.
Quality	and	sustainable	build
Our developments are renowned for their expert build and high 
specification. We use up-to-date methods and materials and 
the latest in energy efficiency and lifestyle technology, to 
reduce running costs for homeowners and each development’s 
overall carbon footprint.
Customer	and	community	focus
We think about the customer at every stage of the process, from 
before we buy the land to after-sales service. The Linden Way 
aims to ensure we adopt best practice across Linden Homes 
and Partnerships, so we offer a consistently good service to 
all our customers. We also embrace the communities around 
our developments, uniting our efforts through The Linden Homes 
Foundation to bring tangible benefits to the places where 
we build.
Construction	 P24
Managing	risk
Robust risk management helps us to choose and deliver the 
right projects. Our hybrid business model means we do not 
have to chase revenue in difficult markets, allowing us to be 
selective about projects. The diversity of our business and 
our order book, which is spread across the public, private and 
regulated sectors, also protects us from downturns in 
particular markets.
Supply	chain	relationships
Our relationships with our supply chain partners help us 
to improve our service quality for our clients, increase our 
efficiency and to address key sustainability issues such as 
health and safety and environmental impact.
Quality	build
We are recognised for our high standards of project delivery 
and have won numerous prestigious awards. Delivering the 
best for our clients enhances our reputation and helps us to 
win new work.
Customer	and	community	focus	
We aim to become our clients’ long-term partner, so we are 
an extension of their team and have a deep understanding 
of their project targets. We also develop strong community 
relationships, so we are welcomed and can work effectively 
in the area.

Strong performance and a robust balance sheet
We	delivered	another	
strong	performance,	
making	good	progress	 
in	line	with	our	strategy

Introduction
Galliford Try had another successful year, delivering record profit 
before tax and earnings per share, and a strong return on net 
assets. Our performance was in line with the strategy we 
published in February 2014 and gives us the platform for further 
growth, keeping us on target to achieve our 2018 objectives. 
We have the financing we need to fund our planned growth, having 
agreed a new, larger and more flexible banking facility in February 
2014. Our strategy requires an increase in net debt levels, as we 
invest in the land and work-in-progress we need in housebuilding. 
At 30 June 2014, net debt was lower than planned, reflecting 
an excellent performance in both construction and housebuilding.
During the year, we completed the first phase of implementing 
our Oracle enterprise resource planning system. Our focus will 
now be on realising the benefits of this system, which will allow 
us to improve our efficiency through improved processes, 
reporting and analysis.
Results
Revenue including joint ventures rose 19% to £1,851 million 
(2013: £1,559 million). Group revenue, excluding our share of joint 
ventures, was 21% higher at £1,768 million (2013: £1,467 million).
Profit from operations, which is stated before finance costs, 
exceptional items, tax and our share of joint ventures’ interest and 
tax, rose 32% to £110.5 million (2013: £83.6 million). This resulted 
in another record profit before tax of £95.2 million, up 28% from 
£74.1 million in 2013, which principally reflected the increase in 
Linden Homes’ operating profit of 37%.

Segmental	analysis
We moved Galliford Try Partnerships from our construction 
division into our housebuilding division, in order to reflect the  
shift in the operational focus of the business. In previous years,  
we had reported Partnerships’ contracting revenues within our 
construction results, including only its fledgling mixed tenure 
business in the housebuilding segment. 
The segmental analysis below now includes the entire 
Partnerships result within the housebuilding division figures. We 
have therefore restated the segmental analysis for 2013, to reflect 
the new structure and to ensure performance is comparable 
between the two years.
Housebuilding
Linden Homes
Linden Homes grew revenue by 20% to £759.6 million (2013: 
£632.6 million), reflecting a significantly higher average selling 
price and higher unit numbers. Prices benefited from a stronger 
product mix, including a high proportion of houses versus 
apartments, together with some general inflation from an 
improving market.
We generated revenue of £7.2 million from land sales (2013: £17.9 
million). Including land sales, Linden Homes achieved a gross 
margin of 21.4%, compared with 19.8% in 2013, reflecting our focus 
on this key measure. We saw benefits from our margin improvement 
plan, and worked with our supply chain to mitigate the effect of 
supply cost pressures. Profit from operations increased by 37% to 
£114.9 million (2013: £83.8 million). The operating margin, including 
land sales, rose from 13.3% in 2013 to 15.1%, as we improved 
efficiency and leveraged our fixed cost base. Following an operating 
margin in the first half of the year of 13.5%, the margin achieved in 
the second half of the year was 16.4%.
Return on net assets was 22.4%, compared with 16.7% in 2013, 
reflecting a strong performance in working capital management.
Galliford Try Partnerships
In line with our growth strategy, Galliford Try Partnerships achieved 
a 150% increase in its revenue, from £97.0 million in 2013 to £242.8 
million in 2014. Of this, £22.3 million came from mixed tenure 
developments and £220.5 million from contracting.
Partnerships contributed profit from operations of £5.0 million, up 
from £1.4 million in 2013. This represented a blended operating 
margin of 2.1% (2013: 1.4%).
Construction
Construction continued to be profitable, though, as anticipated, 
margins fell to 1.0%, mainly reflecting the challenge of delivering 
contracts won in more difficult economic conditions in the current 
environment of increasing input costs. Our construction business 
worked hard on protecting its margin and generating cash. In line 
with our strategy, revenue increased by a modest 1% during the 
year, to £832.9 million (2013: £822.7 million).
Profit from operations was £8.0 million (2013: £12.9 million), 
representing a margin of 1.0% (2013: 1.6%).
Capital	structure	and	funding
The Group’s working capital needs vary, depending on the 
level of working capital and timing of sales in housebuilding, 
and the profile of our construction contracts. Our hybrid 
business model reduces our reliance on external funding, as 
construction generates cash which helps fund our investment 
in housebuilding. The construction division had an average 
cash balance of £97.7 million during the year.
Favourable conditions in the land market have allowed us 
to achieve our objective of around 14,000 units earlier than 
expected. We intend to maintain our landbank at this level. This 
investment has increased net capital employed in housebuilding 
to £717 million, with the cash commitment mitigated by an 
increase of £35 million in land creditors to £233 million.
The Group is funded by ordinary shares, retained profits and 
a single bank facility. In February this year, we entered into a 
new five-year bank facility, with Santander joining our existing 
consortium of HSBC, Barclays and RBS. The facility is for 
£400 million, an increase of £75 million over the previous 
facility, giving us ample headroom for our growth plans. 
We are targeting period-end gearing of no more than 30%, 
with average and peak levels well below our covenants. The 
costs are similar to the previous arrangement, with simplified 
covenants. Importantly, the new facility is unsecured. This 
means that security is provided by our overall balance sheet, 
rather than us having to secure each land purchase we make. 
We are not restricted by loan to value covenants on any 
individual land purchase, giving us greater operational flexibility 
and efficiency. 16 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Financial	review	continued
Building delivered profit from operations of £3.0 million (2013: £6.5 
million), with a reduced margin of 0.7% (2013: 1.6%), reflecting 
constraints in the supply chain and rising material and labour 
costs, which have a more marked impact on contracts priced in 
more difficult economic conditions. The result included the benefit 
of £3.1 million from the disposal of three investments managed 
and delivered within the Building division. 
Infrastructure’s profit from operations was £5.0 million (2013: £6.4 
million), representing a margin of 1.3% (2013: 1.5%). 
PPP Investments reported a loss from operations of £1.8 million 
(2013: £3.2 million), the reduction reflecting the stage of progress 
on its bidding activities. 
Taxation
The effective tax rate was 18.9% (2013: 21.5%) compared to a 
standard rate of 22.5%. The low rate is largely attributable to the 
tax on our joint venture profits being included within profit before 
tax, investment sales and land remediation relief. We believe our 
effective tax rate will continue to be just below the headline rate of 
corporation tax in future years.
Earnings	and	dividend
Earnings per share increased by 32% to 94.6 pence (2013: 71.7 
pence). Details of the calculation of earnings per share can be 
found in note 8 to the financial statements.
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 38 pence per 
share which, subject to approval at the annual general meeting, 
will be paid on 28 November 2014 to shareholders on the register 
at 17 October 2014. Together with the interim dividend of 15 pence 
per share paid in April, this will result in a total dividend in respect 
of the year of 53 pence per share, an increase of 43% over the 
previous year. The total dividend is 1.8 times covered by earnings, 
in line with our strategy.
The cost of the final dividend is £31.3 million, resulting in a total 
dividend relating to the year of £43.6 million.
Cash	and	equity
Management of cash is a critical focus for the directors. Following 
the increase in our landbank, we finished the year with net debt of 
£5.1 million (2013: £14.4 million). Cash balances in construction 
improved to £151.3 million at 30 June 2014 (2013: £132.1 million). 
Group average net debt during the year was £161.0 million. 
Housebuilding requires net investment and the year-end net 
capital employed in developments and housebuilding joint 
ventures was £717 million (2013: £621 million). We continue to 
purchase land on deferred payment terms where possible and 
land creditors increased by £34.6 million to £233.4 million.
Total equity increased by £32.8 million to £534.2 million, whilst 
tangible net assets increased by £33.1 million to £406.1 million. This 
represented net assets per share at 30 June 2014 of £6.49 (2013: 
£6.12) and tangible net assets per share of £4.93 (2013: £4.55).
Group return on net assets, which is profit before tax, finance 
costs and amortisation, divided by average net assets, increased 
to 20.8% from 16.6%, particularly reflecting the strong 
performance in housebuilding.
Pension	and	share	scheme	costs
The total pension cost charged to the income statement was £13.6 
million (2013: £12.8 million), including the costs of auto-enrolment.
Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ there is a surplus in the Group’s 
final salary pension schemes. This was calculated at 30 June 2014 
by an independent, qualified actuary. The gross surplus recognised 
on the balance sheet is £1.0 million (2013: £0.5 million surplus). The 
last valuation of the Galliford Try Final Salary scheme, at 1 July 2012, 
showed a deficit of £33.7 million. The latest valuations of the 
Group’s other schemes showed a deficit of £1.6 million. The 
Group made annual deficit funding payments of £6.1 million to the 
schemes. Further details of the Group’s pension arrangements can 
be found in note 30 to the financial statements.
Amounts charged to the income statement in respect of employee 
share schemes amounted to £3.4 million in 2014. Further details 
can be found in note 27 to the financial statements. 
Treasury	management	and	financial	instruments
The Group operates under treasury policies and procedures 
approved by the Board. Our financial instruments principally 
comprise bank borrowings, an interest rate swap and cash and 
liquid resources that arise directly from our operations. We do not 
trade in financial instruments.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained 
profits and bank borrowings. We have rigorous controls in place to 
ensure we maintain borrowings at an acceptable level. On a daily 
basis, we aggregate the bank balances or borrowings in all the 
Group’s operating companies into a total cash or borrowing figure, 
so we can obtain the most advantageous offset arrangements and 
interest rate.
Construction maintains significant cash balances, while Linden 
Homes requires net investment. Galliford Try Partnerships 
generates cash surpluses in its contracting business, which it 
may deploy as working capital for mixed tenure developments. 
Overall, Partnerships is self-funding and passes its cash balances 
to the Group. 
The Group’s bank facility is subject to covenants in respect of 
interest cover, gearing and minimum consolidated tangible assets. 
We continue to operate well within these covenants.
The main risk arising from our financial instruments is interest rate 
risk. While our policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk, in 
2012 the Group entered into a five-year swap agreement to fix the 
interest rate of £75 million of borrowings. 
Virtually all of our activities take place in the United Kingdom 
and the Group had no material foreign currency exposure at 
30 June 2014. Strategic report Financials Governance

Strategy
Linden	Homes
Our strategy for delivering our 2018 objectives builds on the highly 
successful strategy we have followed in recent years. We will:
•	 focus on increasing our operating margin towards 18%, by 
maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations;
•	 deliver disciplined expansion in volumes; 
•	 continue to focus on prime sites in prime locations, principally 
in the south and south east; and
•	 increase the predominance of houses over apartments.
Galliford	Try	Partnerships
Our strategy in Partnerships is to:
•	 continue to grow our contracting revenues;
•	 grow our mixed tenure revenue by leveraging Linden Homes’ 
relationships, reputation and development skills; and
•	 use the cash generated by Partnerships’ activities to fund the 
mixed tenure developments.
We aim to strengthen our landbank across all our housebuilding 
activities, building a landbank of around 14,000 plots early in the 
strategy period and maintaining it at this level to 2018.
Market
The long-term demand for housing is driven by the UK’s rising 
population and more single-person households. Despite the UK 
housing shortage, in recent years completions have been well 
below the 250,000 per annum required to meet demand. In the 
short term, the availability and terms of mortgages for individuals 
and financing for affordable housing providers affect demand. 
Regional demand also varies, depending on local economies and 
job markets.
Government policy affects both demand and industry regulation. 
The April 2013 introduction of Help to Buy has been very beneficial 
for the market, particularly outside the south and south east. 
Mortgage availability and consumer confidence have also 
improved in the last 12 months. The planning environment is 
currently positive, although a shortage of planning officers in local 
authorities is leading to some delays getting started on site.
The UK has under-invested in affordable housing for the last 30 
years, creating considerable pent-up demand. All political parties 
see the sector as a lever for economic growth and employment, 
and there is high reliance on the private sector for supply. The 
Government’s ten-year rent policy has strengthened the financial 
capacity of Registered Providers (RPs). In the short-term, RPs 
are looking to close out their 2015 programmes, under which 
they have committed to the Homes and Communities Agency 
(HCA) to deliver affordable homes. There are also signs that 
some local authorities are considering direct commissioning of 
affordable homes.

1. 2013 has been restated to reflect the new Partnerships segment, as described in 
the financial review on page 15.
Revenue increased by £127.0 million to £759.6 million, with 
completions of 2,887 compared with 2,806 in 2013. Excluding our 
joint venture partners’ share, completions were 2,748 against 2,568 
in 2013. 
Private housing completions accounted for 2,244 of the total  
(2013: 2,160). The average selling price rose by 15% to £305,000, 
reflecting the strong demand for homes on our prime southern 
sites, the high proportion of houses in our sales mix and the larger 
average size of the houses we are building. There were 643 
affordable housing completions (2013: 646), with an average 
selling price of £124,000 (2013: £119,000).
We had 65 active selling sites (2013: 84), with sales per site 
per week up from 0.57 in 2013 to 0.63, focused on larger sites. 
Cancellation rates remained level at 17% (2013: 17%). We finished 
the year with sales in hand at a record £308 million (2013: 
£313 million).
Our gross margin improved from 19.8% to 21.4%, with the 
operating margin up from 13.3% to 15.1% and return on capital 
increased to 22.4%. The margin of 15.1% was ahead of our 
expectations. The operating margin benefited from using more 
land bought at current prices; operational efficiency driven by The 
Linden Way, which standardises our processes by pulling together 
best practice from across our business; leveraging our fixed 
overheads; and increased revenues from our affordable housing 
developments. Whilst we have seen cost increases in our supply 
chain, as a result of the shortages discussed in the chief 
executive’s review on page 8, this was offset by sales price 
increase in the year.
Help to Buy has been an important catalyst in improving housing 
market conditions this year, although its impact on our sales has 
been less than for many of our peers. Since its launch, customers 
have used Help to Buy for 32% of our plots but only 26% of sales 
by value. Fewer of our customers are using Help to Buy in the 
South and South East, where we are strongest, with a greater 
proportion in the Midlands and East of England, where 
affordability is often more of an issue.

At 30 June 2014, Linden Homes’ landbank stood at a record 12,400 
plots. Including 1,500 plots in Partnerships, our total housebuilding 
landbank was 13,900. The figure represents the number of plots 
we own and control, including sites under option but excluding 
longer-term strategic options. Of the total, 91% was held at current 
market prices, up from 86% at June 2013. 75% of the total private 
landbank is houses, with the remainder apartments. Linden Homes’ 
average cost per plot is £61,000 and the expected average selling 
price per plot is £272,000.
The gross development value of our landbank increased by 30% 
to £3.6 billion (2013: £2.76 billion). Our strategic land holdings 
stood at 1,405 acres at the year end (2013: 1,522 acres). We 
expect to generate in excess of 7,000 plots from this land.
We increased the hurdle rate for new land from 22% to 23% 
on 1 July 2014. 
Affordable	housing	and	regeneration
In addition to our Partnerships affordable housing business 
(see page 23), Linden Homes develops affordable homes for sale. 
This business had another good year, with our strong client 
relationships contributing to improved revenues, through our 
Government funded Affordable Homes Programme and our joint 
ventures with leading housing associations. Affordable housing 
has been a key contributor to Linden Homes’ performance and 
Galliford Try’s overall profile has never been higher in this sector.
The Government has implemented a ten-year rent policy, which 
will sustain the capacity of housing associations to commission 
affordable homes over the next decade. Major registered 
providers also want to leverage their balance sheets, by including 
speculative sales to cross-subsidise their activities. This plays to 
Linden Homes’ strengths in development and sales. There is also 
considerable demand in the private rental sector and we are 
discussing proposals with local authorities, housing associations 
and pension funds, which are all showing interest in investing in 
this sector.
The HCA’s Delivery Partner Panel continues to provide excellent 
land acquisition opportunities for us, as the public sector disposes 
of surplus land. We continue to be very successful in securing 
public land on deferred payment terms.
Opal Land, our joint venture with Thames Valley Housing 
Association, made further good progress. It has three 
developments under way, all of which are delivering better than 
anticipated results. We have also established joint ventures with 
Aster Homes, Notting Hill Housing, and Devon and Cornwall 
Housing during the year, and see further opportunities to partner 
with housing associations.

Divisional	review:	Housebuilding
Outlook
The housing market continues to be positive, with Help to Buy, 
mortgage availability and consumer confidence all contributing 
to rising selling prices, the rate of which appears to be moderating 
to more sustainable levels.
At the year end, we had secured plots for 100% of our planned 
developments in 2015 and 87% for 2016. Combined with the 
record sales carried forward at the year end, this puts us in a 
strong position to hit our objectives. We will drive efficiency and do 
more with our existing resources, as we aim to further increase our 
margin. We will continue to benefit from our sector expertise in 
delivering affordable housing. 
Our challenge will be to deliver homes within our expected 
timescales and costs. Whilst supply chain conditions have 
steadied in recent months, we believe they will remain difficult 
during the next financial year. This requires us to plan ahead and 
to work with our supply chain partners, so they understand our 
development schedules and can provide materials when we 
need them.
Southern	focus
Linden Homes’ strong position in the South continues to 
benefit the business. For example, Milbury Reach is a popular 
development in Exminster, Devon, close to Exeter’s city centre 
and key transport links.

1. 2013 has been restated to reflect the new Partnerships segment, as described in 
the financial review on page 15. 
On 1 January 2014, we successfully integrated Partnerships into our 
housebuilding division, alongside Linden Homes. This will help us to 
capture the significant growth opportunities in this key market. We 
began planning this move at the start of the financial year, with the 
result that we have already started to see the benefits. For example, 
Partnerships is able to use Linden Homes’ systems and experience 
of selling homes to support its mixed-tenure developments, and is 
adopting the principles of The Linden Way.
Partnerships grew revenue from £97.0 million to £242.8 million, an 
increase of 150%. Of this, £22.3 million came from mixed tenure 
developments, with £220.5 million from contracting. Profit from 
operations rose to £5.0 million (2013: £1.4 million), representing 
a margin of 2.1% (2013: 1.4%).
This growth reflects our strong performance in favourable market 
conditions. An increase in land-led and mixed-tenure developments 
also contributed, enabling clients to get projects on to site more 
quickly and improving our margins.
During the year, as part of the consortium S4B, Partnerships 
reached financial close on the circa £100 million Brunswick 
regeneration scheme. This aims to transform the Brunswick 
area of East Manchester, through a project which includes 520 
new homes, community facilities and enabling infrastructure. 
In East London, Partnerships secured two housing contracts 
totalling £60 million for the registered provider Peabody. Following 
appointment as preferred bidder, Partnerships achieved financial 
close on the 25-year £100 million Kent ‘Excellent Homes for All’ 
scheme. In addition, Partnerships announced Extra Care and 
affordable housing contracts totalling £55 million in Coventry, 
Dunstable and Taunton.
Partnerships’ contracting order book was £513 million at the year 
end (2013: £494 million). At the same date, the business had £40 
million of unit sales in hand.
Outlook
The outlook for the affordable homes market is strong, reflecting 
the considerable shortage of affordable homes in the UK. We 
believe we have the right strategy to grow in this exciting market 
for many years to come and are on track to reach our strategic 
objectives.

Divisional review
Construction
Construction delivered a robust 
performance. We are continuing 
our selective approach to new 
projects, a strategy that has 
seen us outperform our peers 
in the tough markets of 
recent years.
Strategy
Construction
We continue to follow largely the same strategy that has served 
our construction business well during difficult market conditions. 
We will:
•	 retain our discipline and select projects with appropriate risk 
and cash profiles;
•	 focus on both the public and the private sector, frameworks 
and increasing our capability in major projects; and
•	 target margin improvements.
PPP Investments
In PPP Investments, our strategy is to:
•	 target our PFI and PPP investment capabilities, to support 
our construction and Partnerships businesses; and
•	 increasingly become a collaborative investment partner for 
public sector clients, to give us access to a pipeline of 
projects rather than one-off bids.
Market
The UK construction market has remained challenging during the 
last 12 months but we are seeing more opportunities across the 
country and an improving outlook.
The regulated sector is driven by five-year investment plans, which 
means that business has come through consistently as expected. 
In the water sector, we are seeing strong competition from new 
entrants for work on AMP6 programmes, leading to significant 
pressure on prices.
The public sector market depends on the Government’s 
ability to finance investment, either directly or by attracting private 
sector funds. The market has been weak but opportunities are 
appearing, with the Government beginning to unveil investment 
plans and most departments being funded as the general 
election approaches.
Private sector work depends on companies having the confidence 
to invest, which is linked to economic conditions, consumer 
spending and the availability of finance. We are seeing a steady 
increase in opportunities, particularly around London where we 
have a strong presence, although this improvement is still at an 
early stage.
The PPP market in England has remained quiet with PF2 failing 
to take off, although the £700 million procurement initiative, the 
Priority Schools Building Programme to address the condition 
of schools in urgent need of repair, is delivering substantial 
opportunities. As in previous years, the market in Scotland 
remains positive with a strong pipeline of opportunities.

1. 2013 has been restated to reflect the new Partnerships segment, as described in

2. Increased to £3.0bn following the acquisition of Miller Construction in July 2014.
We have continued to follow our strategy of being selective about 
the work we bid for, in order to protect our margins and maintain 
our focus on cash.
We won important new contracts during the year, as discussed 
below, contributing to revenue that was up by 1% at £832.9 million 
(2013: £822.7 million).
Margins declined to 1.0%. We had anticipated that margins would 
be lower in 2014, owing to challenging conditions in the supply 
chain, notably in building, leading to higher costs than we expected 
at the time we bid for some contracts. The effect was mitigated by 
profits of £3.1 million on the disposal of three investments, held and 
managed within the building division. This resulted in a reduced 
margin in the second half of the year and a margin for the full year 
that was in line with our expectations.
We continued to manage our cash carefully and had a cash 
balance in construction of £151 million at the year end (2013: 
£132 million), representing 18% of revenue.
At the year end, our order book was £1.4 billion (2013: £1.2 billion). 
Of this, 29% was public sector, 19% was in regulated industries 
and 52% was in the private sector. Importantly, 56% of our order 
book is in frameworks. Construction’s order book increased to 
£3.0 billion following the acquisition of Miller Construction.
On 9 July 2014 we acquired the Miller Construction business. 
Miller Construction is a UK only contractor, which delivers building 
and infrastructure projects to both the public and private sectors. 
The acquired business has a strong strategic fit and accelerates 
our strategy of growth into an improving marketplace. In the year 
to 31 December 2013, Miller Construction reported revenue of 
£409 million.

East Scotland to develop two new high schools in Kelso 
and Newbattle; 
•	 in commercial, construction of the Forbury Place office 
project in Reading for M&G Real Estate and Bell Hammer 
(£38 million); and 
•	 in health, the first phase of the £41 million redevelopment 
of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. 
In addition, Building was appointed to both regional segments of the 
new four-year Education Funding Agency contractors’ framework. 
We are one of ten contractors appointed and one of eight on both 
the North and South sectors. The framework is potentially worth £4 
billion in total and will be the primary means of government bodies 
procuring major capital works for academies, free schools and the 
capital-funded element of the Priority Schools Building Programme.

Our infrastructure business continued to deliver work for regulated

In particular, our four-party consortium constructing the new 
Queensferry Crossing is on programme, with the critical marine 
based bridge pier foundation work complete. The business has 
been appointed as a framework contractor to both Lots 1 and 2 
of the Midlands Highway Alliance framework. 
Yorkshire Water appointed our joint venture with AECOM Design 
Build to continue as a contractor for its AMP6 framework. The 
framework will run from 2015 to 2020 and we expect it to be worth 
at least £110 million to Galliford Try over this period. The framework 
is similar in value and scope to the current AMP5 contract.
We also won our first contract in the airport sector, for Manchester 
Airports Group. The contract, worth £80 million, is part of the 
client’s £500 million Capital Delivery Programme, which we were 
appointed to in June 2013. This is a difficult sector to enter and we 
expect to win further work based on this success.
Sector strength
We have considerable experience in leisure and hotels. Current 
projects include Hotel Football, next to Manchester United’s 
stadium. Exciting features include a terrace with a 16 metre by 
12 metre pitch and retractable roof.
Leading large‑scale infrastructure 
The South Devon Link Road is a prime example of our 
capabilities in delivering large-scale infrastructure schemes.  
It will improve access to Torbay and South Devon, helping  
to create nearly 8,000 jobs in the area. 28 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Divisional review: Construction
Outlook
We are seeing increased opportunities across our construction 
business. The division is winning work with appropriate margin 
and inflation protection and continues its focus on risk 
management and cash. 
We have a well-balanced business with strong sectoral 
capabilities. The diversity of our order book continues to 
support us and helps to protect us from weakness in any 
particular market. The acquisition of Miller Construction in July 
2014 provides access to new frameworks and more than doubled 
the size of our order book.
Supply chain conditions remain challenging, particularly in our 
building business, and we continue to manage them. We expect to 
hold our construction margin steady during 2015.
Working in partnership
Delivered under hub South East Scotland, the Wester Hailes 
Healthy Living Centre in Edinburgh is a state-of-the-art facility

We are experts in delivering flood alleviation schemes. The 
scheme we are constructing in Elgin, Scotland, will be able to 
cope with 190 tonnes of floodwater per second – an 
occurrence expected only once every 200 years. Strategic report Financials Governance

Revenue (£m) 15.1 6.7

Directors’ valuation (£m) 1.8 4.5
PPP Investments continued to provide good opportunities for our 
construction, Partnerships and maintenance businesses during 
the year. To date, we have arranged and financed 31 projects, with 
a total funding requirement in excess of £1.3 billion.
The director’s valuation of our PPP portfolio was £1.8 million at 
30 June 2014, compared with a value invested of £1.1 million (2013: 
valuation £4.5 million; value invested £2.9 million). We use 
discounted cash flows to value our portfolio.
We are particularly active in Scotland, where there are a number of 
PPP projects in progress. We are part of the Alliance Community 
Partnerships consortium on the South West Scotland hub 
initiative, and are also part of the South East Scotland hub. During 
the year, our construction business in Scotland won a number of 
contracts to build or refurbish schools and hospitals through these 
hub initiatives.
Together with our infrastructure business, we secured, as part of 
the Connect Roads Consortium, preferred bidder status for the 
design, build, finance and operation of the £745 million Aberdeen 
Western Peripheral Route.
Together with Galliford Try Partnerships, we were confirmed as 
preferred bidder and reached financial close on the Kent ‘Excellent 
Homes for All’ project, which includes a £38 million construction 
contract and associated facilities management services.
Outlook
In the short term, the market for PPPs in England is expected to 
remain subdued, while Scotland continues to provide a pipeline 
of projects.
Looking further out, we expect to see more opportunities to partner 
with the public sector across the UK, applying the concept of the 
Scottish hubs. This will provide us with a pipeline of work, rather 
than requiring us to bid for individual projects. Our collaborative 
approach will allow public bodies disposing of assets to benefit 
from the skills in our PPP Investments business.
Investing in regeneration
We are part of the consortium delivering the Brunswick 
regeneration scheme, which will create more than 500 new 
homes and refurbish 650 council houses in East Manchester, 
as well as providing jobs and training for local people.
Creating sustainable communities
Our approach to building the Pickaquoy Centre, part of the 
Orkney Schools Investment Programme, won us a Considerate 
Constructors Scheme bronze award for exceptional community 
relations and a positive site image.

important that we cannot 
take the time to do it safely. 
We recognise that our 
projects have an impact on 
the environment and we 
remain committed to 
providing sustainable 
solutions. We therefore 
place increasing importance 
on cutting carbon emissions, 
managing waste and 
improving the environment

Sustainability continued
Measuring safety
Galliford Try measures its Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) in two 
ways: firstly, by using the more recent RIDDOR definition of 
accidents as incidents resulting in more than seven days’ absence; 
and, secondly, against the former industry standard of three days’ 
absence, which has been our internal benchmark for many years. 
Our internal measure identifies more accidents that could have 
caused serious harm, moving us to a culture where no accidents 
are acceptable and everyone has the right to go home safely. 
Our internal target AFR, capturing accidents leading to more than 
three days’ absence, was 0.13. This year our internal AFR rose for 
the first time in over five years, increasing to 0.14 from 0.13. This is 
still significantly below the all industry average published by the 
HSE. Our health and safety team continues to tackle the root 
causes of all accidents, to influence the behavioural elements of 
safe working practices.
To 30 June 2014, we received no prosecutions, prohibitions or 
enforcements from the HSE, thereby achieving our target.
Encouraging safer working
Our new Group health and safety development manager has 
introduced enhanced training, so more frontline employees know 
how to encourage safer working practices. This reinforces and 
develops our safe working practices and our culture of care.
We extended the number of trained safety coaches in both our 
business and subcontractor network. We now have 742, up by 212 
on last year. Safety coaches play a vital site-level role in our 
main health and safety programme, ‘Challenging Beliefs, Affecting 
Behaviour’, by encouraging their colleagues to recognise an 
activity’s risks and find safe ways to do it.
Coaches tend to be foremen, assistant site managers and regular 
subcontractors. They need to be persuasive, enthusiastic about 
safety and strong enough to address contentious issues. Coaches 
have an important role in influencing how our site teams operate, 
by constantly reinforcing the message about safer ways of 
working, and by embedding a culture where everyone manages 
their own, and their colleagues’ safety. One way of achieving this 
is their delivery of Safe Behaviour Discussions.
We achieved our target of 60,000 Safe Behaviour Discussions, 
which identify good and bad on-site practice through open 
discussion with operational personnel. This is a change from the 
enforcement approach to managing safety, and leads to a more 
positive and sustained approach to health and safety at all levels.
Gauging employee awareness 
We gauge awareness of health and safety across our workforce, 
including office-based employees. Following extended awareness 
training, 86% of employees understand our ‘Challenging Beliefs, 
Affecting Behaviour’ programme and their role in it (2013: 82%). 
We also held a significant number of safety shutdowns across our 
operations, to take ‘time out’ to reflect on both good and bad 
safety practices and ensure the highest standards are maintained 
across our sites. Although the percentage of employees who 
believe we give health and safety a high priority dropped slightly, 
from the target of 95% to 93%, the awareness figure remains high 
and we continue to prioritise improving employee awareness.  
Providing leadership for health and safety
Everyone employed by us or working on our behalf is responsible 
for health and safety. However, leadership drives home the need 
for vigilance. Our executive team therefore committed to carry out 
80 site safety visits during the year and achieved 67. Our business 
unit managing directors and leaders exceeded their target of 500 
site assessment visits.

Climate change presents risks and opportunities for our business. 
For example, extreme weather can disrupt building programmes 
and we can expect increasing requirements to make 
developments resilient to climate change and to mitigate its 
impact. This may make delivering our projects on time and to 
target costs more challenging. Conversely, we may also see more 
flood defence structures being required, which could create more 
opportunities for our infrastructure business due to its significant 
delivery expertise.
In our housebuilding business, resource efficiency and cost are 
drivers for continued improvement in building techniques. We aim to 
deliver energy and water efficient homes and during 2014, more 
than 50% of all the homes we built complied with Level 3 of the 
Code for Sustainable Homes or equivalent, thereby exceeding our 
target. Our ‘fabric first’ approach is the most cost-effective and 
easily replicated way to deliver energy efficient homes. Complicated 
operating systems can help reduce energy use but we feel that 
attention to specification and robust building details are better. 
Cutting energy and carbon
We have divisional carbon reduction plans, which respond to the 
needs of each division’s sectors and clients. These are supported 
by our Group Carbon Task Force, comprising the chief executive, 
carbon champions with specialist divisional knowledge, and the 
Group sustainability manager. Its role is to challenge performance 
and set aspirational goals across all divisions.
Through this task force we have again reduced our emissions, 
to 2.25 tonnes of carbon dioxide per £100,000 of revenue. 
These emissions are those defined in Scope 1 and 2 of the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, covering direct use of fuels, fugitive 
emissions (for example, from air-conditioning units), and emissions 
associated with consumed electricity. We have included emissions 
from our offices and all operational sites, including joint ventures. 
For joint ventures where we have operational control, we report all 
emissions. Where we do not have operational control, we apportion 
emissions using our equity share. All emissions defined here are 
assessed and measured in line with the DEFRA guidance.
We have started to record and report Scope 3 emissions, which 
are those outside our direct control, such as those arising from 
waste, material deliveries, subcontract movements to site, hotel 
stays and water consumption. Scope 3 emissions are far more 
significant than Scope 1 and 2, estimated to be around 135,000 
tonnes of carbon dioxide, and will be an area of continued focus as 
we look to deliver the commitment of the Government’s 
infrastructure plans.

Our improved score in the Carbon Disclosure Project (rising

Economy Index evidence our improved performance.
Managing waste
We continue to focus on reusing or recycling waste on-site and 
using transfer stations with high recycling rates. We have improved 
performance in recent years and in 2013, we diverted 94% of 
waste from landfill and reused or recycled 1.17 million tonnes 
on-site. 
Reducing waste to landfill drives business efficiency and cuts costs.

Our other environmental impacts
We have committed to recording, reporting and increasing the 
proportion of timber we use from certified sources. We gather this 
information on a quarterly basis and report it to our divisional and 
executive boards. We also report this information to the UK 
Contractors Group (UKCG) along with other environmental data on 
waste, carbon and water, and are one of the leading UKCG 
members in doing so.
During the year we continued to develop our approach to issues 
such as water conservation, which has processes and key 
performance indicators embedded in our ISO 14001 compliant 
management system that are reported to our management boards.
Our projects must create environment plans, which recognise and 
set strategies for dealing with fauna and flora. Working with the 
UKCG, we have recommended a preferred industry process for 
engaging ecologists, requiring them to identify habitat 
enhancement opportunities. We were also instrumental in 
launching the CIRIA BIG Challenge ‘Do one thing’, encouraging 
contractors to find opportunities for projects to leave a positive 
biodiversity legacy.
Creating the right culture for growth 
Galliford Try aims to grow significantly during the period to 2018. 
Having the right people is key to this, so we continue to focus on 
developing our existing staff and sourcing additional talent in 
the marketplace. 
Developing employees’ skills to support our growth relies on a robust 
review process for performance and skills, and encouraging the  
next generation of employees by offering high quality training and 
apprenticeships. Our target is for trainees to make up at least 2% of our 
workforce and we have achieved a proportion of 4.2% during the year.
We support our people through The Galliford Try Academy, which 
enables all our employees to access management programmes, 
structured on-the-job training and a wide range of learning resources. 
Our aim is to offer an average of two days’ training per employee. 
During the year, we achieved 9,044 days’ training, which is equivalent 
to 2.05 days per employee.
With the economy showing signs of recovery and our success as  
a business, our employees are becoming increasingly desirable.  
As a result, we are seeing an increased churn rate, from 11.45% 
last year to 15.69% this year. We have reviewed the reasons why 
people leave and consider 15% to be the maximum acceptable 
churn rate for our business, reflecting our need to retain talent 
while bringing in new people and new ideas.
Measuring success
Our employee engagement survey had a response rate of nearly 
70%, including site-based staff, giving us a comprehensive picture 
of our people’s views on working for the Group. We continue to 
score above the benchmark in most areas. 78% of staff are proud 
to work for the Group and 68% were satisfied or very satisfied with 
their job, up by 1% from last year.
During the year, we launched a new employee engagement initiative 
to help our employees understand the actions we will take in 
response to the survey. ‘You said, We will’ is a process through 
02

37 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
which our HR team, business unit leaders and managing directors 
presented the results and asked teams how we should respond. 
This included a Group-wide e-book, in which our divisional leaders 
responded to the survey results and committed to take action. 
Promoting diversity and equality
The Group is committed to employment policies, which follow 
best practice, based on equal opportunities for all employees, 
irrespective of sex, race, age, colour, disability or marital status. 
We value everyone as an individual, recognising that everyone is 
different and has different needs at work. We respect people’s 
differences and treat everyone with dignity and respect. We create 
a culture in which everyone feels valued as an individual and is 
motivated to give their best in their jobs.
People from minority backgrounds are underrepresented in 
construction, and this imbalance is greater at more senior levels 
in our business. We capture data for five of the nine protected 
characteristics and performance against these metrics is regularly 
reviewed at divisional and Executive Board level. Our aim is to 
achieve a workforce that is more representative of society, while 
employing the right candidate for each position. The challenge for 
us and many of our peers lies in promoting the opportunities to, 
and encouraging, a wider range of candidates.

The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications 
for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities. We carry out regular workplace 
assessments, and provide occupational health checks and 
advice to support both employees and line managers. Appropriate 
arrangements are made for the continued training and employment, 
career development and promotion of disabled persons. If 
members of staff become disabled, the Group endeavours to 
continue employment, either in the same or alternative position, 
with appropriate retraining being given if necessary.
We continue to support the UKCG’s Equality Working Group and 
its Respect initiative, which challenges preconceptions about 
working in the industry through a targeted communication and 
information campaign. 
Protecting human rights
We are committed to protecting the human rights of our 
employees and of people engaged with our business. There have 
been no related issues during the financial year. 
For our Group, the most significant areas of focus are:
•	 respecting the diversity of our staff, and in particular ensuring 
their health and safety, and working conditions;
•	 contributing to the well-being and sustainability of the 
communities in which we operate;
•	 selecting suppliers who evidence prioritising the rights and 
welfare of their staff, and monitoring their performance 
against internal guidelines;
•	 maintaining robust policies and procedures for dealing with 
bribery and corruption, supported by mandated training and 
awareness; and
•	 allowing our employees the right to freedom of association 
and providing avenues for employee representation.
As a responsible business, we predominantly deal with reputable 
UK-based companies and consider that sourcing goods from 
them minimises the risk of negative social impact. Where we 
source materials or project expertise from businesses based 
overseas, we undertake reasonable assessments to ensure that 
appropriate welfare standards are maintained.
Apprenticeships
A skills shortage and decline in new entrants feature 
across the construction industry. Through the Linden 
Homes Apprentice Programme, we have encouraged 
139 new entrants into the industry over the last 
three years.
Our chief executive, Greg Fitzgerald, began his 
career as an apprentice. To outline the benefits 
of providing apprenticeships, he was a key speaker 
at the Apprenticeship, Skills and Employment 
event in Exeter, held as part of the National 
Apprenticeship Week. 38 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

Encouraging volunteering
We recognise that employees support good causes connected with 
their employment and that they volunteer in their communities. We 
also know that encouraging and enabling employees to volunteer 
can increase loyalty and job satisfaction, and help employees to 
develop new skills and benefit others. We launched our volunteering 
policy at the start of the year, which allows employees to take up to 
two days of paid special leave per year. By the end of the financial 
year, 25 volunteering days had been requested.
Our national approach to community engagement is through our 
support for CRASH, the homelessness charity established by the 
construction industry. As a patron, we offer financial support to 
enable CRASH to run its operations. However, CRASH’s real value 
is in discovering the needs of the many smaller homelessness 
organisations it works with, then enabling its supporting 
organisations to deliver the professional services needed. This 
allows the smaller organisations to deliver projects that would 
otherwise have significant financial costs. During the year, we 
supported three projects by providing surveying, estimating and 
technical skills.
At a local level, individual project teams donate to good causes in 
support of employees or local interests, and gift time and resources. 
Giving money is beneficial but it is often more valuable to provide 
the resources and skilled time needed to deliver projects. We 
targeted delivering 4,000 hours of time to good causes during the 
year and delivered 6,047 hours, equivalent to around £136,050 of 
support in kind. Coupled with charitable and materials donations, 
our total community support amounted to £347,680.
Open Doors
Last year, 16 of our sites welcomed schoolchildren and students, 
to provide an experience of what happens on major construction 
sites and outline the career opportunities on offer. Many UKCG 
members support this initiative, which showcases careers in 
construction and the fantastic work completed on our sites. Open 
Doors aligns with our ambition to make a positive impact in 
communities and we will support the next event in 2015.
We view community as a defined group of people and 
organisations with a specific connection to, or interest in, a 
particular geographical location. We expect, as a general rule,  
that any community will have a shared interest in improving or 
maintaining quality of life and the local environment. As a major 
housebuilding and construction company with hundreds of active 
sites, we both create and participate in communities every day. 
Our responsibility is to help communities realise their ambitions 
through the homes, housing developments and the wider built 
environment we deliver. Our construction projects are driven and 
shaped by the needs of communities, reflected by the public 
sector contracts we win and deliver, and through our work for 
private clients. 
Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS)
The CCS is an independent organisation devoted to promoting 
best practice on construction projects, from how we manage and 
operate sites and treat our employees and supply chain partners, 
through to our engagement with local communities. We are an 
associate member and register all our sites of more than six 
weeks’ duration with the scheme. 
Registered sites receive independent monitoring visits that assess 
performance. Sites that achieve a score of 7/10 in each of five 
sections achieve best practice. Our Group target is therefore to 
achieve or exceed 35/50. This year we achieved an average score 
of 37 on 178 registered sites, which received a total of 349 
compliance visits. 19 of our sites won CCS awards for 
performance beyond compliance during the year.

Linden Homes
Linden Homes has continued to follow The Linden Way, its 
approach to providing an excellent customer experience. This 
initiative embraces the Group’s values of excellence, passion, 
integrity and collaboration and aims to capture and share best 
practice across our regional businesses. This should ensure 
that wherever someone is buying one of our homes, they receive 
the highest standard of customer service.
This enhanced customer experience is aimed at increasing 
customer satisfaction, reducing defects, enabling Linden Homes 
to progress from its current four star status to become a ‘Five Star 
Home Builder’ under the Home Builders Federation Star Rating 
Scheme, and increasing revenue whilst minimising cost.
During the year, we revised our approach to measuring customer 
satisfaction. We were using an independent company and our 
customers were also being approached by NHBC for its survey. 
This led to survey overload and customer fatigue. We have now 
adopted the NHBC system. We retained our target from the 
previous satisfaction survey of 90% and returned a rate of 86.4% 
from NHBC. This shows that we still have work to do to improve 
the customer experience and achieve our Five Star status.
During the year, Linden Homes changed the methodology used to 
calculate a net promoter score, and reset the target to 23.5%, in 
line with the industry average. We achieved 15.5% using the new 
methodology, which brings our customer satisfaction and net 
promoter scores together under the NHBC monitoring regime. 
This allows us to directly compare our performance to that of 
our peers. We will continue to review how we can improve 
our performance.
Our defects per plot measure fell significantly, from 0.46 to 0.29 
this year. A continued focus on the final stages of building and 
handing over homes will see us move closer to our target of 0.25.
Construction
To win new clients, it is crucial that we understand their needs and 
that they understand what we can deliver for them. We do this by 
continuing to develop our long-term sustainability plans. Our 
infrastructure business was the first to complete its review and set 
out its strategic aims to 2025. Our other businesses are also 
reviewing their plans and have adopted an initial set of 
requirements as part of our ISO 9001 compliant Business 
Management System. 
A number of key indicators help us to understand how our 
construction division is performing. We gauge customer 
satisfaction against our target of 80% and achieved 83% during 
the year. This is a very consistent performance over the last few 
years and we will continue to target a minimum of 80% across 
the division. 
We also measured our net promoter score for the first time, 
which was 34%. This is based on dividing customers into three 
categories: promoters, passives, and detractors.  
Finally, we assess repeat business, which we treat as having 
completed another project for a client we have worked for in the 
last 24 months. During the year, this percentage was 53%. This 
includes Partnerships, which was part of the construction division 
at the start of the year. Next year, given the transfer of Partnerships 
to our housebuilding division, this data will be recast.

Customers
The Linden Way
The customer must be at the forefront of every 
decision we make, from land acquisition to planning, 
from design to construction, and sales to aftercare. 
The Linden Way embraces this idea and aims to 
revolutionise the customer experience, by improving 
our culture and working practices.

The Supply Chain Sustainability School
Our projects encounter a range of social and environmental 
issues. Whilst our larger supply chain partners already have 
commitments in these areas and support their employees in 
delivering them, many smaller partners cannot access the 
resources they need to become more sustainable businesses and, 
in making that transition, help us to be more sustainable too.
Given the number of businesses we work with, delivering 
awareness training and helping to develop our partners’ skills 
is not straightforward. Our approach is a new Supply Chain 
Sustainability School, which we financially support along with 
14 other construction partners. Our commitment allows the  
School to offer free support to companies that join and gives  
them access to:
•	 a detailed benchmarking service across ten themes of 
sustainable business;
•	 strength and weakness analysis; and
•	 the resources and learning opportunities to improve 
performance.
The School helps us and our partners to improve performance and 
provides more general support across the industry. It is a real 
example of the strength that comes from major construction 
companies working together.
Over 700 companies we work with are already signed up and have 
taken the opportunity to assess and understand their scores. It is 
encouraging that our partners score above the industry average. 
We are targeting our preferred group suppliers for even better 
performance during this calendar year.
Delivering projects to achieve our customers’ requirements and 
our aspirations relies on us having the best possible partners. 
Achieving targets for improving the performance of our business 
on many social, environmental and economic performance 
indicators is only possible if we work with organisations that share 
our commitment. 
We work with hundreds of suppliers and contractors, with around 
12,000 people on our sites every day, and an even greater number 
are involved in manufacturing and supplying the materials we 
need. We already have robust procedures to select supply chain 
partners, to minimise the risks to our projects. We manage 
subcontractors locally through regional procurement teams but 
take a different approach with major suppliers of materials and 
have established relationships with around 50 preferred suppliers. 
This enables us to set standards for materials and equipment 
supplied to us. We also encourage subcontractors to purchase 
materials from our preferred suppliers.

Supply Chain Business Briefing
Our Supply Chain Business Briefing was hosted by 
our chief executive, Greg Fitzgerald, and outlined our 
plans for Galliford Try over the next four years. This 
allowed us to consult our partners on initiatives 
which will improve how we engage with our Group 
supply chain partners, including prompt payment 
and sustainable procurement.
Sustainable Timber
Galliford Try is committed to sourcing all of its 
timber from legal and sustainable sources, with 
an appropriate standard in place to evidence this. 
91% of timber products received from our preferred 
suppliers complied with either Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC) or the Programme for the 
Endorsement of Forests Certification (PEFC).

High standards across the Group 
I am pleased to report on the 
continued high standards of 
governance across the Group. 
The year has been characterised 
by stability and gradual evolution, 
as the Board has adapted to the 
improved prospects for the 
Group’s markets, particularly 
in housebuilding.
The strong performance of the Group’s operational businesses, 
the improvements to profitability made by the housebuilding 
division, and the response of the construction division to its 
challenging market backdrop, have given the Board increased 
confidence in its governance and risk management processes. 
That increased confidence is particularly reflected in the decision 
to reduce the number of formal Board meetings from ten to eight, 
with additional ad hoc meetings held as necessary. 
While cognisant of improved prospects for the Group, the Board 
has previously acknowledged that there remain specific areas 
identified for further improvement. I was therefore delighted that 
we were able to welcome Ishbel Macpherson and Terry Miller to 
the Board as non-executive directors in February this year. The 
Board is already benefiting from Ishbel and Terry’s considered 
opinion and insight, and we look forward to moving forward 
together as a group into the next financial year.
At the presentation of half year results, the Group announced 
a revised corporate strategy for the years to 2018, in response 
to the improved prospects for its key markets, in particular 
housebuilding, and the strengthening UK economy. The Board 
was necessarily closely involved in the formulation and approval 
of the strategy, which the executive team is now tasked with 
delivering for shareholders and stakeholders. We are pleased that 
2014 has been another strong year of delivery against strategy, 
and similarly of full compliance with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

Ishbel Macpherson and Terry Miller were both appointed as

Amanda Burton retired from the Board on 16 September 2014, 
after a nine year appointment. Greg Fitzgerald has indicated his

Their roles within the Group remained unchanged from the

Appointment of additional 
non-executive directors
Ishbel Macpherson and Terry Miller were 
formally appointed as non-executive directors 
on 1 February 2014. Ishbel and Terry have 
joined the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. Both appointments strengthen 
the independence and diversity of the Board, 
and addressed succession planning for 
Amanda Burton’s retirement from the Board in 
2014.
The ratio of independent non-executive 
directors improved from 57% to 66% on 
the appointments taking effect. The Board 
gender diversity ratios similarly improved 
from 14% to 33% from February onwards, 
with this ratio falling to 25% on Amanda 
Burton stepping down from the Board.
Both appointments have successfully 
refreshed the Board’s composition, 
independence and diversity. Both Ishbel and 
Terry have completed effective inductions, 
and are contributing strongly to the Board and 
its Committee work and strategic formulation. 
The appointments should mean the Board is 
adequately composed and resourced in the 
short and medium term.
Group brokerage review and 
retender
The Executive Board initiated a thorough 
review of its existing brokers, and in parallel 
conducted a comprehensive market tender 
in 2013. Through the tender process, three 
additional brokers were invited to present 
to the Executive Board alongside both 
incumbents. All completed follow up actions. 
As a result of the tender, the Executive Board 
recommended to the Board the appointment 
of HSBC Corporate Broking in addition to its 
existing adviser Peel Hunt.
Having established strong working 
relationships with both incumbent brokers 
over engagements spanning many years, 
the Executive Board took the opportunity 
in October 2013 to review and benchmark 
service levels. The tender process was 
extremely beneficial in reaffirming existing 
areas of strength, and identifying potential 
areas for service improvement and adoption 
of new market initiatives.
Both appointed brokers continue to work 
effectively to deliver an improved service to 
the Group, following completion of the tender 
process. The selected brokers complement 
each other to ensure that a premium service is 
received across the agreed broking remit.
External audit review and retender The Group committed to complete a tender 
of the external audit engagement in 2014, 
in line with the rotation date of the previous 
lead partner, Pauline Campbell. The decision 
reflects the latest guidance of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and EU 
Competition Commission.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were originally 
appointed as the Group’s external auditor in 
January 2001, and completion of the external 
tender sought to market test and reaffirm 
whether their continuing appointment was 
in the best interests of the Group and its 
stakeholders, given the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
In itself a valuable exercise, the review 
and tender process established that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP continue to 
offer a market competitive external audit 
proposition. Their experience of working 
across the Group’s operations offers 
continuity, which will be strengthened by 
the appointment of a new audit partner 
from October 2014.

Partnerships. From 1 January 2014, 
Partnerships has transferred to form part of 
the housebuilding division, with a refocused 
management team expected to drive a 
significant increase in both mixed tenure 
revenues and the size of the contracting 
business.
Previously a business unit within construction, 
with divisional board representation at that 
level and organised with an operational 
management board beneath, the strategic 
change has necessitated establishment of a 
new Executive Partnerships Divisional Board, 
to drive strategy and performance.
The Executive Partnerships Board was formed 
for the 2014 calendar year, and continues to 
operate effectively. The divisional managing 
director for Partnerships chairs meetings, 
which are attended by the chief executive, 
finance director, construction division chief 
executive, and general counsel and company 
secretary in advisory capacities, to ensure 
appropriate resourcing. This board reports 
directly to the Executive Board, with the chief 
executive responsible for operational 
performance. 46 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Governance continued
Diversity
In line with our stated commitment and addressing the 
expectations of Lord Davies’ report ‘Women on Boards’, the 
Group improved the ratio of female Board members during the 
financial year. The gender balance at Board level accordingly 
improved, from 14% to 33%, reflecting Ishbel Macpherson and 
Terry Miller’s appointments as non-executive directors in February. 
The ratio will be 25% upon Amanda Burton stepping down from 
the Board.
Notwithstanding the diversity related improvements in 2014, the 
Nomination Committee undertakes to actively consider a diverse 
range of candidates, including those from other societal groups 
not currently represented at Board level, for positions as and when 
they become available, whilst always basing any recruitment 
decision on merit. Further diversity disclosures can be found  
in the Strategic Report on page 37. 
Jane Davies was appointed as HR director with effect from 
9 September 2013, with specific responsibility for strategic 
HR planning. Jane attends Executive Board meetings as a 
member of the senior management team.
Board: attendance
Meetings were led by the chairman, including a specific 
performance assessment day at which individual appraisals were 
completed. The company secretary was in attendance. The senior 
independent director separately led a meeting of the non-executives 
to assess performance of the chairman, without him being present.
Board: remit
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for prior 
authorisation by the Board, the specifics of which have not 
materially changed from those disclosed in previous years. The 
Board held its annual strategy away day in October 2013 and 
specifically approved the Group business plan for 2014 to 2018.

Board: information, advice, evaluation, insurance and 
indemnity
Well-established Board procedures covering timely provision of 
information in advance of all Board and Committee meetings, and 
for the provision of independent professional advice, remained in 
operation throughout the financial year. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the general 
counsel and company secretary. No director sought independent 
advice during the financial year.
As reported in the 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
an external performance evaluation of the Board was completed 
in 2013 using the services of Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP, 
a recognised independent consultant. An internal Board 
performance evaluation was therefore completed in 2014, using 
the Group’s well-established processes and augmented by input 
from Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP’s related recommendations. 
The 2014 evaluation focused on risks to the Group’s revised 2018 
corporate strategy and sought opinion on current operations, 
performance, governance and strategy. Consideration was given 
to the aggregate time commitments of the non-executive 
directors. The findings and recommendations were presented to, 
and approved by, the Board in May 2014.
The Group maintains appropriate directors and officers liability 
insurance on behalf of, and provides individual indemnities to, the 
directors and general counsel and company secretary, which 
complies with the provisions of section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Executive Board report
Membership of the Executive Board is detailed on page 43. 
Executive management is the responsibility of the chief executive. 
He chairs the Executive Board, which in turn takes responsibility 
for the operational management of the Group, under terms of 
reference delegated by the main Board. The Executive Board also 
has further delegated responsibility for making recommendations 
to the main Board on all items included in the formal schedule of 
matters reserved for main Board authorisation. There are regular 
performance and operational related reports and presentations 
from divisional management. The assistant company secretary 
acts as secretary to the Executive Board. 
The Executive Board meets on a monthly basis, and additional 
meetings are convened when necessary to consider and authorise 
specific operational or project matters.

Governance continued
The Audit Committee has 
focused its attention on key 
projects in 2014 relating to 
the review and tender of the 
external audit, and also 
establishing fair, balanced 
and understandable review 
processes for the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements, in line 
with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Introduction: Andrew Jenner 
Audit Committee chair
Audit Committee report 2014 
The Committee has continued to monitor and review the Group’s 
risk management and internal control framework, in the context 
of an improving outlook for the Group’s markets, and in particular 
in UK housebuilding.
Although the thorough review and tender of the external 
audit completed this year resulted in the reappointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), shareholders and 
stakeholders can be reassured that the review was extremely 
beneficial in benchmarking PwC’s service levels and engagement. 
The decision to reappoint PwC followed a detailed and 
comprehensive audit review and tender process, and was based 
on merit, as well as reflecting PwC’s long standing involvement 
with, and knowledge of, the Group and its operations.
The Committee looks forward to continuing to work with the audit 
team closely under the newly appointed partner, Jonathan Hook.
Having specifically established revised procedures, I am pleased 
to confirm on behalf of the Committee that the 2014 Annual Report 
and Financial Statements are considered fair, balanced and 
understandable in terms of the form and content of the strategic, 
governance and financial information presented therein. The 
Group has evolved the format of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements over recent financial years to ensure that this Annual 
Report complies in full with requirements of new regulations 
covering narrative and remuneration reporting, applying to the 
Group for the first time this financial year.
We have welcomed the appointment of both Ishbel Macpherson 
and Terry Miller as Committee members and the Committee is 
already benefiting from their considered insight and opinion in the 
short period since their appointment. We look forward to working 
together as a group into the next financial year.
Audit Committee: composition and attendance
Membership of the Audit Committee is detailed on page 43. The 
chairman, chief executive and finance director attend all Committee 
meetings by invitation. Andrew Jenner, who is Committee chair, has 
a strong financial background which satisfies the UK Corporate 
Governance Code requirement that the Committee’s membership 
has recent and relevant financial experience. The general counsel 
and company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
Audit Committee: remit
The Committee meets at least three times a year, this number 
being deemed appropriate to the Audit Committee’s role and 
responsibilities. The Committee’s delegated authorities and 
calendar of prioritised work have not changed substantially 
from those disclosed in previous years. The key responsibilities 
of the Committee are: delegated responsibility from the Board for 
financial reporting; monitoring external audit, internal audit, risk and 
controls; and reviewing instances of whistleblowing. The terms of 
reference of the Committee are available on the Group’s website.
The authorities and calendar of work remain in line with the 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. At each 
meeting, Committee members took time, in the absence of the 
executive directors, to separately review and discuss any issues 
meriting their attention. The Committee also met informally several 
times during the financial year, in connection with the external audit 
tender project completed in July 2014. The table on page 49 
summarises the key activities during the financial year.
The Committee also continues to meet with the internal and 
external audit teams, in the absence of executive management.  Strategic report Financials Governance

During the financial year, the risk and internal audit team focused 
on delivering their agreed calendar of audit reviews, under 
their rolling three-year internal audit plan, and also providing 
commercial and risk management support across the Group at 
the request of the Committee, the Executive Board and senior 
management. Further information regarding their activities during 
the year can be found on page 50.
As disclosed in note 5 to the financial statements, no significant 
non-audit related services were provided by PwC during the 
financial year, although the Group did receive non-audit related 
advice and services covering general corporate matters. Policies 
and review mechanisms governing the provision of material 
non-audit services, and safeguarding the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor, remained in force throughout 
the financial year. A market tender of the external audit was 
completed during the financial year, in line with the guidance of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee is satisfied that 
the incumbent external auditor, PwC, remains fully independent, 
and accordingly has recommended to the Board that a resolution to 
reappoint PwC is proposed at the 2014 annual general meeting.
The Committee reviewed the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements and all formal announcements relating to the Group’s 
financial performance. This included an assessment of 
Partnerships’ segmental reporting and each critical accounting 
policy, as set out on pages 77 and 78, as well as review and 
debate over the following areas of significance:
•	 contract revenue and provisions: in conjunction with the 
annual audit, the Committee reviewed a paper setting out key 
judgements in respect of revenue recognition and contract 
provisions, in relation to individually significant long-term 
construction contracts;
•	 reporting exceptional items: the Committee reviewed and 
considered the FRC’s press notice of December 2013 in 
relation to the reporting of exceptional items;
•	 going concern: the Committee assessed the available banking 
facilities, and the associated covenants and sensitivities. 
The related paper also considered other commercial and 
economic risks to the Group’s going concern status. The 
Committee reported to the Board on its findings; and
•	 goodwill impairment review: during the year, the Committee 
considered the judgements made in relation to the valuation 
methodology adopted by management and the model 
input used, as well as the sensitivities used by management 
and the related disclosures.
Nomination Committee report 2014
Nomination Committee: composition and attendance
Membership of the Nomination Committee is detailed on page 43. 
The Committee was chaired by Peter Rogers, an independent 
non-executive director, throughout the financial year. Ian Coull 
will chair the Nomination Committee following the appointment of 
Peter Rogers as senior independent director in September 
2014. The general counsel and company secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committee. 
Nomination Committee: remit
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the 
Group’s website. The authorities delegated to the Committee by 
the Board comprise:
•	 reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board;
•	 evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board, including the impact of new appointments;
•	 overseeing and recommending the recruitment of any 
new directors;
•	 ensuring appointments are appropriately made against 
objective criteria; and
•	 keeping the leadership and succession requirements of the 
Group under review.
The Committee took direct responsibility for the processes which 
led to the appointment of Ishbel Macpherson and Terry Miller 
as non-executive directors in February 2014. A detailed job 
specification was prepared by the Committee and external 
consultants were appointed to provide advice on the availability 
of suitable external candidates. The Committee then commenced 
a formal, rigorous and transparent selection process, which 
included considering a diverse shortlist of candidates, before 
recommending the final appointments to the Board. Further 
background to both appointments, together with the Board’s 
agreed position on diversity in accordance with the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, can be found on pages 45 
and 46.
In accordance with best practice and the latest guidance issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, the 
new non-executive directors received a formal and thorough 
induction programme covering, amongst other things: Board 
policies and procedures; share dealing restrictions; financial, 
strategic and operational summaries; governance processes; 
introductory meetings with senior management and advisers; 
and other Group specific information and training. 50 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Governance continued
The Group’s annual general meeting, held in November each year, 
continues to be a popular means for private shareholders to 
receive personal updates on performance from Board members 
and share opinions on progress. All directors of the Company 
were in attendance at the 2013 annual general meeting and all 
arrangements for the meeting followed the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and related best practice.
Reporting, risk, internal audit and controls
The governance review commencing on page 44 details the 
specific actions undertaken by the Group during the financial 
year, including those with a risk management focus. The Board’s 
approach to risk and internal audit, including its systems in relation 
to the preparation of consolidated accounts, and the material 
controls of the Group’s established internal control framework 
have not changed substantially from those disclosed in detail in 
the 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
The Group’s governance reporting structure shown on page 51 
clarifies the effective Group, divisional and operational board 
structures upon which the delegated authorities matrices and 
Corporate and Finance Manuals are overlaid, and reflects changes 
made in 2014. 
During the financial year, a programme of 17 internal audits was 
completed across the Group’s operations and progress checks 
were completed against previous recommendations. All significant 
internal control failings or weaknesses, including compliance with 
the provisions of the Group Corporate and Finance Manuals, have 
been rectified either during the financial year or to the date of this 
Annual Report.
Compliance statement
The Group believes that the highest standards of corporate 
governance are integral to the delivery of its strategy, providing 
the means by which the Board manages the expectations of 
stakeholders to optimise sustainable performance as summarised 
in this Annual Report.
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), applicable to all 
premium listed companies, is the governance code to which the 
Group is subject. The Group remains compliant with the UK 
Listing Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.2.6 and 
related information can be found in the Directors’ Report on pages 
64 and 65.
As a member of the FTSE 250, Galliford Try has committed to 
complying in full with all provisions of the Code and in doing so 
seeks to both support and foster the highest standards of 
corporate governance. The Group complied in full with all 
provisions of the Code throughout the financial year.
For and on behalf of the Board
Kevin Corbett
General counsel and company secretary
The Committee continues to review Board composition 
and progress made by potential internal candidates for key 
executive roles. 
The Committee remains wholly independent in accordance 
with the requirements of provision B.2.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. External consultants, The Zygos Partnership 
(Zygos), have been engaged to advise on all prospective Board 
appointments, and the appropriateness of open advertising and 
other recruitment methodologies. There is no other connection 
between Zygos and the Group.

Remuneration Committee: composition and attendance
Membership of the Remuneration Committee is detailed on page 
43. The Committee was chaired by Amanda Burton throughout the 
financial year. Ishbel Macpherson chairs the Committee on 
Amanda Burton’s stepping down from the Board.
Remuneration Committee: remit
The authorities delegated to the Committee by the Board have 
not materially changed from those disclosed in the 2013 Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. Further information regarding 
the work of the Committee during the financial year can be found 
on pages 52 to 63, which address the requirements of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Reporting Regulations effective from 
30 September 2013 as issued by the Department of Business, 
Innovation & Skills.
Governance policies
The Group continues to operate a suite of governance and risk 
management policies, procedures and training programmes, all of 
which address obligations arising under the relevant legislation. 
The Group Corporate and Finance Manuals, which summarise the 
policies, procedures and authority matrices by which the central 
functions and divisions operate, were refreshed and updated 
during the financial year. 
Shareholder relations
The Company continues to prioritise maintaining effective 
relationships with all its shareholders and accordingly seeks to 
engage appropriately with all interested parties. The Board, and 
in particular the chairman, chief executive and finance director, 
continue to organise a range of meetings with existing and 
prospective institutional shareholders. Specific reports regarding 
shareholder views generally are regularly provided to the Board for 
analysis and discussion. The Board continues to actively engage 
with institutional shareholders in line with the expectations of the 
UK Stewardship Code, whether on key matters of specific 
relevance to the Group and its operations or general market 
themes. The Board, the senior independent director and other 
non-executive directors, are available to attend meetings with 
shareholders and address any significant concerns stakeholders 
may have.
During the year, the Company completed a standard postal 
consultation with all registered shareholders regarding the 
proposed implementation of e-communications. Consultation 
responses were such that only 19% of registered shareholders 
elected to continue to receive hard copy mailings from 
2014 onwards. Strategic report Financials Governance

Remuneration policy and report
Policy, framework and implementation
The Group has again performed strongly in the context of an 
improvement across the listed housebuilding sector, and continues 
to clearly outperform its construction sector peers. The revised 
2018 strategy announced in February 2014, Group performance, 
and the future direction of the Group, give the Committee renewed 
confidence that its Remuneration Policy is aligned with both 
corporate strategy and delivery by the executive team. We were 
therefore happy to approve the reward packages received by the 
chief executive and his executive team during the financial year, and 
in particular the variable elements of pay. 
Further details regarding the specific variable elements of pay 
received by the executive directors, to recognise their outstanding 
annual performance delivered for shareholders, including profit in 
excess of plan and success on a number of strategic fronts, such 
as accelerated land acquisition, can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 63. All variable elements of 
pay were specifically approved in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The Committee continues to monitor and review pay and conditions 
across the Group, and in particular the wider executive population 
immediately beneath the senior team. Pay increases above inflation 
were awarded to all staff on review in July 2014, with discretionary 
merit-based increases for those performing exceptionally. Further 
details regarding the salary increases awarded to Greg Fitzgerald, 
Graham Prothero and Ken Gillespie can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
As reported last year, the Group will offer shareholders a binding 
vote on the Remuneration Policy by way of a separate resolution 
at this year’s annual general meeting. This is in addition to the 
standing advisory vote on this Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Following my departure from the Board, Ishbel Macpherson will be 
available to shareholders to discuss matters of significant concern.
There has been a smooth transition to Ishbel Macpherson, 
who will assume responsibility for the Committee from me. 
I have enjoyed overseeing remuneration matters on behalf of the 
Board, in what latterly has been an exciting period of growth for 
the Group and the housebuilding industry generally. I wish the 
executive team continued success as they move towards their 
goals for 2018.
Amanda Burton 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Foreword by Ishbel Macpherson, Committee chair designate
Whilst I formally take responsibility for the Committee on Amanda 
stepping down from the Board in September, having worked with 
her and been a member of the Committee since my appointment 
in February, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Amanda 
for her considerable contribution to the successful remuneration 
framework installed and overseen by the Committee. I would also 
emphasise to both shareholders and stakeholders that I do not 
anticipate any significant changes to that policy in the short and 
medium term. 
That said, there remains a great deal of work to be completed to 
ensure ongoing compliance with the new regulatory environment 
and best practice expectations, and I look forward to further 
improvement as the Group moves into 2015 and beyond.
Ishbel Macpherson
Chair designate of the Remuneration Committee
Committee chair’s annual statement
This is the first year that the new regulations published by the 
Department of Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) formally apply 
to the Group, and I am pleased to confirm that following changes 
made in last year’s Annual Report, ahead of implementation, the 
Group complies in full with the new requirements. As a result, the 
changes to this year’s Annual Report are more subtle than the 
revised and largely compliant structure adopted last year.
Introduction: Amanda Burton
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
There have not been any 
significant changes to the 
Remuneration Policy in 2013/14. 
This year the Committee has 
focused on the ongoing review 
of the appropriateness of the 
Remuneration Policy, the 
annual cycle of salary review 
and incentive plan activity, and 
preparing for the transition to 
a new Committee chair on my 
stepping down from the Board. Strategic report Financials Governance
53 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Remuneration policy and report
Remuneration Policy
Remuneration Policy
Remuneration: strategy
The Group’s remuneration strategy is to appropriately incentivise 
future executive performance, reward successful performance 
delivery and to ensure that we recruit and retain our most talented 
and experienced executives.
Remuneration: policy
During the year, the Committee reviewed and maintained the 
policy which, subject to confirmation at the 2014 annual general 
meeting, is to:
•	 ensure that remuneration packages are structured so that 
they can attract, retain and motivate the executives required 
to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives;
•	 engender a performance culture which will position Galliford 
Try as an employer of choice and deliver shareholder value;
•	 deliver a significant proportion of total executive pay through 
performance-related remuneration and in share-based form;
•	 position performance related elements of remuneration so 
that upper quartile rewards may be achieved in 
circumstances where outstanding results and peer sector 
outperformance have been delivered; and
•	 ensure that failure is not rewarded.
The policy necessarily extends to include the specific detail 
outlined throughout this Remuneration Policy. 
The policy is shaped by environmental, social and governance 
factors, which help determine the design of incentive structures to 
ensure that responsible behaviour is encouraged. Furthermore, 
recognising that even well designed incentives cannot cater for all 
eventualities, should any unforeseen issues arise that would make 
any payments unjustifiable, the Committee can use its discretion to 
address such outcomes by scaling back payments. The Committee 
operates clawback provisions within both the Annual Bonus Plan 
and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which facilitate the retrieval of 
payments made to directors and executive management in 
circumstances of error, financial misstatement or misconduct.
Considerations in setting the Remuneration Policy
To ensure executive remuneration is considered in the context 
of the Group as a whole, the Committee reviews the policy on the 
pay and benefit structure, including bonus schemes, for all Group 
employees. The views of divisional and business unit management 
across the Group are sought as a matter of process, when 
completing the Group’s annual salary review. 
The Board has delegated to the Committee the responsibility for 
making recommendations about the remuneration of senior 
management immediately below the executive directors.
All-employee schemes
All staff throughout the Group participate in an annual bonus 
scheme, with targets linked to performance of their particular 
responsibilities or business unit. The scope and extent of these 
schemes vary between levels of management and business 
sector. All bonus schemes throughout the Group are subject to a 
50% reduction in payment if Group profit before tax does not meet 
a pre-determined threshold, whatever the performance of the 
individual businesses may have been. The non-financial targets 
applying to the executive directors apply to all bonus schemes 
covering staff across the Group.
There are, however, some differences in the structure of the 
Remuneration Policy for the executive directors (as set out below) 
compared to that for the broader employee base within the Group, 
which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the differing 
levels of seniority and responsibility. The Remuneration Policy for 
the executive directors places a greater weight on performance-
based variable pay through the LTIP . This ensures the remuneration 
of the executives is aligned with the performance of the Group and 
therefore the interests of shareholders. 
Employees have not been consulted formally on directors’ 
remuneration but the Committee will keep this under review.
Performance measures and targets
The Committee selects financial and strategic measures (such as 
profit and cash flow) for the annual bonus that are key performance 
indicators for the business. The Committee will select for long-term 
incentives a combination of measures that provide a good focus on 
the outcomes of Group strategy, together with sustainable 
improvements in long-term profitability.
The Committee sets appropriate and demanding targets for 
variable pay in the context of the Group’s strategic objectives and 
trading environment. The targets for the Annual Bonus Plan will 
be set each year with reference to the budget and strategic plan. 
The Committee approves these targets as the most effective 
means of aligning the Group’s short-term executive incentive with 
improving the Group’s key financial metrics in the financial year. 
Further information on targets for 2013/14 is set out on page 59. 
The Committee will review the performance metrics and targets 
for awards under the LTIP each year, prior to awards being made. 
Consideration is given to the Group’s internal planning, business 
environment and market forecasts, for example, to determine 
whether the TSR (Total Shareholder Return) peer group and 
range of EPS (Earnings Per Share) performance targets remain 
appropriate. Should there be a material change in the Group’s 
performance conditions (for example, the introduction of additional 
performance metric) appropriate dialogue with the Company’s 
major shareholders would take place, along with a full explanation 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report to support any

Components of executive reward
Component and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Framework to assess performance
Salary
To provide a competitive and 
appropriate level of basic fixed pay, 
sufficient to attract, motivate and 
retain directors of high calibre, able 
to develop and execute the Group’s 
strategy.
Normally reviewed annually, with any 
changes typically taking effect from 
1 July.
Set taking into consideration pay and 
employment conditions across the 
Group, the economic environment, 
the responsibilities and 
accountabilities of each role, the 
experience of each individual, his or 
her marketability and the Group’s key 
dependencies on the individual.
Reference is also made to salary 
levels amongst relevant housebuilder 
and construction peers and other 
companies of equivalent size 
and complexity.
The Committee reserves the right to 
reduce salary levels (and has done so 
in the past) if the circumstances 
warrant it.
There is no prescribed maximum. 
The Committee’s policy on salary 
increases for executive directors is for 
increases to be broadly in line with the 
average across the workforce, unless 
there is a promotion or material 
change in role or business 
circumstances, in which case 
increases may be higher.
Last year’s salaries are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
When reviewing salaries, both Group 
and individual performance are 
considered.
Benefits
To provide cost-effective and 
market-competitive benefits.
Benefits provided to executive 
directors currently comprise 
entitlements to a company car or 
cash equivalent allowance, private 
medical and permanent health 
insurance, and life assurance.
The benefits provided may be subject 
to minor amendment from time to 
time by the Committee within the 
Remuneration Policy.
The cost of benefit provision varies 
from year to year, depending on the 
cost to the Group, and there is no 
prescribed maximum limit. Benefit 
costs are monitored and controlled to 
ensure that they remain appropriate 
and represent a small element of total 
remuneration costs.
n/a
Pension
To provide a market-competitive 
retirement benefit.
The executive directors may each 
receive contributions to a money 
purchase pension scheme or salary 
supplements in lieu of company 
pension contributions.
20% of basic salary. n/a
Annual Bonus Plan
Rewards the achievement of 
stretching annual goals that support 
the Group’s annual and strategic 
objectives.
Compulsory deferral of part of the 
bonus into shares provides alignment 
with shareholders.
Executive directors and a selected 
senior management population, 
subject to invitation and approval by 
the Committee, may participate in the 
Annual Bonus Plan.
Where the bonus earned and payable 
equates to over 50% of the recipient’s 
basic salary in any one financial year, 
two thirds of the bonus earned in 
excess of that 50% salary threshold is 
required to be deferred into restricted 
shares. Although beneficially held by 
the participants, the restricted shares 
are legally retained by the trustee of 
the Galliford Try Employee Benefit 
Trust (EBT) for three years, and are 
subject to forfeiture provisions, unless 
otherwise agreed by the Committee in 
certain clemency situations. Subject 
to continued employment, the 
restricted shares are legally 
transferred to participants on the third 
anniversary of allocation.
The Committee operates clawback 
provisions within the Annual Bonus 
Plan, which facilitate the retrieval of 
payments made to directors and 
executive management in 
circumstances of error, financial 
misstatement or misconduct.
150% of salary for the chief executive 
and 100% of salary for other 
executive directors.
At least half of the annual bonus 
opportunity may be earned for 
on-target performance. Bonuses start 
to be earned from 0% of salary for 
achieving threshold performance.
Dependent on the achieving specified 
financial (no less than 50% of the 
bonus) and strategic targets, the 
bonus may be scaled back if certain 
non-financial targets are not 
achieved. Last year’s performance 
measures are described in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
page 59. Strategic report Financials Governance

Component and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Framework to assess performance
Long Term Incentive Plan 
Rewards the achievement of 
sustained long-term financial and 
operational performance and is 
therefore aligned with the delivery of 
value to shareholders.
Facilitates share ownership to provide 
further alignment with shareholders.
Making of annual awards aids 
retention.
Under the rules of the 2006 LTIP, 
the Committee is authorised to 
recommend that the trustee of 
the EBT grant provisional share 
allocations to invited participants 
annually.
The vesting of any award depends 
on the achievement of performance 
conditions linked to specific grants 
over an associated three-year 
plan cycle.
The Committee operates clawback 
provisions within the LTIP, which 
facilitate the retrieval of payments 
made to directors and executive 
management in circumstances of 
error, financial misstatement or 
misconduct.
The maximum value of a base award 
that may be granted in any financial 
year to any individual will not exceed 
100% of their basic annual salary as 
at the award date, except in the event 
of outstanding performance where 
there is the potential to achieve 
vesting of up to 200% of the 
base award.
The minimum level of vesting that may 
occur is 7.5% of basic salary.
Dividends may accrue on LTIP awards 
over the vesting period and, subject 
to the discretion of the Committee, be 
paid out either as cash or shares on 
vesting, in respect of the number of 
shares that have vested.
Measures are currently based on EPS 
growth and relative TSR, measured 
against two unweighted industry 
peer groups.
The Committee may vary the 
measures and targets that are 
included in the plan and the 
weightings between them from year 
to year. Any material changes to the 
measures would be subject to prior 
consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders.
Details of performance conditions are 
provided on page 60.
All-employee schemes
To encourage employee share 
participation.
The Group may from time to time 
operate tax-approved share plans 
(such as an approved Sharesave 
scheme for the benefit of all staff) for 
which executive directors could 
be eligible.
The schemes are subject to the limits 
set by HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC).
n/a
Shareholding guidelines
To ensure the interests of the 
executive directors are aligned to 
those of shareholders.
The Group’s share retention policy 
requires executive directors to build 
and maintain a shareholding over a 
five-year period equivalent in value to 
at least 100% of basic salary or, in the 
case of the chief executive, at least 
150% of basic salary.
n/a n/a
Non-executive fees
To provide a competitive and 
appropriate level of fees sufficient 
to attract, motivate and retain a 
chairman and non-executive directors 
of high calibre.
The chairman is paid a single fixed 
fee. The non-executives are paid a 
basic fee. The chairs of Board 
Committees and the senior 
independent director are paid an 
additional fee to reflect their extra 
responsibilities.
The level of these fees is reviewed 
periodically by the Committee and 
chief executive for the chairman and 
by the chairman and executive 
directors for the non-executive 
directors.
Fees are set taking into consideration 
market levels in comparably sized 
FTSE companies and relevant 
housebuilder and construction peers, 
the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the role and the 
experience and expertise required.
The chairman and the non-executive 
directors are entitled to 
reimbursement of reasonable 
expenses.
Non-executive directors cannot 
participate in any of the Group’s 
annual bonus or share plans and are 
not eligible for any pension 
entitlements from the Group. The 
chairman is eligible to participate in 
the Group’s medical assurance plan.
The Committee is guided by the 
general pay increase for the broader 
employee population, but on 
occasions may need to recognise, for 
example, changes in responsibility or 
time commitments.
Current fee levels are disclosed on 
page 63.

Discretions retained by the Committee in operating 
incentive plans
The Committee operates the Group’s various incentive plans 
according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC 
rules where relevant. To ensure efficient administration of these 
plans, the Committee may apply certain operational discretions 
such as: determining the extent of vesting based on the 
assessment of performance; determining ‘good leaver’ status and, 
where relevant, the extent of vesting of share based plans; making 
appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (such 
as rights issues or corporate restructurings); or the annual review 
of and weighting of performance measures, and setting targets for 
annual bonus plan and discretionary share plans from year to year.
The Committee may adjust the targets or set different measures 
and alter weightings for the incentive plans if, for example, an event 
occurs which causes the Committee to reasonably consider that 
the performance conditions would not achieve their original purpose 
without alteration. Any changes and the rationale for those changes 
will be set out clearly in the Directors’ Remuneration Report in 
respect of the year in which they are made.
Directors’ service contracts and policy for payments to 
departing executive directors
The service contracts and letters of appointment for the Board 
directors serving at the date of this Annual Report are detailed in 
the following table: 
  Contract date
Notice period 
(months)
Non-executive directors
Ian Coull 8 November 2010 6
Amanda Burton 1 July 2005 6
Peter Rogers 1 July 2008 6
Andrew Jenner 1 January 2009 6
Ishbel Macpherson 1 February 2014 6

Executive directors
Greg Fitzgerald 1 July 2003 12
Graham Prothero 18 June 2012 12
Ken Gillespie 19 February 2013 12
1. Contract dates shown are the directors’ initial contract as an executive director 
or non-executive director of the Group. Executive directors have a rolling notice 
period as stated. Non-executive appointments are reviewed after a period of three 
years and their appointment is subject to a rolling notice period as stated. All 
serving directors (apart from Amanda Burton) will stand for re-election at the 2014 
annual general meeting.
2. There are no contractual provisions requiring payments to directors on loss of 
office or termination, other than payment of notice periods. The Remuneration 
Committee may seek to mitigate such payments where appropriate.
3. Subject to the discretion of the Nomination Committee, the Group’s practice is to 
agree notice periods of no more than six months for non-executive directors and no 
more than 12 months for executive directors. 
Executive directors’ service contracts are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours 
and will be available for inspection at the annual general meeting.
For executive directors, at the Group’s discretion, a sum equivalent 
to 12 months’ salary and benefits may be paid in lieu of notice. 
In the contracts of Graham Prothero and Ken Gillespie there are 
mitigation provisions to pay any such lump in monthly instalments, 
subject to offset against earnings elsewhere. This will also be the 
case for any future appointments.
For the proportion of the financial year worked, bonuses may be 
payable pro rata at the discretion of the Committee. Depending 
upon the circumstances, the Committee may consider additional 
non-statutory payments in respect of an unfair dismissal award, 
outplacement support and assistance with legal fees.
An executive director’s service contract may be terminated summarily 
without notice and without any further payment or compensation, 
except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, if they are 
deemed to be guilty of gross misconduct or for any other material 
breach of the obligations under their employment contract. 
The Group may suspend executive directors or put them on a 
period of garden leave during which they will be entitled to salary, 
benefits and pension. 
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director 
under the Group’s share plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules. The default treatment is that any outstanding 
awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as death in service, serious 
illness, injury, disability, retirement or other circumstances ‘good 
leaver’ status can be applied at the discretion of the Committee 
(taking into account the individual’s performance and the reasons 
for their departure).
For ‘good leavers’, awards may vest at the normal time (other than 
by exception) to the extent that the performance conditions have 
been satisfied. The level of vested awards will be reduced pro rata, 
based on the period of time after the grant date and ending on the 
date of cessation of employment relative to the three-year 
performance period, unless the Committee, acting fairly and 
reasonably, decides that such a scaling back is inappropriate in 
any particular case. Deferred bonus shares vest early.
The overriding principle will be to honour contractual remuneration 
entitlements and determine on an equitable basis the appropriate 
treatment of deferred and performance-related elements of 
remuneration, taking into account the circumstances. Failure will 
not be rewarded.
Policy on recruitment
In cases where the Group recruits a new executive director, the 
Committee will align the new executive’s remuneration with the 
approved Remuneration Policy. In arriving at a value for individual 
remuneration, the Committee will take into account the skills and 
experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that 
experience, as well as the importance of securing the preferred 
candidate. In exceptional circumstances the Committee reserves 
the right to award additional remuneration (in cash and/or shares)  
in excess of Remuneration Policy at appointment, exclusively to 
replace lost rewards or benefits. The Committee may also agree  
to meet certain other incidental expenses (for example, relocation 
costs) to secure recruitment of preferred candidates. Further 
details of the recruitment policy are set out in the following table

established in the role.
Pension and

In line with policy for 
executive directors.
 
Bonus In line with existing 
schemes.
Specific targets could

an individual where 
necessary within the 
annual bonus limit (150% 
of base salary for chief 
executive and 100% for 
other directors).
Pro rating applied as 
appropriate for intra-year 
joiners.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan
In line with Group 
policies and LTIP rules.
An award may be made 
in the year of joining or 
the award can be delayed 
until the following year. 
Targets would normally be 
the same as for awards to 
other directors.
Other share 
awards
The Committee may 
make an incentive award 
to replace deferred pay 
forfeited by an executive 
leaving a previous 
employer.
Awards would, where 
possible, be consistent 
with the awards forfeited 
in terms of structure, 
value, vesting periods and 
performance conditions.
The Committee may, in exceptional and appropriate 
circumstances, make use of the flexibility provided in both the 
Listing Rules and the approved Remuneration Policy, to make 
awards outside the existing parameters of the LTIP, if it deems 
such an award to be appropriate to replace forfeited deferred 
variable pay, in order to secure the preferred candidate. 
For internal promotions to executive director positions, the 
Committee’s policy is for legacy awards or incentives to be 
capable of vesting on their original terms or, at the discretion of the 
Committee, they may be amended to bring them into line with the 
policy for executive directors. 
For a new chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement 
would be set in accordance with the approved Remuneration 
Policy at that time.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Remuneration 
Policy, authority is given to the Group to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former directors (such as the payment 
of a pension or vesting and exercise of a past LTIP award) that 
have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Directors’ 
Remuneration Reports.
External directorships
With prior written approval of the Board in each case, executive 
directors are permitted to accept external appointments as 
non-executive directors and retain any associated fees. 
Policy: shareholder consultation and voting analysis
The Committee actively consults with relevant institutional 
shareholders regarding, and in advance of, substantial changes to 
Remuneration Policy or individual executive salary packages. It 
has not been necessary to approach shareholders during the year.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 58 onwards has 
been subject to audit.
Reward, potential and mix
The Committee’s objective is to design performance-related 
elements of pay that account for a significant proportion of total 
pay, at a targeted level of performance.
The individualised potential executive reward charts for 2014/15 
set out below have been prepared using the following 
assumptions: 
•	 for minimum remuneration: only fixed salary, benefits and 
pensions payments have been included;
•	 for on-target remuneration: fixed salary, benefits and pension 
plus on-target (52.5%) vesting of the Annual Bonus Plan and 
50% of the LTIP (face value) awards have been included; and
•	 for maximum remuneration: fixed salary, benefits and pension 
plus full vesting of the Annual Bonus Plan and super vesting 
(maximum 200%) of the LTIP (face value) awards have 
been included.
The chart below is indicative only, as share price movement and 
dividend accrual have been excluded. Salary levels are based on 
those applying on 1 July 2014. The value of taxable benefits is 
based on the cost of supplying those benefits (as disclosed) for 
the year ending 30 June 2014. Executive directors can participate 
in all employee share schemes on the same basis as other 
employees but, for simplicity, the value that may be received from 
participating in these schemes has been excluded. 58 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Committee: composition
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Amanda Burton 
until her departure. During the financial year the other members 
comprised Peter Rogers, Andrew Jenner and the chairman, Ian 
Coull. In February 2014, Ishbel Macpherson joined the Committee 
as chair designate. Terry Miller also joined the Committee. The 
company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee and the 
chief executive has a standing invitation to attend all Committee 
meetings. No director, or the company secretary, is present when 
his or her own remuneration is being considered.
During the financial year, the Committee prioritised the calendar of 
key activities and areas of focus set out below.

Remuneration advice and advisers
The Committee is informed of key developments and best practice 
in the field of remuneration and regularly obtains advice from 
independent external consultants, when required, on individual 
remuneration packages and on executive remuneration practices 
in general.
New Bridge Street (NBS) is the Committee’s sole remuneration 
consultant, having been appointed in January 2011. Services 
provided to the Committee by NBS encompassed remuneration 
guidance, regulatory guidance and share plan related consultancy. 
Fees paid to NBS for services provided to the Committee during 
the financial year were £28,551.
NBS do not provide any other services to the Group, although 
NBS is part of Aon plc. Aon continue to provide advice to the 
Group specifically relating to private medical insurance policies. 
The Committee is satisfied that these services do not impinge on 
the independence of NBS. Furthermore, NBS is a signatory to the 
Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct which requires that 
its advice be objective and impartial.
The general counsel and company secretary also advises the 
Committee as necessary and makes arrangements for the 
Committee to receive independent legal advice at the request of 
the Committee chair.
Performance
The Group has continued the strong financial performance 
established in recent years. The closing mid-market quotation for 
the Company’s shares on 30 June 2014 was £11.42 (2013: £9.34). 
The high and low during the year were £13.54 and £9.53 
respectively (2013: £9.99 and £6.06).
Comparative TSR performance across the financial year, reflecting 
share price movements plus dividends reinvested, ranked the 
Company as 3.1% and 15% above median, respectively, 
equivalent to between second and third, and third and fourth 
places against its dual comparator groups drawn from the 
housebuilding and construction industries. 
The FTSE 250 index was chosen as an index which includes 
companies of a comparable size and complexity and the FTSE All 
Share Index was chosen as a broader index which gives a wider 
perspective of performance. 
The Company’s TSR over the last five financial years, based on the 
30 trading day average values, is shown below: 
The chief executive’s total gross remuneration, and the percentage 
achieved of the maximum Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP awards, is

Performance-related remuneration
Annual Bonus Plan
For the financial year to 30 June 2014, Group targets were based 70% on profit at both half and full year, and 30% attributable to 
monthly, half year and full year cash management targets. The construction division chief executive’s targets were based on 20% Group 
targets and 80% construction division targets. Senior management have been subject to similar targets, which were applied to their 
respective divisional or business unit performance. The bonus outcome was subject to a scale back if certain non-financial targets in 
relation to health and safety, and HR were not achieved.
The target range is considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive information and has not been disclosed. The Committee will 
review whether these target ranges are capable of disclosure prior to publication of next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The performance outcome against the Group targets (before deductions for health and safety, and HR) set for the Annual Bonus Plan in 
2013/14 was as follows:
  % of bonus    
Measure Threshold On-target Maximum Actual performance Payout % of bonus
Profit  10% 37% 70% Above maximum 70%
Cash management  0% 15% 30% Above maximum 28%
Total 10% 52% 100% 98%
The Committee determined that in respect of the year to 30 June 2014, the resulting Annual Bonus Plan awards were as follows:

The Committee considered the performance against targets set at the start of the year for profit before tax, cash flow and other

performance. The profit and cash targets were exceeded, although monthly cash targets were affected by the decision, approved by the 
Board, to accelerate investment in land.  
Two thirds of the bonus earned in excess of the 50% salary threshold is required to be deferred into restricted shares. Although 
beneficially held by the participants, the allocated restricted shares are legally retained by the trustee of the EBT for a period of three 
years, and are subject to forfeiture provisions, unless otherwise agreed by the Committee in certain clemency situations. Subject to 
continued employment, the restricted shares are legally transferred to participants on the third anniversary of allocation. 60 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

1. Each LTIP award is a provisional allocation of a number of shares which is equal in value as at the date of grant to 100% of the individual’s basic salary as at the date of 
grant. The award is subject to performance conditions over a three-year period as described on page 60.
2. The face values of the LTIP awards are (to the nearest thousand): for Greg Fitzgerald, £450,000 (2010), £475,000 (2011), £487,000 (2012), and £538,000 (2013); for

Remuneration policy and report continued
Compliance with executive shareholding policy
As at 30 June 2014, Greg Fitzgerald and Ken Gillespie were both 
compliant with the minimum shareholding policy referred to on 
page 55, having shareholdings in market value on 30 June 2014 
representing 1,262% and 765% of their respective base salaries. 
Following his appointment in February 2013, Graham Prothero has 
five years to acquire the required shareholding and has undertaken 
to retain future shares vesting to him (net of shares sold for tax) 
under the LTIP for this purpose.
External directorships
During the year, Greg Fitzgerald served as a non-executive 
director of the NHBC, for which he received and retained an 
annual fee of £32,124. Ken Gillespie remained a non-fee-earning 
director of the Scottish Contractors Group, a non-profit 
industry body.
Implementation of policy on exit payments in year
The Committee has undertaken to disclose in full any exit 
payments to executive directors triggered during the financial year. 
None were payable in the 2013/14 financial year. 
It was also not necessary for the Committee to operate the 
clawback provisions integrated into the Group’s main executive 
incentive plans during the financial year.

equates to average remuneration per staff member of £49,800 per 
annum as at 30 June 2014 (2013: £48,500). 
Payments for loss of office and payments to former 
directors
In the year to 30 June 2014, the Group made no payments to 
directors for loss of office. Pursuant to the terms of the 2011 LTIP, 
for which the performance conditions concluded on 30 June 2014, 
38,907 shares will vest on 22 September 2014 to Frank Nelson, 
who retired from the Board in September 2012.
Forward looking implementation of policy
Base salaries
At the 2014 salary review completed in May, the directors carefully 
scrutinised pay and employment conditions across the Group. 
The backdrop of an improving economy and a need to retain key 
operational staff to deliver the revised 2018 strategy meant that 
average salary increases of 3.75% were accordingly approved for all 
staff across the Group’s divisions and central functions. The overall 
pay budget increased by 4%, with discretionary increases above the 
average pay increase of 3.75% awarded to selected staff, to reflect 
market adjustments and promotions. 
With effect from 1 July 2014, Greg Fitzgerald, Graham Prothero 
and Ken Gillespie were each awarded annual salary increases 
of £15,000 (to £550,000), £10,150 (to £348,500) and £10,000 
(to £343,300) respectively.
Annual bonus
The Committee has decided that for the financial year to 30 June 
2015, the existing bonus structure remains broadly appropriately 
aligned to corporate strategy. It will therefore remain in its current 
form, subject to adjustment of targets, with an opportunity of 
150% of salary for the chief executive and 100% of salary for the 
other executive directors. 
The level of award will be based on performance against a 
combination of Group targets for profit (60%), cash management 
(30%) and margin enhancement (10%). In the case of the 
construction division chief executive, these targets will be based 
on 50% Group and 50% construction division performance. The 
outcome may be subject to a scale back if certain non-financial 
targets in relation to health and safety, and HR are not achieved, 
and the Committee retains discretion to amend targets if house 
price inflation is higher than anticipated.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the 
performance targets for the forthcoming year, as these include 
items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. 
Information on the level of bonuses earned will be disclosed 
next year. 
LTIP
The base award levels under the LTIP for the 2014/15 financial 
year continue to be 100% of base salary, with a stretch vesting 
opportunity of 200% of the base award.
Vesting is based on TSR and EPS performance over the three 
years to 30 June 2017:
•	 Vesting of up to 50% of the base award will be based on EPS 
performance. 15% will vest if aggregate EPS is 334 pence 
over the period, increasing to 50% vesting for aggregate 
EPS of 408 pence. 
•	 Vesting of up to 75% of the base award will be based on the 
same TSR and EPS conditions as the 2013 awards. The peer 
groups will be the same as for the September 2013 grant. 63 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Strategic report Financials Governance
All-employee schemes
The Group operates a HMRC approved Sharesave scheme for the 
benefit of all staff. The Group is planning a further grant under the 
scheme later in 2014, to which the directors intend to apply a 20% 
option discount.
Chairman and non-executive fees
The chairman, Ian Coull, received a fee of £150,000 for the 2013/14 
financial year. Ian received no benefits in connection with his 
position, other than membership of the Group’s medical assurance 
plan. The standard non-executive fee was increased from £33,000 
to £40,000 per annum with effect from 1 February 2014. Amanda 
Burton received a £4,000 fee supplement in recognition of her 
appointment as the Group’s senior independent director, 
unchanged throughout the financial year. 
The chairman’s fee and the standard non-executive fee will remain 
unchanged for 2014/15. The fee supplement for the three chairs of 
Board Committees, which includes the senior independent 
director, is £7,500.
It is anticipated that the supplements paid to various non-
executive directors will further change in the 2014/15 financial year, 
reflecting changes to Committee and other responsibilities arising 
from Amanda Burton stepping down from the Board.
Employee benefit trust and dilution
The EBT is the primary mechanism by which shares required to 
satisfy the executive incentive plans are provided. During the 
financial year, the EBT purchased a further 680,061 shares in the 
market at an average price of £10.95, which resulted in a balance 
held at 30 June 2014 of 678,180 shares.
Including the purchase of shares, the Group provided net 
additional funds to the EBT during the financial year of  
£14.4 million, by extending the existing EBT loan facility. 
In only issuing 407,110 new shares during or since the financial  
year, the Company has complied with the dilution guidelines of the 
Association of British Insurers. The increase in the year reflects  
the satisfaction of grants vesting under the Group’s Sharesave 
plan in January 2014. Applying the guidelines, the Group has 
7.49% headroom against ‘the ten percent in ten years’ rule and 
4.1% headroom against the ‘five percent in ten years’ rule for 
discretionary plans.
Shareholder voting on the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
The Committee similarly takes account of annualised shareholder 
voting trends in connection with the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
advisory vote. Votes cast in support of the annual resolution to 
approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report over the previous five 
years are: 98.52% (2013), 99.16% (2012), 87.66% (2011), 95.38% 
(2010) and 97.10% (2009). Votes withheld in each of those years 
represented 3.16% (2013), 2.78% (2012), 1.91% (2011), 0.08% (2010) 
and 2.69% (2009) of the total votes cast.
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations (Amended) 2013 and the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with the Directors Remuneration Regulations 2013, 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations (Amended) 2013 and the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules. The auditors are required to 
report on the remuneration data disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report section and state whether, in their opinion, 
that part of the report had been properly prepared in accordance 
with relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended).
The Committee is governed by formal terms of reference agreed 
by the Board and is composed solely of non-executive directors, 
each of whom the Board considers are independent. The latest 
terms of references are available on the Group’s website.

Strategic Report
The Group is required by section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 
to present a Strategic Report in the Annual Report. The Strategic 
Report can be found on pages 1 to 41. 
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 42 to 66 is a statement 
for the purposes of Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.2.1. 
The Annual Report and Financial Statements use financial 
and non-financial key performance indicators wherever possible 
and appropriate.
Further information on the Group’s employees and employment 
practices, including its policies on equal opportunities for disabled 
employees and employee involvement, and its approach to 
environmental, social and community matters, including a 
consideration of the impact of the Group’s business on the 
environment, is provided in the Strategic Report on pages  
32 to 41. 
Results and dividends
The profit for the year, net of tax, of £77.2 million is shown in the 
consolidated income statement on page 72. The directors have 
recommended a final dividend of 38 pence per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 15 pence declared in February, results 
in a total dividend for the financial year of 53 pence. The total 
dividend for the financial year will distribute a total of £43.6 million. 
Subject to approval by shareholders in general meeting, the final 
dividend will be payable on 28 November 2014, to shareholders on 
the register at close of business on 17 October 2014.
Share capital, authorities and restrictions
The Company has one class of ordinary share capital, having a 
nominal value of 50 pence. The ordinary shares rank pari passu in 
respect of voting and participation and are listed for trading on the 
London Stock Exchange. At 30 June 2014, the Company had 
82,274,395 ordinary shares in issue (2013: 81,870,095). 
The directors are authorised on an annual basis to issue shares, 
to allot a limited number of shares in the Company for cash other 
than to existing shareholders, and to make market purchases of 
shares within prescribed limits. Resolutions to be proposed at the 
2014 annual general meeting (AGM) will renew all three of the 
directors’ standing authorities relating to share capital, which 
are further explained in the Notice of AGM sent separately to 
shareholders. Other than usual activity in connection with the 
Group’s share plans, no shares have been issued or purchased 
by the Company under the relevant authorities either during the 
financial year or to the date of this Annual Report.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s shares, 
with the exceptions that certain shares held by the EBT are 
restricted for the duration of the applicable performance periods 
under relevant Group share plans, and directors and persons 
discharging managerial responsibilities are periodically restricted 
in dealing in the Company’s shares under the Group Dealing Code, 
which reflects the requirements of the Model Code published by 
the UK Listing Authority under its Listing Rules. In certain specific 
circumstances, the directors are permitted to decline to register a 
transfer in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. 
There are no other limitations on holdings of securities, and no 
requirements to obtain the approval of the Company, or other 
holders of securities in the Company, prior to the share transfer. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or voting rights. 
There are no securities carrying specific rights with regard to 
control of the Company, with the exception that the EBT holds 
shares in the Company in connection with Group share plans 
which have rights with regard to control of the Company that 
are not exercisable directly by the employee. The EBT abstains 
from voting in respect of any shares so held. The EBT currently 
holds 0.82% of the issued share capital of the Company for the 
purposes of satisfying employee share options or share awards 
(2013: 1.32%).
Articles of association
The Articles of Association, adopted in 2009 to reflect the Companies 
Act 2006, set out the internal regulations of the Company, and define 
various aspects of the Company’s constitution including the rights 
of shareholders, procedures for the appointment and removal of 
directors, and the conduct of both directors and general meetings.
In accordance with the Articles, directors can be appointed or 
removed either by the Board or shareholders in general meeting. 
Amendments to the Articles require the approval of shareholders 
in general meeting expressly by way of special resolution. Copies 
of the Articles are available by contacting the company secretary 
at the registered office.

Board and directors’ interests
Summary biographies of the Board directors as at the date of this 
Annual Report are on page 43. Ishbel Macpherson and Terry Miller 
were both appointed as non-executive directors with effect from 
1 February 2014 and there have been no other changes to the 
Board, either during or since the financial year end, except that 
Greg Fitzgerald has indicated his intention to retire in 2015 and 
Amanda Burton has stepped down from the Board. 
The interests of the directors in the share capital of the Company 
are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 
63, where details of executive directors’ service contracts and 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment can also be found.
The Company operates a formal ongoing procedure for the 
disclosure, review and authorisation of directors’ actual and 
potential conflicts of interest, in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. In addition, conflicts of interest are reviewed, and as 
necessary further authorised, by the Board on an annual basis.
Significant agreements
Except for the agreements underpinning the Group’s refinancing of 
its revolving credit facility in February 2014, there are no persons 
with which it has contractual or other arrangements which are 
essential to its business. 
Charitable and political donations
For information regarding charitable donations please refer to the 
Strategic Report on page 38.
It is Group policy to avoid making political donations of any nature 
and accordingly none were made during the year. However, the 
Group notes the wide application of Part 14 of the Companies Act 
2006, but does not consider the housebuilding and construction 
industry bodies of which it is a member to be political 
organisations for the purposes of the Act.
Creditor payment policy
Group policy regarding creditor payment is to agree payment 
terms contractually with suppliers and land vendors, ensure the 
relevant terms of payment are included in contracts, and to abide 
by those terms when satisfied that goods, services or assets have 
been provided in accordance with the agreed contractual terms. 
In November 2013, the Group became a signatory to the Prompt 
Payment Code which contains, amongst other, commitments to 
pay suppliers within agreed contract terms. 
Financial instruments
Further information regarding the Group’s financial instruments, 
related policies and a consideration of its liquidity and other 
financing risks can be found in the financial review from page 14, 
and in note 25 to the financial statements.
Important developments since year end 
There have been no material events or developments affecting the 
Company or any of its operating subsidiaries since 30 June 2014 
except that the chief executive, Greg Fitzgerald, has indicated his 
intention to retire in 2015. Also on 9 July 2014 the Group acquired 
Miller Construction, a UK construction business which delivers 
building and infrastructure projects to both the public and private 
sectors and which reported revenue of £409 million for the year 
ended on 31 December 2013.
Going concern 
In accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on 
Going Concern and Liquidity published in 2009, the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code and Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3), 
the directors have conducted a rigorous and proportionate 
assessment of the Group’s ability to continue in existence for the 
foreseeable future. This has been reviewed during the financial 
year, taking into account the Group’s refinancing of its core 
revolving credit facility agreed in February 2014, and the directors 
have concluded that there are no material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Furthermore, the Group has adequate resources 
and visibility as to its future workload, as explained in this Annual 
Report. It is therefore justified in using the going concern basis in 
preparing these financial statements.
Independent auditor
Each of the directors at the date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
•	 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditor is unaware; and
•	 the director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
A resolution is to be proposed at the forthcoming AGM for the 
reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditor of the 
Company, at a rate of remuneration to be determined by the 
Audit Committee.
AGM
The AGM will be held at the offices of Royal Bank of Scotland, 
3rd Floor Conference Centre, 250 Bishopsgate, London EC2M 
4AA, on 7 November 2014 at 11 am. The notice convening the 
AGM, sent to shareholders separately, explains the items of 
business which are not of a routine nature.
Fair, balanced and understandable 
In accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and as further described on pages 48 and 49, the Group has 
arrangements in place to ensure that the information presented 
in this Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. The 
directors consider, on the advice of the Audit Committee, that 
the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Approval of report
This Directors’ Report, including by reference the Strategic Report 
on page 1 to 41 and the Corporate Governance and Directors’ 
Remuneration Reports on page 42 to 66, was approved by the 
Board of Directors on 16 September 2014.

16 September 2014 66 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under company law the 
directors have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements, unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the Company and to enable 
them to ensure that the Group financial statements comply with 
both the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the International 
Accountancy Standards Regulation; and that the Parent Company 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors whose names and functions are listed on 
page 43, confirms that to the best of their knowledge:
•	 the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
•	 the Strategic Report contained in pages 1 to 41 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
For and on behalf of the Board

Chairman

Forward looking statements
Forward looking statements have been made by the directors 
in good faith using information up until the date on which they 
approved this Annual Report. Forward looking statements should 
be regarded with caution due to uncertainties in economic trends 
and business risks. The Group’s businesses are generally not 
affected by seasonality.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
•	 Galliford Try plc’s group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the financial statements) give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2014 and of the Group’s profit, and the 
Group’s and the Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
•	 the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
Galliford Try plc’s financial statements comprise:
•	 the consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets as at 30 June 2014;
•	 the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
•	 the consolidated and Parent Company statements of cash flows for the year then ended;
•	 the consolidated and Parent Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
•	 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit approach
Overview
•	 Overall Group materiality: £4.5 million which represents 5% of profit before tax.
•	 We conducted an audit of complete financial information at four reporting units across the UK.
•	 Our audit scope addressed 87% of Group revenue and 100% of Group profit before tax.
•	 Risk of fraud in revenue recognition and contract accounting.
•	 Valuation of housebuilding developments.
•	 Valuation of amounts recoverable on construction contracts.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may 
represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “Areas of focus” in the table on page 68 together with an explanation of how we tailored our audit to address these specific 
areas. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of focus identified by our audit.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition and contract accounting 
See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors’ 
disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements 
and estimates and note 2 for further information around the 
segmental split of revenues.
Most businesses face a risk of fraud in revenue recognition.
Construction contract accounting is inherently complex and 
we focussed on this area because there is judgement involved 
in estimating the costs to complete of projects. Revenue from 
fixed price construction contracts is recognised based upon 
management’s assessment of the value of works carried out 
considering performance against the programme of works, 
measurement of the works, detailed evaluation of the costs 
incurred and comparison to external certification of the work 
performed. Profit is not recognised until the outcome of the 
contract is reasonably certain.
We also focussed on the timing of recognition of housebuilding 
revenue where private housing sales are only recognised once 
legal completion has been achieved.
•	 We performed data analysis to identify potentially unusual 
manual journal entries impacting revenue and performed 
testing on those items.
•	 We identified and assessed key judgements inherent in the 
estimation of significant construction contract projects, 
particularly around validating stage-of-completion and costs 
to completion on significant projects, as well as evaluating 
the final outcome on projects completed in the year in 
relation to previous estimates made.
•	 We agreed revenue recognised on a sample of major projects 
to supporting documentation such as customer contracts 
and signed variations.
•	 We tested the timing of construction contract revenue 
recognition, taking into account contractual obligations, 
the percentage of the contract completed, third-party 
certifications and the timing of cash receipts.
•	 For housebuilding revenue, we tested a sample of sales by 
examining legal completion documents and by checking 
the level of remedial work carried out after the year end 
to confirm that the building work was complete. We also 
considered the third-party release of mortgage finance, 
where appropriate, to check building work was complete.
Risk that housebuilding developments may not be valued 
appropriately
See pages 30–31 and note 16 to the financial statements.
The valuation of developments is dependent upon the correct 
estimation and allocation of common costs on housebuilding 
sites. Common costs are allocated proportionately across 
the site using projected site margin to give a common gross 
profit margin on all units on that site. Older or slower-moving 
developments can be an indication of potential impairment.
•	 We identified and tested the operating effectiveness of key 
controls around the estimation and allocation of common 
costs on sites, estimation of costs to complete and 
calculation of projected site margins.
•	 We compared management’s assumptions on future 
sales prices for a site to completed sales and available 
industry data.
•	 We identified and assessed key judgements inherent in 
estimates of site and project margins, particularly around 
the allocation of common costs on sites and working 
relationships with subcontractors.
•	 We evaluated the ageing of developments and investigated 
large and older items.
Risk that amounts recoverable on construction contracts may 
not be valued appropriately
See pages 30–31, and notes 1 and 17 to the financial statements 
for the directors’ disclosures of the related accounting policies, 
judgements and estimates.
The valuation of amounts recoverable on construction contracts 
is dependent on judgements around stage-of-completion 
and remaining costs to complete, as well as the associated 
provisions.
•	 We tested the operating effectiveness of key controls 
around stage-of-completion, costs to complete and forecast 
margin calculations.
•	 We identified and assessed key judgements inherent 
in estimation of significant projects, particularly around 
stage-of-completion, costs to complete and provisions 
on loss-making contracts through our testing of contract 
review meetings, review of correspondence and testing 
of audit evidence on customer/supplier disputes and 
insurance claims.
•	 We reviewed the final outcome on projects completed in the 
year in relation to previous estimates made to assess the 
reliability of management’s estimates.
•	 We tested whether valid contractual agreements or other 
documentation was in place to support recognised balances.
•	 We identified and assessed unusual fluctuations in significant 
project margins. Strategic report Financials Governance
69 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
How we approached the audit scope
In identifying these areas of focus and in ensuring that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, we took into account: the divisional structure of the Group; the accounting processes and controls; and the 
industry in which the Group operates, and tailored the scope of our audit accordingly.
The Group is structured in two principal divisions, being housebuilding (comprising Linden Homes and Partnerships) and construction 
(comprising building and infrastructure). The Group financial statements are a consolidation of six reporting units in total, comprising the 
four operating entities within these two divisions, PPP Investments and centralised Group functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at reporting units. 
Of the Group’s six reporting units, we identified that Linden Homes, building, infrastructure and centralised Group functions, in our view, 
required an audit of their entire financial information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics. This, together with additional 
procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items were audited by the Group engagement team 
at the head office. These included valuation of goodwill and legacy defined benefit pension scheme balances.
Taken together, our audit work performed at individual business unit locations and at the head office addressed 87% of Group revenue 
and 100% of Group profit before tax.
Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and 
to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality: £4.5 million (2013: £3.7 million)
How we determined it: 5% of profit before tax 
Rationale for benchmark applied: We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, in the 
absence of indicators that an alternative benchmark would be more appropriate.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £230,000 (2013: 
£150,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 65, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the 
going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Parent Company have adequate resources 
to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were 
signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 70 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

•	 the statement given by the directors on page 65, in accordance with UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) Provision C.1.1, that they consider the Annual Report taken 
as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company acquired in the course 
of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.
•	 the section of the Annual Report on pages 48 to 49, as required by Code Provision C.3.8, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

prepared by the Parent Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 66, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

77 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
1 Accounting policies
General information
Galliford Try plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated, listed and domiciled in England and Wales. The address of the 
registered office is Galliford Try plc, Cowley Business Park, Cowley, Uxbridge, UB8 2AL. Galliford Try is a construction and housebuilding 
group (the Group).
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. The amounts stated are denominated in millions (£m).
Basis of accounting
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU adopted International Accounting Standards (IASs), 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations 
and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available for sale investments, retirement 
benefit obligations, share-based payments and financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value 
through profit and loss. The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board and IFRIC and endorsed by the EU, relevant to its operations and effective on 1 July 2013. 
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 to not present the parent company 
income statement and statement of comprehensive income. The loss for the parent company for the year was £3.6 million (2013: profit 
£3.0 million).
New amendments to standards that became mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2013 are listed below. 
The new amendments had no significant impact on the Group’s results other than certain revised disclosures.
– IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ 
– IAS 19 (revised 2011) ‘Employee benefits’ 
– Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ on deferred tax 
– Amendment to IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption’
– Amendment to IFRS 7 on ‘Financial instruments: asset and liability offsetting’
– IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine’
– Other changes recommended in ‘Annual Improvements 2011’
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective or yet to be endorsed by the EU are as follows:
– IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ and the amendment on general hedge accounting (effective 1 January 2018)
– IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory deferral accounts’ (effective 1 January 2016)
– IAS 27 (revised 2011) ‘Separate financial statements’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘Associates and joint ventures’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 & 12 on transition guidance (effective 1 January 2014)
– Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 & IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities (effective 1 January 2014)
– Amendment to IAS 32 on ‘Financial instruments: asset and liability offsetting’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– Amendment to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ (effective 1 January 2016)
– Amendment to IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement’ (effective 1 January 2014)
– Other changes recommended in ‘Annual Improvements 2012’ and ‘Annual Improvements 2013’ (effective 1 July 2014)
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Group’s accounting for its 
financial assets. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact. However, initial indications are that it may affect the Group’s accounting 
for its available for sale financial assets, as IFRS 9 only permits the recognition of fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive 
income if they relate to equity or certain debt investments that are not held for trading. Fair value gains and losses on available for sale 
debt investments, for example, will therefore have to be recognised directly in profit or loss.
The Group has yet to assess the full impact of the remainder of these new standards and amendments. Initial indications are that they 
will not significantly impact the financial statements of the Group.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 78 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
1 Accounting policies continued
Material estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regards to establishing the following policies: 
(i) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The determination of the value of any impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows 
expected from these cash-generating units, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and requires the determination 
of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Details of the goodwill impairment review calculations and 
sensitivity analysis performed are included in note 10.
(ii) Estimation of costs to complete and contract provisions
In order to determine the profit and loss that the Group is able to recognise on its developments and construction contracts in a specific 
period, the Group has to allocate total costs of the developments and construction contracts between the proportion completing in the 
period and the proportion to complete in a future period. The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation. 
However, Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an 
individual contract basis.
(iii) Retirement benefit obligation valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit schemes’ assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. The key 
assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group:
•	 return on plan assets;
•	 inflation rate;
•	 life expectancy;
•	 discount rate; and
•	 salary and pension growth rates.
The Group is exposed to risks through its defined benefit schemes if actual experience differs to the assumptions used and through 
volatility in the plan assets. Details of the assumptions used, and associated sensitivities, are included in note 30.
(iv) Shared equity receivables
Shared equity receivables largely have variable repayment dates and amounts, and are provided as part of the sales transaction 
secured by a second legal charge on the related property. They are stated at fair value as described in note 14. In determining the fair 
value, the key assumptions, which are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group are:
•	 date of final repayment of the receivable;
•	 house price inflation; and
•	 discount rate.
Details of the sensitivity analysis carried out in respect of the shared equity receivables are set out in note 25.
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Galliford Try plc, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of the 
results of joint ventures. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies. 
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether 
the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, until the 
date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 
exchange. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed to the income statement. The identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of any non-controlling interest. The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries 
are changed where necessary, to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
In addition to total performance measures, the Group discloses additional information including profit from operations and, if applicable, 
performance before exceptional items and adjusted earnings per share. The Group believes that this additional information provides useful 
information on underlying trends. This additional information is not defined under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly 
titled profit measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit.

79 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
1 Accounting policies continued
Exceptional items
Material non-recurring items of income and expense are disclosed in the income statement as exceptional items. Examples of items 
which may give rise to disclosure as exceptional items include gains and losses on the disposal of businesses, investments and 
property, plant and equipment, cost of restructuring and reorganisation of businesses, asset impairments and pension fund settlements 
and curtailments. In light of the Financial Reporting Council’s press release of December 2013 the Group has classified certain inventory 
provision reversals as exceptional, as set out in note 5.
Segmental reporting
Segmental reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s business segments, which are the 
primary basis of segmental reporting. The business segmental reporting reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. 
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Revenue and profit
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser. Revenue comprises 
the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of rebates, discounts and value added tax. Sales within the Group are 
eliminated. Revenue also includes the Group’s proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue and profit are recognised as follows:
(i) Housebuilding and land sales
Revenue from private housing sales is recognised at legal completion, net of incentives. Revenue from land sales is recognised on the 
unconditional exchange of contracts. Profit is recognised on a site by site basis, by reference to the expected result of each site. 
Contracting development sales for affordable housing are accounted for as construction contracts.
(ii) Facilities management contracts 
Revenue is recognised on an accruals basis once the service has been performed, with reference to value provided to the customer. 
Profit is recognised by reference to the specific costs incurred relating to the service provided.
(iii) Construction contracts
Revenue comprises the value of construction executed during the year and contracting development sales for affordable housing. 
The results for the year include adjustments for the outcome of contracts, including jointly controlled operations, executed in both the 
current and preceding years. 
 (a) Fixed price contracts – Revenue is recognised based upon an internal assessment of the value of works carried out. This 
assessment is arrived at after due consideration of the performance against the programme of works, measurement of the works, 
detailed evaluation of the costs incurred and comparison to external certification of the work performed. The amount of profit to be 
recognised is calculated based on the proportion that costs to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete. Revenue and 
profit are not recognised in the income statement until the outcome of the contract is reasonably certain. Adjustments arise from 
claims by or against customers or third parties in respect of work carried out for variations on the original contract. Provision for 
claims against the Group is made as soon as it is believed that a liability will arise, but claims and variations made by the Group are 
not recognised in the income statement until the outcome is virtually certain. Provision will be made against any potential loss as 
soon as it is identified.
 (b) Cost plus contracts - Revenue is recognised based upon costs incurred to date plus any agreed fee. Where contracts include 
a target price, consideration is given to the impact on revenue of the mechanism for distributing any savings or additional costs 
compared to the target price. Any revenue over and above the target price is recognised once the outcome is virtually certain. 
Profit is recognised on a constant margin throughout the life of the contract. Provision will be made against any potential loss as 
soon as it is identified.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts and payments on account on construction contracts are calculated as cost plus 
attributable profit less any foreseeable losses and cash received to date, and are included in receivables or payables as appropriate.
Housing grants and government funding
Grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the 
grants will be received. The grants are recognised in the Income Statement over the periods necessary to match them with the related 
costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis.
Interest bearing loans received from the government, for example under the Homes & Communities Agency (HCA) programmes, are 
recorded at proceeds plus accrued interest and reported within Financial Liabilities - Borrowings.
Grants and government funding received by the Group in the year to 30 June 2014 include direct capital grant funding awards under the 
HCA’s Affordable Homes Programme; infrastructure loan finance under the Large Sites Infrastructure Fund; and equity loans provided to 
house buyers under the Help to Buy home ownership initiative. 80 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
1 Accounting policies continued
Bid costs for PFI/PPP contracts
Bid costs relating to PFI/PPP projects are not carried in the balance sheet as recoverable until the Group has been appointed preferred 
bidder or has received an indemnity in respect of the investment or costs, and regards recoverability of the costs as virtually certain. 
Costs that are carried on the balance sheet are included within amounts recoverable on construction contracts, within trade and 
other receivables.
Rent receivable 
Rental income represents income obtained from the rental of properties and is credited to the income statement within revenue on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the operating lease.
Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense is recognised on a time proportion basis, using the effective interest method.
Income tax
Current income tax is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation recorded in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or 
deductible. The liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for all temporary differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured 
at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is 
more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future, out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying 
temporary differences can be deducted. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited through the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited through 
the statement of comprehensive income or to equity, when it is charged or credited there.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the net assets 
acquired. It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event, by considering 
the net present value of future cash flows. For purposes of testing for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is charged immediately 
to the income statement. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, following 
impairment tests. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been restated.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating 
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include brands, customer contracts and customer relationships acquired on acquisition of subsidiary companies, 
and computer software developed by the Group. The intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a 
triggering event. Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Cost is determined at the time of 
acquisition as being directly attributable costs or, where relevant, by using an appropriate valuation methodology.
Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods:
(a) Brands – on a straight line basis over four to ten years.
(b) Customer contracts – in line with expected profit generation, varying from one to nine years.
(c) Customer relationships – on a straight line basis over three years.
(d) Computer software – once the software is fully operational, amortisation is on a straight line basis over up to ten years.
At 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014 the Group’s only intangible assets related to computer software and brands.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Strategic report Financials Governance
81 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
1 Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Land and buildings mainly comprise offices.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of each asset to its estimated residual value over its expected useful life. Freehold land is 
not depreciated. The annual rates of depreciation are as follows: 
Freehold buildings 2% on cost
On cost or reducing balance: 
Plant and machinery 15% to 33%
Fixtures and fittings 10% to 33%
In addition to systematic depreciation, the book value of property, plant and equipment would be written down to its estimated 
recoverable amount should any impairment in the respective carrying values be identified.
The asset residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance 
sheet date.
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is expensed as incurred on an accruals basis.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with third 
parties and these parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The Group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the 
equity method. Under this method the Group’s share of profits less losses after taxation of joint ventures is included in the consolidated 
income statement and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the share of 
losses exceeds the Group’s interest in the entity and there is no obligation to fund these losses, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and 
recognition of further losses is discontinued. Future profits are not recognised until unrecognised losses are extinguished. Accounting 
policies of joint ventures have been changed on consolidation where necessary, to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group. 
Where joint ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net assets are based upon 
unaudited accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting reference date.
Joint operations
A joint operation is a joint arrangement that the Group undertakes with third parties, whereby those parties have rights to the assets and 
obligations of the arrangement. The Group accounts for joint operations by recognising its share of profits and losses in the consolidated 
income statement. The Group recognises its share of associated assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the assets within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date. On initial recognition the asset is recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Available for sale financial assets 
are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in 
other comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
The Group operates schemes under which part of the agreed sales price for a residential property can be deferred for up to 25 years. 
The fair value of these assets is calculated by taking into account forecast inflation in property prices and discounting back to present 
value using the effective interest rate. Provision is also made for estimated default, to arrive at the initial fair value. The unwinding of the 
discount included on initial recognition at fair value is recognised as finance income in the year. 
Leases
Leases in which a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Inventories and developments
Inventories and developments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Work in progress is valued at the lower of 
cost, including direct costs and directly attributable overheads, and net realisable value. On initial recognition, land is included within 
developments at its fair value, which is its cost to the Group. Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised, which is 
generally after the exchange of conditional contracts once it is virtually certain the contract will be completed.
Where a development is in progress, net realisable value is assessed by considering the expected future revenues and the total costs to 
complete the development, including direct costs and directly attributable overheads. To the extent that the Group anticipates selling a 
development in its current state, then net realisable value is taken as its open market value at the balance sheet date less any 
anticipated selling costs. 82 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
1 Accounting policies continued
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the 
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (typically 
more than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the income statement within cost of sales. 
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the impairment provision for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against cost of sales in the income statement. Short-term trade receivables do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their amortised cost, as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Bank 
overdrafts are also included, as they are an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
Bank deposits with an original term of more than three months are classified as short term deposits where the cash can be withdrawn 
on demand and the penalty for early withdrawal is not significant. Cash held in escrow accounts is classified as a short term deposit 
where the escrow agreement allows the balance to be converted to cash, if replaced by a bond repayable on demand.
Bank and other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are originally recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Such 
borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, with the difference between initial fair value and redemption value recognised in 
the income statement over the period to redemption.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals 
basis in the income statement, using the effective interest rate method. Refinancing costs associated with new borrowing arrangements 
are included within the borrowing amount and amortised over the period of the loan.
Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate and subsequently 
held at amortised cost. The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using 
the effective interest rate. Changes in estimates of the final payment due are taken to developments (land) and, in due course, to cost of 
sales in the Income Statement.
Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past 
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using the pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense. 
Derivative financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision 
of the instrument.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. In accordance with its treasury policy, 
the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, comprising interest rate swaps, are measured 
at fair value. The effective portion of changes in the fair value is recognised directly in reserves. Amounts accumulated in equity are 
recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit or loss. Any gains or losses relating to an 
ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement. 
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Strategic report Financials Governance
83 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
1 Accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are initially accounted for and measured at fair value at the 
point the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the 
income statement. 
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the 
income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution schemes operated by the Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
method. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the excess of the fair value of the schemes’ assets 
over the present value of scheme liabilities, with a net asset recognised to the extent that the employer can gain economic benefit as set 
out in the requirements of IFRIC 14. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash flows, using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
pension liability. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Gains and losses arising on curtailment and settlements are taken to the income statement as incurred.
Accounting for the Employee Share Ownership Plan
Own shares held by the Galliford Try Employee Share Trust (the Trust) are shown, at cost less any permanent diminution in value, as a 
deduction from retained earnings. The charge made to the income statement for employee share awards and options is based on the 
fair value of the award at the date of grant, spread over the performance period. Where such shares subsequently vest to the employees 
under the terms of the Group’s share option schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in equity. 
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions such as growth in earnings per share. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact 
of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised. The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
Dividend policy
Final dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments, such as ordinary share capital, issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly 
attributable incremental issue costs. Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the Trust are deducted from total equity.
Investments in subsidiaries
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Company’s balance sheet at cost less any impairment. The directors 
review the investments for impairment annually.
2 Segmental reporting
Segmental reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s business segments, which are the 
primary basis of segmental reporting. The business segmental reporting reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting 
structure. Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis. As the Group has no material activities outside the UK, segment reporting is not required by geographical region.
The chief operating decision-makers (CODM) have been identified as the Group’s chief executive and finance director. The CODM 
review the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. As set out in the financial review, in the 
year to 30 June 2014 the Group has reviewed its internal reporting structure and now reports Galliford Try Partnerships separately to 
Linden Homes and the construction businesses. Accordingly, management has determined the operating segments as housebuilding, 
including Linden Homes and Partnerships; construction, including building and infrastructure; and PPP investments. The Group’s 
segmental reporting has been revised, and the comparative disclosures as at 30 June 2013 restated, to reflect the new structure. 
Further information can be found within the Strategic Report. 84 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
2 Segmental reporting continued
The CODM assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted earnings before finance costs, 
amortisation, exceptional items and taxation. This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure from the 
operating segments, such as restructuring costs and impairments when the impairment is the result of an isolated, non-recurring event. 
Interest income and expenditure are included in the result for each operating segment that is reviewed by the CODM. Other information 
provided to them is measured in a manner consistent with that in the financial statements.

The total income tax expense for the year of £18.0 million (2013: £15.9 million) is lower (2013: lower) than the blended effective rate of 
corporation tax in the UK of 22.5% (2013: 23.75%). The differences are explained below:

Income tax expense 18.0 15.9
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. Accordingly, the Group’s profits 
for the accounting period to 30 June 2013 were taxed at an effective rate of 23.75%. The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 
changed from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014. Accordingly, the Group’s profits for the accounting period to 30 June 2014 are 
taxed at an effective rate of 22.5%. 
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above, further changes to the UK corporation tax system were 
announced in the March 2013 UK Budget Statement and substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2013 on 2 July 2013. These 
included reductions to the main rate of corporation tax by a further 1% to 20% by 1 April 2015. This further rate reduction had been 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, the relevant deferred tax balances have been remeasured.

8 Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Share Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
Under normal circumstances, the average number of shares is diluted by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares 
held under option in the period. The dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased, using the 
aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option price. Only shares that have met their cumulative 
performance criteria are included in the dilution calculation. The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those 
share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares 
during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plan. A loss per share cannot be reduced 
through dilution, hence this dilution is only applied where the Group has reported a profit.  
The earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Impairment review of goodwill 
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to business segment. 
The goodwill is attributable to the following business segments:
2014
£m
2013
£m
Linden Homes 52.2 52.2
Galliford Try Partnerships 5.8 5.8
Building 17.9 17.9
Infrastructure 37.2 37.2
PPP Investments 1.9 1.9
115.0 115.0
Key assumptions
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow 
projections, based on future financial budgets approved by the Board, based on past performance and its expectation of market 
developments. The key assumptions within these budgets relate to revenue growth and the future profit margin achievable. Future 
budgeted revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years and latest forecasts for the current year, 
along with the existing secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available within the market sector and 
expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins, the margins currently being 
achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current market value of land being 
acquired. 
Cash is monitored very closely on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, for the purposes of managing both treasury and the business as a 
whole. Details of the Group’s treasury management are included within the financial review on pages 14 to 17 of the Annual Report. The 
assumptions used are reviewed regularly and differences between forecast and actual results are closely monitored, with variances 
being investigated fully. The knowledge gained from this past experience is used to ensure that the future assumptions used are 
consistent with past actual outcomes and are management’s best estimate of the future cash flows of each business unit. 
Cash flows beyond the budgeted three year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% per annum within building, 
infrastructure and housebuilding. The growth rate used is the Group’s estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market 
sectors in which the CGU operates. No long term growth rate has been applied to PPP Investments. A pre-tax discount rate of 12.1% 
(2013: 11.8%) in Linden Homes, 10.2% (2013: 9.8%) in Partnerships, 10.1% (2013: 11.5%) in building and 10.9% (2013: 11.9%) in 
infrastructure has been applied to the future cash flows, based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of each division.
Sensitivities
The recoverable values of all CGUs are substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken 
on each goodwill impairment review, by changing the discount rates, profit margins, growth rates and other variables applicable to each 
CGU. Taking into account current market conditions within the construction and housebuilding markets, none of these sensitivities, 
either individually or combined, resulted in the fair value of the goodwill being reduced to below its current book value amount.
The detailed sensitivity analysis indicates that an increase of more than 31% (2013: 46%) in the pre-tax discount rate or a reduction of 
22% (2013: 45%) in the forecast operating profits of the Linden Homes CGU could give rise to an impairment. The goodwill in the other 
segments is less sensitive to the detailed assumptions used and hence no additional disclosure is considered necessary. 92 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

At 30 June 23.4 26.8
The available for sale assets comprise equity securities, being PPP/PFI investments, and shared equity receivables. The shared equity 
receivables largely have variable repayment dates and repayment amounts, provided as part of the sales transaction, and are secured by a 
second legal charge on the related property. The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future receivable by the Group, 
discounted back to present values. The fair value of the future anticipated receipts takes into account the directors’ view of future house 
price movements, the expected timing of receipts and credit risk. These assumptions are reviewed at the end of each financial reporting 
period. The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited to finance income over the estimated 
deferred term, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date. Credit risk, 
which is largely mitigated by holding a second charge over the property, is accounted for in determining the fair values and appropriate 
discount rates that are applied. The directors review the financial assets for impairment at each balance sheet date. 
During the year the Group’s net investment in shared equity receivables decreased by £2.9 million (2013: increase £0.6 million). There 
were £0.1 million of new shared equity receivables and £1.6 million arose on the unwinding of the discount applied on initial recognition 
of the receivables at fair value, which has been shown as finance income in the income statement. An impairment of £1.7 million arose 
due to the variation in current assumptions compared to the original calculations. There were disposals in the year of £2.6 million (2013: 
£1.5 million) relating to the repayment of shared equity receivables, generating a profit on disposal of £0.8 million (2013: £0.3 million).

None of the financial assets are past their due dates (2013: Nil) and the directors expect an average maturity profile of ten years.

During the year, the Group made additional subordinated loans of £0.4 million (2013: £0.8 million) to its PPP/PFI investments, and 
disposed of interests held at £1.2 million (2013: £1.1 million), generating a profit on disposal of £1.6 million (2013: £0.5 million). The fair 
value of these unlisted investments is based on future expected cash flows discounted using an average rate of 9% (2013: 9%) based on 
the type of investment and stage of completion of the underlying assets held.

provision are generally written off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
Provisions for amounts due from joint venture undertakings are set out in note 13. The other classes within trade and other receivables 
do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the book value of each class of receivable mentioned above, along with 
the Group’s investment in shared equity receivables (note 14) and its cash and cash equivalents. The Group does not hold any collateral 
as security. 
Management believes that the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited, due to the Group’s customer base 
being large and unrelated. Major water industry customers accounted for in total 8% (2013: 12%) of Group revenue in the year. However, 
the customers involved comprise a variety of entities, including those in both the public and commercial sectors. In addition, within the 
commercial sector each customer has an unrelated ultimate parent company.

February 2014. They currently incur interest at 2.25 – 2.55% (2013: 2.25 – 2.6%) over LIBOR. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps as set out in note 25. The bank 
loans are classified as non-current as the Group expects to, and has the discretion to, roll over the obligations under its existing bank facility.
2. The unsecured loan notes are £Nil (2013: £0.1 million) of loan notes that were issued in 2007 as part of the acquisition of Linden Holdings plc. They were redeemable in 
whole or in part by the holders at six monthly intervals, provided that 30 days’ notice was given of their intention to redeem the loan notes. Their interest rate was 5% per 
annum. The loan notes were redeemed in March 2014, their final date for redemption. The loan notes were guaranteed by a bank.

25 Financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and interest rate 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the 
net amount reported when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a 
net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Cash and cash equivalents comprise £707.8 million of bank accounts 
in credit offset against £567.4 million overdrafts with the same counter-party (2013: £593.4 million and £535.5 million respectively).
The Group and Company operate within financial risk policies and procedures approved by the Board. It is, and has been throughout 
the year, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. The Board provides written principles for overall 
risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of 
derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity. The Group’s and Company’s 
financial instruments principally comprise bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables, available for sale 
financial assets and interest rate swaps that arise directly from its operations and its acquisitions.
Capital risk management
The Group’s and Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital. The capital requirements of the Group’s divisions differ, with housebuilding typically requiring debt and partnerships and 
construction typically being cash generative, and the economic cycle of each division is also different. The Group manages its capital 
taking these differing requirements into account.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group and Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. In 2014, the Group increased its bank facilities to £400 
million, following a review of its future capital requirements undertaken in the context of the Group’s strategy to 2018 and we are 
targeting period-end gearing of no more than 30%.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt 
divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the 
consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. The Group held net debt at 30 June 2014 and had gearing of 1%. The 
Group also held net debt at 30 June 2013, with gearing of 3%. The Group also has capital requirements in the covenants in its bank 
facilities, as set out later in this note. The Group has complied with all bank covenants during the year.
Financial risk factors
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
All material activities of the Group take place within the UK and consequently there is little direct exchange risk other than payments to 
overseas suppliers who require settlement in their currency. If there is any material foreign exchange exposure, the Group’s policy is to 
enter into forward foreign currency contracts. The Group and Company have no material currency exposure at 30 June 2014 (2013: Nil). 
(ii) Price risk
The Group is affected by the level of UK house prices. These are in turn affected by factors such as mortgage availability, employment 
levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and availability of land with planning. Whilst it is not possible to fully mitigate such risks the 
Group continues to monitor its geographical spread within the UK concentrating its operations in areas that management believe 
minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations. As at 30 June 2014, the Group’s house price linked financial instruments consist 
entirely of shared equity receivables held as available for sale financial assets. If UK house price inflation had been 1% higher or lower, 
with all other variables held constant and excluding any effect of current or deferred tax, the value of these financial instruments would 
increase or decrease by £1.6 million respectively, with a corresponding change in the result for the year and equity; whilst if the discount 
rate used had been 1% higher or lower, the value of these financial instruments would decrease or increase by £1.5 million respectively. 
The concentration of the financial risk lies within price risk as a result of these financial instruments being linked to house prices.
The Group has no quoted investments that are exposed to equity securities price risk. The Group and Company are not exposed to 
commodity price risk. 
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from movement in cash and cash equivalents and long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at 
variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk as long as the 
effect of various changes in rates remains within prescribed ranges. Details of the interest rate swaps entered into by the Group are set 
out below. 
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. On a regular basis the Group calculates the impact on the income 
statement of a defined interest rate shift on the Group’s borrowing position. 
Based on the forecasts performed, the impact on post tax profit and equity of a 1% decrease or increase in interest rates for a year 
would be a maximum increase of £1.7 million (2013: £1.2 million) or decrease of £1.7 million (2013: £1.2 million), respectively. 102 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
25 Financial instruments continued
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits 
and borrowings with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables 
(including shared equity receivables) and committed transactions. The Group has a credit risk exposure to the providers of its banking 
facilities. These are primarily provided by HSBC Bank plc, Abbey National Treasury Services plc (Santander), The Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc and Barclays Bank plc, being four of the UK’s leading financial institutions. Further details of credit risk relating to trade and 
other receivables are disclosed in note 18. No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not 
expect any material losses from non-performance of any counterparties, including in respect of receivables not yet due.
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through 
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains 
flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The contracting operations of the Group 
generally generate cash. The housebuilding operations, however, utilise cash and any future downturn in the housebuilding market may 
require additional borrowings, in addition to retained earnings, to finance the maintenance of the landbank and associated work in 
progress. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve, which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities (see below) 
and cash and cash equivalents (note 19) on the basis of expected cash flow. This is generally carried out at local level in the operating 
companies of the Group, in accordance with practices and limits set by the Group. These limits vary by location to take into account the 
liquidity of the market in which the entity operates. On a daily basis throughout the year, the bank balances or borrowings in all the Group’s 
operating companies are aggregated into a total cash or borrowings figure, in order that the Group can obtain the most advantageous 
interest rate.
In accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement’, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded 
derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard. No such 
embedded derivatives have been identified.

Non-current (1.1)
During the year ending 30 June 2012, the Group entered into a five year interest rate swap contract that expires in May 2017. The 
notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 30 June 2014 was £75 million (2013: £75 million). At 30 June 
2014, the fixed interest rate is 1.5% (2013: 1.5%). The five year swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in reserves. A gain of £1.1 million was recognised in other comprehensive income in the period. Gains and losses 
recognised in reserves will be released to the income statement within finance costs over the period to maturity of the contract, and 
£0.3 million was recognised in the current year.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting 
expected future cash flows at the prevailing interest rate. The fair value of current borrowings equals their carrying amounts, as the 
impact of discounting is not significant.

In February 2014, the Group agreed a new five year £400 million unsecured revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc, Abbey National 
Treasury Services plc (Santander), Barclays Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. The facility provides long-term finance and 
bonding facilities and is subject to covenants over interest cover, gearing (adjusted to take account of development land payables) and 
minimum consolidated tangible net assets. Interest is calculated by aggregating margin, LIBOR and relevant costs.  
Fair value estimation
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments are defined as:
•	 Level 1 – Quoted market prices or dealer quotes in active markets for similar instruments.
•	 Level 2 –  The fair value of equity securities and interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash 
flows, based on observable yield curves. 
•	 Level 3 –  Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial 
instruments. The fair value of available for sale financial assets is set out in note 14.
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 30 June:

There were no transfers between levels during the period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by 
using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as 
little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is 
included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. 
The Company’s only liabilities that are measured at fair value are derivatives used for hedging, as shown in the table above. 104 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

The key assumptions used in level 3 valuations include future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts, credit risk and 
discount rates. The typical repayment period is 10–15 years and the timing of receipts is based on historical data. The discount rate of 
5.5% and future house price movements used to compute the fair value (typically 2.5%) are based on local market conditions. The 
sensitivity to house price inflation and discount rates is set out on page 101. If receipts were to occur earlier than expected, the fair value 
would increase.
The total impact in the period of level 3, taken to the income statement, is a net charge of £0.9 million (30 June 2013: £1.2 million) in cost 
of sales and £1.6 million (30 June 2013: £1.5 million) in finance income.

Savings related share options
The Company operates an HM Revenue & Customs approved sharesave scheme, under which employees are granted an option to 
purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at grant, in either three or five years’ time, dependent on 
their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. These funds are used to fund 
the option exercise. This scheme is open to all employees. No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of sharesave options.

30 Retirement benefit obligations
All employees are entitled to join the Galliford Try Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme established as a stakeholder plan, 
with a company contribution based on a scale dependent on the employee’s age and the amount they choose to contribute. Since 
1 July 2013 all non-participating and newly employed staff have been auto-enrolled into the separate stakeholder plan and are entitled 
to increase their contribution rates in line with existing members. Since 1 April 2009, the Group has operated a pension salary sacrifice 
scheme which means that all employee pension contributions are paid as employer contributions on their behalf. 
The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes that pay out pensions at retirement based on service and final pay, each with 
assets held in separate trustee administered funds: the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme, the Galliford Group Special Scheme and 
the Kendall Cross (Holdings) Ltd Assurance & Pension Scheme. The accounting numbers consolidate these three arrangements. The 
Group’s principal funded pension scheme is the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme, which was closed to all future service accrual 
on 31 March 2007. The trustees include representatives of the Company and plan participants, in accordance with each plan’s regulations.
The Group has adopted the revised IAS19 ‘Employee Benefits’ published in June 2011, which came into force for financial periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The adoption of the new standard was not significant and did not result in any restatement of the 
surplus/deficit recognised as a non-current asset/liability, of the actuarial losses, or of the net cost recognised in the income statement 
at 30 June 2013.
Pension costs for the schemes were as follows:

Defined benefit schemes – Expense recognised in the income statement 0.3 0.2 
Defined contribution schemes 13.3 12.6 
Total included within employee benefit expenses (note 3) 13.6 12.8 
Of the total charge for all schemes £7.8 million (2013: £7.0 million) and £5.7 million (2013 £5.6 million) were included, respectively, within 
cost of sales and administrative expenses. £0.1 million (2013: £0.2 million) was included within net finance costs.

Defined benefit schemes
An independent actuary performs detailed triennial valuations, together with periodic interim reviews, following which a funding plan and 
contribution schedule is agreed between the Company and the Trustees. The most recent completed formal actuarial valuation for the 
Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme was as at 1 July 2012 and was prepared by Mercer, the scheme actuary. The Galliford Try 
Final Salary Pension Scheme closed to future accrual with effect from 31 March 2007. The IAS19 accounting results for the Galliford Try 
Final Salary Pension Scheme have been calculated using a roll forward approach, based on the liabilities calculated for the 1 July 2012 
actuarial valuation. The latest actuarial valuations for the Galliford Group Special Scheme and the Kendall Cross (Holdings) Ltd 
Assurance & Pension Scheme were as at 1 April 2013 and 14 November 2011 respectively. 
The deficit recovery funding plan agreed with the Trustees in 2013 requires the Company to pay contributions of £466,667 per calendar 
month until February 2019, with potential additional payments being linked to dividend payments of the Company.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Galliford Group Special Scheme was prepared using the attained age method as at 1 April 
2013. A deficit recovery funding plan was agreed with the Trustees to meet the funding shortfall, which requires the Company to pay 
contributions of £16,000 per calendar month until September 2014.
The Kendall Cross (Holdings) Limited Scheme is funded and provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries. The scheme was 
closed to new members and to future accrual for existing members prior to the date of the acquisition by Galliford Try plc in November 
2007. The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was prepared as at 14 November 2011. A deficit recovery funding plan was 
agreed with the Trustees, which requires the Company to pay contributions of £15,300 per month from April 2013. 
Principal assumptions
The valuations of the Group’s pension schemes have been updated to 30 June 2014 and all three schemes are consolidated for 
disclosure purposes below. The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items are as follows:

Discount rate 4.20% 4.50%
Retail price inflation 3.40% 3.40%
Consumer price inflation 2.40% 2.40%
For the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme, the life expectancies as at 30 June 2014 are based on S1PA tables (90% scaling 
factor applied for males), with a future improvement in mortality assumption in line with CMI 2012 tables, with a long-term rate of 
improvement of 1.5% p.a. The life expectancies as at 30 June 2013 were based on S1PA tables (90% scaling factor applied for males), 
with a future improvement in mortality assumption in line with CMI 2011 tables, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% p.a.

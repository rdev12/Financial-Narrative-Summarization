Chairman’s Statement by David Newton
It is a pleasure to report a sixth successive annual
increase in adjusted earnings per share.
Financial review
On turnover up 4.7% at £155.7 million (2003: £148.7
million), total operating profit increased by 22.0% to
£5.77 million (2003: £4.73 million), whilst pre-tax
profit was 26.0% ahead at £5.13 million (2003: £4.07
million), despite a £0.4 million increase in pension
costs. Basic earnings per share advanced by 30.8% 
to 39.9p (2003: 30.5p). If 2003’s £0.50 million
exceptional reorganisation costs are disregarded, 
the increases in operating profit, pre-tax profit and
earnings per share are 10.4%, 12.3% and 15.0%,
respectively.
Year end equity shareholders’ funds increased by 8.1%
to £24.04 million (2003: £22.24 million), representing
net assets per share of 297.7p (2003: 275.4p). Net
debt increased slightly to £5.76 million (2003: £5.62
million), giving gearing of 24.0% (2003: 25.2%). Net
interest payable is similar to last year at £0.65 million
(2003: £0.66 million) and was covered 8.9 times
(2003: 7.1 times) by profit before interest and tax.
Dividends
A final dividend per share of 9.0p (2003: 7.5p), up
20.0%, is proposed, payable on 21 January 2005 to
shareholders on the register at close of business on
17 December 2004, with an ex-dividend date of 
15 December 2004.
Together with the interim dividend per share of 
4.5p (2003: 4.0p), proposed dividends per share 
are 17.4% higher at 13.5p (2003: 11.5p), covered 
3.0 times (2003: 2.7 times, or 3.0 times if exceptional
items are disregarded).
If approved at the AGM to be held at 11.30 a.m. 
on 6 January 2005 at the Crown Hotel, Wetheral,
Carlisle, the final dividend will be paid on 21 January
2005 to shareholders.
Business
Agriculture achieved an operating profit of £5.73
million (2003: £5.03 million, after one-off costs 
of £0.26 million) on a turnover of £124.4 million 
(2003: £120.8 million). This outcome reflected
further improvements in the performance of UK
The results we have achieved are due to
the commitment
of all the Group’s employees 03
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2004
animal feed and fertiliser outweighing a decreased
contribution from US animal feed after an
exceptionally good previous year.
Food’s operating profit was halved at £0.27 million 
(2003: £0.60 million) on a turnover of £22.0 million 
(2003: £20.3 million) following the exceptionally
large rise in raw material costs, in particular in the
first half.
Engineering broke even (2003: made an operating
loss of £0.68 million, after one-off costs of £0.24
million) on an increased turnover of £9.3 million
(2003: £7.6 million). This result benefited from the
closure of Keytor in March 2003 and the subsequent
consolidation of R Hind from three sites to one.
Board
In May 2004, Ian C. Carr died, aged 75, following a
brief illness. Ian Carr, a great grandson of Jonathan
Dodgson Carr, who founded Carr’s in 1836, was
appointed Chairman of Carr’s in April 1964, aged 35,
and remained in that position until his retirement on
his 70th birthday in August 1998. Thereafter, he was
President of Carr’s, representing the Company on
many occasions. Ian was a model of good practice,
acting as an example of what we should all aspire to
be. Together with his wife, Rilla, they formed a
partnership which was well known locally and one
we shall all miss.
In September 2004, Lord Inglewood, aged 53, 
was appointed a non-executive Director of Carr’s.
Richard Inglewood was a Conservative member of
the European Parliament for ten years until his
retirement in 2004, and has been a member of the
House of Lords since 1989. He brings to the Board
wide experience, in particular of EU and
Westminster politics, allied with a knowledge of
farming and of Carr’s north west England heartland.
Outlook
Despite having to absorb higher energy costs across
the Group, mainly for electricity, the current year is
expected to show further growth in all three
Divisions, especially in Food, where gross margins in
flour have returned to a more normal level following
unprecedented wheat price increases last year. With
the growth of the existing business combined with
the Meneba UK acquisition, the Board considers that
Carr’s is well placed for further progress.

Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Chief Executive’s Review by Chris Holmes
In the year ended 28 August 2004, Agriculture and
Engineering improved their results whilst Food’s
operating profit halved in unusually difficult market
conditions for flour. As usual, Agriculture was much
the most important of the three Divisions in terms of
both turnover and profit.
Agriculture
Feed
The Group’s animal feed business comprises the 
UK manufacture of compound feed by Carrs
Billington Agriculture (in association with Edward
Billington & Sons Limited) at Carlisle (Cumbria),
Penrith (Cumbria) and Stone (Staffordshire); and 
the blending of animal feeds at Askrigg (North
Yorkshire) and Kirkbride (Cumbria).
Carrs Billington Agriculture’s compound feed
volumes were well ahead of last year, but margins
were squeezed due to under-recovery of
unprecedented raw material cost increases in 
grain and proteins.
The low-moisture animal feedblock business
comprises the UK manufacture by Caltech at Silloth
(Cumbria) and in the US by Animal Feed
Supplements at Belle Fourche (South Dakota) and
Poteau (Oklahoma).
Caltech’s Crystalyx low-moisture animal feedblock
again increased turnover in both the UK and
Continental Europe. Its Calflyx Easy Breather, 
a new product launched for calves, exceeded all
expectations. Caltech also benefited from the first full
year of molasses being imported into the port at Silloth.
In the USA in 2003, Animal Feed Supplement
benefited from the US Government’s Drought
Assistance Programme, which subsidised feed
supplement products for ranchers in certain states,
thereby achieving a record sales increase in that year
of 29%. In 2004, sales were lower as ranchers used
subsidised stock of Feed in a Drum and Smartlic, 
in particular in the first half of the financial year.
Underlying growth continued to be achieved as new
markets were entered. The strength of the pound
versus the US dollar also had a negative impact on
profit of £0.1 million.
Sales of machinery 
remain strong
throughout the United Kingdom  05
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Fertiliser
Carrs Fertiliser operates three blending sites, at
Invergordon (Easter Ross), Montrose (Angus) and
Silloth (Cumbria), producing a wide range of
fertilisers. 
Following the successful rationalisation of production
facilities with the planned reduction of sales volumes
shedding certain low margin business the
profitability improved to respectable levels. The
investment in Silloth and Montrose to enhance
capacity and efficiency enabled demand to be met 
at the critical time of usage.
Retail
Following the closure in March 2004 of a small
branch at Pitscottie (Fife), Carr’s Retail comprises 
14 branches, from Perth in the north to Leek
(Staffordshire) in the south, selling farm supplies.
Turnover increased by 13%, reflecting the opening in
October 2003 of a larger branch in Cockermouth
(Cumbria), which performed ahead of expectations,
and the addition of new products to the portfolio.
Machinery
Carr’s Machinery distributes new and used
agricultural and groundcare machinery from six of
the retail branches, in the north west of England and
the south west of Scotland. These branches have
modern workshops that test equipment and provide
a comprehensive store of spare parts.
Turnover and profit again exceeded expectations,
and were only slightly down on last year, which 
was a record.
Food
Carr’s principal food company is Carr’s Flour Mills, 
a cereals processing company with flour mills at
Silloth using the latest milling technology to meet the
quality and specialist requirements of bakers, food
manufacturers and retailers.
Following a difficult first half as the result of
considerable under-recovery of the 60% increase in UK
wheat prices in the eight months to January 2004,  06
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Consistent growth throughout the 
engineering division has been achieved with
major contract wins
in Azerbaijan and the United States
the second half performed better, with selling price
increases being effective from the early months of
2004. The high-quality Carrs Breadmaker brand, which
was launched two years ago, while a small percentage
of divisional turnover, continues to be a good seller,
with listings in three major multiple retailers.
On the 29 November 2004 we exchanged contracts
to acquire, for a cash consideration of £4.7 million,
the flour milling business of Meneba UK which has
two flour mills, Robert Hutchinson at Kirkcaldy, 
Fife and Greens Flour Mills at Maldon, Essex. The
acquisition is subject to shareholder approval at the
Extraordinary General Meeting on 18 November
2004 and the details of the acquisition were
forwarded in a Circular to shareholders on 
1 November 2004.
The enlarged milling group will have a strong market
presence in the northern part of the UK and will
increase its activity in the area of speciality mixes
under both the Carrs and the Greens names.
The acquisition will be an excellent strategic fit for
Carrs and will more than double the size of our flour
business and is expected to be earnings enhancing in
the year to August 2005.
Engineering
Engineering now comprises Bendalls and R Hind,
both of which are based in Carlisle, and Carrs 
MSM, which is based in Swindon. Bendalls, whose
specialism is precision welding, designs and
manufactures plant and equipment for the petro-
chemical, oil and gas, nuclear power, pharmaceutical,
process and water industries. R Hind provides
vehicle body building and accident repairs for cars
and commercial vehicles. Carrs MSM designs and
manufactures master slave manipulators, which are
key components for many industries but notably the
nuclear industries. Bendalls performed better, with a steady order book
throughout the year and improved overall margins; the
business has won substantial orders in recent months.
Our involvement in renewable energy continues and
funding for phase 2 of the underwater turbine project
“SeaGen” is agreed. The design of “SeaGen” should
be approved in early 2005 with manufacture to
progress thereafter. R Hind had a disappointing year,
with tight margins and some unprofitable work. Carrs
MSM, which was set up in December 2003, has a
small but satisfactory order book, with its main
customer being British Nuclear Fuels Limited.
In October 2004, Carr’s completed the disposal of 
its site at London Road, Carlisle, where Bendalls
Engineering, its high integrity welding business, 
is based.
The cash consideration receivable by Carr’s is 
£2.6 million. In addition, the purchaser is committed
to build a new 55,000 sq ft factory for Bendalls at
Kingstown Industrial Estate which is expected to
cost £2.7 million, bringing the total consideration to
£5.3 million. The cash consideration will be used to
equip the new factory and for general working
capital purposes.
The total book value of the net assets disposed of is
£0.8 million. Accordingly, the profit on disposal is
expected to be approximately £4.5 million, which
will be accounted for as an exceptional gain in the
current year to 3 September 2005. A further benefit,
the Directors believe, is that the change in location
will enable Bendall to operate from a more efficient
factory.
Bendalls will remain operating from the London
Road site until the completion of the new factory and
the equipping thereof to its own specifications at a
cost to it of £0.75 million, which is expected to be in
August 2005.
Staff
I would like to take this opportunity to endorse the
Chairman’s comments about Ian C. Carr. In addition
to Ian’s contribution to the company over 40 years
making Carr’s Milling Industries what it is today, his
wonderful presence and approach to life and
business will be remembered by employees,
customers and shareholders alike.
Again, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the
UK, the Republic of Ireland and the USA for their
individual contributions in achieving a further set of
record profits.

Charitable and political contributions
Charitable donations made by the Group during the year amounted
to £7,535 (2003: £10,990). No political contributions were made
(2003: Nil).
Creditor payment policy
It is the Company’s policy to agree terms of payment with its
suppliers when agreeing the terms of a business transaction or
transactions. All suppliers are aware of this procedure and the
Company abides by the agreed payment terms subject to the terms
and conditions being met by the supplier. Wherever possible UK
subsidiaries follow the same policy and the overseas subsidiary is
encouraged to adopt similar policies, by applying local best
practice.
The amount of trade creditors shown in the Group balance sheet at
the end of the financial year represents 36 days (2003: 36 days) of
average daily purchases from suppliers.
The Company has no trade creditors in either period.
International Financial Reporting Standards
In common with all UK listed companies the Company is required
to comply and adopt International Financial Reporting Standards 
for the first financial statements commencing on or after 1 January
2005. Therefore the first accounting period affected will be for 
the year ending 31 August 2006. The adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards will have both accounting and
business implications and the Company is preparing an impact
assessment, which is expected to be completed before the end 
of 2004.
Pensions
The directors have considered the financial impact on the Group of
the deficit which exists in the Carr’s Milling Industries Pension
Scheme 1993 and confirmed its continuing support of the defined
benefit section of the scheme. The directors will continue to
regularly monitor the performance of the scheme investments and
take action should the scheme’s deficit increase.
Land and buildings
The Group has entered into an agreement that values the Bendall’s
site at £4.5m in excess of its carrying value.
The interests of the directors, as defined in the Companies Act 1985, in the ordinary shares of the Company, other than in
respect of options to acquire ordinary shares (which are detailed in the analysis of options included in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 16 to 19) are as follows.

Authority to purchase own shares
At the year end the shareholders’ authority to the directors to

Annual General Meeting
The Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting appears on page
52 and will be held at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday 6 January 2005 at the
Crown Hotel, Wetheral, Carlisle.
The notice of Annual General Meeting includes the following items
of Special Business:
(i) Resolution 7: Disapplication of pre-emption rights
The resolution renews the existing authority to the Directors
under Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot shares
by way of rights to shareholders and to allot shares for cash
up to a nominal value of £100,920 (representing 5 per cent
of the issued share capital) without first offering such shares
pro rata to existing shareholders, as would otherwise by
required under Section 89 of that Act. This will allow the
Directors some flexibility when considering how best to
finance new business opportunities. In accordance with the
requirements of the London Stock Exchange this resolution
will come up for renewal at the next Annual General
Meeting.
(ii) Resolution 8: Purchase its own shares
This resolution renews the existing authority to the directors
to buy, by way of market purchases, up to 807,360 of its own
shares (representing 10 per cent of the issued share capital).
The proposal should not be taken as an indication that the
Company will purchase its own shares. This authority will
only be exercised by the Directors if they are satisfied that it
would result in an increase in earnings per share and would
be in the best interest of shareholders generally.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial
statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of
the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been
used and applied consistently and that reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates have been made in the preparation of
the financial statements for the year ended 28 August 2004. 
The directors also confirm that applicable accounting standards
have been followed and that the financial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. In addition, they are responsible for taking reasonable
steps to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and to
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have indicated their
willingness to continue in office and a resolution that they be
reappointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Report
continued 13
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2004
The Company remains committed to high standards of corporate
governance. All listed companies are obliged to report on how they
apply the Principles of Good Governance set out in the Combined
Code issued in June 1998 and whether they complied with the
Code’s Provisions throughout the accounting period. The Board
complied throughout the year with the provisions set out in the
Combined Code issued in June 1998 apart from those relating to
the following:
• a senior independent non-executive director was appointed
after the year end on 1 September 2004;
• one of the two non-executive directors is not independent,
however a third non-executive director was appointed on 
1 September 2004;
• bonuses and benefits in kind paid to executive directors 
are pensionable;
• the directors’ contract periods are two years;
• there are no specific provisions for compensation on 
early termination;
• the Remuneration Committee comprised both non-executive
directors, albeit one director is not independent, however a third
non-executive director was appointed on 1 September 2004; and
• the Audit Committee comprised the two non-executive
directors instead of at least three non-executive directors, a
majority of whom should be independent, however a third 
non-executive director was appointed on 1 September 2004.
These matters are discussed further in the relevant paragraphs
below and in the Remuneration Report.
Board structure and committees
The Board at 28 August 2004 comprised two executive directors
(including the Group Chief Executive) and two non-executive
directors (including the Chairman), who bring a range of skills and
experience to the Board. Biographical details of all current directors
are set out on page 10. The Audit Committee and Remuneration
Committee both have written terms of reference.
Directors
The directors supervise the management of the business and the
affairs of the company and see their prime responsibility as being 
to determine the broad strategy of the company and to ensure its
implementation with a view to enhancing the prosperity of the
company and its shareholders over time. 
The roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive are
separated and clearly defined. The Chairman’s overall responsibility
is to ensure that the Board carries out its responsibilities. The
Group Chief Executive’s responsibilities are to direct and promote
the operation and development of the Group. 
One of the non-executive directors is not considered independent
as he is deemed to represent a significant shareholder. The Board
have considered the appointment of a third non-executive director,
and on 1 September 2004, Lord Inglewood was appointed a director
of the Company. Lord Inglewood will be the senior independent
non-executive director. The Board has not set an objective on the
reduction of directors’ service contract periods to one year or less.
The Board does not wish to reduce the service contract period
below the current level of two years as it feels that this is the
minimum appropriate to retain the services of key executives with
significant knowledge of the business in which the Group trades.
Each director is provided with sufficient information to enable him to
discharge his duties and responsibilities as a director.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary. The Board has also established a formal procedure
whereby directors, wishing to do so in the furtherance of their
duties, may take independent professional advice, if necessary, at
the Company’s expense.
The Articles of Association require one-third of the Board to retire
by rotation at every Annual General Meeting. The Combined Code
requires that directors are required to present themselves for 
re-election at intervals of no more than three years. It is the Board’s
intention to amend the Articles of Association at an appropriate
time to ensure compliance with this provision, but in the interim,
the Board intends to operate re-elections of directors in a manner
to ensure compliance with the Combined Code.
The Board meets regularly and has reserved certain items for its
review and approval, including the annual and interim results, the
annual profit and cash flow budget, significant acquisitions and
divestments, and senior management appointments.
Directors’ remuneration
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee, the role of
which is to review the performance of the executive directors and
to set the scale and structure of their remuneration, including
bonus arrangements. The Committee comprised David Newton as
Chairman and the other non-executive director. From 1 September
2004 Lord Inglewood will be appointed to this Committee. The
report on directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 16 to 19.
Accountability and audit
In submitting this Annual Report and the Financial Statements to
the shareholders, the Board has sought to ensure that a balanced
and understandable assessment of the company’s position and
prospects has been presented to shareholders.
Corporate Governance 14
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2004
The Board has established an Audit Committee comprising the 
non-executive directors, with Robert Heygate as Chairman. 
From 1 September 2004 Lord Inglewood will be appointed to 
this Committee. The Committee is responsible inter alia for
safeguarding the company’s assets. The Committee meets at 
least twice a year and reviews the annual and interim financial
statements and the other documents to be sent to shareholders
before they are submitted for Board approval. The Committee also
has meetings with the auditors at least twice a year. The Group
does not have an internal auditor, which is kept under annual
review, but a member of the head office accounting staff is
available to conduct reviews of internal control and specific areas 
of concern where this is thought necessary.
Internal Control
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss, the
maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of
financial information.
The Combined Code required directors to introduce procedures
and review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal
control, including financial, operational and compliance controls
and risk management. These procedures establish the process by
which the Board will, on an ongoing basis, identify, evaluate and
manage the significant risks faced by the Group and carry out its
annual review of the effectiveness of the internal controls. These
procedures have been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. The
Board reviewed the internal controls this year and it is intended
that these procedures will be kept under review each year and
adjusted as appropriate.
The Board’s risk management strategy is to follow a prudent risk
policy. Business risks are evaluated at Group level as part of the
annual budgeting process. The executive directors and the senior
management of subsidiary companies have responsibility for
identifying the risks facing each business and then establish
procedures or putting policies in place to mitigate or monitor them.
Treasury risks are evaluated by the Group Finance Director who is
responsible to the Board for evaluating all significant borrowings,
foreign currency and interest rate management facilities.
The Group has comprehensive budgets and detailed monthly
reporting, together with daily cash reporting. The annual budget is
reviewed with senior management and submitted to the Board for
approval. Revised forecasts for the year are prepared if results are
deviating significantly from the budget. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of good communications with
all shareholders. The Company maintains dialogue with institutional
shareholders and analysts, and general presentations are made
when financial results are announced. All shareholders have access
to the Company’s website at www.carrs-milling.com.
The Annual General Meeting is the principal forum for dialogue
with private investors. All shareholders are given the opportunity to
raise questions at the meeting. The Company aims to send notices
of Annual General Meetings to shareholders at least 20 working
days before the meeting, as required by The Combined Code, and
it is the Company’s practice to indicate the proxy voting results on
all resolutions at the meetings.
Going Concern
Based on normal business planning and control procedures the
directors are confident that the Company has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For
this reason, the directors adopt the going concern basis in the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements.

Annual Report & Accounts 2004
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the statement of group total
recognised gains and losses, the note of group historical cost
profits and losses, the consolidated balance sheet, the company
balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and the
related notes. We have also audited the disclosures required by
Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the
directors’ remuneration report (“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and
the financial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the
statement of directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also
responsible for preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if
the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. The other information comprises only the
chairman’s statement, the chief executive’s review, the directors’
report, the corporate governance statement and the unaudited
part of the directors’ remuneration report. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code issued in June 1998 specified for our review by
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s or group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part
of the directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the
directors’ remuneration report are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and the group at 28 August 2004 and of
the profit and cash flows of the group for the year ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by
Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Remuneration Committee
All matters relating to executive remuneration are determined by 
the Remuneration Committee, a sub-committee of the Board of
Directors. The Remuneration Committee, comprises the Chairman
and A R Heygate, the other non-executive director of the Company.
As appropriate, the Committee may invite the Chief Executive Officer
to participate in some of its discussions. The Committee is
responsible for determining the terms and conditions of employment
of executive directors. It is also responsible for considering
management recommendations for remuneration and employment
terms of the Company’s senior staff, including incentive
arrangements for bonus payments and grant of share options.
The Remuneration Committee’s decisions are made on the basis of
rewarding individuals for the nature of jobs they undertake and
their performance therein. Proper regard is given to the need to
attract and retain high quality, well-motivated staff at all levels and
to the remuneration being paid by similar companies.
Details of Remuneration
The remuneration of directors is set out in detail on page 18. The
Company’s Remuneration Committee decides the remuneration
policy that applies to executive directors and the Group’s other
senior management.
Each of the executive directors has a two-year rolling contract. 
The most recently executed contracts for the executive directors 
were dated 10 June 2002. In the event of termination the executive
directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and
pensionable service for the notice periods. The contracts of 
non-executive directors of the Company are fixed for two years 
and the most recent executed contracts for D A Newton and 
A R Heygate were 1 September 2003. Lord Inglewood has a two
year fixed contract which expires on 31 August 2006.
The Company’s policy is that a proportion of the remuneration 
of the executive directors should be performance related. As
described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive
payments together with the benefits of participation in Share
Option Schemes.
Constituent Elements of Remuneration Package
In applying the above principles to the determination of executive
director remuneration, the Remuneration Committee gives
consideration to several components which together comprise the
total remuneration package; these consist of the following:
• Basic Salary is determined by the Committee at the
beginning of each year. In deciding appropriate levels, the
Committee considers the position in the Group, personal and
Company performance and relies on information on a
comparable group of companies. Basic salaries were last
reviewed in August 2004, with increases taking effect from 
1 September 2004. The next review will take place in August
2005. Executive directors’ contracts of service, which include
details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the
Annual General Meeting.
• Annual Bonus is paid up to a maximum of 40% of Basic Salary
on achievement of profit targets, and is pensionable.
• Benefits in Kind comprise private healthcare, which is
pensionable and critical illness/death in service cover. 
• Pension Contribution. The Company’s defined benefit
pension scheme aims at producing a pension of two-thirds final
pensionable salary at normal retirement age of 60. Due to the
Inland Revenue cap this provision cannot be met in full from
the scheme and supplementary arrangements are in place and
are commented on later. The two executive directors are
members of the pension scheme and can opt, after age 50, to
retire early without actuarial reduction to their pension. Non-
executive directors do not participate in the scheme. Pension
entitlement is calculated on the salary element of remuneration
plus the average of the last three years’ bonuses and taxable
benefits in kind. The executive directors’ pension information is
as follows:
Directors’ Remuneration Report 17
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2004
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid
annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay additional
voluntary contributions, neither the contributions nor the
resulting benefits are included in the table on page 16.
The normal retirement age is 60 with a two-thirds surviving
spouse’s pension. On death in service a lump sum equal to four
times pensionable salary is payable together with a surviving
spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the director’s prospective
pension. For death after retirement a spouse’s pension of 
two-thirds of the member’s pension is payable plus the balance
of a five year guarantee if applicable.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to be increased annually
by 5% or the increase in the Index of Retail Prices (RPI) if less.
For the element of gross salary in excess of the Inland Revenue
limits the Group has established for C N C Holmes a funded
unapproved retirement benefit scheme (FURBS). 
This arrangement attempts to provide for a pension of 
two-thirds of his final pensionable salary at age 60, inclusive 
of benefits from his previous employment, and a surviving
spouse’s pension of two-thirds of his pension. Pensions in
payment are to be increased annually by the increase in RPI. 
As a result of the recently announced changes to the funding of
pensions, to be effective from April 2006, the Company ceased
contributing to the FURBS from January 2004. The funding cost
of this arrangement in 2004 was £49,000 (2003: £120,000).
Any transfer value calculations would not make allowance for
discretionary benefits including pension increases and early
retirement.
• Share Options. The Group believes there is benefit to be
gained from aligning executive directors’ interests (and other
employee interests) with those of shareholders by means of
share options. The award of options is wholly at the discretion
of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance Graph
The following graph illustrates the
Company’s total shareholder return
performance since 31 August 1999

The Company considers that the
FTSE All-share index to be the most
appropriate comparator group as it is
a broad equity index and reflects the
Company’s broad range of activities.

Share options granted to directors
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved and an
unapproved share option scheme to reward employees’ performance
and to incentivise at senior levels. Exercise is subject to performance
conditions. For all options granted the exercise criterion has been
that earnings per share should achieve growth which exceeds the
percentage growth in the Retail Price Index by 2% or more. The rules
of the schemes conform to institutional investor guidelines.
The performance criterion, which applies to the executive directors
to whom options have been granted under the Schemes, was
chosen as it requires significant improvement in financial
performance. No options have been granted at a discount to the
market price at the date of their grant.

Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Statement of Accounting Policies
for the year ended 28 August 2004
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in
the United Kingdom. A summary of the more important Group
accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set
out below.
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain land and
buildings. The financial statements are prepared in accordance
with applicable accounting standards all of which have been
applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet
include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiary
companies prepared to the Saturday nearest to 31 August. The
results of subsidiary companies acquired and sold are included
from and up to the respective dates of acquisition or sale. 
On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and
liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their
fair values reflecting their condition at that date. All changes to
those assets and liabilities, and the resulting gains and losses, that
arise after the Group has gained control of the subsidiary are
charged to the post-acquisition profit and loss account.
Associated undertakings
Associated undertakings are those in which the Group has a
participating interest and over which it exerts significant influence.
The Group’s share of the results of associated undertakings is
included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest
in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated
balance sheet under the equity method of accounting.
Turnover
Turnover represents the value of goods despatched or services
rendered to customers, excluding value added tax and inter-group
transactions. In respect of long-term contracts turnover is
calculated on the basis of the stage of completion and the total
sales value of each contract.
Revaluation of properties
Prior to 1999, some freehold and leasehold properties were
revalued. On adoption of FRS 15 in 1999, the Group followed the
transitional rules to retain the book value of land and buildings.
Transfers are made to retained profits each year in order to
amortise surpluses over the remaining useful lives of the
properties. On disposal the profit or loss is calculated by reference
to the net book value and any unamortised revaluation surplus is
transferred from revaluation reserves to retained profits.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes production overheads where appropriate.
Long-term contracts
Turnover on long-term contracts is recognised according to the
stage reached in the contract by reference to the value of work
done. A reliable estimate of the profit attributable to work
completed is recognised once the outcome of a contract can be
assessed with reasonable certainty. The amount by which the
turnover exceeds payments on account is shown under debtors 
as amounts recoverable on contracts. The costs incurred on 
long-term contracts not yet taken to the profit and loss account
less related foreseeable losses and payments on account are
shown as work in progress.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any amounts written off in
respect of impairment.
Financial instruments and derivatives
The Group’s accounting policy for derivatives is to defer the
recognition in the Group profit and loss account of gains and
losses on hedges of revenues, operating payments and capital
expenditure until such time as the underlying transactions 
are recognised.
Forward foreign exchange contracts entered into as hedges of
future purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies are
recorded at cost. Gains and losses are deferred and matched to
the underlying transaction when it matures.
Interest rate collar agreements taken out are recorded at cost in
the balance sheet and amortised over the period of the
agreements. Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest
rate collar agreements are recognised in the net interest payable
charge on an accruals basis.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in
an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right
to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when
they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Deferred tax is
not provided on timing differences arising from revaluation of
fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded
as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not discounted. 26
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Goodwill
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions since 31 August 1998 has been
capitalised on the balance sheet and is being amortised over
periods not exceeding 20 years in line with the directors’ view of
their useful economic lives.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions prior to 30 August 1998
remains eliminated against reserves. This goodwill had been
eliminated as a matter of accounting policy and will be charged or
credited in the profit and loss account on any subsequent disposal.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are capitalised on the balance sheet and
amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years in line with the
directors’ view of their useful economic lives.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation of
tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land and assets in the
course of construction which are not depreciated, in equal annual
instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates:
Freehold and 
long leasehold properties 2%
Short leasehold property 10%
Plant and equipment 5% – 25%
Grants
Grants received on capital expenditure are recorded as deferred
income and taken to the profit and loss account in equal annual
instalments over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Revenue grants and contributions are credited to the profit and
loss account in the year to which they apply.
Leased assets
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights
approximating to ownership (“finance leases”), the assets are
treated as if they had been purchased outright. The amounts
capitalised are the present values of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding commitments are shown as obligations under
finance leases.
Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and
loss account in equal annual instalments over the shorter of the
lease terms and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest
elements and the interest is charged using the actuarial method.
All other leases are “operating leases” and the annual rentals are
charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension costs
The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is
charged to the profit and loss account over the periods benefiting
from the employees’ services. The difference between the charge
to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the
scheme is included as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries recorded in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of
the financial year and the results of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Differences
on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net
investment in subsidiary companies, and from the translation of
the results of those companies at average rate, are taken to
reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised
gains and losses. All other foreign exchange differences are taken
to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.

19 Derivatives and other financial instruments
Set out below are the narrative and numerical disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 13 “Derivatives and other
financial instruments”.
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources, and various items such
as trade debtors, trade creditors etc., that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to
manage the finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group also enters into derivatives transactions (principally foreign currency contracts and interest rate caps). The purpose of such
transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risk from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged throughout
the year.
Short-term debtors and creditors
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired
currencies at fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate collars and swaps to manage the Group’s exposure to interest
rate fluctuations. At the year end £1.225 million (2003: £1.280 million) of the Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest. 
Liquidity rate risk
As regards liquidity, the Group’s policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short and medium term borrowings. Short
term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. In addition it is the Group’s policy to maintain committed undrawn facilities in order to
provide flexibility in the management of the Group’s liquidity.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s subsidiary, Animal Feed Supplement Inc., operates in the USA and its revenues and expenses are denominated exclusively
in US dollars. The Group’s sterling balance sheet is not protected from movements in US dollar/sterling exchange rate. The foreign
currency risk in relation to the Group’s other overseas subsidiaries, George Shackleton & Sons Limited and Quinphos (Ireland) Limited,
which operate in Eire, is insignificant. 37

All the Group’s creditors falling due within one year (other than bank, other borrowings and finance leases) are excluded from the above
table either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and
financial liabilities at 28 August 2004. Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length
transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. Where
available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where market values are not available, fair values have been
calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

Forward foreign currency contracts —5 ——
The fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts are based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet
date. The fair value of the short-term borrowings and cash at bank approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity 
of these instruments.
Gains and losses on hedges
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on purchases denominated 
in foreign currencies immediately those purchases are transacted. Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not 
recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures. An analysis of these unrecognised gains and losses has not 
been provided as the balances were under £50,000. This was also the case for the year ended 30 August 2003.

33 Pension commitments 
The Group participates in two defined benefit pension schemes, Carr’s Milling Industries Pension Scheme 1993 and Carrs Billington
Agriculture Pension Scheme. The company has accounted for the schemes under SSAP 24 and adopted the transitional rules of FRS 17.
Carr’s Milling Industries
The Company sponsors the Carr’s Milling Industries Pension Scheme 1993 and offers a defined contribution and a defined benefit
section. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested with an independent investment
manager.
The pension expense for the defined contribution section of the scheme for the period was £143,000 (2003: £84,000). Contributions
totalling £nil (2003: £1,000) were payable to the fund at the year end and are included in creditors.
The defined benefit section of the scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities (including expected future earnings and pension
increases). It is subject to an independent valuation on a triennial basis by a qualified actuary who determines the rate of the employer’s
contribution. Pension scheme contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the
employees’ working lives within the Group. The most recent valuation of the scheme was at 1 January 2003 and adopted the Projected
Unit Method. It was assumed that the investment returns would be 7% per annum and that the salary increases would average 3.25%
per annum. It was also assumed that present and future pensions, in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMPs), would
increase once in payment at the lesser of 5% per annum and price inflation and that GMPs would increase at the rate of 3% per annum.
The actuarial valuation as at 1 January 2003 shows that the market value of assets relating to the defined benefit section of the scheme
was £18,997,000 and the actuarial value of those assets represented 66% of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to members,
after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. At 1 January 2003, the scheme showed a deficit of £9,577,000.
A net accrual of £488,000 (2003: £219,000) is included in the Group net assets representing the deficit of the amount funded over the
accumulated pension expense.
The pension contribution made by the Group over the period to the defined benefit section was £1,303,000 (2003: £1,167,000)
allowing for the amortisation of the deficit over 12 years being the average remaining service lives of the employees. The contribution
rates payable by employer and employee were increased in 2003 following the triennial valuation of the scheme and will continue until
reviewed at the next valuation due as at 1 January 2006.
The following disclosures relate to the defined benefit section and exclude insured pension arrangements. The last full actuarial
valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 January 2003 and updated on an approximate basis
to 28 August 2004. 45

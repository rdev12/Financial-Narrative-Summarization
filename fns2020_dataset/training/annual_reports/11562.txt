Chairman’s Statement
Building on our momentum 
Introduction
We have continued to successfully grow our 
businesses organically, and this growth has been 
supplemented by the acquisition, mid-year, of 
Meritus and GMA, which significantly expanded 
our presence in the North American online 
payments market.
Strategy
Optimal Payments has set out five strategic 
initiatives to grow the Company:
1. Drive organic growth in our core business 
lines of Straight-Through-Processing, Stored-
Value and, from 2014, Card Services;
2. Develop multi-channel solutions for these 
businesses so that their services offered are 
available on the widest and most up-to-date 
platforms;
3. Deliver new and innovative white label 
solutions to our customers that will help them 
retain and win business from their  
own customers;
4. Position our businesses to take maximum 
advantage of any further legalisation of online 
gambling (a worldwide market we know 
intimately) in the US, and;
5. Continue our successful M&A strategy to 
add scale to our operations – providing the 
acquisition can be completed on terms that 
are earnings accretive from the outset.
In 2014 the Company advanced all of these 
initiatives and I believe that we will make further 
significant progress in 2015. A detailed report 
on 2014’s achievements is set out in the CEO’s 
Review. 
Results
Revenues for 2014 increased by 44% to $365 
million (2013: $253.4 million) boosted by the 
FIFA World Cup in the first half of the year and, 
the contribution of the US businesses that 
were acquired in July 2014. Earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(EBITDA) increased by 65% to $86.1 million 
(2013: $52.2 million) reflecting the operational 
leverage of our businesses where revenue rises, 
with low marginal cost increases, lead to larger 
increases in profits. Basic earnings per share 
(EPS) increased by 64% to 36 cents (2013: 22 
cents) and adjusted fully diluted EPS increased 
52% to 38 cents (2013: 25 cents). The Group 
ended 2014 with cash (excluding customer 
merchant cash) of $106.5 million (2013: $93.8 
million) and free cash of $44 million after 
funding $26.6 million in part consideration and 
acquisition costs for the US businesses. The net 
debt position at year end was $26.3 million, a 
bank facility of $150 million was secured to fund 
the US acquisitions, and the Group was in full 
compliance with its debt covenants and cleared 
the remaining shareholder loans in January 2014.
Dividend
The Board is not recommending the payment 
of a dividend in respect of 2014, in line with 
our stated policy to reinvest cash generated in 
further growth opportunities.
Board and governance
In addition to my appointment as Non-Executive 
Chairman, there have been a number of further 
changes to the composition of the Board 
as we seek to put in place the people and 
Dennis Jones
Chairman
This is my first statement to 
shareholders following my appointment 
as Chairman in July 2014 and I am 
pleased to be able to report material 
progress during 2014 - operationally 
and financially.    Optimal Payments Plc

processes that are appropriate for the much 
larger enterprise that we seek to become. Ian 
Jenks and Andrew Dark became Non-Executive 
Directors at the same time as my appointment 
and they bring with them a wealth of experience 
and the type of governance necessary to 
sustain and accelerate our growth plans. John 
Bateson and Jonathan Comerford resigned as 
Non-Executive Directors on our appointment 
and, on behalf of the Board; I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank them for their valuable 
contributions.
Shortly after my appointment, the Board 
instituted a search for a CFO with large public 
company experience in the technology industry. 
In December, we announced the appointment 
of Brian McArthur-Muscroft as CFO and 
Executive Director of the Company. Brian was 
most recently Group Finance Director at Telecity 
Group Plc where he led the IPO of the business 
in 2007 and was chosen as the ICAEW’s FTSE 
250 Finance Director of the Year in 2012 and 
Business Week’s Finance Director of the Year 
in 2013. He holds a Law degree and qualified 
as a Chartered Accountant in London with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Brian succeeded 
Keith Butcher whom I must also thank for his 
valuable contribution during the Company’s early 
growth phase.
With the appointment of the new Non-Executive 
Directors, Brian’s appointment as CFO and the 
tightened corporate governance regime the 
Board has now put in place, I believe that we 
have a Board structure and governance platform 
that positions us well for the future.
The future 
We announced the proposed acquisition of 
the Skrill Group with the release of the full year 
results, taking advantage of an opportunity 
to acquire a business we know well which, 
combined with Optimal Payments will be a UK 
based, world class and scale online payments 
business. These opportunities are few and far 
between. The Board believes this transaction 
will be accretive for shareholders from the first 
full year of ownership, will further diversify our 
client base and, additionally, enable us to deliver 
enhanced services to existing and prospective 
merchants and customers around the world.

President and CEO’s Review
Positioned for further growth
Introduction
We are extremely pleased with the significant 
growth and strong performances across the 
business in 2014 with revenues up 44% to 
$365.0 million (2013: $253.4 million) and EBITDA 
increasing 65% to $86.1 million (2013: $52.2 
million); this resulted in the Group’s profit after  
tax increasing by 83% to $57.7 million (2013: 
$31.5 million), which was also favourably 
impacted by an unrealised fair value gain of 
$18.8 million during the current year.
We also achieved a number of significant 
milestones in 2014: the launch of the NETELLER 
and NET+ offerings in the US to enhance 
our position in the regulated online gambling 
market, attaining Principal Membership status 
with Visa and MasterCard to strengthen our 
NETBANX offering in the European Union 
and the successful acquisition and ongoing 
integration of the Meritus and GMA online 
payments companies to our NETBANX business 
to establish a significant presence and merchant 
base in the US. More recently, we have launched 
of a new card issuing services division and 
our NETELLERGO! offering for ecommerce 
merchants outside of gambling to contribute to 
continued growth. These achievements have all 
been important strategic goals as we continue to 
deliver on our stated objectives. We believe that 
the investment we have made in these and other 
areas will help to drive further growth.
The NETELLER Stored Value business 
continued to perform well through 2014, driven 
by underlying growth in customer metrics and 
an improvement in the gross margin which 
Joel Leonoff
President and CEO
2014 was a year of significant 
growth for Optimal Payments with 
substantial increases in revenue 
and profitability, setting a solid 
foundation for the year ahead.
has significantly contributed to the increase 
in EBITDA. The NETBANX Straight Through 
Processing business also performed strongly, 
revenues from the US businesses were 
incorporated in the second half of the year 
following the completion of the acquisitions in 
July. Our largest merchant contributed 36.7% 
of overall revenue, significantly boosted by the 
World Cup in the first half; this contribution was 
diluted by the inclusion of revenues from the 
US businesses in the second half of 2014. We 
continue to provide NETELLER and NETBANX 
services to this customer worldwide. The 
regulatory environment has continued to evolve 
and while this did not materially impact our 
revenues in 2014, some uncertainty persists in 
this regard. 
The Group was highly cash generative during the 
year, enabling us to acquire Meritus and GMA for 
a combined cost of $225 million payable in cash 
and shares, partly financed by new bank debt of 
$150 million. The Group’s ‘own cash’ (excluding 
any merchant cash) increased to $106.5 million 
at year end (31 Dec 2013: $93.8 million) with free 
cash of approximately $44.0 million. 
In January 2014, we successfully placed our then 
major shareholder’s entire stake (25.2% of the 
then issued share capital) into the market with the 
resulting transformation of our shareholder base, 
with 72 institutional shareholders participating in 
the placement. The remaining shareholder loans 
of $9.5 million that were related to the 2011 
acquisition of OP Inc. were converted into equity 
and formed part of this placement.   Optimal Payments Plc

NETELLER Stored Value (“SV”)
The Group’s NETELLER SV business 
(comprising the NETELLER and Net+ prepaid 
card stored value offering) performed strongly 
throughout 2014 with revenues up 50% to  
$89.6 million (2013: $59.8 million) and the gross 
margin improved to 85% (2013: 84%). 
The improved cash-back based VIP member 
loyalty program, a strengthened sales team, 
an enhanced affiliate program and numerous 
additions to deposit options for members 
worldwide have contributed to increased market 
share, primarily in the European online gambling 
market where NETELLER remains one of the 
two major providers of stored-value offerings. 
Key lead indicators such as number of member 
signups and member conversion rates continued 
to improve.
In 2014, we built upon our Principal Issuer 
membership of MasterCard through 
improvement of existing products and the 
development of a wider product suite. We 
have seen consistent growth with our award 
winning Net+ product, with over 450,000 
Net+ prepaid cards issued and an average of 
35,000 cardholders active every month. Our 
Issuing business made good progress in 2014 
with the continued organic growth of our Net+ 
programme with transaction value of $376 million 
(2013: $324 million). A new card issuing services 
division was launched in October 2014 to offer 
a variety of different programmes from white 
labelled cards to fully customised prepaid and 
multi-channel payment solutions, leveraging the 
Group’s extensive experience in multi-currency 
issuance and settlement to create repeatable 
scalable processes to merchants. Key strategic 
projects for 2015 are to enhance the offering 
with a pooled accounts solution to support real 
time loading of consumer funds and an agency 
banking solution which will allow prepaid card 
programmes to offer a more comprehensive 
banking experience to their clients (including 
internet banking and electronic payments).
In July we announced the shirt sponsorship of 
UK Premier League football club Crystal Palace 
FC which has given extensive exposure to and 
raised the awareness of the NETELLER brand 
in the UK and internationally. Our focus has 
traditionally been on the online gambling market 
where NETELLER has a strong market position 
however, we recently launched NETELLERGO! 
for ecommerce merchants to offer their 
consumers the flexibility of access to indemnified 
alternative payment types to complete their 
purchases. Optimal Payments Plc

President and CEO’s Review continued
NETBANX Straight Through Processing 
(“STP”) 
The Group’s NETBANX STP business also 
showed strong growth with full year revenues 
up 42% to $274.7 million (2013: $193.0 million). 
The growth was due to increasing demand from 
gambling and non-gambling customers alike, 
including our largest merchant whose revenue 
increased significantly during the World Cup. 
The gross margin in NETBANX was stable at 
41% (2013: 42%) with the bulk of the direct 
processing costs being fees to acquiring banks 
and other intermediate processors. Customer 
retention remains high as NETBANX provides 
a wide range of payment and fraud prevention 
services through a single customer integration 
point as well as access to more than a dozen 
acquiring banks worldwide. The underlying 
platform is scalable, and can accommodate a 
large number of new customers. 
The integration of the Meritus and GMA 
businesses is progressing well, contributing 
to the growth of the NETBANX division in the 
second half of the year. Acquisition of these 
profitable, fast growing and cash generative 
businesses will significantly accelerating Optimal 
Payments’ expansion into the rapidly expanding 
US ecommerce market by providing it with 
a diversified merchant client base, a highly 
agile multi-channel sales force operating in 
complimentary and new vertical markets and, 
partnerships with leading US acquiring banks. 
Having secured Principal Membership with Visa 
and MasterCard in the European Union, we are 
now able to offer competitive acquiring services 
to merchants which gives us the opportunity 
to increase the addressable market for our 
NETBANX offering. Principal Membership allows 
us to compete with banks and also benefit from 
interchange pricing from Visa and MasterCard. 
We expect to be more competitive in the lower 
risk processing markets whereas, to date, we 
have mainly focused on moderate to high risk 
markets. Our lower cost base should result in a 
more balanced mix of merchants in our portfolio. 
This business model underpins our confidence 
that NETBANX can continue to win business in 
all territories.
We have also continued to invest in building out 
our product infrastructure with the specific focus 
of providing etailers and retailers with the tools 
necessary to integrate technologies, such as our 
Developer centre giving code examples and test 
access to developers. In addition, we have the 
tools to enable merchants to access alternative 
payment types such as Apple Pay, MasterPass 
and Pingit to enhance the shopping experience 
for their customers using the most secure 
payment solutions available. 
US gaming 
NETELLER and Net+ products launched in 
the US in March 2014 and we have seen wide 
acceptance and adoption by merchants in New 
Jersey, Nevada and Delaware where online 
gambling has been regulated. Larger and more 
populous US states, including California and 
Pennsylvania, are currently considering licensing 
online gambling in 2015 and beyond. 
We are well positioned to gain market share 
in the US market, having acquired significant 
US operations through our California based 
businesses Meritus and GMA. We have 
continued to develop our relationships with 
current and potential merchants and have forged 
successful partnerships in the rapidly developing 
area of fantasy sports leagues.  Optimal Payments Plc

Recognition
We have won a number of awards across the 
business in the past year demonstrating the 
excellent service which we deliver to customers 
globally and the Group’s continued contribution 
as a provider of outsourced technology solutions 
to the online gaming industry. 
NETELLER most recently won ‘Best Payment 
System for Affiliates’ at the iGB Affiliate Awards 
and ‘Corporate Services Supplier of the Year’ 
at the International Gaming Awards in February 
2015. Our Net+ card achieved ‘Best General 
Spend Prepaid Card’, ‘Best Free Prepaid Card’, 
‘Best Prepaid Card’ and ‘Best Gaming Prepaid 
Card’ at the Prepaid 365 Awards. Optimal 
Payments won ‘Regional Payments Solution 
of the Year’ at the eGaming Review and was 
recognised as the leading ecommerce platform 
gateway provider at the Card not Present (CNP) 
Awards.
In October 2014, Danny Chazonoff (our Chief 
Operations Officer) and I were honoured to 
be named as the winners of Ernst & Young’s 
Entrepreneur of the Year Quebec’s Information 
Technology category. Most recently we were 
proud to announce that Elliott Wiseman, our 
General Counsel, won the Individual Award in the 
Regulatory (Financial Services) category at the 
European Counsel Awards 2015 in recognition 
of the considerable expertise he has shown in 
leading our legal and compliance functions from 
joining the Group in 2011.
Current trading and outlook 
The underlying business continues to perform 
well. Having accomplished all we set out to do 
during the year, both financially and operationally, 
we have emerged with a solid foundation for 
2015 and look forward to maintaining the 
momentum established in 2014. 
Our Executive Management Team has been 
strengthened through the addition of talented 
and experienced executives from Meritus and 
GMA and the recent appointment of Brian 
McArthur-Muscroft as CFO provides us with 
FTSE 250 level experience and pedigree as well 
as great leadership, discipline and value for our 
growing business. 
We continue to assess M&A opportunities that 
provide a strategic fit at the right valuation to 
further accelerate earnings growth, diversify 
our business and, most importantly, deliver 
value to shareholders. I would like to thank 
the management team and all staff for their 
outstanding contributions, without which the 
Group’s success today could not have been 
achieved.

NETELLER SV
The NETELLER and Net+ stored value offering 
allows consumers to store monetary value, 
which can then be used to pay for transactions 
at merchant’s online sites. NETELLER, 
established in 1999, has attracted millions of 
consumers who value simplicity, convenience, 
anonymity and security. Consumers deposit 
funds into their NETELLER and Net+ accounts 
via one of over 100 payment options, such as 
credit or debit cards, internet bank transfers 
and vouchers, and then use those funds to 
pay directly for goods or services online. The 
NETELLER and Net+ prepaid card stored value 
account allows members to withdraw funds 
directly from their NETELLER accounts via ATMs 
or to pay for goods and services. 
NETELLER derives its revenues by charging 
transaction fees to customers (members) 
as they deposit funds into their NETELLER 
account. It also charges fees to merchants 
when funds in the NETELLER account are 
moved to that merchant’s site. NETELLER 
processed over $7 billion in transaction value  
in 2014.
NETBANX STP
The Group’s STP business, NETBANX, provides 
payment processing services for gambling and 
non-gambling merchants whose customers 
transact principally online. These services are 
provided on platforms in Europe, North America 
and Asia. 
In Europe and North America, NETBANX 
processes both card and non-card payments for 
a very diverse set of e-commerce businesses. 
This is a fully PCI DSS Level 1 compliant and 
certified service for multi-channel cardholder 
not present transactions, including web, IVR, 
call centre, mail order, and telephone order 
purchases. NETBANX processes all major credit 
and debit cards including Visa and MasterCard, 
with additional payment support for global 
processing of American Express, NETELLER, 
PayPal, Ukash, and direct from bank payments 
such as iDEAL, Giropay and Direct Debit – all 
through a single integration, via multiple acquiring 
banks.
In Asia, NETBANX provides a bespoke gateway 
service via an outsourced service provider that 
leverages in-country processors to facilitate 
payments to merchants. Most of these payments 
are initiated via debit cards. The acquisition of the 
Meritus and GMA businesses has substantially 
increased our US portfolio and will drive multi-
channel sales growth in that market.
NETBANX earns fees for processing online 
transactions either as a fixed fee per transaction 
(the “gateway” model) or as a percentage of the 
transaction value (the “bureau” model, where 
the Group takes on the risk of managing the 
transaction process instead of an acquiring 
bank). NETBANX processed over $13 billion in 
transaction value in 2014 with over 130 million 
transactions completed.

Financial Review
Strengthening the Group through  
diversification and growth
Introduction
This is the first review following my appointment 
as Chief Financial Officer and I am pleased to 
present the consolidated Group results for the 
year ended 31 December 2014. I will continue to 
focus on generating controlled, sustainable and 
profitable growth across the business. 
EBITDA increased 65% to $86.1 million (2013: 
$52.2 million) and profit after tax increased 
by 83% to $57.7 million (2013: $31.5 million); 
adjusted diluted EPS increased 52% to $0.38 
(2013: $0.25) with basic EPS increased 64% to 
$0.36 (2013: $0.22). 
Gross profit
Full year revenues increased by 44% to $365 
million in 2014 (2013: $253.4 million) driven 
by a substantial improvement in high margin 
NETELLER SV revenues and strong growth in 
the NETBANX STP division. Revenues for the 
H2 totalled $205.9 million (2013: $135.0 million) 
incorporating revenues from Meritus and GMA 
following the completion of these acquisitions on 
23 July; revenues in the H1 were $159.1 million 
(2013: $118.4 million) boosted by c$5 million 
from the World Cup. 
NETELLER SV performed strongly, with revenues 
increased by 50% to $89.6 million (2013: 
$59.8 million) and the gross margin improved 
to 85% in 2014 (2013: 84%) as the number of 
new member monthly signups increased by 
78% between December 2013 and December 
2014 and monthly conversions increased by 
109% resulting in the conversion of 95% more 
members in 2014 than 2013. The principal direct 
costs of the NETELLER SV division that vary 
directly with revenue (included in cost of sales) 
are transaction related deposit and withdrawal

controlled, sustainable and 
profitable growth across the 
business.
fees and bad debts, accounting for 13% and 2% 
of revenue respectively in 2014, in line with 2013. 
Additionally, with growth in customer signups, 
there are ‘stepped’ costs of additional headcount 
in the call centre and the risk department and 
marketing and promotions fees where VIP loyalty 
‘cash back’ costs vary in line with VIP revenues. 
NETBANX STP revenues increased by 42% to 
$274.7 million (2013: $193.0 million) and the 
gross margin adjusted to 41% in 2014 (2013: 
42%), incorporating revenue and processing 
costs derived from the US businesses in H2. 
Processing costs and bad debts are the only 
costs that are directly variable in line with 
revenues in the STP division, accounting for  
59% and 0.2% of revenue respectively in 2014, 
in line with 2013. Meritus and GMA revenues  
of $45 million and net earnings incurred of  
$8.9 million are included in NETBANX STP 
revenues from the date of acquisition  
(23 July 2014), with a gross margin of 34%. 
The Group has one merchant, located and 
licensed in Europe, who represented 36.7%  
of total fee revenue in 2014 (2013: 41.4%) 
across all reportable segments and geographies. 
The majority of this revenue comes from the 
merchant’s activities in Asia. In 2014, the 
proportion of revenue contributed by this 
merchant increased significantly as a result of 
the World Cup in H1 but slowed in the following 
months to contribute 29% overall in H2 (further 
diluted by the inclusion of revenues from the US 
acquisitions). Overall, H2 saw a slowdown in 
revenues generated from the Group’s merchants’ 
activities in Asia which has now stabilised. We 
would expect the concentration of Asian based 
revenues to reduce further in the years ahead as 
the Group continues to diversify.

Company Information 80 - 82
Investment income of $0.7 million in 2014 (2013: 
$0.5 million) of revenue was derived from interest 
earned on the Group’s cash and the cash  
held by the Group on behalf of merchants  
and members. 
The Group’s gross profit, incorporating 
investment income and cost of sale expenses,  
is reported at $189.1 million in 2014 (2013: 
$131.8 million). The overall gross margin 
remained stable at 52% in 2014 (2013: 52%).
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by 50% to 
$146.9 million in 2014 (2013: $98.2 million) due 
primarily to consolidating more than five months 
of operations of the US acquisitions.
Salaries and employee expenses increased by 
approximately $13.7 million as we increased 
our headcount by approximately 200 heads to 
over 700 full-time employees as at 31 December 
2014. The NETBANX division now incorporates 
employees at the US businesses acquired in 
July, additions to headcount beyond this was 
mainly in technology as we continue to invest in 
our STP platform and product offerings on both 
sides of the business. The continued growth in 
NETELLER necessitated that we added staff 
in our call centre and risk operations to handle 
the higher number of NETELLER member 
applications and enquiries (which have doubled 
since June 2012). Share option expenses in 
2014 were $8.3 million (2013: $4.5 million), the 
Group continues to use share options and LTIPs 
to incentivise its employees and management 
team. The performance conditions for the LTIP 
awards granted in 2012 were met in 2014 and 
the cost has therefore been recognised in 2014. 
We have also recognised some of the cost of the 
2014 award based on an expected outturn.  
The share options available to employees in 
2011 also vested in December 2014. 
Technology and Software costs increased by 
$2.1 million as we invested in both platforms  
and our outsourced third party costs for our  
Asia operations increased in line with the growth 
in that business through 2014. Marketing  
and promotions increased by $7.2 million to 
$15.2 million incorporating costs associated  
with the NETELLER loyalty programme and  
cash back costs plus costs associated with  
the sponsorship of Crystal Palace. 
A foreign exchange loss of $3.0 million was 
incurred in 2014 (2013: gain of $0.9 million) due 
primarily to the fact that each of the EURO and 
GBP weakened against the USD in 2014 while 
the Group maintained significant cash balances 
in EURO and GBP in excess of what was owed 
to members and merchants. The Group employs 
forward exchange contracts to mitigate some 
of the exposure of financial risk associated with 
foreign currency balances. Large balances in 
a number of currencies are held on deposit for 
members and merchants and these balances 
fluctuate due to members and merchants not 
always choosing to deposit and withdraw funds 
in the same source currency, whilst this benefits 
the Group through the generation of foreign 
exchange revenue, it is impossible to perfectly 
predict balances to hedge. Furthermore, the 
results from the Group’s subsidiaries in Canada, 
UK and Bulgaria are reported in local functional 
currencies; as required under IFRS, foreign 
exchange on consolidation of a subsidiary’s 
balance sheet is captured in equity, but the 
subsidiary’s individual exposure to foreign 
currency is captured in income.
There were no restructuring costs in 2014 (2013: 
$0.8 million) and, impairment charges were not 
incurred. 
EBITDA
EBITDA increased 65% to $86.1 million (2013: 
$52.2 million) with the EBITDA margin increased 
to 24% (2013: 21%) due to the addition of the 
US businesses and the continued scalability of 
operations. Cash conversion remains strong and 
the Group was highly cash generative.
Profit after tax
Depreciation and amortisation was $21 million  
in 2014 (2013: $13.5 million) which included 
$15.6 million of amortisation of intangible 
assets (2013: $9.3 million) and $5.5 million in 
depreciation of capital assets (2013: $4.2 million). 
Approximately $3.1 million of the depreciation 
and amortisation charge in 2014 relates to the 
assets acquired through the acquisition of OP 
Inc. in 2011 (2013: $3.3 million) and an additional 
$6.1 million relates to the assets acquired through 
the acquisitions of Meritus and GMA in 2014; the 
NETELLER SV platform was launched at the end 
of 2010 and is being amortised over five years on 
a straight line basis. 
Finance costs were $2 million in 2014 (2013: 
$1 million), due to the debt incurred to fund the 
acquisitions of the US businesses in July 2014. 
The Group earns income and pays tax principally 
in Canada, the USA, the UK and the Isle of Man. 
T ax liabilities in these countries are calculated on 
an arm’ s length basis in line with internationally 
recognised transfer pricing principles. The 2014 
tax charge is $1.3 million (2013: $1.2 million).
The 2014 year-end provision for income taxes  
of $4.8 million (2013: $5.12 million) includes  
$4.8 million (2013: $4.8 million) in relation to 
Canadian withholding taxes that were deemed 
to have arisen on the relocation of assets to 
the Isle of Man from Canada in the 2004 and 
2005 taxation years. Following a seven year 
investigation, the Canadian Revenue Agency 
(CRA) claimed that additional withholding taxes 
were payable by the Group. The provision in 
place at the beginning of the year has not been 
increased during the year as it is believed to 
represent the amount the group will likely be 
required to pay in respect of such withholding 
taxes and interest. Without this provision the 
group’ s income tax liability at the balance sheet 
date would have been $0.04 million.
The Group’ s profit for the year, adjusting for  
these expenses and taxation paid is reported  
at $57.7 million in 2014 (2013: $31.5 million).

Earnings per share
The significant growth in revenue and EBITDA has 
resulted in an increase of adjusted diluted earnings 
per share of 52% to $0.38 (2013: $0.25) as 
compared to basic EPS which increased 64% to 
$0.36 (2013: $0.22). Adjusted EPS is calculated 
based on adjusted profit after tax, reconciliation to 
unadjusted earnings is shown above. 
Cash position 
Total gross cash available to the Group was 
$151.1 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: 
$170.6 million). This includes the unrestricted cash 
and cash equivalents of $142.3 million (2013: 
$164.4 million) plus restricted merchant cash 
balances and restricted member cash balances 
which is the excess of qualifying liquid assets held 
in respect of e-money issued to members over 
member balances payable. 
Included in cash and cash equivalents is a 
transient cash balance totalling $44.6 million 
(2013: $76.8 million) that relates to merchant 
transactions processed via the NETBANX gateway 
operations and security deposits held from the 
Group’ s bureau merchants. These gateway 
operations do not fall within the EU definition 
of “e-money” nor does a legal right of offset 
exist between this cash and the corresponding 
merchant liabilities. The cash and the merchant 
liabilities relating to gateway operations and 
merchant security deposits are therefore 
recognised both on the face of the balance sheet 
as cash and cash equivalents and as a liability in 
trade and other payables respectively. 
Group “own cash” position is $106.5 million 
(2013: $93.8 million) after deducting merchant 
cash balances, this does not represent the free 
cash of the business as a significant portion is 
tied up in various payment processing channels 
and security deposits. Free cash, available for 
long term investment, was approximately $44.0 
million (2013: $38.0 million) at 31 December 
2014.
Intangible assets 
The net book value of intangible assets at  
31 December 2014 was $76.1 million (2013: 
$22.8 million). This includes assets of $19.8 
million acquired from OP Inc. on 1 February 
2011 and assets of $63.6 million acquired from 
Meritus and GMA in 2014 (per note 16 of the 
Group’s financial statements). Management 
considered that the carrying value of these 
acquired assets did not need to be impaired. 
During the year, the Group incurred development 
costs to add new functionality to the NETELLER 
SV and NETBANX platforms. Management 
determined that no impairment was required at 
31 December 2013 in relation to this platform. 
Liabilities
The remaining shareholder loans of $9.5 million 
(as at end 2013, including accrued interest) 
were converted into equity in the Company at 
66.248 pence per share and formed part of the 
placement on 28 January 2014, these loans 
were related to the 2011 acquisition of OP Inc. 
Total current liabilities have decreased to  
$113.6 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: 
$117.6 million) despite new debt instruments 
added in 2014 related to the acquisition of the 
Meritus and GMA. This is attributed in large part 
to the decrease in NETBANX merchant cash 
processing liabilities (to $44.6 million at end 
2014 from $76.8 million at end 2013) relating to 
large sums of transient cash due to NETBANX 
merchants which has an equal and opposite 
liability included in trade and other payables.
Net debt
The Group was highly cash generative during  
the year and was effectively debt free at  
30 June 2014, enabling us to acquire Meritus 
and GMA for a combined cost of $225 million 
in July. These acquisitions were partly funded 
by a new bank debt facility of $150 million 
provided by the Bank of Montreal, consisting of 
a $100 million term loan facility and a $50 million 
revolving loan facility that are repayable over 
three years. The balance was funded by cash  
of $26.6 million and shares.
Year end net debt was $26.3 million, the 
increase of $109.2 million is due to the debt 
facilities taken to finance the US acquisitions, 
the Group was in full compliance with its debt 
covenants and has capacity for additional debt 
finance should this be required to capitalise any 
further acquisition opportunities that arise.
Off balance sheet arrangements
As of 31 December 2014, the Group had no 
off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or 
are reasonably likely to have, a current or future 
material effect on the consolidated financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital 
expenditures or capital resources.

Managing risk in our business 
Effective risk management is critical to achieving 
the Group’s objectives. Optimal Payments 
has a comprehensive system of controls in 
place to manage risks. We conduct regular 
reviews of the major risks which may affect our 
business and its financial performance. Risks 
are identified, evaluated and mitigated through 
a combination of a “top down” approach (driven 
by the Audit Committee and the Board) and 
a “bottom up” process (originating from the 
operations). The Risk Management Committee 
comprising a number of senior executives 
including the Chief Operating Officer, the 
Group’s General Counsel, Head of Compliance 
and the Group’s Director of Operational Risk, 
is tasked with identifying and evaluating 
group risks. These are pulled together into 
an Enterprise Risk Management framework 
where the risks are prioritised and responsibility 
assigned to an executive for monitoring and risk 
mitigation. Optimal Payments has appointed 
Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton to undertake 
regular reviews across the Group’s operations 
to assess the controls that are in place to 
mitigate the risks we face.
Responsibility
The Board has oversight responsibility for the 
effective management of all major risks affecting 
the Group. In each area, the Board is supported 
by members of the executive management 
team and other managers with key functional 
responsibilities.
Appropriate policies and procedures
Detailed policies and procedures support 
risk management across the Group and 
the application and consistency of these 
procedures is reviewed regularly by the Group’s 
Internal Audit function. Further details of this are 
included in the Corporate Governance section 
on pages 36 to 37.
Risk analysis
The Group’s principal risks can be categorised 
as either strategic, financial, operational, 
regulatory or market risks as shown below:
Business Risks
Managing risk remains a key focus 
Strategic risks Examples of mitigating activities include:
Loss of a major customer
Loss of one or more major customers of the Group could result in a 
material loss of revenue and profit to the Group.
The Group derived approximately 37% of its revenue in FY2014 from  
one customer.
•	 Developing 	 a 	 diversified 	 customer 	 portfolio, 	 both 	 geographically 	 and 	 
by industry sector.
•	 Building 	 and 	 maintaining 	 close 	 r elationships 	 with 	 customers 	 to	
determine and adapt to their current needs, providing the solutions  
and flexibility that they require.
•	 Dedicated 	 account 	 management 	 for 	 major 	 customers.
Failure of a major customer 
The business failure of a merchant of the NETBANX Straight Through 
Processing division might result in chargebacks from the merchant being 
passed on to the Company which could have a materially adverse effect 
on the Group’s financial condition.
•	 Ensuring 	 that 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 holds 	 the 	 appr opriate 	 r olling 	 r eserves 	 and	
collateral/security and insures against the risk in certain circumstances 
where appropriate and available.
•	 Assessment 	 of 	 the 	 financial 	 risk 	 befor e 	 accepting 	 the 	 mer chant 	 as 	 a 	
customer and regular ongoing review of the merchant’s performance 
and general financial health.
•	 Reacting 	 quickly 	 to 	 any 	 marked 	 changes 	 in 	 behaviour 	 including	
transaction patterns, cashflows and/or chargeback levels.
Changes in the Online Gambling Industry
The Group relies on the continued supply of its services to merchants 
within the online gambling industry. If such merchants are subject to 
heavier taxes, compliance costs, levies or licence fees or are forced to 
cease operating in a jurisdiction as a result of prohibitive legislation it may 
result in reduced demand for the services of the Group within the online 
gambling industry.
•	 Ensuring 	 that 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 builds 	 on 	 the 	 inter national 	 diversification 	 of 	
its merchant base to reduce the impact of changes in one jurisdiction 
having a material impact on the Group.
•	 Incr easing 	 the 	 supply 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 services 	 to 	 mer chants 	 outside	 
of the online gambling industry.
Acquisitions and partnerships
Acquisitions and partnerships can play a key role in the Group’s strategy 
and the failure to integrate and operate acquired businesses and/or 
partnerships represents a commercial risk to the business.
•	 Managing 	 corporate 	 activity 	 thr ough 	 a 	 structur ed 	 acquisition 	 and	
integration process using multifunctional teams and major programme 
specialists.
Attracting and retaining the best talent
The Group’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key 
management to drive the business’ development and respond to the 
challenges and opportunities it faces.
•	 Developing 	 the 	 skills 	 and 	 capabilities 	 of 	 identified 	 staf f 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 talent 	
management.
•	 Cr eating 	 opportunities 	 within 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 for 	 personal 	 development 	 and	
career enhancement by corporate activity. Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 18
Financial risks Examples of mitigating activities include:
Relationships with financial institutions
The nature of the Group’s business requires it to enter into numerous 
commercial and contractual relationships with banks, card schemes, 
issuers and other financial institutions. The Group depends on these 
relationships to operate on a day-to-day basis. If, for any reason, any 
banks, payment card schemes, issuers or financial institutions ceased to 
supply the Group with the services it requires to conduct its business it 
could impact the Group’s ability to provide its digital payment services.
•	 Maintain 	 str ong 	 r elationships 	 with 	 financial 	 institution 	 partners.
•	 Continue 	 to 	 seek 	 new 	 financial 	 institution 	 partners 	 to 	 help 	 build 	 latency 	
into the network.
Secure sufficient funding
The Group has working capital needs which can limit the Group’s ability 
to utilise cash for investment purposes. Access to funding is therefore 
important to retain sufficient flexibility in the Group’s strategic development.
•	 Developing 	 str ong 	 r elationships 	 with 	 financial 	 institutions 	 and 	
shareholders.
•	 Adopting 	 appr opriate 	 cash 	 management 	 strategies 	 aligned 	 to	
operational and strategic priorities.
Cost and capital expenditure control
The Group’s ability to deliver sustainable improvement in financial 
performance is dependent on controlling costs and capital expenditures.
•	 Adopting 	 sufficiently 	 detailed 	 budgets 	 and 	 business 	 plans 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 a 	
comprehensive annual budgeting process.
•	 Monthly 	 r eporting 	 of 	 budget 	 variance 	 and 	 performance 	 to 	 the 	 Boar d,	
including capital expenditure reviews.
Operational risks Examples of mitigating activities include:
Complex global operations
The Group operates in global markets with customers in over 200 
countries and territories, and has a physical presence in a number 
of countries around the world. The Group runs a number of different 
operating platforms supporting core payment processing services. This 
creates complexity within the Group’s operations: different time zones; 
technical interfaces; business processes; cultures and work practices.
•	 Building 	 str ong 	 interaction 	 and 	 communication 	 frameworks 	 between	
those operations.
•	 Defined 	 management 	 structur es 	 with 	 clear 	 r eporting 	 lines.
Product innovation
The Group must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, 
functionality and features of its products and services and the underlying 
network infrastructure. The Internet and e-commerce industries are 
characterised by rapid technological change, changes in user  
requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service 
introductions embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new 
industry standards and practices that could render our technology and 
systems obsolete.
•	 Developing 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 capability 	 to 	 inter nally 	 develop, 	 acquir e, 	 partner	
or licence leading technologies to enhance existing products and 
services and also to develop new products and services.
•	 Continuing 	 to 	 addr ess 	 the 	 incr easingly 	 sophisticated 	 and 	 varied 	 needs	
of the Group’s merchants, and responding to technological advances 
and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and 
timely basis.
Security, fraud and money laundering
The Group is focused on providing trusted services to consumers 
and merchants and ensuring that data and confidential information is 
transmitted and stored securely. Ensuring customer data security, privacy, 
and ongoing compliance with Payment Card Industry regulations requires 
significant capital expenditure.
As an online business with little or no face-to-face contact with its 
customers, the Group faces the possibility of reputational damage if there 
was a serious case of a customer using the Group’s services to carry out 
money laundering or terrorist financing.
•	 Operating 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 automated 	 monitoring 	 tools 	 and 	 r esponse	
procedures to identify and react to threats.
•	 Continuing 	 to 	 invest 	 in 	 solutions 	 that 	 impr ove 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 ability 	 to	
manage credit risk and fraud and ensure compliance with regulations  
in the most cost-effective and appropriate manner.

Operational risks Examples of mitigating activities include:
Transaction processing
The Group relies on the ongoing availability and uninterrupted operation 
of transaction processing systems and services within and outside of the 
Group. All operational systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption 
from targeted denial of service attacks, viruses, natural or man-made 
disasters and human or technological failures under a variety of scenarios.
•	 Pr oviding 	 business 	 r ecovery 	 capability 	 and 	 infrastructur e 	 to 	 enable	
resumption of services to merchants and consumers as quickly and as 
conveniently as possible with minimal disruption and loss of business. 
Outsourcing risk
The Group relies on the services of an outsourced service provider to 
provide services to its largest merchant which is licensed and located in 
Europe in relation to its activities in China. If the service provider ceases 
to provide services to the Group for any reason, the Group would be 
adversely affected as the Directors believe that there are currently no other 
service providers which are capable of replicating the services which the 
Group receives.
•	 Build 	 and 	 maintain 	 a 	 close 	 r elationship 	 with 	 the 	 outsour ced 	 service	
provider.
•	 Reduce 	 dependency 	 on 	 largest 	 mer chant.
Cyber Security
The IT environments of the Group may be subject to hacking, data theft or 
other cyber security threats which may harm customer relationships and 
the market perception of the effectiveness and resilience of the Group’s 
products and services. Such an attack may also have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial condition.
•	 Ensuring 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 has 	 the 	 systems 	 in 	 place 	 to 	 defend 	 against	
potential cyber security threats.
Regulatory risks Examples of mitigating activities include:
Changes in Online Gambling Regulation
The Group relies on the continued supply of its services to merchants 
within the online gambling industry and has a material indirect 
dependency on the Chinese online gambling market. 
Many countries have introduced licensing regimes which has led to 
greater regulatory oversight and scrutiny for many of the Group’s 
customers. In some cases, a lack of clarity in the regulations or conflicting 
legislative and regulatory developments mean that the Group’s customers 
may risk failing to obtain an appropriate license, having existing licenses 
adversely affected, or the Group or its customers may be subject to 
actions (criminal or civil) which could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business and financial performance.
Changes in the applicable regulatory regime or the way in which a regime 
is enforced in an important jurisdiction could also have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial performance in that jurisdiction.
•	 Understanding 	 the 	 specific 	 risks 	 r elated 	 to 	 operations 	 and 	 potential 	
ways to mitigate those risks, while maintaining continuous monitoring 
to ensure that the Group remains aware of, and can react to, market 
developments which might impact its business.
•	 Pr oviding 	 dedicated 	 management 	 (legal, 	 compliance) 	 to 	 compr ehend	
emerging regulatory requirements and lead implementation of 
appropriate strategies.
•	 Utilising 	 exter nal 	 expertise 	 to 	 guide 	 strategy 	 formulation.
The Group may be affected by the Common Reporting Standard 
for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information and other 
cross border automatic exchange of information provisions
The UK, Isle of Man and a number of other jurisdictions have announced 
they intend to enter into multilateral arrangements modelled on the 
Common Reporting Standard for Automatic and if implemented they 
would require the Group to provide certain information to local tax 
authorities about merchants and customers. If those merchants or 
customers do not wish to disclose their tax residency or status to the 
Group the merchants or customers may cease to utilise the services  
of the Group which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial condition.
•	 Ensur e 	 that 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 pr ovides 	 sufficient 	 communication 	 to 	 its 	
customers and merchants concerning the collection of relevant 
information so that the reasons are understood.
•	 Putting 	 in 	 place 	 the 	 appr opriate 	 systems 	 to 	 efficiently 	 collect 	 the 	
applicable information. Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 20
Business Risks continued
Market risks Examples of mitigating activities include:
Global economic environment
The global economy provides the broad context for many of the Group’s 
operations. Expanding or contracting demand impacts on the opportunity 
to develop the Group’s activities.
Further, the challenging economic conditions increase the risk that 
financial or banking parties or other third party service providers may 
default or cease to provide the Group with services.
•	 Expanding 	 the 	 diversification 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 NETBANX 	 STP 	 business 	
across numerous e-commerce verticals, reducing the risk from 
concentration on one market vertical. 
•	 Maintaining 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 alter native 	 pr oviders 	 of 	 “critical” 	 services 	 so	
that in the event of failure, replacement providers can be mobilised and 
business processes resumed with minimal disruption.
Competitive environment
The Group operates in rapidly evolving payments markets, where service 
provision is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological 
change. The Group faces competition from non-traditional participants as 
well as established payment processors.
Certain competitors have longer operating histories, greater financial, 
technical, marketing or other resources to bring to bear.
•	 Investing 	 in 	 new 	 pr oducts, 	 markets, 	 payment 	 types.
•	 Impr oving 	 r elationships 	 with 	 key 	 mer chants 	 and 	 consumers.
Risks relating to the Skrill acquisition Examples of mitigating activities include:
Risks relating to the Skrill acquisition completing
Failure to realise the anticipated benefits of the Skrill acquisition may have 
a significant impact on the profitability of the Group in the future.
Failure to integrate Skrill’s business practices and operations may result in 
management distraction or overstretch with the result that the underlying 
businesses do not perform in line with management or shareholder 
expectations.
•	 The 	 Gr oup 	 has 	 significant 	 transaction 	 integration 	 experience. 	
•	 An 	 integration 	 plan 	 has 	 alr eady 	 been 	 established 	 and 	 is 	 r eady 	 to	
execute on identified synergy opportunities immediately following 
completion.
Risks relating to the Skrill acquisition not completing
Completion of the Skrill acquisition remains subject to a number of 
conditions including FCA approval and approval from regulatory authorities 
in the US. The Company will incur legal and other professional costs of 
approximately £6 million if the acquisition does not proceed. If completion 
of the acquisition does not occur for any reason other than as a result of 
the seller not complying with its obligations under the agreement for the 
acquisition of Skrill, the Company will also be required to make a costs 
reimbursement payment of up to €5 million to the seller.
•	 The 	 FCA 	 and 	 US 	 appr oval 	 pr ocess 	 is 	 underway 	 and 	 the 	 Company 	 is	
confident that approval will be obtained and that completion of the 
acquisition will take place in the third quarter of 2015.   Optimal Payments Plc

Corporate Social Responsibility
Making a difference
Our approach to engaging with our customers, 
our employees, the industries we serve and the 
broader communities where we do business 
underpins our culture, raising awareness of our 
brands and reinforcing our corporate values.
Customers
The Group’s approach to its customers is a key 
strength of the business. In attracting customers, 
the aim is to win and retain their trust and 
loyalty. The Group is always aware of the risks 
associated with the transfer of money online 
and its policies and procedures are designed to 
minimise the risks to customers and to gain their 
trust. This approach is underpinned by a robust 
identity verification system and corresponding 
ability to “know your customer”. This applies to 
both merchants and consumer members. Group 
procedures validate an individual’s identity and 
thereafter determine what products or services 
are appropriate for that member. A similarly 
rigorous process ensures that new merchants 
are appropriate for the Group to serve.
Employees
The Board is of the view that the Group’s 
continuing success and in particular its ability to 
meet the frequent and varied challenges it faces, 
is due to the quality and commitment of its 
workforce. The Group’s employee management 
priorities, including its remuneration strategies, 
are based on recruiting and retaining the best 
people in the industry and on encouraging 
working practices that improve productivity, 
reduce costs, develop talent and give job 
satisfaction.
The Group is committed to developing ongoing 
communication with all of its employees. This is 
achieved through a variety of channels to ensure 
that employees are informed of the Group’s 
progress and are recognised for the key roles 
that they play in the Group’s success. Further, 
the Group is committed to a policy of equal 
opportunity in matters relating to employment, 
training and career development of employees, 
and is opposed to any form of less favourable 
treatment based on age, disability, sex, marital 
status, sexual orientation, nationality, race or 
religion. The Group also has a whistleblowing 
policy which was implemented in 2007.
Trade organisations and industry awareness
As a registered online payments service provider, 
facilitating global payments for our merchants 
and customers, our business is built on trust. 
That’s why we comply with the highest industry 
standards. As part of that compliance regime,

to many corporations due to the online nature 
of our services, we are committed to minimising 
our environmental impact. We endeavour to do 
this in our offices by deploying high efficiency 
servers, ensuring computer and electrical 
equipment is switched off when not in use.

Empowering people and communities 
around the globe

countries, we seek to support the communities 
where we have operations by supporting local 
charities in these regions and aim to match 
charitable fundraising by individual employees. 
During 2014, the Group directly contributed 
$105,842 (2013: $90,620) to directly support 
charitable causes and continued to encourage 
employees to participate in charitable 
endeavours. 
Optimal Payments partnered with the 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Society of Canada 
(ALS Canada) in 2012 and processed a record 
amount of online donations as part of the 
successful Ice Bucket Challenge in 2014 to raise 
awareness of ALS and treat and support people 
living with this disease. ALS Canada raised over 
$16 million with Optimal Payments donating 
$10,000 to this worthy campaign.

micro-lending sponsorships to entrepreneurs 
via Kiva. As a global organisation, we believe it 
is important to provide people across the globe 
with opportunities to become economically 
independent, improve their standard of living

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Isle of Man company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group, and of the profit or loss  
of the Company and the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select 	 suitable 	 accounting 	 policies 	 and 	 apply 	 them 	 consistently;
•	 make 	 judgments 	 and 	 estimates 	 that 	 ar e 	 r easonable 	 and 	 prudent;
•	 state 	 whether 	 applicable 	 International 	 Financial 	 Reporting 	 Standar ds 	 have 	 been 	 followed, 	 subject 	 to 	 any 	 material 	 departur es 	 disclosed 	 and 	 explained	 
in the financial statements; and
•	 pr epar e 	 the 	 financial 	 statements 	 on 	 a 	 going 	 concern 	 basis 	 unless 	 it 	 is 	 inappr opriate 	 to 	 pr esume 	 that 	 the 	 Company 	 and 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 will 	 continue 	 in 	
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each of the Directors has 
taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
The financial statements are published on the Group’s website. The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. 
The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

The Directors present their annual report on the affairs of the Company and the Group, together with the audited Group financial statements and 
independent auditor’s report for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Principal activity
The Company is a holding company and its subsidiaries are engaged in the provision of innovative payment solutions to merchants and consumers 
through its NETBANX payment processing business and its NETELLER Stored Value Business. Optimal Payments Limited, a UK subsidiary of the 
Company, is authorised by the FCA to issue e-money. Optimal Payments Merchant Services Limited, an Isle of Man subsidiary of the Company, is 
authorised by the FSC to provide money transmission services. A review of the current and future development of the Group’s business is given in the 
Strategic Report on pages 01 to 23 which forms part of, and by reference is incorporated within this Directors’ Report. 
The Group’s financial and risk management objectives and policies are discussed in the Financial Review and Business Risks section starting on page 14 
and Note 27 to the Financial Statements.
Results for the year and dividends
The results of the Company and the Group for 2014 are set out on pages 41 to 48 and show a net profit after tax of $57.7 million (2013: $31.5 million).  
An overview of the development of the business of the Group during 2014 is provided in the Chairman’s Statement and in the Strategic Report on pages 
04 to 13.
It remains the view of the Board that shareholders are best served by reinvesting the Group’s cash to generate growth opportunities rather than declaring  
a dividend. This policy remains under regular review.
Directors and their interests

Company Information 80 - 82
The Board’s objective is to build a sustainable business through consistent, profitable growth and to make sure that it acts responsibly in meeting its 
accountabilities to shareholders. Sound corporate governance is key to achieving this objective.
The Board believes that clear direction and understanding, robust internal controls, and high standards of integrity should be dominant factors in the way 
the Group is managed. To effect this, the Board has maintained written policies since 2004 governing various aspects of the Group’s operations and 
procedures, which underpin further operational policies and procedures. These policies are reviewed regularly to ensure conformity with current legislation, 
regulations, and changing market conditions. New policies are introduced when considered appropriate. 
The Board reviews this policy framework and sets and monitors fundamental internal policies and external requirements on a continuing basis, with  
the aim of minimising strategic, operational, financial and market risks as far as possible, and to make decisions based on such a risk based approach. 
The Board fully endorses the spirit of the UK Corporate Governance Code, as set out in the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules (the “Code”) and, as far as 
practically possible, the Board seeks to ensure that the Company complies with the principles of the Code, whilst being aware of the Company’s specific 
circumstances in terms of its size, nature and stage of development.
Board of Directors
The Board comprises two Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors whose Board and Committee responsibilities are set out in the table below. 
The Directors’ biographies on pages 24 and 25 illustrate their relevant corporate and industry experience.
Membership of the Board and its Committees is as follows:
 Position  Board  Audit  Remuneration  Nomination
Dennis Jones  Non-Executive Chairman Chairman  — — Member
Joel Leonoff  President and CEO  Member  — —  Member
Brian McArthur-Muscroft  CFO  Member — — Member
Andrew Dark Non-Executive Director Member Member Member Chairman
Ian Francis  Non-Executive Director  Member  Chairman  Member  Member
Brahm Gelfand Non-Executive Director Member Member Member Member
Ian Jenks Non-Executive Director  Member Member Chairman  Member
Stephen Shaper Non-Executive Director Member Member Member Member
The Non-Executive Chairman, Dennis Jones, is responsible for the running of the Board, and he, together with the CEO, is responsible for liaising with the 
Company Secretary to ensure that all Directors receive sufficient and relevant information of a financial, business and corporate nature prior to meetings. 
The Chairman encourages the Board to act as a single unit by obtaining consensus at Board meetings. In exceptional circumstances decisions would be 
taken by majority.
Executive responsibility for the running of the Group’s business rests with Joel Leonoff and he is supported in this by the Executive Management Team.
It is the Board’s policy that all new Director appointments are considered and, if appropriate, approved by the full Board, following consideration by the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees of any incoming Director’s remuneration package.
Meeting attendance
Details of the number of Board and Committee meetings attended by each Director appear in the tables at the beginning of the Report of the Directors,  
the Nomination Committee Report, the Remuneration Committee Report and the Audit Committee Report respectively.
The Board communicates frequently and meets at regular intervals, and at these meetings the Directors are responsible for approval of the overall strategy 
and major developments of the Group. The CEO and the Executive Management Team are responsible for coordinating and implementing the approved 
business strategy.
The Board approves the annual budget and monitors monthly the performance of the Company, Group and Executive Management Team against the 
approved budget and a range of key performance indicators, as well as considering employee issues and key appointments. All members of the Board are 
able to take independent professional advice in relation to their duties as a Director of the Company, at the Company’s expense, should they wish to do so.
During 2014, the Company Secretary, to whom all Directors have access, attended Board and Committee meetings, and ensured compliance with 
relevant procedural obligations, as well as being available for provision of advice to the Company and Directors.
The Directors submit themselves for re-election, in accordance with the Group’s Articles of Association and the Code, at least once every three years.
A summary of the performance and financial position of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014 is set out in the Chairman’s Statement, the 
CEO’s Review and the Financial Review. The Board believes that this information provides a balanced assessment of the Company and the Group’s 
financial position and future prospects. The responsibilities of the Directors are set out on page 26.

ANNUAL REPORT 2014 30
Internal control and risk management
The Board attaches considerable importance to the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management by establishing a continuous process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks which the Company and Group face.
During 2014 the exposures to risk, including the changing regulatory environments within the industry were closely monitored by the Group. A summary of 
the key risks facing the business is set out in the section “Business Risks” on pages 17 to 20.
During 2014, the Internal Audit function was outsourced to Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton in Canada. At each Audit Committee meeting, they report on 
any matters that have arisen and for which the Committee should review. The Board is satisfied that the outsourcing of the Internal Audit Function ensures 
that sufficient controls for managing risks are in place in line with the Code. Risk management covers operations, security, compliance, finance and 
strategy. The Audit Committee, acting on behalf of the Board, monitors these areas closely with regular input from Executive management, and applicable 
matters are reviewed at meetings of the Audit Committee.
Internal controls are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and the Board recognises that any system 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group also operates an accounting and budgeting system, which is reported and analysed on a monthly basis. Variances between budget and actual 
results are analysed thoroughly to ensure that any material differences are investigated appropriately.
During 2014, the Company reviewed and updated its share dealing code and this was approved by the Board. The Company’s share dealing code is 
based on the Model Code for dealings in securities of the Company by “relevant employees” of the Group, and Directors of the Company or Group 
companies. The Directors will also continue to comply with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules relating to Directors’ dealings and will take all reasonable steps to 
ensure compliance by the Group and the Group’s relevant employees.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company is strongly committed to good investor communications and seeks to build and maintain good relationships with both its institutional and 
private investors. The Company values the views of shareholders and recognises their interests in the Group’s strategy and performance. The CEO and 
the CFO, assisted by the Head of Investor Relations, meet with institutional shareholders on a regular basis and make themselves available for calls as 
appropriate. There have been regular dialogues with shareholders during the year.
The Company holds briefings with institutional fund managers, analysts and other investors, primarily following the announcement of interim and final 
results, as well as at other times during the year as may be appropriate. The Company’s programme of investor relations activities is designed to ensure 
that the investing community receives a balanced and consistent view of the Group’s performance. Care is taken to ensure that any price sensitive 
information is released to all shareholders at the same time in accordance with FCA requirements.
The Company also uses the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate with its shareholders. All Directors are expected to attend the 
Annual General Meeting and the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees are also available to answer shareholders’ questions. 
Notice of the date of the 2015 Annual General Meeting is included with this report. Separate resolutions on each substantially separate issue, in particular 
any proposal relating to the Annual Report and Accounts, will be made at the Annual General Meeting.
Communication is also provided through the Annual Report and the Interim Report and the investor relations area on the Company’s website  
(www.optimalpayments.com). The Group’s corporate website provides information as required by Rule 26 of the AIM Rules in addition to general  
corporate and investor information.
All material public and regulatory announcements are reviewed by the Board and the Company’s nominated adviser prior to release and publication.  
The Board receives reports from the Company’s broker twice a year that communicate feedback from institutional shareholders. The Board reviews analyst 
and press coverage of the Company regularly at Board meetings, and receives reports twice a year from its financial public relations adviser regarding the 
views of analysts.
The Group also maintains a portal for UK-based shareholders that provides an online record of shareholdings and shareholder details. Further information 
is set out at the end of the Annual Report.
Enquiries from shareholders are always welcome and can be directed to Jessica Stalley, Head of Investor Relations, at the following email address: 
investorrelations@optimalpayments.com or by telephone to +44 20 7182 1707.

Code. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
Governance
Appropriate specialist advice is taken where necessary, bearing in mind the cross-jurisdictional operations of the Group.
Employment arrangements
In accordance with its remit, the Committee determines the terms and conditions of service of the Group’s senior staff and Executive Directors which 
includes the determination of appropriate salaries, bonuses, share options, pension and long term incentive arrangements and all other relevant terms and 
conditions of service, as well as termination arrangements, which are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain staff of the high calibre needed to 
maintain the Group’s position and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The remuneration and terms and conditions of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board with due regard to the interests of shareholders 
and the performance of the Group. No Executive or Non-Executive Director plays any part in the discussion or approval of his own remuneration.
Components of remuneration of Executive Directors
Base Salary
The base salary recognises the day-to-day responsibilities of the individual director. It is set following consideration of compensation data for comparable 
businesses as well as individual experience and performance. 
Pension

is 5% of base salary. Joel Leonoff does not receive any pension contributions.

Report of the Remuneration Committee Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 32
Annual performance-related remuneration
Performance-related remuneration consists of two elements: an annual cash bonus and an annual equity-based incentive award. The cash bonus rewards 
performance for the preceding year and the annual equity incentive award provides incentive for performance in current and forthcoming years.
The sizes of the performance-related awards in the form of cash bonuses are dependent upon meeting challenging financial and individual objectives.  
The normal cash bonus limit for the CEO is based on 100% of basic salary and 75% of basic salary for the CFO, however these levels can be increased  
by the Committee, if the individual and Group performance significantly exceeds its target. 
Target performance is set by the Remuneration Committee each year, based on the annual plan and budget.

Share-based remuneration
The Company operates two share incentive based remuneration schemes. The Company’s Employee Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”), which was 
introduced at the time of the Company’s admission to AIM in April 2004, was the principal scheme under which share-based incentives were made until 
mid-2010, when the Company introduced a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Awards to executive management are now made under the LTIP which  
vest only on the achievement of certain performance conditions, and the Company makes grants under the ESOS to those employees who are not 
participants of the Company’s LTIP .
Employee Share Option Scheme
On 20 May 2014, a total of 495,500 options were granted to all full time employees of the Group (except those participating in the Company’s LTIP),  
of which 390,500 were made under the Unapproved Share Option Scheme and 105,000 were made under the Approved Share Option Scheme at an 
exercise price of £3.35 per share. There is a three year vesting period before the grant can be exercised and it is not conditional upon any performance 
condition save continued employment.
During 2014, no awards were granted to Executive Directors pursuant to the Company’s Employee Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”).
As at 31 December 2014, 1,456,750 shares (2013: 1,565,750) are outstanding under the ESOS amounting to 0.89% (2013: 1.04%) of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
Further details on the ESOS options can be found in Note 21 on page 68.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Company makes grants under the LTIP on an annual basis to incentivise executive management (including Executive Directors) based on the 
performance of the business and achievement of prescribed EBITDA targets for certain periods. The criteria for and timing of vesting of the LTIP grants  
are determined by the Company’s Remuneration Committee in accordance with the LTIP Scheme rules. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the scheme regularly in light of current market practice and advice received from Independent Remuneration 
Consultants. The Remuneration Committee has considered several possible amendments to the scheme to ensure that the interests of the Executive 
Directors and Senior Management are aligned to those of the Shareholder. Accordingly it is the intention of the Committee to implement a scheme which  
is based upon a three year time period with performance criteria being measured against total shareholder return target as opposed to an EBITDA target.  
It is also intended that an Employee Benefits Trust will be established to hold the shares to satisfy awards made under the scheme. 
During 2014, 4,066,993 options were granted under the LTIP (further details provided in the 2014 grant explanation on page 34), 20,000 were forfeited 
and 2,846,591 were exercised. As at 31 December 2014, there were 6,729,559 LTIP options outstanding, of which 674,800 had vested and could be 
exercised.
Further details on the LTIP options can be found in Note 21 on page 68.
 
2013 Grant
The EBITDA target which determines the vesting of the 2013 LTIP grant is the target set for the year ending 31 December 2014 and the award will vest in 
a single tranche on the second anniversary of grant as set out in the table below:
 EBITDA achieved
End of performance period Below Threshold* Annual Target or Above Between Threshold and Target
31 December 2014 Nil 100% of grant  Between 30% and 100% of grant 
   (on a straight line basis) vests in 2015
*The threshold is set at approximately 88% of the target EBITDA.
Based on the 2014 annual results, the EBITDA targets were met in full and therefore, in accordance with the scheme rules, the Remuneration Committee 
determined that 100% of the 2013 LTIP grant vested. Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 34
2014 Grant
A grant was made to eligible executives on 28 March 2014 with a total award of 1,066,993 shares. Joel Leonoff was awarded 185,759 shares and  
Keith Butcher was awarded 61,065 shares. The EBITDA target which determines the vesting of the 2014 LTIP grant is the target set for the year ending  
31 December 2015 and the award will vest in a single tranche on the second anniversary of grant as set out in the table below:
 EBITDA achieved
End of performance period Below Threshold* Annual Target or Above Between Threshold and Target
31 December 2015 Nil 100% of grant  Between 30% and 100% of grant 
   (on a straight line basis) vests in 2016
*The threshold is set at approximately 88% of the target EBITDA.
One-off LTIP award
In September 2013, the Remuneration Committee approved the principle of making an award over 3,500,000 shares to be granted to certain senior 
management to replace the change of control commitments made to them in the past. The award was subject to the performance conditions being 
agreed. 
In July 2014, the Remuneration Committee granted the award over a total of 3,000,000 shares, 2,000,000 of which were granted to Joel Leonoff.  
These will vest on 1 October 2016, subject to continued employment and pre-determined share price targets tested over the three-year period ending  
30 September 2014 (a third of awards), 30 September 2015 (a third of awards), and 30 September 2016 (a third of awards) being met. It is intended  
that the award will vest in full in the event of a change of control, with no time pro-rating unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.  
The pre-determined share price target for the first tranche of the award was exceeded and accordingly one-third of the award is capable of vesting on  
1 October 2016.

The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Audit Committee and attends its meetings.
T erms of reference
A copy of the Terms of Reference of the Audit Committee can be obtained upon request from the Company Secretary and is also available on the 
Company’s corporate website. The Terms of Reference are reviewed annually and are approved by the Board. 
In accordance with its remit, and acting as a sub-committee of the Board, the Committee is responsible for exercising the full powers and authority of the 
Board in reviewing a wide range of accounting and financial reporting matters, as well as internal control and risk management issues.
The Audit Committee is advisory in nature to the Board, and its Terms of Reference require it to be independent in relation to controls, procedures, policies 
and accounting. The Audit Committee supports the Board’s responsibilities in respect of the monitoring, review and reporting on internal controls and risk 
management. 
The Committee reviews the published financial results, Annual Report and other published information for statutory and regulatory compliance. It reports its 
views to the Board to assist in its review and approval of the results announcements and the Annual Report.
Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet at least three times a year and did so during 2014. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
Chief Risk Officer, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Inc. (“RCGT”) (who undertake the Internal Audit function) and the external auditors, KPMG Audit LLC, 
attending by invitation as considered appropriate.
The Committee also meets separately with the internal and external auditors without management being present.
Internal Audit
During 2014, the Internal Audit function was outsourced to RCGT in Canada. RCGT undertook a comprehensive review of risks and requirements 
culminating in a three year Audit Plan, that was tabled and approved at the September meeting.
Internal audit reports are presented to, reviewed, and discussed at each meeting, together with the corresponding management response to ensure that 
the key risks within the business were identified and managed. A rolling schedule which tracks outstanding audit points is maintained by RCGT and is 
reviewed by the Committee at each meeting. 
Compliance
Internal Compliance Reports are presented to, reviewed, and discussed at each meeting. These reports cover the Group’s compliance with the various 
regulatory controls that the Group has to operate under in its various geographical locations. The reports highlight where non-compliance has occurred, 
management’s response to it and the corrective action taken by them. The reports also highlight any potential/new regulatory controls that may affect  
the Group’s business.

Monitoring Business Risk
The Committee reviews and monitors the approach to risk management and overall risk management arrangements. It reviews the management of 
significant enterprise risks identified within the business.
Following the internal restructure of the business into defined Business Units at the end of 2013, the ERM programme was reviewed and updated during 
2014. The ERM programme aims to cover the key risks facing the Group as a whole and what actions are taken to mitigate these risks. The programme 
incorporates a methodology for identifying risks, rating their impact and tolerance level for those risks, and assigning risk owners to take action to mitigate 
the risks identified. Every quarter, a report is produced by the Chief Risk Officer, supported by RCGT, which states the status of the implementation plan 
used to mitigate identified risks, to highlight those risks that have exceeded their tolerance levels and, every six months, emerging risks are highlighted  
and reviewed.
A Risk Management Committee, comprising of senior management with the Group’s General Counsel acting as Chairman, has been set up. This 
committee monitors business risk and coordinates actions taken within the Group to mitigate those risks and to improve policies and procedures where 
necessary. Minutes of the Risk Management Committee are submitted to each Audit Committee meeting for review.
The Committee continues to monitor the effectiveness of the internal audit, risk and compliance functions by demanding the highest levels of performance 
and accountability from those responsible and who report in to Committee.
External Audit
The Committee considers and recommends the reappointment of the Company’s external auditor and the fees considered appropriate to such 
appointment. Following a review of the auditor’s performance by gathering feedback from senior management, considering the audit scope, planning  
and performance of the lead audit partner and the audit team, audit reporting and communications and added value commensurate to the audit fee,  
the Committee recommends the reappointment of KPMG Audit LLC as the Company’s auditor for 2015.
KPMG Audit LLC has been the external auditor to the Company since 2005. The current Audit Partner was appointed in 2012.
Both the Board and external auditors have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditor’s objectivity and independence could be 
compromised. The Group’s policy in respect of services provided by the external auditors is as follows:
• 	 	 audit 	 r elated 	 services 	 – 	 the 	 external 	 auditors 	 ar e 	 invited 	 to 	 pr ovide 	 services 	 which, 	 in 	 their 	 position 	 as 	 auditors, 	 they 	 must 	 be 	 or 	 ar e 	 best 	 placed 	 to	
undertake;
• 	 	 tax 	 consulting 	 – 	 in 	 cases 	 wher e 	 they 	 ar e 	 best 	 suited, 	 the 	 external 	 auditors 	 ar e 	 used. 	 All 	 other 	 tax 	 consulting 	 work 	 is 	 put 	 out 	 to 	 tender . 	 Since 	 2011,	 
the Group has used Deloitte to provide international tax advice;
• 	 	 due 	 diligence 	 for 	 acquisitions 	 – 	 in 	 cases 	 wher e 	 they 	 ar e 	 best 	 suited, 	 the 	 external 	 auditors 	 ar e 	 used, 	 however 	 for 	 the 	 most 	 r ecent 	 acquisitions 	 over 	 the	
last two years, the Group has used Deloitte to undertake the due diligence work; and
• 	 	 general 	 consulting 	 – 	 in 	 r ecognition 	 of 	 public 	 concerns 	 over 	 the 	 ef fect 	 of 	 consulting 	 services 	 on 	 auditors’ 	 independence, 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 policy 	 is 	 that 	 the	
external auditors are not invited to tender for general consulting work.
The external auditor met separately with the Committee twice during the year without the presence of Executive Management. The external auditor also 
has access to the Chairman of the Committee and meets with him, between meetings, where necessary.
The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year ended 31 December 2014 appears in Note 31 to the accounts.

Appointment of new Chief Financial Officer
At the end of 2014, the recruitment process for a new Chief Financial Officer was also completed. This process was undertaken with the assistance of 
Odgers following on from their selection for this recruitment by the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel were delegated to work 
with Odgers to produce a suitable shortlist of candidates who would then meet the Board. 
From a list of 20 original candidates put forward by Odgers, seven were shortlisted and interviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel. 
The candidates were from a variety of backgrounds and geographical locations, some with experience of the payments industry and some with public 
company experience. Two strong candidates were then recommended to the Committee as being suitable for meeting with the members of the Board. 
Following those meetings, the Committee recommended to the Board that Brian McArthur-Muscroft be appointed as the new Chief Financial Officer with 
effect from 1 January 2015 which was then acted upon.

ANNUAL REPORT 2014 40
We have audited the financial statements of Optimal Payments plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 which comprise the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Group Statement of Financial Position, the Group Statement of Cash Flows, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Company Statement of Financial Position, the Company Statement of Cash Flows, the Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 15 of the Companies Act 1982. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 26, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of financial 
statements that give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion on, the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
 Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
•	 give 	 a 	 true 	 and 	 fair 	 view 	 of 	 the 	 state 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 and 	 Par ent 	 Company’ s 	 af fairs 	 as 	 at 	 31 	 December 	 2014 	 and 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 pr ofit 	 for 	 the 	 year 	 
then ended;
•	 have 	 been 	 pr operly 	 pr epar ed 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 IFRSs 	 as 	 adopted 	 by 	 the 	 EU; 	 and
•	 have 	 been 	 pr operly 	 pr epar ed 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 the 	 pr ovisions 	 of 	 Companies 	 Acts 	 1931 	 to 	 2004.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 require us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•	 pr oper 	 books 	 of 	 account 	 have 	 not 	 been 	 kept 	 by 	 the 	 Par ent 	 Company 	 and 	 pr oper 	 r eturns 	 adequate 	 for 	 our 	 audit 	 have 	 not 	 been 	 r eceived 	 fr om	
branches not visited by us; or 
•	 the 	 Par ent 	 Company’ s 	 statement 	 of 	 financial 	 position 	 and 	 statement 	 of 	 compr ehensive 	 income 	 ar e 	 not 	 in 	 agr eement 	 with 	 the 	 books 	 of 	 account 	 
and returns; or 
•	 certain 	 disclosur es 	 of 	 dir ectors’ 	 r emuneration 	 specified 	 by 	 law 	 ar e 	 not 	 made; 	 or

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
NETELLER plc was a private company incorporated under the laws of the Isle of Man (“IOM”) on 31 October 2003 and was registered as a public 
company on 1 April 2004. NETELLER plc changed its name to NEOVIA Financial Plc on 17 November 2008. On 1 March 2011 NEOVIA Financial Plc 
changed its name to Optimal Payments Plc (the “Company”). The principal activities of the Company and the Group are described in Note 2. The Group 
includes the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries as set out under “Basis of consolidation” in Note 4 and “Investment in subsidiaries” in Note 28. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group had 712 employees (2013: 516 employees).
2. NATURE OF OPERATIONS
The Group provides services to businesses and individuals to allow the processing of direct debit, electronic cheque and credit card payments.  
The Group processes direct debit, electronic cheque and credit card payments, principally for internet Merchants. Optimal Payments Limited, a  
wholly-owned subsidiary of Optimal Payments Plc, is authorised by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority under the Electronic Money 
Regulations 2011 (FRN:900015) for the issuing of electronic money and payment instruments. Optimal Payments Merchant Services Ltd. is licensed  
by the Financial Supervision Commission of the Isle of Man (Ref. 1357) to carry on money transmission services.
3. BASIS OF PREPARATION
Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable IOM law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the EU and the AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 March 2015. 
Statement of going concern
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board of Directors are satisfied that the Group and parent company 
have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Board have considered a wide range of information 
relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources. 
The Group borrowed $141 million in July 2014 to finance the acquisition of California-based payment processing businesses Meritus Payment Solutions 
and Global Merchant Advisors, Inc. The acquisition of these profitable, fast growing and cash generative businesses is expected to enhance earnings,  
and the Group has demonstrated it has sufficient financial resources in place to meet its new debt requirements.
 
The Group’s principal activities, business and operating models, strategic direction and key and emerging risks are described in the CEO’s Review, 
Business Overview and Business Risk sections. A financial summary, including a review of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and 
consolidated statement of financial position, is provided in the Financial Review section. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
credit, liquidity and market risk along with the Group’s approach to capital management and allocation are described in the Note 27 of the financial 
statements.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities and contingencies at the date of the Group’s financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could 
differ from those estimated. Significant estimates in the Group’s financial statements include depreciation and amortisation, impairment testing of long-
lived assets, share based payments, share consideration payable, and income taxes. By their nature, these estimates and assumptions are subject to 
estimation uncertainty and the effect on the Group’s financial statements of changes in estimates in future periods could be significant.
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, and have been 
applied consistently by Group entities. The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and enterprises controlled by the Company (and its 
subsidiaries) as at the year end. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee 
enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its principal wholly 
owned subsidiaries as identified in Note 28. All inter-company transactions and balances between Group enterprises are eliminated on consolidation.
In the financial statements of the Company, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the Year ended 31 December 2014 Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 50
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
Intangible assets 
Intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life which is assessed to be three to five years. 
Other intangible assets, including customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements that are acquired by the group and have finite useful 
lives are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date (“cost”) and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the intangible asset, which is 3 to five years.
Website and platform development costs are recorded at cost and amortised over their estimated useful life using the declining-balance method at 30%.  
Property, plant & equipment
Land is not depreciated. Property, plant & equipment are recorded at cost and is depreciated over their estimated useful lives, using the declining-balance 
method, on the following basis:
 
 Communication equipment 20%
 Furniture and equipment 20%
 Computer equipment 30%
Other assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
 
 Computer software 2 years
 Building & Leasehold Improvements 4% and 10 years respectively
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and is recognised in income.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that  
are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount  
of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the 
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGU. Subject 
to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that 
the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from synergies of the combination.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on 
a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the 
CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each 
reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in estimates 
used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss has been recognised.
The Group performs impairment tests at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill and intangible assets 
that have indefinite useful lives or are not yet in use carrying values for a business unit may not be recoverable.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of subsidiaries at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables, including receivables from Merchants, are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses and doubtful accounts.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and as other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost depending on 
the purpose for which the financial liabilities were acquired or incurred. Management determines the classification of its financial liabilities at the initial 
recognition. 
Share consideration payable meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 and therefore classified as such. The fair value of share consideration  
is determined through single-factor Monte Carlo valuation model at reporting date. Movements in fair value at any one reporting date are measured 
through profit and loss.
The Group’s other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise ‘trade and other payables’ and ‘Long term-debt’ in the balance sheet. 
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Long-term debt are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the 
period of the Long-term debt using the effective interest method. Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the statement  
of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method.
Trade and other payables and Long-term debt are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as  
non-current liabilities.
Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except 
to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group uses the balance sheet liability method of accounting for income taxes. Temporary differences arising from the difference between the tax basis 
of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance sheet are used to calculate deferred tax assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are calculated using tax rates anticipated to exist in the periods that the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on the laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend 
to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including 
revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed 
regularly by the Group’s CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete 
financial information is available.  Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 52
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Revenue recognition
The Group is involved in transaction processing services. Revenues from transaction processing services are recognised at the time services are rendered. 
Member revenue is recognised either as a fee calculated as a percentage of funds processed or as a charge per transaction, pursuant to the respective 
Member agreements. Merchant revenue is recognised as a fee calculated as a percentage of funds processed or as a charge per transaction on behalf of 
Merchants.
Interest income is accrued on a monthly basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
The Company renders services to various subsidiaries within the Group including Franchise Rights and Platform Service Fees. Revenue from rendering  
of services is recognised in profit or loss at the time the services are rendered.
Leases
(i)  Leased assets 
 Assets held by the Group under leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. 
 Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position.
(ii)  Lease payments 
 Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
 Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance  
of the liability.
Foreign exchange
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates  
(its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in US 
dollars, which is the functional currency of Optimal Payments Plc, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) 
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for 
the period, except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. 
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations (including comparatives) are 
expressed in United States dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange  
rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and 
translated at the closing rate.
Related party transactions 
Monetary related party transactions in the normal course of operations are recorded at fair value, and transactions between related parties, not in the 
normal course of operations, are recorded at the carrying value as recorded by the transferor.
Foreign exchange contracts
The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These financial instruments are 
presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair value. Fair values are based on market quotes, current foreign exchange rates  
or management estimates, as appropriate, and gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the consolidated income statement. 
The increase or decrease in the fair value of the contracts has been taken to income.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Research and development
Research expenditure is written off to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is written off in the same way unless management is satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of the 
individual projects generating future economic benefits, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell 
the asset. In this situation, the expenditure is capitalised at cost, less a provision for any impairment in value, and is amortised on the commencement of 
use over the period in which benefits are expected to be received by the Group. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour 
and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.
Share-based payments
The Company issues share options to certain employees, including Directors. Equity-settled share options are measured at fair value at the date of 
grant. In valuing equity-settled share options, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the 
Company (market conditions). 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share option is expensed over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled share options at each reporting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest 
(or in the case of a market condition, be treated as vesting). The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the 
income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market vesting condition or a non-
vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the condition is satisfied, provided that all other non-market vesting conditions 
are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified. An 
additional expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of the modification, based on the difference 
between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income 
statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is 
deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are set off and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group has a legal 
enforceable right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Gross settlement is equivalent to net settlement if and only if the gross settlement mechanism has features that eliminate or result in insignificant credit and 
liquidity risk and processes receivables and payables in a single settlement cycle.
The balances owing to the Members and merchants and the related cash balances segregated in the members and merchant’s accounts are presented 
net in the statement of financial position as the Company considered these gross settlement as equivalent to net settlement in accordance with IAS 32.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted by the accounting standards, or for gains and losses arising from a group of 
similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity.
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own 
shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held and for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise convertible notes and share 
options granted to employees.
Application of new and revised accounting policies
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and a new Interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2014.
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities
The amendments to IFRS 10 define an investment entity and require a reporting entity that meets the definition of an investment entity not to consolidate 
its subsidiaries but instead to measure its subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss in its consolidated and separate financial statements. 
Consequential amendments have been made to IFRS 12 and IAS 27 to introduce new disclosure requirements for investment entities. As the Company is 
not an investment entity (assessed based on the criteria set out in IFRS 10 as at 1 January 2014), the application of the amendments has had no impact 
on the disclosures or the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 54
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Application of new and revised accounting policies (continued)
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The Group has applied the amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for the first time in the current year. The amendments 
to IAS 32 clarify the requirements relating to the offset of financial assets and financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments clarify the meaning of 
‘currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off’ and ‘simultaneous realisation and settlement’. The Group has assessed whether certain of its financial 
assets and financial liabilities qualify for offset based on the criteria set out in the amendments and concluded that the application of the amendments has 
had no impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements other than consistency of accounting policy application for 
restricted members cash and amounts owing to members as disclosed in Note 6.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
The Group has applied the amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets for the first time in the current year. The 
amendments to IAS 36 remove the requirement to disclose the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill or other intangible 
assets with indefinite useful lives had been allocated when there has been no impairment or reversal of impairment of the related CGU. Furthermore, the 
amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements applicable to when the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is measured at fair value 
less costs of disposal. These new disclosures include the fair value hierarchy, key assumptions and valuation techniques used which are in line with the 
disclosure required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements.
The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
The amendments to IAS 39 provide relief from the requirement to discontinue hedge accounting when a derivative designated as a hedging instrument is 
novated under certain circumstances. The amendments also clarify that any change to the fair value of the derivative designated as a hedging instrument 
arising from the novation should be included in the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness. As the Group does not have any derivatives 
that are subject to novation, the application of these amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.
Future changes to accounting standards
The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The IASB issued IFRS 9 in November 2009, introducing new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 was 
subsequently amended in October 2010 to include requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition, and 
in November 2013 to include the new requirements for general hedge accounting. Another revised version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014 mainly to 
include a) impairment requirements for financial assets and b) limited amendments to the classification and measurement requirements by introducing a 
‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ (FVTOCI) measurement category for certain simple debt instruments. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 until the Group undertakes a detailed review.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, IFRS 15 was issued which establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with 
customers. IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related 
Interpretations when it becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should 
recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, the Standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition: 
•	 Step 	 1: 	 Identify 	 the 	 contract(s) 	 with 	 a 	 customer
•	 Step 	 2: 	 Identify 	 the 	 performance 	 obligations 	 in 	 the 	 contract
•	 Step 	 3: 	 Determine 	 the 	 transaction 	 price
•	 Step 	 4: 	 Allocate 	 the 	 transaction 	 price 	 to 	 the 	 performance 	 obligations 	 in 	 the 	 contract
•	 Step 	 5: 	 Recognise 	 r evenue 	 when 	 (or 	 as) 	 the 	 entity 	 satisfies 	 a 	 performance 	 obligation
Extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 15. The directors of the Group do not anticipate that the application of IFRS 15 in the future will have a material 
impact on the amounts reported and disclosures made in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. However, it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 15 until the Group performs a detailed review.

Future changes to accounting standards (continued)
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
The amendments to IFRS 11 provide guidance on how to account for the acquisition of a joint operation that constitutes a business as defined in IFRS 3 
Business Combinations. Specifically, the amendments state that the relevant principles on accounting for business combinations in IFRS 3 and other 
standards (e.g. IAS 36 Impairment of Assets regarding impairment testing of a cash generating unit to which goodwill on acquisition of a joint operation has 
been allocated) should be applied. The same requirements should be applied to the formation of a joint operation if and only if an existing business is 
contributed to the joint operation by one of the parties that participate in the joint operation.
A joint operator is also required to disclose the relevant information required by IFRS 3 and other standards for business combinations.
The amendments to IFRS 11 apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The directors of the Group do not anticipate that 
the application of these amendments to IFRS 11 will have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets
The amendments to IAS 16 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment. The amendments 
to IAS 38 introduce a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis for amortisation of an intangible asset. The amendments apply 
prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Currently, the Group uses the declining balance method for depreciation for its 
property, plant and equipment, and declining balance and straight line methods for amortisation for its intangible assets. The directors of the Group believe 
that these methods are the most appropriate method to reflect the consumption of economic benefits inherent in the respective assets and accordingly, 
the directors of the Group do not anticipate that the application of these amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 will have a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.
5. RESTRICTED NETELLER MERCHANT CASH 
The Group maintains bank accounts with the Group’s principal bankers which are segregated from operating funds and which contain funds held on 
behalf of Merchants, representing pooled Merchant funds. Balances in the segregated accounts are maintained at a sufficient level to fully offset amounts 
owing to the Group’s Merchants. A legal right of offset exists between the balances owing to the Merchants and the cash balances segregated in the 
client accounts. As such, only the net balance of surplus cash is disclosed on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as Restricted NETELLER 
merchant cash.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had the following balances:

Restricted NETELLER Merchant Cash 2,232,596 1,635,858
6. RESTRICTED NETELLER MEMBER CASH 
In compliance with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules and regulations, the Group holds Qualifying Liquid Assets at least equal to the amounts  
owing to Members. These amounts are maintained in accounts which are segregated from operating funds. As a legal right of offset exists between the 
balances owing to the Members and the cash balances segregated in the member accounts, the prior year presentation in the Consolidated Statement  
of Financial Position has been updated and only the net balance of surplus cash is disclosed on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as 
Restricted NETELLER Member cash.
At 31 December 2014, The Group had the following balances:

Restricted NETELLER Member Cash 6,543,680 4,561,566
Prior year presentation has been updated to conform to current year presentation and classification where appropriate. The effect of the change in 
presentation from the prior year has resulted in a decrease in current liabilities and current assets respectively to the amount of $123,412,531 on the  
face of the Statement of Financial Position. The Presentation and disclosure per the Statement of Cash flows has been updated accordingly. Optimal Payments Plc

Carrying amount 
As at 31 December 2014 205,339,002
The Group performs goodwill asset impairment tests at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill carrying 
value for a business unit might not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates and EBITDA growth rate. The values assigned to the key assumptions 
represented management’s assessment of future trends in the e-commerce industry impacting the NETBANX straight-through processing business and  
were based on both external and internal sources (historical data). The key assumptions were as follows, and reflect a weighted average of this CGU 
comprising the respective operating divisions: 
 Y ear ended Year ended

Weighted average (in percent) $ $
Discount rate 5% 8%
Terminal value growth rate 1.35% 1.35%
Budgeted EBITDA growth rate (average 5 years) 5% 5%
The discount rate is an estimate based on past experience and the expected average weighted average cost of capital.
Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model. A long-term growth rate into perpetuity was determined based on  
management’s estimate of the terminal value growth rate in EBITDA, which management believed was consistent with the assumption that a market 
participant would make. Budgeted EBITDA was based on expectation of future outcomes taking into account past experiences.

NETBANX Merchant processing liabilities 44,591,159 76,792,100

Payroll liabilities 2,962,874 1,824,768
 67 ,328,017 100,763,462
NETBANX Merchant processing liabilities arise from the operations of the NETBANX division totaling $44,591,159 (2013: $76,792,100). In addition,  
included in cash and cash equivalents is an equivalent transient cash balance that relates to Merchant transactions processed via the straight-through 
processing operations. The operations do not fall within the EU definition of “e-money” nor does a legal right of offset exist between this cash and the 
corresponding NETBANX Merchant liabilities. 
11. LOYAL TY PROGRAM
The Group launched the NETELLER Reward Points Program (the “Program”) in February 2012. The Program allows members to earn points on their 
transactions in the NETELLER eWallet accounts. Members can redeem these points for merchandise, cash exchange, and other NETELLER provided 
services. 
When points are earned by Members, the Group establishes a liability for future redemptions by multiplying the number of points issued by the estimated 
cost per point. The actual cost of merchandise redemptions is applied against this liability. The expense has been included in Marketing and promotions.
The estimated cost per point is determined based on many factors, primarily related to expected future redemption patterns and associated costs.  
The Group monitors, on an ongoing basis, trends in redemption rates and net cost per point redeemed. Adjustments to the estimated cost per point  
are made based upon expected future Program activities.
Any variance in the cost per point is recognised in marketing and promotions expenses in the Group’s consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The liability account is adjusted based on the outstanding balance of points issued on a monthly basis. The Company continues to evaluate and revise 
certain assumptions used to calculate the Program liability, based on redemption experience and expected future activities.
12. PROVISION FOR LOSSES ON NETBANX MERCHANT ACCOUNTS
In certain cases, transactions may be charged back to merchants, which mean the transaction amount is refunded to the consumer and, in certain 
instances, charged to the merchant. If the merchant has insufficient funds, the Group must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction. 
Management evaluates the risk for such transactions and estimates the loss for the disputed transactions based primarily on historical experience and 
other relevant factors. A provision is maintained for merchant losses in order to absorb charge backs and other losses for merchant transactions that 
have been previously processed and on which revenue has been recorded. Management analyses and regularly reviews the adequacy of its provision 
for merchant losses. The provision for merchant losses comprises specifically identifiable provisions for merchant transactions for which losses can be 
estimated based on historical experience.
The net charge for the provision for merchant losses is included under the caption Straight Through Processing expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income and can be reconciled as follows:

13. TAX
The Company is incorporated in the IOM and is subject to a tax rate of zero percent. No provision for IOM taxation is therefore required. Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

A total liability of approximately $4.8 million remains outstanding as at 31 December 2014 in relation to an ongoing investigation by the Canadian Revenue 
Agency (“CRA”) regarding Canadian withholding taxes which are deemed to have arisen on the relocation of assets to the Isle of Man from Canada in the 
2004 and 2005 taxation years. This liability represents management’s estimate of the maximum amount the Group is likely to be required to pay in respect  
of such withholding taxes and interest.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of carryforward tax losses amounting to approximately $1,714,000 (2013: $4,000,000) in certain 
companies within the Group since it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom.
14. SHAREHOLDER LOANS
Two shareholders, Aurum Nominees Ltd and IIU Nominees Ltd, gave notice to the Company that they each wished to convert the shareholder loans 
amounting to $9,525,814 (including accrued interest) into ordinary shares pursuant to the loan agreement. As a result, in January 2014, the Company 
issued 4,348,503 and 4,330,406 Ordinary Shares to Aurum Nominees Ltd. and IIU Nominees Ltd. respectively.
On 24 January 2014, following the conversion of the shareholder loans into ordinary shares, the Company completed a placing of 44,634,535 ordinary 
shares to 72 institutions which resulted in the sale of all of the shares of the Company’s largest shareholder; IIU Nominees Ltd. Optimal Payments Plc

On 23 July 2014, the Group amended its $9 million credit facility which consisted of letters of guarantee to a $150 million Credit Facility consisting of a 
$100 million term facility and a $50 million revolving facility. The term facility bears interest at US prime rate plus a premium varying from 0.25% to 1.50% 
or at a LIBO rate plus a premium varying from 1.75% to 3.00%, matures on 23 July 2017, and is repayable in quarterly instalments of $5 million starting 
in September 2014 up to the maturity date. The revolving facility can be used for the financing of a portion of the permitted acquisitions in a maximum 
amount of $41 million and general corporate purposes including the issuance of letters of credit. The revolving facility has no specified terms of repayment 
and it bears interest and matures on the same basis as the term facility. Amounts of $100 million and $41 million were drawn down from the term facility 
and revolving facility, respectively, on 23 July 2014 in order to fund the Meritus and GMA acquisitions (see Note 16). Principal repayments have amounted 
to $10 million and $4 million on the term facility and revolving facility, respectively, as at 31 December 2014. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group has approximately $9 million outstanding in issued letters of guarantee in relation to various performance bonds 
drawn from the revolving facility.
Under the terms of the loan agreement, the Group must satisfy certain restrictive covenants including minimum financial ratios. These restrictions are 
composed of ratios of funded debt to EBITDA, funded debt to capitalisation and fixed charge coverage ratio. EBITDA, a non IFRS measure, is defined in 
the Credit Facility on a consolidated basis, as total comprehensive profit attributable to the owners of the Group before interest expense, income taxes, 
depreciation, amortisation, gains or losses from asset dispositions, gains or losses from extraordinary items and non-recurring transaction costs related to 
the acquisition of Meritus and GMA, non-cash share option expenses and gains or losses relative to foreign exchange or derivative instruments, plus (or 
minus) the historical EBITDA of any businesses acquired (or sold) during the reporting period. As at 31 December 2014, all debt covenant requirements 
and exemptions have been respected.
16. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
On 23 July 2014, Optimal Payments Plc, through its subsidiaries, NBX Services Corp and NetBX Services LLC acquired all of the partnership interests of 
TK Global Partners L.P . (doing business as Meritus Payment Solutions or “Meritus”), a California based payment processing entity. The total consideration 
agreed upon of $210 million on the closing date consists of $150 million in cash and $60 million of Optimal Payment shares and/or cash to be issued 
in equal tranches over four years commencing on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to customary closing adjustments (“Deferred 
consideration”). Concurrent with the execution of the Meritus purchase agreement, NBX Services Corp. (“the Buyer”) bought all the outstanding limited  
and general partnership interest of Meritus ( “the Seller”) in Global Merchant Advisors, Inc (“GMA”), a US based online payments company.
 
On the same date, NETBX Services LLC acquired the trade and assets of GMA for $15 million in cash, $10 million of which was paid at closing date and 
the balance of $5 million to be paid based on future performance of the business (“Contingent consideration”). 
Acquisition of these profitable, fast growing and cash generative businesses is expected to enhance earnings by significantly accelerating Optimal 
Payments’ expansion into the rapidly expanding US ecommerce market by providing it with a diversified merchant client base; a highly agile multi-channel 
sales force operating in complimentary and new vertical markets; and partnerships with leading US acquiring banks. 
 
The acquisitions will also allow Optimal Payments to offer Meritus’ and GMA clients access to its global network and the ability to more easily sell products 
and services online virtually anywhere in the world. Similarly, Optimal Payments’ international clients will gain greater access to the US market.

determined using a single-factor Monte Carlo valuation model. As at 31 December 2014, fair value of the share consideration payable is $57,290,000 of which $14,322,500 represents the 1st tranche 
payable in July 2015. The Group recognised the movement in fair value of $18,800,000 as Net fair value gain on share consideration payable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.  
b  On 23 July 2015, the Group shall make a cash payment to the Seller in an aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000 should GMA meet certain performance targets as prescribed in the Purchase 
Agreement. As the minimum performance target was met as at 31 December 2014, the fair value of the contingent consideration is valued at $5,000,000.
c  The goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes (see Note 9)
Meritus and GMA revenues of $45 million and net earnings incurred of $8.9 million are included in the consolidated income statement from the date  
of acquisition. The Group’s consolidated revenues and net earnings for the year ended 31 December 2014 would have included $100.6 million and  
$21.7 million, respectively, had the Meritus and GMA acquisitions occurred on 1 January 2014.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $7,600,000 to 31 December 2014 which were expensed in the period relating to these 
transactions. Optimal Payments Plc

21. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Company adopted the unapproved equity-settled share option plan (“ESOS”) pursuant to a resolution passed on 7 April 2004 and amended by the 
Board on 15 September 2008. The 2008 amendment included the addition of a new ‘approved’ plan for UK based employees. Under the ‘approved’ and 
‘unapproved’ plans, the Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to eligible employees including directors of Group companies  
to subscribe for ordinary shares of the Company.
No consideration is payable on the grant of an option. Options may generally be exercised to the extent that they have vested. Options vest according to 
the relevant schedule over the grant period following the date of grant. The exercise price is determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, and 
shall not be less than the average quoted market price of the Company shares on the three days prior to the date of grant. Subject to the discretion of the 
Board share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The ESOS options granted vest on the third anniversary of the 
date of grant and lapse a further six months after vesting.
The Company also adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) which took effect from 1 January 2010. These LTIP options vest in one tranche based 
on future performance related to EBITDA targets determined each year and subject to continued employment over the remaining vesting period. Vested 
options lapse on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. On July 9, 2014, the board granted 3,000,000 “special” LTIP options which vest in three 
tranches based on future performance related to share price targets.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group recognised total expenses of $8,274,348 (2013: $4,511,983) related to share-based payments 
transactions which are included in salaries and employee expenses.

was £4.33 (2013: £2.35).
Assumptions used in ESOS and LTIP options pricing model
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model that takes into account factors specific to this 
plan, such as the expected life and vesting period. The following table shows the principal assumptions used in the valuation:
 Y ear ended Year ended
 31 December 31 December
 2014 2013
Weighted average exercise price £3.35 £1.21
Expected volatility 40.0% 36.5%
Expected life 3.25 years 3.25 years
Risk free interest rate 0.92% 0.63%
Dividend yield 0% —
Weighted average fair value per option granted £1.00 £0.31
The fair value of the “special” options granted under the LTIP was determined using a bespoke Monte Carlo pricing model that takes into account the 
market-based performance conditions specific to this plan. The following table shows the principal assumptions used in the valuation:
 Y ear ended Year ended
 31 December 31 December
 2014 2013
Weighted average exercise price £0.00 —
Expected volatility 41.9% —
Expected life 2.31 years —
Risk free interest rate 1.20% —
Dividend yield 0% —
Weighted average fair value per option granted £3.49  —
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price from the time of issue to the date of grant.
Due to the nominal exercise price of the LTIP options and that option holders are entitled to receive a benefit by reference to the value of dividends that 
would have been paid on vested shares during the vesting period, the regular options granted under the 2014 LTIP were valued based on the share price 
at the date of grant. The weighted average fair value per option granted for the year ended 31 December 2014 based on share price at the date of grant 
was £3.58 (31 December 2013: £1.19). Optimal Payments Plc

22. OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Group has two operating segments as disclosed below. For each of the segments, the Group’s CEO reviews internal management reports on at least 
a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. 
NETELLER: fees are generated on transactions between Members and Merchants using the NETELLER service and Net+ prepaid cards. 
NETBANX: fees are generated through the NETBANX and NETBANX Asia straight-through processing platforms where customers send money directly  
to Merchants.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below.

Variable margin percentage 84% 42% 52%
Processing costs and bad debt are the only two costs which vary directly with revenue, and accordingly have been shown separately as variable costs.  
For 2014, variable costs for NETELLER and NETBANX were 15% (2013: 16%) and 59% (2013: 58%) of revenue respectively.
Net assets have not been presented in the segmented information since significant assets and resources throughout the Group serve both reporting 
segments and would not reasonably be allocable between the two.
The amounts reported are based on the financial information used to produce the consolidated financial statements.
Major Merchants
The Group has one Merchant who represents 36.7% (2013: 41.4%) of total fee revenue across all reportable segments and geographies. The majority  
of this revenue comes from Asia. 
23. MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS
Total marketing and promotions including advertising costs for the year were $15,194,281 (2013: $7,950,375). These consisted of targeted NETELLER

ANNUAL REPORT 2014 72
27 . FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted NETELLER Merchant cash, restricted NETELLER Member cash, trade and other 
receivables, and trade and other payables. All financial instruments are classified as held for trading except for accounts receivable and accounts payable 
which are classified as loans and receivables.
i) Fair values
The Group estimates the fair value of its financial instruments based on current interest rates, market value and pricing of financial instruments with 
comparable terms.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted NETELLER Merchant cash, restricted NETELLER Member cash, trade and other receivables,  
and trade and other payables approximate the carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The fair value of the obligations under finance lease as at 31 December 2014 has been established by discounting the future cash flows using interest 
rates corresponding to those which the Group would currently be able to obtain for leases with similar maturity dates and terms.
The fair value of the of the shareholder loans has not been prepared as fair value cannot be measured reliably as there is no market for such instruments.
ii) Credit risk and concentrations
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a member or merchant counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted NETELLER merchant cash, restricted NETELLER member cash, and trade 
and other receivables. The cash and cash equivalents, restricted NETELLER merchant cash and restricted NETELLER member cash are deposited with 
major financial institutions which the Group’s management believes to be financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risks exist with respect to  
these assets. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that its members and merchants may charge back credit card purchases. The Group manages the 
exposure to credit risk by employing various online identification verification techniques, enacted transaction limits and having a significant number of 
members and merchants. As these members are geographically widespread and the merchants are active in various industries, the exposure to credit  
risk and concentration is mitigated. 
As at the reporting date, the maximum credit exposure of the Group’s financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following:

iii) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that investment revenue earned on cash and cash equivalents, client account funds, and restricted 
NETELLER member cash and interest expense incurred on debt owing are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. The Group’s exposure to interest rate 
risk is limited as investments are held in liquid and short-term funds. A sensitivity analysis has been performed wherein 1% increase in interest rates offered 
would result in a $2,613,188 (2013: $3,309,654) favourable impact on net earnings while a 1% decrease would result in a $688,377 (2013: 540,811) 
unfavourable impact on net earnings.
iv) Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk due to financial assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, primarily the 
Great Britain Pound (“GBP”), the EURO (“EUR”), the Canadian dollar (“CAD”), and the Hong Kong Dollar (“HKD”). The Group manages the exposure to 
currency risk by commercially transacting in US dollars and by limiting the use of other currencies for operating expenses, wherever possible, thereby 
minimising the realised and unrealised foreign exchange gain/(loss). Where limited exposures exist, these are managed through entering into forward 
foreign exchange contracts as appropriate (Note 3). 
The Group’s exposure as at the reporting date was as follows:

As at 31 December 2014, had the US Dollar strengthened by 1% in relation to all the other currencies, with all other variables held constant, the net assets 
of the Group would have been decreased in both profit and equity by US $470,618 (2013: $364,119). A weakening of the US Dollar by 1% against the 
above currencies would have had an equal and opposite effect.
v) Market segment risk
Market segment risk may arise due to adverse changes in legislation relating to internet, payment processing or on-line gambling. The Group is exposed 
to market segment risk to the extent that legislation impacts operational presence and related revenue streams, which may be significant. The Group 
manages this exposure through geographical diversification and participation in non gambling sources of revenue. The Group closely monitors local 
legislation in key markets (new or existing) and does not have economic reliance on any one country. Optimal Payments Plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 74
27 . FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
vi) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Management controls and monitors the Group’s cash 
flow on a regular basis, including forecasting future cash flows. The Group’s objective to managing liquidity is to ensure that, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet the liabilities when they become due. 
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments:

Total 54,920,320 48,878,493 9,529,915 800,643
vii) Risk management assets and liabilities
Risks are identified, evaluated and mitigated through a combination of a “top down” approach driven by both the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. 
These are aggregated into a Risk Management framework where the risks are prioritised and assigned to the executive for monitoring and risk mitigation. 
The Group Internal Audit function undertakes regular reviews of the controls that are in place to mitigate risk. The Group enters into financial instruments 
through forward currency contracts that fix the net asset or liability position for significant currencies held on the Statement of Financial Position.
viii) Capital disclosure
The Group’s capital structure is comprised of shareholders’ equity, deferred and contingent consideration as well as secured credit facilities as required 
to fund business and asset acquisitions. The Group’s objective when managing its capital structure is to finance internally generated growth and maintain 
financial flexibility including access to capital markets. To manage its capital structure the Group may adjust capital spending, issue new shares, or acquire 
short-term financing.

ix) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern, while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings 
as disclosed in Note 15, and equity attributable to owners of the parent, comprising reserves and retained earnings as disclosed. The board reviews 
the capital structure and as part of this review, considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. In addition the board of 
directors considers the liquidity and solvency of the Group on an ongoing basis. The primarily measure used by the Group to monitor its financial leverage 
is its ratio of net debt to equity. The net-debt-to equity ratios as at 31 December 2014 are as follows:

From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of the claims and actions  
and no provision or disclosure is made where the Directors feel, based on that advice, the action is unlikely to result in a material loss or a sufficiently  
reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made. 
As at 31 December 2014, NetBanx Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, has net current liabilities. Optimal Payments Plc will continue to provide financial 
support to enable NetBanx Limited to meet its existing and future liabilities and continue as a going concern.  Optimal Payments Plc

30. EBITDA 
EBITDA is defined as results of operating activities before depreciation and amortisation and exceptional non-recurring items which are defined as items of 
income and expense of such size, nature or incidence, that in the view of management their disclosure is relevant to explain the performance of the Group 
for the period.
EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The presentation on these financial measures may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to the differences in the ways the measures are calculated.

Share fraud warning
Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of the blue and offered shares that often turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or an  
inflated price for shares they own. These calls come from fraudsters operating in ‘boiler rooms’ that are mostly based abroad. While high profits are 
promised, those who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has found most share fraud victims  
are experienced investors who lose an average of £20,000, with around £200 million lost in the UK each year.
REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

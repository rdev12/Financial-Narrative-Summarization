In Italy, 888 offers Casino and, as of 
Q1 2016, Sport on mobile and desktop

and offline marketing campaigns.

ONLINE GAMING IS A GLOBAL 
GROWTH MARKET
The global online gaming industry is fast-growing and dynamic, 
supported by technological developments and government regulation.
The online gaming industry has 
experienced rapid growth since its 
inception during the mid-1990s and 
continues to demonstrate strong 
growth fundamentals. This is supported 
by product innovation, customers’ 
ever greater access to high-speed 
and reliable internet connections, 
the popularity of smart mobile devices, 
and  government regulation. 
With the growth of online gaming, 
many governments have adopted 
and are continuing to adopt specific 
regulatory frameworks for the industry 
and 888 remains focused on growing 
in sustainable, regulated markets. 
Whilst new regulation increases 
duties and costs for operators, it 
also creates opportunities for brands 
with scale, proprietary technology 
and a marketing edge to access new 
customers in new markets and grow.

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am delighted to update our stakeholders 
on what has been another outstanding 
year for 888. Our strong financial results 
for the year have been underpinned by 
significant progress against our strategic 
objectives. As you will read in more detail 
throughout this year’s Annual Report, 
888’s success in 2016 was characterised 
by continued investment in our technology 
leadership; successful further expansion 
in regulated markets; and standout 
performances in Casino and Sport. 
RESULTS 
2016 was another very busy year at 
888 and, testament to the skill and 
entrepreneurial spirit of our exceptional 
team, our operational performance was 
stronger than ever. This resulted in the 
Group delivering revenue growth of 13% 
to US$520.8 million (2015: US$462.1 
million) despite significant adverse 
currency movements impacting our 
reported results. At constant currency 
revenue increased impressively by 18% 
to US$546.4 million.
Our core B2C business continued to grow, 
with a 5% increase in active customers, 
driven primarily by outstanding results 
in Casino and Sport, growth in regulated 
markets and by our offer on mobile 
devices, which expanded to represent 
60% of B2C revenue in the UK (2015: 
47%). As a result, total B2C revenue was 
US$460.2 million, representing a 15% uplift 
on the prior year (2015: US$399.4 million) 
or a 20% increase at constant currency to 
US$479.9 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 12% to 
US$90.2 million (2015: US$80.6 million) 
which represented 24% growth at 
constant currency to US$100 million 
and profit before tax was 82% higher at 
US$59.2 million (2015: US$32.5 million). 
The Group remains highly cash generative 
with net cash generated from operating 
activities of US$68.1 million (2015: 
US$85.0 million).
Given the continuing strong financial 
performance of the Group and the Board’s 
confidence in the outlook, the Board of 
Directors is recommending a final dividend 
of 5.1¢ per share in accordance with 888’s 
dividend policy, plus an additional one-
off 10.5¢ per share bringing the total for 
the year to 19.4¢ per share (2015: 15.5¢ 
per share).
STRATEGIC PROGRESS
The Board believes that 888’s proprietary 
online gaming technology is second to 
none. This strength, coupled with the 
Group’s business analytics, customer 
relationship management and marketing 
expertise, continues to provide the 
foundation for 888’s competitive 
advantages. In such a dynamic and rapidly 
developing industry, continually investing 
in and developing our own world class 
technology means that we are able to 
be nimble in relation to opportunities, 
respond to regulatory developments 
and create new, engaging and — above 
all — safe and secure entertainment for 
our customers. 
In 2016 we delivered further successful 
expansion across regulated markets 
where we are able to leverage the Group’s 
full marketing expertise to develop the 
888 brands. We continued to make 
outstanding progress in the UK; Spain, 
which is now our second largest market; 
Italy, where we are benefitting from the 
introduction of Sport in the first quarter 
of the year; and Denmark, where we 
successfully launched in the second 
half of 2015 with a full suite of products 
and brands. Revenue from regulated 
markets increased to represent 61% of 
Group revenue (2015: 59%), significantly 
outpacing growth from unregulated  
“dot.com” markets. 
Our values place the community  
and the customer at the centre  
of all our endeavours.

STRONG GROWTH ACROSS 
A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
07
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
The Group continues to monitor and 
plan for potential implications from the 
UK’s decision to leave the European 
Union. However, we do not anticipate 
significant impact on our operations. Since 
the ”Brexit” vote Sterling has devalued 
compared to the US$ and, as the Group 
has adopted the US$ as its reporting 
currency, our reported financials have 
consequently been impacted. 
Trading during the financial year to 
date has been in line with the Board’s 
expectations with average daily 
revenue more than 11% above the 
previous year at constant currency.
888 is an increasingly diversified operator 
with the majority of its income now 
generated from regulated markets. 
The Group has significant further 
growth opportunities across its existing 
geographies, platforms and product 
verticals and will continue to evaluate and 
explore new avenues for growth. Into 2017 
and beyond 888’s focus will remain as 
resolute as ever on delivering a truly 
satisfying experience for our customers, 
thereby delivering strong, sustainable long 
term earnings growth for our shareholders.
BRIAN MATTINGLEY
Chairman
21 March 2017
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
The Board had previously identified 
sports betting as a major opportunity 
for the Group. In 2016, a major focus was 
on driving growth in Sport, which we are 
for the first time in our Annual Results 
reporting as a standalone product vertical. 
During the year we significantly increased 
investment behind marketing the 888sport 
brand and enjoyed a very successful 
European Football Championships in the 
summer, which demonstrated our ability to 
effectively compete during major sporting 
events. As a result, Sport customers 
increased by 49% and revenue increased 
by 49% to US$51.9 million (2015: 
US$34.8 million). In 2017, the Group will 
continue to invest behind delivering the 
exciting further opportunities for Sport 
both in terms of revenue growth and 
efficient customer acquisition. 
888’s success in Sport is just 
one example of the Group’s 
ability to identify new 
growth opportunities and 
successfully deliver them.
In addition to our organic growth plans, 
M&A remains a part of the Group’s 
strategic agenda and, with 888 in great 
health, it is an area that we are able to 
evaluate from a position of strength. 888 
has significant organic growth potential 
and — where M&A might complement this 
— we will continue to evaluate and explore 
appropriate opportunities.
888’S WINNING TEAM
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank each and 
every one of my colleagues at 888 for 
their commitment during the year. 
2016 was a very busy year for the Group 
and the success we have been able to 
deliver under 10 licences across regulated 
markets, four major product verticals 
and both B2C and B2B divisions speaks 
volumes for the strength in depth of our 
people throughout 888. I am confident 
that their skill and dedication will ensure 
888 remains at the forefront of the online 
gaming industry for years to come. 
I would also like to thank Amos Pickel, 
who has served on the 888 Board as a 
Non-executive Director and as a Chairman 
and member of Board Committees since 
2006, and who does not intend to offer 
himself for re-election at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting. Amos has brought a 
wealth of experience and knowledge to 
the Board, and we wish him well in his 
future endeavours.
The Board is fully committed to complying 
with the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. You can find the 
required regulatory and governance 
disclosures throughout this report and in 
the compliance statement on page 48.
OUTLOOK 
The global online gaming market is 
dynamic and will continue to grow driven 
by technology developments, the opening 
up of new marketing channels and 
further regulation. 
888 operates in a highly regulated 
industry across multiple geographies 
and the Group’s investment will remain 
focused on driving growth in markets 
where there are sustainable regulatory 
frameworks for online gaming. Regulated 
markets are the future of our industry 
and 888 has an enviable track record 
in adapting to and capitalising on 
new regulatory developments. 
In the UK, in August 2017 changes in 
remote gaming duty will expand the tax 
base to include customer bonuses and 
this will have an impact on the competitive 
dynamics and profitability of operators. 
However, with our own gaming platforms 
and significant experience of adapting to 
new regulatory environments, 888 remains 
well positioned to mitigate in part the 
impact of and capitalise on opportunities 
presented by these changes.
07
STRATEGIC REPORT 08
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
During 2016, 888 again made strong 
progress against its stated strategy. 
We have continued to deliver 
outstanding organic growth and expand 
our brands across the regulated markets 
we operate in. 888 today is a truly 
diversified operator across markets 
and product verticals with a unique 
technology platform and an outstanding 
team and culture at its core. With these 
qualities we continue to see a number of 
clear growth opportunities for the Group 
both in existing and new markets. 
888’S ‘DNA’
888’s mission is to supply its customers 
with innovative and market-leading 
online gaming entertainment, above 
all in a safe and secure environment. 
The Group’s competitive advantages 
to achieve this are built on world 
class proprietary gaming technology; 
leading-edge Customer Relationship 
Management (“CRM”) based on business 
analytics expertise; strong brands and 
innovative marketing. 
Technology leadership and continuous 
innovation are central to 888’s progress, 
and the Group is constantly evolving 
and developing its proprietary platforms 
and industry-leading back office 
systems to maintain its competitive 
edge. This is supported by a strong 
corporate culture which encourages 
our skilled end entrepreneurial team 
to develop innovative ideas and test 
them. Whilst a significant number of 
our myriad ideas and projects may 
never reach the market, they are part 
of a process and mindset of continually 
striving to develop our edge and lead 
the industry. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STRATEGIC REPORT
888 today is a truly diversified operator across 
markets and product verticals with a unique 
technology platform and an outstanding team  
and culture at its core.
ITAI FRIEBERGER
Chief Executive Officer
888 employs an extensive team 
of highly trained and experienced 
business analytics and data-mining 
professionals who have analysed and 
learned from customer behaviour since 
888’s foundation nearly two decades 
ago. Teams across 888 from product 
development to marketing to customer 
support leverage this extensive and 
constantly evolving data and, by applying 
robust statistical models, are able to 
successfully influence the following 
three key drivers of 888’s success:
 ♦ increasing the number of new players 
(first time depositors or “FTDs”) 
across 888’s brands; 
 ♦ reducing the cost per acquisition 
(“CPA”) of those new players to 888; 
and
 ♦ maximising the life time value (“LTV”) 
(measured as average forecasted 
revenue over a customer’s entire life 
cycle) to 888 of each customer.
This is supported by 888’s strong, trusted 
and award-winning brands that remain 
crucial in the competitive global online 
gaming market. The Group’s consistent 
and engaging customer offer, focused 
customer support and heritage in online 
gaming have meant that 888’s brands are 
amongst the most trusted and recognised 
in the online industry. The Group’s resolute 
focus on product development, customer 
service and marketing continue to 
support the sustained strength and appeal 
of 888’s brands. 
As a business we never lose sight of 
our duty as a responsible operator and 
888 acknowledges there is a potential 
danger that its games may pose for 
a small minority of people. We take 
comprehensive steps to minimise fraud, 
problem gaming and eliminate minors 
from using our services. Through rigorous 
and timely customer checks as well as 
ongoing real-time tracking of customer 
activity, 888 continually monitors for 
irregular activity that may be an indication 
of compulsive gaming or fraud. 888’s 
fraud and prevention and customer 
service teams are highly trained and have 
developed efficient and proactive methods 
to identify issues and notify and protect 
our customers. Further details on 888’s 
robust Information Technology systems 
are given in the Risk Management Strategy 
report on page 26. We pride ourselves on 
the strength of our customer relationships 
and first class customer support is offered

COST DRIVEN
ONLINE BUSINESS CYCLE FACTORS
1. Marketing 
At the core of 888’s business philosophy 
is an unwavering focus on return to cost 
driven marketing. The business continually 
develops innovative marketing techniques 
and channels, both online (including 
online advertising, affiliate programmes, 
search engine optimisation) and offline 
(including TV and print media advertising, 
sponsorships) to support its brands and 
increase customer loyalty. The returns 
to cost of all marketing campaigns are 
rigorously tested against 888’s strict 
criteria before being extended to their 
target markets. This ensures that 888’s 
marketing spend is both cost efficient 
and highly effective.
2. Acquisition
Effective marketing helps to attract 
increased customers to 888’s brands in the 
most cost effective manner. Strong levels 
of customer acquisition, measured by 
increases in first time depositors (“FTDs”), 
is the fuel for 888’s ongoing growth.
3. Deposits
Customers need to be able to enjoy 
a seamless, enjoyable journey from the 
moment they visit our websites through 
to depositing into their accounts and 
enjoying our games. 
888’s leading proprietary payment 
processing capabilities support a wide 
variety of languages and currencies with 
more than 35 payment methods. It is vital 
that we are able to offer fast, efficient and 
easy to use payment processing, both to 
ensure a positive customer experience 
but also to maximise revenue and convert 
browsers into players. 888’s payment 
options include a cashier interface 
available in 18 languages, both for desktop 
and on mobile/tablet devices, with the 
most relevant payment methods identified 
and emphasised for different customers 
according to their market. 
4. Customer Relationship Management 
Once we have acquired a customer, 
we want to keep them enjoying their 
experience with 888 for the longest 
time possible. 
Underpinned by sophisticated statistical 
models, the Group is able to effectively 
predict the life-time value of a new 
customer within a short period of time 
of them joining 888. This helps enable 
888 to deliver to customers personalised 
communications across relevant 
channels that increase loyalty and 
activity. Underpinned by 888’s analytical 
approach, the Group offers a broad range 
of appealing bonuses that are localised 
from country to country, from product to 
product, and according to a customer’s 
individual profile. Furthermore, 888 is able 
to apply these skills to accurately identify 
potential “churning” players according 
to certain characteristics, interact with 
those players accordingly, and retain 
them for longer.
5. Activity
Ensuring that we continually offer a 
high quality product across our brands 
helps to increase customer activity and, 
consequently, life-time value with 888. 
888’s ability to successfully develop new 
proprietary games and functionality on 
mobile and desktop platforms helps to 
differentiate the 888 experience in the 
eyes of the customer. 888 combines 
exclusive and high-quality “in house” 
created content with third-party 
games and branded content to ensure 
that we always offer the freshest and 
most enjoyable customer proposition. 
888’s products are seamlessly available 
and responsive across mobile and 
desktop platforms and the flexibility and  
consistent experience across devices 
means that customers are able to 
enjoy unrivalled gaming entertainment 
however and wherever they choose. 
With 888’s strengths in four major 
online gaming verticals – Casino, Poker, 
Sport and Bingo – through the use of 
analytics and proven predictive modelling, 
888 is able to enhance customer activity 
and life-time value by promoting each 
relevant product to existing customers 
in a targeted and attractive way. 
6. Gaming revenue 
By generating upward trends in customer 
LTV, our marketing teams are able 
to increase investment in campaigns 
to acquire more new customers and 
still ensure that the business meets 
its strict return to cost criteria.

CASINO
888casino is one of the most recognised and longest 
standing online casino brands in the market, and the 
winner of numerous prestigious awards. 
888casino is known for its generous jackpot prizes and 
aims to provide the most enjoyable online experience 
available by combining exclusive in-house developed 
games alongside branded video slots and “live” Casino 
games, which offer high-quality video streamed casino 
games with a range of professional dealers.
Online casinos replicate the real-life casino experience 
with players playing against “the house” across online 
versions of classic casino table games such as roulette 
and blackjack as well as slot and video games. In these 
games, the house has a statistical advantage or “edge”.
Casino gaming revenue is represented by the difference 
between the amounts of bets placed by customers less 
amounts won. 
888poker is a multi-award winning poker destination, 
offering a first-class poker environment that enables 
players of all abilities to enjoy the games of their choice 
alongside a variety of innovative features. Formats and 
features include BLAST (combining gaming with poker, 
allowing players to compete for a randomly drawn 
prize pool of up to 10,000 times the player’s “buy in” in 
a time-limited game), PokerCam (enabling players to 
enjoy secure poker games that are available in real time 
via 888’s streaming webcam technology), 3D Poker, 
and TeamsPoker tournaments.
888poker offers T exas Hold’em, Omaha Hi’Lo, 7 Card 
Stud, Razz and other poker variations in Pot Limit, 
Fixed Limit and No Limit formats.
In online poker the operator acts as the virtual host 
for the game and provides a platform that enables 
customers to play various forms of poker against 
each other.
Poker revenue represents the commission (or “rake”) 
charged from each poker hand in ring games, and 
entry fees for participation in Poker tournaments.
POKER
888’s leading bingo brands each have engaging 
themes, a variety of games and a strong sense of 
community, replicating the experience of traditional 
bingo halls. The Group’s bingo brands also benefit 
from a range of 888 and third party developed slot 
games, casino games and scratch cards that are offered 
alongside traditional bingo formats.
888’s portfolio of brands includes 888 Ladies, 
Wink Bingo, Posh Bingo and others. 
As with traditional bingo halls, online bingo rooms offer 
customers the chance of winning prizes by purchasing 
tickets and playing their bingo format of choice.
Bingo online gaming revenue is represented by the 
difference between the amounts of bets placed by 
customers less amounts won.
BINGO
888sport is a fast-growing sports betting destination. 
At the heart of the 888sport offer is genuine passion 
for sport, with thousands of live and pre-event betting 
markets on offer across hundreds of events, from the 
obvious to the obscure.

2  Constant currency: 888 reports its financial results in US$ but (i) generates certain revenue streams from 
customers using other currencies and (ii) incurs costs in various currencies. Due to the strong US$ in 2016, 
reported revenue and profit were adversely impacted. Constant currency has been calculated as follows: (i) 
Revenue: with the exception of Poker, by applying 2015 exchange rates to revenue generated during 2016. 
Poker revenue was also adversely impacted given that many Poker customers fund their US$ bankroll using 
other currencies, which suffered reduced purchasing power compared to the US$. It is difficult to quantify 
reliably this indirect impact (other than a small adjustment which was made to Poker revenue generated in 
Euro) (ii) Costs were retranslated by applying 2015 exchange rates.

INTRODUCTION
888’s success is built on its technological strength in combination with the efficient 
utilisation of this technology, directed by extensive data analytics. The goals of 
888’s business are simple: to maximise customer recruitment, increase customer 
life-time value and minimise the cost per customer acquisition, thereby optimising 
return on marketing investment. The Group’s strong financial performance in 2016 
is once again a reflection of 888’s continued success in attracting new customers, 
retaining them and increasing their overall spend. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND DIVIDEND
In 2016 888’s revenue reached an all-time 
high of US$520.8 million (2015: US$462.1 
million), driven by the continued strong 
performances of Casino, Sport and 
regulated markets including Spain 
and Italy as well as further growth on 
mobile devices. This revenue growth 
of 13% compared to 2015 was achieved 
despite weaker currencies compared 
to the US$ when compared to the 
prior year. At constant currency, Group 
revenue increased 18% year on year to 
US$546.4 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year increased 
by 12% to US$90.2 million (2015: US$80.6  
million) which represented 24% growth 
at constant currency at US$100 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin remained 
stable at 17.3% (2015: 17.4%) despite 
significant adverse currency movements. 
At constant currency, Adjusted EBITDA 
margin was 18.3%. 
Profit before tax increased by 82% to 
US$59.2 million (2015: US$32.5 million) 
and profit after tax increased by 75% to 
US$51.5 million (2015: US$29.5 million). 
Basic Earnings per Share increased by 
74% to 14.4¢ (2015: 8.3¢).
Cash generated from operating 
activities was US$68.1 million in 2016 
(2015: US$85.0 million). The decrease 
compared to 2015 is more than offset 
when adding back US$22.7 million cash 
payments made during the year which 
relate to previous periods: US$14.5 
million costs incurred during 2015 in 
respect of UK point of consumption 
tax, VAT and gaming duties (2015: 
US$3.0 million) and of US$8.2 million in 
respect of exceptional retroactive duties 
and associated charges (2015: US$3.2 
million). 
As at 31 December 2016, the Group’s 
financial position remains strong with 
cash and cash equivalents of US$172.6 
million (2015: US$178.6 million). This is 
despite the adverse impact from Sterling 
devaluation of US$8.4 million. As at 31 
December 2016, the Group had US$75.7 
million liabilities to customers (2015: 
US$82.4 million), which was effectively 
reduced by US$3.7 million as a result of 
Sterling devaluation.
Given the strong results during the year 
the Board of Directors is recommending 
a final dividend of 5.1¢ per share in 
accordance with 888’s dividend policy 
plus an additional one-off 10.5¢ per share 
bringing the total for the year to 19.4¢ 
per share (2015: 15.5¢ per share).
B2C OVERVIEW 
Active B2C customers and first time 
depositors, two core KPIs of the 
B2C business, increased 5% and 14% 
respectively year on year. This reflects 
highly effective customer relationship 
management and marketing activity 
across our brands as well as strong 
growth on mobile and in Sport 
which we are for the first time in the 
Group’s annual results reporting as 
a standalone vertical. The total number 
of active customers across 888’s B2C 
Casino and Poker brands in the last 
quarter of 2016 was 728,000.
B2C revenue during the year was 
US$460.2 million, representing a 15% 
increase on the prior year (2015: US$399.4 
million) and 88% of total Group revenue 
(2015: 86%). This strong outcome was 
driven primarily by continued momentum 
in Casino, outstanding growth in Sport, 
further growth in regulated markets 
and the increasing popularity of mobile.  18

Mobile remains a key driver in terms of revenue, deposits and customer recruitment 
across product verticals for 888 and the Group continues to benefit from owning 
its own proprietary mobile solution and games. B2C revenue from mobile devices in 
the UK increased to represent 60% (2015: 47%) of total UK revenue with customer 
recruitment and deposits from mobile devices also rising significantly.

1. The Group has changed its operating segments in the period to reflect a change in the way that the business 
is managed and reported internally. Sport is now presented separately, having previously been reported in 
Emerging Offerings. Brand licensing on third-party platforms, which was previously included in Emerging 
Offerings, is now included in the B2B segment. The comparative segment results for the year ended 
31 December 2015 have been re-classified to reflect this change to allow a like for like comparison. Of the 
Emerging Offerings revenue of US$41.3 million, US$34.8 million has been classified in the Sport segment 
and US$3.2 million in the B2B segment.
2. Regulated and taxed markets refers to jurisdictions where there are regulations in place or where the Group 
is liable for gaming duties or VAT (or its equivalent).
888 continued to deliver growth in the UK market with a revenue increase of 16% 
year on year at constant currency and 5% increase year on year at reported revenue, 
driven by strong performances in Casino and Sport and supported by innovative 
multi-channel marketing initiatives and CRM enhancement enabling effective  
cross-sell. 
Europe’s (excluding UK) significant growth of 29% reflects the strong progress 
delivered across regulated markets mainly in Italy which commenced offering Sport 
during the first quarter of 2016, and Spain, where a strong product suite offering 
and successful marketing campaigns are driving growth. The Group also saw new 
contributions from Denmark and Romania.
Other markets (America and Rest of world) continue to represent smaller proportion 
of Group’s revenue and, as such, fewer resources have been allocated to them, 
which resulted in a year. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Results overview
In 2016, Poker again outperformed a 
challenging poker market backdrop to 
increase first time depositors by 6% and 
remains a credible alternative for Poker 
players. Poker revenue for 2016 was 
US$84.4 million (2015: US$86.7 million). 
The Poker product continued to be an 
attractive source of player’s acquisition, 
retention and cross-sell into Casino and 
Sport. When factoring 888poker’s cross-
sell contribution, 888poker revenue did 
not decline year on year. 
Product overview
The Group’s Poker continues to be 
recognised as a premier destination for 
recreational players and benefit from a 
fully integrated casino gaming suite and 
sports betting proposition, supporting 
the Group’s ability to cross-sell effectively. 
Poker revenue in Q4 2016 was the 
highest of the year (at constant currency) 
driven by the successful launch of Poker 
“BLAST” in July 2016, a “Sit n’ Go” Poker 
tournament format for a pre-set number 
of players. 
888poker prides itself on delivering an 
incomparable gaming experience with 
the widest possible range of formats and 
tournaments. T ournaments are critical 
to the success of the Poker business, 
driving both active customers and first 
time depositors. During the year, 888 
hosted four major poker tournaments (“XL 
T ournaments”), with more prize money 
on offer to players than ever before. As 
well as continuing to drive growth through 
profitable tournaments, in 2017 a major 
focus will be on growing 888poker by 
developing new variants and games that 
are designed to enhance the customer 
experience on mobile devices. 
Results overview
Casino continued its outstanding 
momentum delivering another year of 
double digit revenue growth. Casino 
revenue increased 21% to US$279.3 million 
(2015: US$230.6 million). At constant 
currency, growth was 26%. Active 
players rose 27% compared to the prior 
year and first time depositors increased 
by 23% despite the strong prior year 
comparatives. 
This very good result reflected further 
growth on mobile and excellent 
momentum across a number of regulated 
markets, notably Spain and Italy. Casino 
also benefitted from the successful launch 
of the Group’s new 777.com towards the 
end of 2015 as well as effective cross-sell 
from other verticals, notably the fast-
growing Sport.
Product overview
The success of Casino remains 
underpinned by our heritage as an online 
casino operator and innovative customer 
proposition alongside highly effective CRM 
and marketing. Casino offers classic table 
games, such as blackjack and roulette, 
as well as, exclusive in-house developed 
proprietary games which differentiate 
the brand in the market. The Group 
constantly develops its Casino offer and, 
during 2016, added 57 new games across 
mobile and desktop platforms. In addition 
to our unique content we also provide 
best-in-class and carefully selected third-
party content to accommodate all our 
customers’ needs.

Bingo active players increased 8% 
compared to 2015 in a highly competitive

success of marketing activity and CRM as 
well as the growth of our bingo brands 
on mobile. Mobile devices represent 54% 
of Bingo B2C revenue in the UK (2015:

increased by 7% supported in part by 
newly launched brands, notably Winkslots 
which offers a wide variety of games.
Reported Bingo revenue was US$41.8 
million (2015: US$44.0 million) as a result 
of a significant adverse currency impact 
with the vast majority of Bingo revenue 
denominated in Sterling, which was 
weaker year on year compared to the  
US$, the Group’s reporting currency.
Product overview
888 offers online bingo entertainment 
across a broad range of branded bingo 
sites, each with its own engaging 
theme and rich content. During the 
year, the Group’s bingo brands also 
continued to benefit from new content 
including in-house developed games 
and greater shared progressive 
jackpots, which together contribute to 
enhancing and differentiating 888 in 
this competitive market. 20

This was a first in the market and 
captured a wider consumer trend for geo-
technology games, helping to drive brand 
engagement and customer recruitment. 
As well as providing a growing revenue 
stream for 888, Sport is an increasingly 
important customer acquisition channel 
for the Group, with the lowest cost per 
acquisition for new customers across 
product verticals. Using the Group’s first 
class CRM and analytics capabilities, as 
well as leveraging 888’s strong brands 
in other verticals, 888 remains focused 
on cross-selling customers to other 888 
games and brands as a major driver 
of the Group’s overall strategy and 
continued success. 
B2B REVIEW
Results overview
Revenue from Dragonfish, 888’s B2B 
offering, was US$60.6 million (2015: 
US$62.7 million), with weaker Sterling 
impacting the results from our UK bingo 
network. At constant currency, B2B 
revenue increased 6% to US$66.5 million.
B2B revenue from the USA business was 
slightly lower compared to prior year 
reflecting continued operational changes 
being implemented that are aimed at 
increasing the long term sustainability 
of the business.
Operational overview
During 2016 the B2B platform continued 
to grow with 23 new skins added to the 
network and our partners continuing 
to benefit from new features and 
functionality including the developments 
of shared jackpots across bingo brands 
on the network. In the US, our partners in 
the states of Delaware and New Jersey 
continued to benefit from our unique 
interstate network launched in February 
2015 that enables the pooling of poker 
players across the two states. 
Dragonfish continued to enjoy success 
following the launch of the CasinoFlex 
brand (the Group’s Instant Games Only 
Platform) towards the end of 2015 with 
more brands added to the platform during 
the year. Increased Casino games on offer 
and integrations with vendors serving 
to further differentiate the Group’s B2B 
casino offering in the market.
EXPENSES OVERVIEW
888’s strategic decision to accelerate 
Sport marketing activities, substantially 
invest in Casino and drive continued 
expansion in regulated markets has 
resulted in increased selling and marketing 
investment. This investment created 
strong foundations for outstanding results 
in Sport, following exceptional growth in 
2015, and Casino, with another year of 
double digit revenue growth.
The continued growth in regulated and 
taxed markets which represented 71% of 
total revenue, resulted in an increase in 
gaming duties* levied in these markets 
during the year.
The Group continues to sustain its 
operating efficiencies, which resulted 
in a lower expenses to revenue ratio for 
expenses other than selling and marketing 
and gaming tax.
Operating expenses
Strong performance of Sport product 
which is powered by third-party platform 
coupled with the substantial increase 
in Casino that was supplemented 
by Live Casino provider, resulted in 
increased associated charges. This has 
contributed to the increase of 7% in 
operating expenses* to US$136.1 million 
(2015: US$127.4 million).
The proportion of operating expenses* 
(which mainly comprise employee related 
costs, commissions and royalties payable 
to third parties, chargebacks, payment 
service providers’ (“PSP”) commissions 
and costs related to operational risk 
management services) to revenues 
decreased to 26.1% (2015: 27.6%) reflecting 
continued operating efficiencies, strict 
cost control and the effect of weaker 
currencies compared to the US$. Reported 
operating expenses amounted to US$155.1 
million (2015: US$146.0 million).
Staff costs as a percentage of revenues 
was 11%, compared to 12% in prior year, 
with the reduction primarily a result of 
moderate cost increase offset by currency 
movements.
Deposit volumes substantially increased 
during the year while the chargebacks 
ratio remained stable at 0.8% (2015: 
0.7%) of revenue, reflecting an optimised 
balance between maintaining revenues 
and increased deposits inflow whilst 
reducing transactions with high risk 
profiles. This was achieved through the 
continued use of risk management and 
fraud detection mechanisms which 
enhance internal monitoring systems, alert 
processes and reporting including the 
continued use of 3DSecure verification 
systems. In addition, during the year 
the Group intensified its ability to verify 
members through document submission, 
an integral part of our regulatory “Know 
Your Customer” obligations.

at constant currency
Results overview
Sport is an increasingly important market 
for 888 both in terms of revenue and 
customer acquisition and, reflecting this, 
the Group is now presenting Sport as 
a standalone operational segment.
Following exceptional growth in 2015, 
Sport delivered another outstanding 
results in 2016 with revenue for the 
period of US$51.9 million (2015: US$34.8 
million), a 49% increase compared to the 
prior year and 58% growth at constant 
currency. Active Sport customers in 2016 
increased by 49% and first time depositors 
increased by 52% year on year. This very 
strong performance was supported by 
accelerated marketing investment, growth 
on mobile and a successful Euro 2016 
which demonstrated the Group’s ability 
to successfully compete during major 
sporting events. 888sport’s continued 
growth and momentum also benefited 
from launches into Denmark towards 
the end of 2015 and Italy during the first 
quarter of this year. 
Product overview
Supported by increased marketing 
investment and the consistent 
development of markets and events for 
customers to enjoy, the 888sport brand 
is increasingly recognised by customers 
as a premier sports betting destination. 
As well as agreeing sponsorship deals 
with four Championship League football 
clubs to raise the profile of the brand, 
in September the Group launched a new 
multi-channel marketing campaign in 
the UK to support 888sport’s growth. 
The new campaign, themed “T ake’Em On”, 
is focused away from the noise of simply 
promoting customer offers and matching 
odds and has greater emphasis on 
customer engagement and empowering 
customers by placing them and their 
competitive spirit at the center of the 
888sport experience.
We continued to develop our innovative 
mindset to sports betting with the 
development of a new ‘Free Bet Hunt’ 
game for customers. The Free Bet Hunt 
is a geo-technology game allowing 
customers to search for free-bet offers 
when near to particular football stadia.

Gaming taxes and duties 
Further Revenue growth in regulated 
markets primarily as a result of the 
launch of Sport in Italy as well as newly 
regulated and taxed markets, which 
commenced activity in the second half 
of 2015, namely Denmark, Romania and 
Ireland, resulted in an increase of 21% in 
gaming duties* to US$60.5 million (2015: 
US$50.0 million).
Reported gaming taxes and duties 
amounted to US$63.5 million (2015: 
US$58.4 million). 
* As defined in the table set out on page 16. 
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses 
in the income statement decreased to 
US$34.3 million (2015: US$36.8 million). 
However, when adding back capitalised 
development expenses, overall research 
and development spend would have 
increased 4% to US$43.9 million (2015: 
US$42.0 million). This reflects significant 
investment in regulated markets 
expansion and the Group’s continued 
focus on product development, including 
the development of new games, 
conversion of Flash technology to 
advanced HTML5 across PC and mobile. 
Selling and marketing expenses
888’s strategic decision to accelerate 
Sport and Casino marketing activities 
and continued expansion in regulated 
markets has resulted in increased selling 
and marketing investment of US$170.2 
million (2015: US$138.9 million). The 
marketing to revenue ratio stabilised in 
the second half of the year at 30.9%, 
after a peak of 34.4% in the first half of 
2016, resulting in an overall 32.7% ratio 
in 2016 (2015: 30.1%). As a result of this 
investment, Casino maintained its strong 
momentum across regulated markets, 
benefiting from the success of the new 
777.com brand launched at the end 
of 2015. 
Sport achieved a 49% revenue increase 
compared to previous year supported 
by a very successful Euro 2016, the 
launches into Denmark towards the end 
of 2015 and Italy during the first quarter 
of the year as well as continued brand 
expansion in the UK with the sponsorship 
of four Championship football clubs.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses* amounted to 
US$29.5 million (2015: US$28.4 million) 
but represented a lower proportion of 
revenue compared to the previous year 
at 5.7% (2015: 6.2%). The slight increase 
in administrative expenses is attributed 
to legal costs associated with the 
increased focus in regulated markets. 
Reported administrative expenses 
amounted to US$36.2 million (2015: 
US$32.5 million). 
* As defined in the table set out on page 16.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to 
US$90.2 million (2015: US$80.6 million). 
This is a strong result given external 
factors during the year including new 
gaming duties from regulated markets 
which commenced activity during the 
second half of 2015, namely Denmark, 
Romania and Ireland, with costs of 
US$4.4 million (2015: US$1.7 million), and 
adverse currency movements, principally 
as a result of the weaker Sterling. 
Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency 
increased 24% to US$100 million. 
The Adjusted EBITDA margin remained 
steady at 17.3% (2015: 17.4%) or 18.3% at 
constant currency. EBITDA for the period 
increased 34% to US$79.5 million (2015: 
US$59.3 million).

Share benefit charges
Share benefit charges relate to long-
term incentive equity awards granted 
to eligible employees.
Equity settled share benefit charges 
of US$6.7 million (2015: US$2.4 million) 
comprise of new grants during 
the year and the full year effect of 
awards granted in previous years 
and amounted to US$2.4 million 
and US$4.3 million, respectively. 
There are no Cash settled share benefit 
charges for 2016 (2015: US$1.7 million). 
Further details are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 54.
Finance income and expenses
Finance income of US$0.4 million 
(2015: US$0.3 million) less finance 
expenses of US$1.7 million (2015: 
US$2.6 million, excluding exceptional 
items) resulted in a net expense of US$1.3 
million (2015: expense of US$2.3 million). 
The decrease compared to the previous 
year is attributable to the fair value 
of operational hedging instruments.
888 continually monitors foreign 
currency risk and takes steps, 
where practical, to ensure that the 
net exposure is kept to an acceptable 
level. This has resulted in an income of 
US$0.9 million in respect of hedging 
of the foreign exchange movements 
between US$ and Israeli Shekels. An 
additional expense of US$2.6 million 
is attributable to the valuation of 
assets and liabilities denominated 
in currencies other than the 888’s 
functional currency mainly impacted 
by devaluation of the Sterling following 
the UK’s EU membership referendum 
on 23 June 2016. 
Exceptional costs
During 2016 888 incurred exceptional 
legal and professional costs of 
US$0.9 million associated with the 
subsequently aborted proposal for 
a potential combination between 
the Group, The Rank Group plc 
and William Hill plc. 
Separately, 888 incurred exceptional 
retroactive duties and associated 
charges relating to prior years of 
US$3.0 million in respect of gaming 
taxes (2015: US$8.4 million).
In total 888 recorded US$3.9 
million (2015: US$23.0 million) 
of exceptional costs.
Profit before tax
The Group’s excellent performance 
resulted and continued success has 
resulted in an 82% increase in profit 
before tax to US$59.2 million (2015: 
US$32.5 million), representing a ratio 
of 11% to revenue (2015: 7%).
Taxation and Profit after tax
Profit after tax substantially 
increased by 75% to US$51.5 million 
(2015: US$29.5 million).
The tax charge for the year was 
US$7.7 million (2015: US$3.0 million). 
The higher tax charge is attributed to 
withholding tax payable on dividends 
distributed by a subsidiary to the 
parent company during the year and 
one off tax credits in 2015 in respect 
of prior years. In 2015 and early 2016 the 
Group reached agreement on a number 
of tax matters with tax authorities in the 
key jurisdictions from which it operates. 
Further information on the Group’s 
corporate tax is given in note 8 to 2016 
financial statements.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased 
74% to 14.4¢ (2015: 8.3¢). Adjusted basic 
earnings per share increased 9% to 17.4¢ 
(2015: 15.9¢). Further information on 
reconciliation of Adjusted basic earnings 
per share is given in note 9 to 2016 
financial statements.
Dividend
Given the strong results during the year 
the Board of Directors is recommending 
a final dividend of 5.1¢ per share in 
accordance with 888’s dividend policy 
plus an additional one-off 10.5¢ per share 
bringing the total for the year to 19.4¢ 
per share (2015: 15.5¢ per share).
Cash flow
The Group’s strong performance and 
operating efficiency led to substantial 
free cash allowing for dividend payments 
during the year of US$56.6 million 
(2015: US$53.5 million). 
Cash generated from operating activities 
amounted to US$68.1 million (2015: 
US$85.0 million). The decrease is more 
than offset when adding back US$22.7 
million payments in respect of previous 
periods comprising: US$14.5 million 
relating to costs incurred during 2015 
in respect of UK point of consumption 
tax, VAT and gaming duties (2015: 
US$3.0 million) and US$8.2 million 
in respect of exceptional retroactive 
duties and associated charges (2015: 
US$3.2 million).
Balance sheet
888’s balance sheet remains strong, 
with no debt and ample liquid 
resources. 888’s cash position as at 
31 December 2016 was US$172.6 million 
(2015: US$178.6 million) impacted by 
Sterling’s devaluation of US$8.4 million. 
Balances owed to customers were 
US$75.7 million (2015: US$82.4 million)

UK & EUROPE  
888 continued to deliver strong growth 
in the core UK market with revenue 
increasing 16% year on year at constant 
currency and 5% increase as reported 
to US$223.2 million (2015: US$212.7 
million). This growth was driven primarily 
by continued momentum in Casino and 
Sport and supported by cost efficient 
multi-channel marketing investment 
and effective customer relationship 
management. 
In August 2017, changes in remote 
gaming duty impacting customer 
bonuses in the UK are expected to be 
implemented that will impact on the 
competitive dynamics of the industry. 
However, as a large, established 
operator with its own gaming platforms 
and significant experience of adapting 
to new regulatory environments, 
888 remains well positioned to mitigate 
in part the impact of and capitalise 
on opportunities presented by 
these changes.
Europe (excluding UK) revenue 
continued to expand by 29% to 
US$231.0 million (2015: US$178.4 million). 
Within this performance, Spain, which is 
now the Group’s second largest market, 
continued to grow impressively by 45%, 
further capitalising on the introduction of 
slot games midway through 2015 and its 
Sport offering. The scope, strength and 
breadth of the Group’s offering in Spain 
is supporting the development of the 
888 brand in that market and enabling 
the Group to capitalise on  
cross-sell opportunities. 
In Italy, the Group continued to grow 
with revenue rising 66% year on year. 
This was supported by the launch of  
888sport.it in Q1 of the year, supported 
by online and offline marketing 
campaigns, which has helped to drive 
upward trends across the Group’s 
acquisition and activity KPIs. Now with 
a key Sport product in the Italian market, 
the Group has a clear opportunity to 
effectively cross-sell customers to 
Casino and drive further growth. 
In Denmark, 888 delivered a good 
performance following the Group’s 
launch in that market during 2015. 
The Group launched in Denmark with 
a comprehensive suite of Casino, 
Poker and Sport products across 
mobile and desktop platforms and 
this had enabled 888 to quickly build 
momentum in this exciting market 
supported by effective online and 
offline marketing activities. 
The Group’s significant experience of 
successfully entering regulated markets 
and rapidly developing leading positions 
in those markets means that 888 remains 
well placed to capitalise on positive 
regulatory developments across the 
global industry. 
We maintain a close eye on the 
regulatory environment across Europe 
and are monitoring developments 
in a number of countries that are 
considering or are in the process of 
reforming their regulatory landscapes. 
We are following progress in the 
Netherlands and, on a broader level, 
continue to assess any potential 
impact of the UK’s decision to leave 
the European Union on our business 
in various EU jurisdictions.
UNITED STATES
Trading in the US market during 2016 
remained in line with the Board’s 
expectations. The Group continues 
to benefit from the successful launch 
of our shared poker player liquidity 
across Delaware and Nevada in early 
2015 and we continue to believe that 
pooled liquidity arrangements will be an 
important feature of future states as and 
when they regulate. 
As the only operator in all three 
regulated states, 888 has a unique 
experience of and operational edge in 
the US market. We continue to monitor 
the regulatory landscape in the US 
and we remain confident that 888 is 
exceptionally well placed to capitalise on 
future potential regulatory developments 
as and when they occur.

The Board acknowledges that there is no return without 
risk. However, key risks must be identified, evaluated and 
where possible quantified in order for the Board to rationally 
determine how to harness risk to generate optimal return.
RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
In 2016, the Board adopted 888’s Risk 
Management Policy, which aims to 
explicitly identify and evaluate key risks 
underlying its core business strategy 
and standardise the approach to risk 
prioritisation and management across 
888’s operations, which in turn means 
that effective controls can be put in 
place to ensure 888 is able to manage 
its operations effectively now and into 
the future. The risk register has been 
updated and is being maintained as a 
springboard for discussion at Board and 
management level of the role of risk in 
888’s business. The risk register is a living 
document which is regularly reviewed 
on an ongoing basis, serves as a record 
of the high-level challenges faced by the 
business over time, and also serves as 
an action plan. The Board furthermore 
discussed its approach and response to 
888’s various risks with a view to setting 
a clear boundary between acceptable 
and unacceptable types and levels of risk. 
888’s culture emphasises the need for 
employees to take responsibility for 
managing the risks in their own areas 
and to transparently and timely report 
“bad news” and “near miss” incidents, 
with a willingness to constantly learn 
and improve.
The Board considers that 888 complies 
with the requirements of the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting 
dated September 2014, and specifically 
confirms that:
 ♦ it is responsible for 888’s risk 
management systems and for 
reviewing their effectiveness;
 ♦ there is an on-going process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the principal risks faced by 888;
 ♦ the systems have been in place during 
2016 and up to the date of approval of 
the annual report and accounts; and
 ♦ they are regularly reviewed by 
the Board (please see page 51 
for further details of the review 
conducted in 2016).
Category of risk Tolerance Risk parameters
Strategic Medium During development and implementation of new propositions and 
assessing new opportunities including potential transactions, we are 
prepared to accept medium risks that support our pursuit of growth.
Operational Low to medium When operating within our business, we have a low to medium 
tolerance for risk. We will take a cautious approach to risk within 
our operations, but consider that certain risks will be taken 
in order to achieve our strategic objectives and maintain our 
competitive position.
Financial Low We consider that robust financial controls are necessary to manage 
our business effectively. All our operating processes are based 
around policies and procedures that minimise the risk of a loss 
of financial control.
Compliance Extremely low to zero We have an extremely low to zero tolerance when complying with 
laws and regulations that relate to bribery, corruption and AML. We 
have controls in place that are designed to mitigate these risks, and 
detailed and tested procedures in place for dealing with these types 
of scenarios when they arise.
RISK APPETITE
Risk is a high priority for the Board and effective risk management is an integral 
part of the way we conduct our business on a daily basis. The Board factors into 
the risk assessment impact, likelihood and appetite considerations. Risk is managed 
across the Group in the context of overall risk appetite and the Board considered risk 
appetite to ensure adequate resources are allocated to the risks. The Board reviewed 
and approved the following risk appetite statement: STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
888 FACES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT RISKS:
The risk:
The regulatory framework of online gaming is 
dynamic and complex. Change in the regulatory 
regime in a specific jurisdiction can have a 
material adverse effect on business volume 
and financial performance in that jurisdiction. 
In addition, a number of jurisdictions have 
regulated online gaming, and in several 
of those jurisdictions 888 holds licences. 
However, in some cases, lack of clarity in 
the regulations, or conflicting legislative and 
regulatory developments, mean that 888 may 
risk failing to obtain an appropriate licence, 
having existing licences adversely affected, 
or being subject to other regulatory sanctions. 
Furthermore, legal and other action may 
be taken by incumbent gaming providers in 
jurisdictions which are seeking to regulate 
online gaming, in an attempt to frustrate 
the grant of online gaming licences to 888. 
Relevance to strategy:
Compliance with regulatory requirements and 
the maintenance of regulatory relationships 
in multiple jurisdictions is key to maintaining 
888’s online gaming licences which are critical 
to the operation and growth of its online 
gaming business. In addition, 888 may be 
exposed to claims in jurisdictions which do 
not regulate online gaming, seeking to block 
access to 888’s offering of players located in 
such jurisdiction. A robust understanding of the 
legal and regulatory position in key locations 
worldwide is crucial to mitigating this risk.
How the risk is managed: 
888 manages its regulatory risk by routinely 
consulting with legal advisers in the jurisdictions 
where its services are offered or are accessible, 
where necessary obtaining formal legal opinions 
from local counsel. Furthermore, 888 obtains 
frequent and routine updates regarding 
changes in the law that may be applicable to its 
operations, working with local counsel to assess 
the impact of any changes on its operations. 
888 constantly adapts and moderates its 
services to comply with legal and regulatory 
requirements. Finally, 888 blocks players from 
certain “blocked jurisdictions” using multiple 
technological methods as appropriate.
What happened in 2016: 
In light of increased regulatory scrutiny and 
a review of enforcement policy in the UK, 
888 commenced a review process with its 
English counsel aimed to enhance and improve 
its internal processes related to customer 
on boarding, AML and responsible gaming, 
a process which is ongoing. Consistent with 
its growth strategy in regulated markets, 
888 obtained a permanent gambling licence 
in Romania.
REGULATORY RISK
KEY OF CHANGE
Remained stable Increased Decreased
The risk: 
The proposed status of Gibraltar in relation 
to the United Kingdom as a result of “Brexit” 
is at present unclear. If 888 were to remain 
registered, licensed and operating in Gibraltar 
in these circumstances, its ability to rely on EU 
freedom of services/establishment principles 
in supplying its services within the EU will be 
limited; furthermore, it may become ineligible 
to continue to hold regulatory licences in 
certain EU jurisdictions. “Brexit” could adversely 
affect economic or market conditions in the 
United Kingdom, Europe or globally and could 
contribute to instability in global financial 
markets, in particular until there is more 
certainty as to the form that “Brexit” will take 
and its effect on Gibraltar, the United Kingdom 
and the EU.
Relevance to strategy:
The ability to rely on EU principles underpins 
888’s regulatory strategy regarding 
major EU markets.
How the risk is managed:
888 would not be able to control or mitigate 
political changes of this nature, however it would 
reconsider the appropriateness of remaining 
registered, licensed and operational in Gibraltar 
in these circumstances. Malta may be considered 
as an alternative “dot com” licensing jurisdiction.
What happened in 2016:
On June 23, 2016, it was decided by UK 
referendum that the UK should leave the EU. 
However, the UK Prime Minister has not yet 
given written notice under Article 50 of the 
Treaty on European Union, which would then 
start an up to two-year negotiation period on 
the terms of exit and the relationship between 
the UK and the EU following exit.
BREXIT-RELATED RISKS  28
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
The risk: 
IT systems may be impacted by unauthorised 
access, cyber-attacks, DDoS (Distributed Denial 
of Service) attacks, theft or misuse of data by 
internal or external parties, or disrupted by 
increases in usage, human error, natural hazards 
or disasters or other events. 888 processes 
a large quantity of personal customer data 
including sensitive data such as name, address, 
age, bank details and gaming/betting history 
as part of its business; such data could be 
wrongfully accessed or used by employees, 
customers, suppliers of third parties, or lost 
or disclosed or processed in breach of data 
protection regulation. Cyber-attack and data 
theft incidents may expose 888 to “ransom” 
demands and costs of repairing physical and 
reputational damage. Failure of IT systems, 
infrastructure or telecommunications/third-party 
infrastructure may cause significant cost and 
disruption to the business and harm revenues. 
888 could also face liability under data protection 
laws and could be exposed to action by 
government agencies or private litigation and loss 
of customer goodwill and confidence. Lengthy 
down-time of the site (including in transitioning 
to activated disaster recovery servers) could also 
cause 888 to breach regulatory obligations.
Relevance to strategy:
As an online B2C and B2B business, the 
integrity of 888’s IT infrastructure is crucial 
to the supply of its offerings and compliance 
with its regulatory obligations. The holding 
and processing of sensitive data in a lawful 
and robust manner is furthermore central to 
888’s analytics-based business strategy. These 
are also key to maintenance of the impressive 
customer loyalty with which 888 is entrusted.
How the risk is managed:
Cutting-edge technologies and procedures 
are implemented throughout 888’s technology 
operations and designed to protect its networks 
from malicious attacks and other such risks. 
These measures include traffic filtering, anti-
DDoS devices and Anti-Virus protection from 
leading vendors. Physical and logical network 
segmentation is also used to isolate and protect 
888’s networks and restrict malicious activities. 
The IT environment is audited by independent 
auditors, such as PCI DSS security audit and 
eCOGRA audit. These audits form part of 888’s 
approach to ensuring proper IT procedures 
and a high level of security. In order to ensure 
systems are protected properly and effectively, 
external security scans and assessments are 
carried out on a regular basis. 888 has a disaster 
recovery site to ensure full recovery in the event 
of disaster. All critical data is replicated to the 
disaster recovery site and stored off-site on 
a daily basis. In the event of loss of functionality 
of 888’s critical services, the business can be 
fully recovered through the resources available 
at the disaster recovery site. In order to minimise 
dependence on telecommunication service 
providers, 888 invests in network infrastructure 
redundancies whilst regularly reviewing its 
service providers. 888 has two Internet service 
providers in Gibraltar in order to minimise reliance 
on one provider. As a part of its monitoring 
system, 888 deploys set user experience tests 
which measure performance from different 
locations around the world. Network-related 
performance issues are addressed by rerouting 
traffic using different routes or providers. 888 
operates a 24/7 Network Operations Centre 
(NOC). The NOC’s role is to conduct real time 
monitoring of production activities using state-
of-the-art systems. These systems are designed 
to identify and provide alerts regarding problems 
related to systems, key business indicators and 
issues surrounding customer usability experience. 
The IT environment tracks changes, incidents 
and SLA KPIs in order to ensure that client 
experience is consistent and well managed. 
As part of these procedures, capacity planning 
takes place and infrastructure is built accordingly. 
System-wide availability and business-level 
availability is measured and logged in the IT 
information systems.
What happened in 2016:
At 888, IT security is deeply embedded within 
the organisation, and security projects are 
implemented on a constant ongoing basis. 
Awareness training is carried out for Group 
personnel at all office locations by the CISO. 
Software development personnel are trained in 
IT security and computerised systems monitor 
coding vulnerabilities in real time and provide 
timely notifications to management. Various IT 
security projects were implemented by 888’s IT 
Department under the guidance of its IT Security 
Committee. 888 continued to undergo regular IT 
security audits, including reviews by the internal 
IT team and external audit by gaming regulators.

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
The risk:
Heightened attention to matters of cross-
border taxation, including through the G20/
OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 
project, as well as in other public forums and the 
media, has increased the likelihood of scrutiny 
of tax practices by tax authorities in relevant 
jurisdictions. A finding of taxable presence of the 
888 group in one or more jurisdictions (including 
pursuant to revised interpretations of the 
permanent establishment concept as considered 
in the BEPS reports), or a transfer pricing 
adjustment with respect to attribution of profit 
to such jurisdiction(s), may have a substantial 
impact on the amount of income tax or VAT 
paid by 888. The introduction of the UK Diverted 
Profits Tax also gives rise to a risk that, whilst 
888 carries out its operations from Gibraltar and 
has a considerable presence there, elements 
of its business carried out from the UK may be 
found to constitute an “avoided PE” giving rise 
to tax at a rate of 25% of the profit attributed to 
such avoided PE. The possible imposition by the 
UK of “use and enjoyment” rules with respect 
to advertising, which could be implemented 
during 2017 or 2018, may significantly increase 
888’s UK-facing marketing expense; the UK VAT 
rate is presently 20%. The UK Finance Bill 2017 
provisions pursuant to which free plays will be 
treated as taxable for Remote Gaming Duty 
purposes is expected to have an adverse tax 
impact on 888 with effect from 1 August 2017; 
however, questions remain regarding how this 
will be implemented in practice. Uncertainties 
with regard to the application of VAT to certain 
of 888’s offerings and the tax base to be applied 
thereto also gives rise to the risk of disputes with 
tax authorities, as do the imposition of gaming 
taxes in jurisdictions in which 888 has customers 
but does not hold a local licence. Furthermore, 
the imposition in certain jurisdictions of 
taxation of player winnings and/or imposition 
of a withholding obligation on foreign operators 
may make 888’s offerings less attractive to 
players in relevant jurisdictions.
Relevance to strategy:
In addition to the financial consequences 
of a challenge to 888’s tax structure, tax 
compliance — and being seen to be paying the 
“right amount” of tax — is becoming a serious 
reputational issue as well as being a regulatory 
compliance issue. As such, it is crucial that 888 
has a solid basis for its tax positions taken in 
relevant jurisdictions.
How the risk is managed:
888 aims to ensure that each legal entity within 
its group is a tax resident of the jurisdiction 
in which it is incorporated and has no taxable 
presence in any other jurisdiction. In addition, 
certain jurisdictions impose tax by reference to 
customers’ activity, regardless of whether 888 
has a taxable presence in such jurisdiction. In this 
respect, 888 incurred VAT in certain countries in 
which certain of its online gaming offerings are 
considered services subject to VAT. Furthermore, 
jurisdictions in which online gaming is regulated 
impose gaming duties on licensed operators and 
in some cases even on unlicensed operators. In 
this respect, 888 monitors and seeks to comply 
with its legal obligations in various jurisdictions, 
whilst taking such action as is necessary to 
prevent the improper imposition of unlawful 
or double taxation. 
What happened in 2016:
888 entered into discussions with relevant 
tax authorities in order to regularise its tax 
position and mitigate exposures. In addition, 
it reviewed its structure in light of the BEPS 
recommendations and consulted with tax 
and legal advisers to determine the manner 
and timing of their implementation in relevant 
jurisdictions, in order to ensure compliance 
with increased tax reporting obligations. 
888 furthermore took advice with regard to 
VAT and gaming duty obligations and registered 
for such taxes in relevant jurisdictions in order 
to ensure timely reporting and payment on the 
correct basis in the appropriate jurisdictions, 
whilst reserving its position concerning 
contesting its liability in appropriate cases. 
888 is furthermore closely following the UK 
developments regarding taxation of free 
plays for Remote Gaming Duty purposes, and 
possible imposition of “use and enjoyment” 
VAT rules regarding advertising, directly 
and via relevant industry bodies, as well as 
preparing mitigation actions.
TAXATION RISK 30
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
continued
The risk: 
The reputation of 888 is affected by the profile 
of both other online gaming and betting 
operators, as well as the gaming and betting 
industry as a whole. The perception could 
therefore develop that minors and vulnerable 
players are not adequately protected, and 
there could also be claims for damages due 
to compulsive gambling. It is also difficult 
to ensure that affiliate marketers ethically 
source reliable data for marketing purposes 
such that advertising codes can be strictly 
adhered to and only appropriate age groups 
or demographics are targeted.
Relevance to strategy: 
Underage and problem gaming are risks 
associated with an online gaming business, 
and ensuring compliance with regulatory 
requirements for the protection of vulnerable 
people is critical to maintaining 888’s online 
gaming licences.
How the risk is managed:
888 devotes resources to putting in place 
prevention measures coupled with strict 
internal procedures to protect customers, 
and monitor and update their procedures to 
ensure that minors are unable to access their 
gaming sites. Staff are trained to provide a 
safe gaming experience to customers and to 
recognise and take appropriate actions if they 
identify compulsive or underage activity. 
888 also complies with eCOGRA guidelines to 
protect customers. Web links to professional 
help agencies are provided on 888’s real 
money gaming sites, and 888 has a dedicated 
website which provides information regarding 
responsible gaming. Players can also limit their 
play pattern or request to be self-excluded. 
888 furthermore — directly or via industry 
bodies — seeks to ensure that legislators 
and regulators are provided with accurate 
and useful information regarding protections 
against problem and underage gaming.
What happened in 2016:
888 continued to invest in staff training and 
procedures to identify instances of problem 
gambling and fraudulent behaviour, as well 
as reviewing and optimising responsible 
gaming tools such as self-limits, take a break 
and self-exclusion, continuing to monitor the 
effectiveness of responsible gaming measures, 
and continuing its close partnerships with 
major helping agencies and support centers. 
888 furthermore updated its business practices 
in order to comply with specific new regulatory 
requirements imposed in its major regulated 
markets, including responsible gaming measures 
required under the UK Gambling Commission’s 
Licensing Conditions and Codes of Practice. 
In this context, 888 implemented a new version 
of its player behaviour monitoring system 
during 2016.
REPUTATIONAL RISK
The risk:
888 has in recent years rationalised its 
B2B contracts to focus on fewer, higher-
value contracts. This exposes 888 more to 
termination or reduction of volume under 
existing B2B contracts.
Relevance to strategy:
B2B is a material part of 888’s business. 888’s 
key B2B contracts in terms of financial impact 
are its major Bingo B2B contracts; in addition, 
its US B2B contracts have strategic importance 
for the longer term.
How the risk is managed:
Whilst 888 generally protects itself contractually 
in this respect, it is often not commercially 
practicable to compel B2B partners to 
continue utilising the Dragonfish platform in 
the long term. The main method of mitigation 
is therefore to maintain commercial relevance 
in terms of the functionality and technology 
of the B2B platform offered, competitive 
pricing, maintaining an ongoing relationship 
with B2B partners, and ensuring that 888 has 
a good understanding of the needs of its B2B 
partners and their owners.
What happened in 2016:
During the year, 888 maintained its ongoing 
dialogue with major B2B partners, with a view 
to continued renewal of contracts aligned 
with 888’s strategy, and mitigation of the risk 
of termination of contracts due to changes 
in partner circumstances.

With regulation playing an increasingly dominant role in defining 
and framing our business, 888 continues to monitor closely global 
legal and regulatory developments.
REGULATION AND GENERAL 
REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
As a business operating in a highly 
regulated environment, which is 
deeply committed to operating in 
a lawful, compliant and responsible 
manner, 888 is profoundly impacted 
by regulatory changes related to its 
business operations.
The online gambling industry underwent 
a number of legal and regulatory 
changes in jurisdictions around the 
world during 2016. Each such change 
initiated an internal review process within 
888, aimed at analysing the potential 
opportunities, and managing potential 
risks, resulting from each such change. 
Although changes were often unforeseen 
and inconsistent, which called for 
constant vigilance, 888 remains a strong 
proponent of the forming of strong 
regulatory regimes. Such regimes 
would, in 888’s view, contribute towards 
advancing the online gambling industry 
in its entirety, providing added clarity and 
certainty in the business environment, 
benefitting regulators and compliant, 
responsible operators alike. Strong, 
well-structured frameworks inevitably 
trickle down and ultimately improve 
the services provided to customers, 
enhancing operators’ reliability. 
Naturally, with regulation playing an 
increasingly dominant role in defining 
and framing our business, 888 continues 
to monitor closely global legal and 
regulatory developments and to assess 
their impact on 888’s operations. 
We continue to support regulation 
of the industry and to work with our 
partners in the industry and with our 
regulators towards shaping a regulatory 
landscape that is business-friendly while 
safeguarding the objectives of regulation.
 
The following paragraphs summarise the 
main relevant regulatory developments 
of 2016 and our expectations regarding 
changes that will impact 888 in 2017. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
The general trend throughout the 
European Union in 2016 was the 
continued strive towards local regulation 
by individual member states. Some of 
those efforts were directed towards 
amending local law so that it will better 
comply with EU law, and some focused 
on bolstering existing, non-EU law 
compliant regimes.
There were no significant actions taken 
by the European Commission with 
respect to online gambling in 2016. 
Other than minimal action with respect 
to member states whose gaming laws are 
considered to infringe EU law (such as 
Greece), the European Commission took 
very little action directly related to the 
regulation of online gambling.
Nonetheless, there were a number of 
general EU law developments which 
also impacted the online gambling 
industry. For example, new requirements 
relating to consumer dispute resolution 
came into force at the beginning of 
2016. As a business incorporated 
and licensed in various EU member 
jurisdictions, 888 is directly impacted by 
these changes and will continue to be 
impacted by future changes (such as the 
entry into force of the 4th AML Directive 
now scheduled for mid-2017).
Several regulatory developments in 
specific European jurisdictions affected 
888’s operations in 2016:
 ♦ As in 2015, the UK’s move to a place-
of-consumption based regulatory 
regime continued to have a dramatic 
impact on 888 in 2016, given the 
prominence of 888’s UK-facing 
operations. 888’s continued adaptation 
to the new metrics and regulatory 
requirements of the UK market 
continued to necessitate significant 
efforts and the implementation of 
changes in many areas of the business. 
888’s continued prominence in the 
UK market speaks to the overall 
success of that process, however 
we continue to work to adapt our 
operations and working modalities 
to ensure ongoing adherence to the 
various (and evolving) requirements 
applicable to our UK operations. 
 ♦ During the course of 2016, the Group 
was awarded a permanent operating 
licence in Romania, after operating 
based on an interim licence since its 
application for Romanian licensure 
in 2015. 
 ♦ The regulatory landscape in Germany 
as a whole continued to be mired 
by uncertainty in 2016 with courts 
in various German states issuing 
conflicting rulings with respect to 
the validity and interpretation of 
the German Inter-State Gambling 
Treaty (the “Treaty”). The tender 
process for the award of 20 sports-
betting licenses has been suspended 
(possibly indefinitely), and local 
attempts at regulating the industry 
in other manners (such as the Hesse 
“toleration” process which was aimed 
at regulating local provision of remote 
sports betting services in Hesse) 
were unsuccessful. It is unclear how 
the regulatory landscape in Germany 
will evolve in 2017 as the term of the 
current Treaty nears expiry. 
 ♦ In late 2016, the Norwegian 
government published a white 
paper on the country’s gambling 
policy, supporting the existing 
monopoly model. 
 ♦ The Greek Government’s 
announcements during 2015 and 2016 
of plans to put a licensing regime in 
place as a revenue-generating measure 
have yet to materialise. 
 ♦ Switzerland pushed on its draft bill 
that would allow the country’s casinos 
to offer online gaming. The bill has 
now unanimously passed the upper 
house of the Federal Assembly of 
Switzerland and is due to be brought 
before the lower house early in 2017, 
which supports website blocking of 
unauthorised operators. However, 
implementation of these changes is 
not anticipated earlier than 2019.
 ♦ Regulatory reform in The Netherlands 
is still pending, after the Dutch lower 
house of parliament passed a bill 
to regulate online gambling in July 
2016, which is now pending before 
Senate. 888 continued to conduct 
its operations in The Netherlands in 
accordance with interim guidelines 
issued by the local authorities and 
awaits developments in this important 
market. However, reasonable estimates 
do not predict final change in this 
respect sooner than 2018.
 ♦ In the course of 2016, several 
European regulators have expressed 
their intent to promote the sharing 
of poker liquidity within Europe 
and beyond. Such statements were 
made by regulators from the UK, 
France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. In 
November 2016, an informal meeting 
of the abovementioned regulators 
on the issue took place, where it 
was concluded that efforts would 
be made to reach agreed liquidity 
sharing arrangements by mid-2017. 
Consequently, in late 2016, France 
adopted a bill allowing the French 
gaming regulator to enter into liquidity 
sharing agreements with other EU/
EEA member states. In addition, 
early in 2017, Portugal notified draft 
technical standards for such liquidity 
sharing to the European Commission, 
in preparation of possible future 
liquidity sharing agreements with 
EU member states.

US online gaming market with activity 
in all three states in which commercial 
internet gaming is operational – Nevada, 
New Jersey and Delaware. 888 continues 
to be the only online gaming operator 
authorised to conduct business in each 
of these jurisdictions. 
Despite debates in the legislatures of 
various states regarding online gaming 
(in some cases – online poker) during 
2016, no significant legislative changes 
occurred. 888 continues to closely 
monitor discussions and initiatives 
in the various jurisdictions, with the 
knowledge that positive developments in 
these large-scale markets could present 
tremendous opportunities for 888. 
 ♦ The New York state legislature 
debated a bill in 2016 to regulate 
online provision of poker. The bill was 
stalled after passing the state senate. 
This legislative initiative is likely to 
recommence in 2017. 
 ♦ In addition, we anticipate another 
attempt on New York’s side to try 
and challenge the federal prohibition 
on sports betting embodied in the 
Professional and Amateur Sports 
Protection Act of 1992 (“PASPA”). 
2017 will most likely see a new bill 
being introduced in an attempt to 
regulate sports betting within the 
State of New York, which if passed, 
is expected to be challenged 
immediately in federal court. 
 ♦ The state of New Jersey continued 
its legal challenges to the federal 
prohibition on sports betting and 
made its appeal to the Supreme 
Court on the matter in late 2016. A 
decision by the Court whether to hear 
New Jersey’s appeal is expected in 
early 2017.
 ♦ In 2016, the California state legislature 
debated a bill for the regulation of 
online poker. However, the bill ended 
up being abandoned mid-year. 
Pennsylvania made a similar effort to 
amend an existing bill on slot machine 
tax to include text authorising casinos 
to offer internet gambling in late 2016. 
This bill was similarly abandoned but 
may be reintroduced in 2017. 
The 2016 election cycle brought with 
it uncertainty about changes that may 
take place in the US’s approach (federal 
and state alike) towards gambling in 
coming years. The incoming US Attorney 
General, Jeff Sessions, commented in 
his Senate confirmation hearing that he 
intended to review the DOJ’s position 
on the interpretation of the Federal Wire 
Act which is the keystone to the current 
remote casino and poker offerings in the 
US. Also on the federal level, a bill has 
been proposed to levy a federal tax on 
gambling-related income. As of yet, the 
position of the Trump administration on 
gambling issues remains uncertain. 
On the state level, various legislative 
initiatives are already surfacing which 
would seek to introduce online gaming 
on the intra-state level.
888 will, of course, continue to follow 
these developments as they evolve.
UNITED STATES
In 2016, the Australian Government 
presented draft legislation to Parliament 
aimed at strengthening the 2001 
Interactive Gambling Act’s prohibition 
on online gaming. 
As anticipated, regulatory reform 
reached Latin America in 2016, with 
Colombia adopting a regime for the 
regulation and licensing of online 
gambling and sports betting. 
Further reforms may be brought 
forward in 2017, in places such as 
Mexico and Brazil.
The Indian State of Nagaland adopted 
a regime for the regulation of online 
games of skill in 2016.
888 continues to follow these 
developments to assess their impact 
on our business and to identify 
potential opportunities for growth.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
The Directors have carefully considered 888’s current 
position and principal risks, and have assessed 
the prospects of 888 over a period of three years. 
The directors consider this period appropriate for the 
assessment of viability of an online gaming company 
in 888’s circumstances, taking into account the 
following factors:
 ♦ The Directors are mindful that the Company operates 
in the online gaming sector which, whilst having 
matured substantially since the early days of the 
internet, remains a fast-moving industry subject 
to ongoing change in the global regulatory and 
competitive landscape; and
 ♦ Management currently prepares a detailed bottom-up 
forecast on an annual basis, long range plans of up to 
three years are prepared using a top-down approach, 
and capital investment projects are planned over 
a period of three to five years.
With respect to the period assessed, the Directors 
have considered:
 ♦ 888’s resilience to threats to its viability in severe 
but plausible scenarios;
 ♦ Both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including 
the combined impact of the crystallisation of 
multiple risks simultaneously, as well as stress 
testing, reverse stress testing and sensitivity 
analyses, which the directors consider sufficiently 
robust to make a sound statement; and
 ♦ A broad range of relevant matters that may threaten 
888’s viability.
Specific scenarios tested and considered by the 
Directors included: exit/closure of major markets due to 
regulatory or legal events, loss of major B2B customers, 
a major cyber-attack, and anticipated tax developments 
together with the crystallisation of tax risks. In addition, 
a “reverse stress test” was carried out in order to 
analyse combinations of risks which could bring about 
insolvency of the Company unless capital were raised; 
in such cases it is anticipated that mitigation measures 
(including reduction in dividends and overheads) could 
be implemented in order to forestall such an outcome.
The Directors confirm they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 888, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity, has been 
carried out.
In light of the foregoing, the Directors confirm they 
have a reasonable expectation that 888 will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three year period to 31 December 2019.
Details of 888’s risk management strategy and how it 
manages and mitigates its risks are set out in the Risk 
Management Strategy on page 26.

PROTECTING MINORS
Underage activity on our sites is strictly 
prohibited and 888 takes the matter of 
underage gaming extremely seriously. 
We constantly revise innovative 
procedures to ensure minors are 
unable to access our gaming sites. 
DIVERSITY
Diversity is important to 888 as we 
believe that only through access to the 
most diverse pool of talent will we recruit 
and retain the most talented individuals 
to serve our customers.
Our philosophy of responsibility is 
comprehensive and diverse. 
 ♦ We sponsor and participate 
in activities in the neighbourhoods 
in which we live and work.
 ♦ We create collaborative and rewarding

affect the environment and take 
pro active measures to protect

new and innovative ways to create a 
caring, responsible gaming environment

are not intended, notably underage 
individuals and those vulnerable to 
addiction, will not be drawn into the

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
888 is always mindful of the complex 
regulatory environment in which it 
operates and the social responsibility 
that comes hand-in-hand with the online 
gaming industry. 888 places customer 
protection at the heart of its business 
and is always mindful of its customers’ 
enjoyment and welfare. By looking after 
its customers, 888’s business is able to 
continue to flourish.
As an employer of more than 1,300 
people, 888 is constantly focused on 
creating a collaborative, rewarding 
and fair working environment for all 
employees across the world.
888 is mindful of its environmental 
footprint and continues to monitor 
environmental performance and identify 
opportunities for energy consumption 
and waste reduction.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
As an online business, 888’s activities 
have a relatively small impact on the 
environment. However, we remain 
committed to ensuring that wherever 
possible we minimise what little effect 
we have with the following areas being 
the key focus points:
 ♦ Energy consumption: we continuously 
monitor our energy consumption 
to help us ensure we are being as 
energy efficient as possible.
 ♦ Water: we use only ecological 
detergents in our offices and use water 
saving devices in most of our locations.
 ♦ Travel: to minimise the impact of travel 
on the environment we encourage 
employees to either cycle to work and, 
in certain locations, provide buses for 
commuters. We also continue to invest 
in the state-of-the-art technology to 
help meetings occur remotely. 
888 commissioned a study by AVIV 
AMCG regarding 2015 to provide 
quantitative information regarding its 
environmental impact, as reflected 
through 888’s Greenhouse Gas emissions 
for the period 1 January to 31 December 
2015, and to assist it in finding ways 
to further reduce its Greenhouse Gas 
emissions. Details of the results were 
set out in the Company’s 2015 Annual 
Report. Whilst 888 is committed 
to complying with UK disclosure 
requirements and appropriately 
managing its Greenhouse Gas emissions, 
given 888 has low emissions and in light 
of the costs involved in monitoring and 
measuring such emissions, the Board has 
concluded that a review will be carried 
out once every several years rather than 
annually. The Board acknowledges its 
overall responsibility for environmental 
issues and monitors 888’s environmental 
performance in light of internal targets.
EMPLOYEES
888’s success depends on the quality and 
commitment of its people. We take our 
responsibilities to our staff around the 
world very seriously and aim to provide 
an enjoyable work environment where 
employees are challenged and motivated 
to excel, where flair is rewarded, 
compensation is fair and the balance 
between work and family is respected. 
Some highlights from 2016 include 
the following:
 ♦ We ran a number of management skills 
programs for both senior managers 
and team leaders from all divisions. 
 ♦ During the year we had team building 
activities intended to create better 
connections among team members and 
managers, including a half day fun day 
for each department, overnight event 
combining engagement activities and 
professional lectures, as well as holiday 
celebrations on all Company sites. 
 ♦ We have continued our annual 
evaluation process which is based on 
the principle that giving and getting 
feedback is key to each employee’s 
growth and development and that 
regularly evaluating on the job 
performance helps achieve success 
and is essential for the well-being of 
all employees.
 ♦ We continued our efforts to extend 
our recruitment channels, including 
“refer a friend”, social networks and 
internet channels. 
 ♦ We believe that employees should 
share part of 888’s success. This 
year, due to our great achievements 
and business success, we granted 
various performance bonuses to 
some employees of 888.
 ♦ 888 employees were involved in 
various charity initiatives according 
to office location.
 ♦ Specific retention efforts were carried 
out with respect to key employees.
We also continue 
to invest in the 
state-of-the-art 
technology to 
help meetings 
occur remotely. 38

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
continued
888 takes its employees’ health and 
safety seriously and has written policies 
in place with regard to occupational 
health and safety issues in its major 
offices. The Board will consider setting 
targets with regard to occupational 
health and safety issues in order to 
monitor performance. The Board 
acknowledges its overall responsibility 
for human resources issues, including for 
human resources and labour standards, 
implementing management structures 
and systems to monitor and evaluate 
employee performance and satisfaction, 
promoting diversity at all levels of 888 
and within 888’s supplier base, providing 
employees with the opportunity to have 
formal input into matters that affect 
them, oversee and allocate resources 
to employee training, and to monitor 
key health and safety performance 
goals and indicators. During 2016, 
there were no material labour disputes, 
litigation, or health and safety related 
fines or sanctions imposed on 888. 
888 does not have a written policy 
for the employment, training, career 
development and promotion of disabled 
persons, but in certain of its locations is 
subject to statutory requirements in this 
respect. During 2016, steps were taken 
to maintain and develop arrangements 
to provide information to employees 
regarding financial and economic factors 
affecting 888’s performance, including 
divisional and company-wide seminars, 
email communications and publication 
of pertinent public financial information 
on the 888 internal portal.
SOCIAL, COMMUNITY AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS ISSUES
Our values
At 888 we are fully committed to 
maintaining a high standard of corporate 
and social responsibility. This ethos is part 
of our culture and permeates throughout 
our business into the everyday business 
decisions we make on a day-to-day basis.
We also recognise that a responsible 
approach is not only the correct way to 
do business but one that enhances our 
credibility amongst all our stakeholders 
and thereby supports the development 
of 888. The Board acknowledges 
its overall responsibility for social, 
community and human rights issues.
Responsible gaming
Our values place the community 
and the customer at the centre of all 
our endeavours. We aim to provide 
our customers with the best online 
gaming entertainment experience. 
However, we acknowledge that gaming 
poses a potential risk to a small minority 
of people. We are constantly revising 
our innovative procedures to ensure 
minors are unable to access our gaming 
sites. We also continuously train all our 
staff in how to provide a safe gaming 
experience to our customers. Our training 
programme incorporates methods 
and techniques to help our employees 
recognise and take appropriate actions 
if they identify compulsive or underage 
activity. We continue to innovate in 
this area including the development 
of our proprietary sophisticated player 
behaviour monitoring system to help 
identify and prevent compulsive activity; 
in this respect, a new version of this 
system was implemented during 2016. 
Protecting customers
 ♦ As a responsible, regulated gaming 
group we comply with the eCOGRA 
guidelines. eCOGRA ensures that 
approved online casinos are properly 
and transparently monitored to 
provide player protection.
 ♦ Our sites include links to professional 
help agencies and we have placed 
many safeguards for those who need 
help with controlling their gaming.
 ♦ Self-assessment test: for players who 
are worried about their gaming habits 
and want to know more about the 
signs of compulsive gambling.
 ♦ Controlling deposit limits: should clients 
feel the need to, they can control 
their play pattern by self limiting 
the amounts they deposit per day, 
per week or per month.
 ♦ Self exclusion: a player can request to 
be self excluded for a chosen period, 
due to different concerns. Based on 
internal studies we decided to increase 
time periods available for clients to 
“cool off”. Customers can choose from 
six different exclusion periods from one 
day to six months or more. During this 
period, 888 blocks the account and 
no promotional emails are sent to 
the customer.
 ♦ During 2016, we revised our anti-money 
laundering considerations in general, 
and specifically how they relate to 
our social responsibility program.
Protecting minors
Underage activity on our sites is strictly 
prohibited and 888 takes the matter of 
underage gaming extremely seriously. 
Our offering is not designed to attract 
minors. We make every effort to prevent 
minors from playing on our sites and use 
sophisticated verification systems as well 
as a third-party verification supplier to 
identify and track minors if they log into 
our software. The verification process 
today consists of two independent 
verification systems, ID3 Global by GB 
Group and Call Validate by Call Credit.
We train our staff to be highly sensitive 
to the possibility of underage activity 
and make sure we suspend any account 
suspected to be an underage account.
888RESPONSIBLE
Since 2007, 888 has made available a 
dedicated website, www.888responsible.
com, providing information regarding all 
aspects of responsible gaming.
COMMUNITY
888 is committed to supporting both 
the various local communities in which 
it operates and also the broader global 
community. Our community investment 
programme includes charitable 
donations and long-standing community 
involvement in our key areas across the 
world. In the past 888 supported the 
International Medical Corps in their efforts 
to assist people affected by Typhoon 
Haiyan which struck the Philippines. 
FISCAL CONTRIBUTIONS
During the year the Group made fiscal 
contributions totalling US$79.5 million 
(2015: US$ 71.6 million) comprising of 
corporation tax of US$7.7 million (2015: 
US$3.0 million), VAT of US$8.3 million 
(2015: US$ 10.2 million) and gaming 
duties of US$63.5 million (2015: US$58.4 
million).
HUMAN RIGHTS
888 ensures that its policies comply with 
local law, in addition to reflecting 888’s 
values. These policies set clear standards 
of behaviour to which all Group personnel 
are expected to adhere, including as 
regards social, ethical and environmental 
matters. In this respect, 888 is guided by 
the ten principles of the United Nations 
(UN) Global Compact, which encourages 
companies to make human rights, labour 
standards, environmental responsibility 
and anti-corruption part of their 
business agenda. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2016, the  
Board was empowered to allot securities of a value up to 
66.66% of the Company’s ordinary share capital in issue  
as at 31 March 2016. Furthermore, the Board was empowered  
to equity securities of the Company for cash without 
application of pre-emptive rights under the Company’s 
Articles, provided that such power is limited:
(a) to the allotment of equity securities in connection with 
an offer or issue of equity securities to or in favour of: 
(i) Ordinary Shareholders where the equity securities 
respectively attributable to the interests of all Ordinary 
Shareholders are proportionate (as nearly as may be) 
to the respective numbers of Ordinary Shares held by 
them; and (ii) holders of other equity securities if this is 
required by the rights of those securities, or if the Directors 
consider it necessary, as permitted by the rights of those 
securities; so that the Directors may make such exclusions 
or other arrangements as they consider expedient in 
relation to treasury shares, fractional entitlements, record 
dates, shares represented by depositary receipts, legal or 
practical problems under the laws in any territory or the 
requirements of any relevant regulatory body or stock 
exchange or any other matter;
(b) to the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraphs

(c) to the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraphs 
(a) and (b) above) of equity securities in connection with 
an acquisition or specified capital investment up to an 
aggregate nominal value of £89,317.50;
and shall expire upon the earlier of: (i) the conclusion of the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company after passing 
the resolution, save that the Company may before such expiry

equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Board 
may allot equity securities in pursuance of such an offer or 
agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired; 
and (ii) 30 June 2017. 
In paragraph (c) “specified capital investment” means  
one or more specific capital investments in respect of which 
sufficient information regarding the effect of the transaction  
on the Company, the assets the subject of the transaction  
and (where appropriate) the profits attributable to those  
assets is made available to shareholders to enable them  
to reach an assessment of the potential return.
In 2016, the Company did not exercise any of the foregoing 
powers and authorities.
The Directors do not have any power in relation to the  
buy back by the Company of its own Ordinary Shares.  
In 2016, the Company did not seek authority to and did not 
purchase any of its own shares.

Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Electronic and paper proxy appointment and voting 
instructions must be received by the Company’s registrars not

Restrictions on transfer of shares and limitations  
on holdings
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the 
holding of Ordinary Shares other than under restrictions 
imposed by law or regulation (for example, insider trading 
laws) or pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code. 
During 2016, the Company adopted a revised Share Dealing 
Code as well as an Inside Information Disclosure Policy, in line 
with the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU 596/2014) (MAR). 
The policy acknowledges the Company’s obligation to disclose 
inside information as soon as possible to the market via a 
Regulatory Information Service (RIS), and that disclosure of 
inside information may only be delayed in circumstances set 
out in MAR, that is: (i) to protect the Company’s legitimate 
interests, (ii) if delaying disclosure is not likely to mislead the 
public; and (iii) the Company can ensure that the information is 
kept confidential. The policy sets out procedures for control of 
inside information and the preparation of insider lists, as well as 
for disclosing or delaying the disclosure of inside information 
and communication with analysts and the media.
Requirements of gaming regulations
Amongst others, the Group:
(i) holds a licence from the Nevada Gaming Commission  
as the sole shareholder of an Interactive Gaming Service 
Provider licencee, and as such is subject to the Nevada 
Gaming Control Act and to the licensing and regulatory 
control of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and  
the Nevada Gaming Commission;
(ii) holds a transactional waiver from the New Jersey  
Division of Gaming Enforcement permitting it to be the  
sole shareholder of a Casino Service Industry Enterprise 
licence applicant (presently holder of a transactional  
waiver allowing it to conduct online gaming related 
business in New Jersey), and as such is subject to the 
New Jersey Casino Control Act and to the licensing and 
regulatory control of the New Jersey Division of Gaming 
Enforcement; and
(iii) holds a Gaming Vendor Licence from the Delaware 
Department of Finance, State Lottery Office, and as 
such is subject to Title 29 of the Delaware Code and 
to the licensing and regulatory control of the Delaware 
Department of Finance, State Lottery Office.
The Company and holders of Ordinary Shares therein may 
also in the future be subject to similar restrictions in other 
jurisdictions where the Group secures a gaming licence.
The criteria used by relevant regulatory authorities to make 
determinations as to suitability of an applicant for licensure 
varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require 
the submission of detailed personal and financial information 
followed by a thorough investigation. Gaming authorities have 
very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant 
(corporate or individual) qualifies for licensing or should be 
found suitable. 
Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial 
ownership of more than a certain percentage (typically five 
percent) of the Company’s securities, to report the acquisition 
to the gaming authorities and apply for a finding of suitability.  
Many gaming authorities allow an “institutional investor” 
to apply for a waiver that allows such institutional investor 
to acquire up to a certain percentage of securities without 
applying for a finding of suitability, subject to the fulfillment 
of certain conditions. In some jurisdictions, suitability 
investigations may require extensive personal and financial 
disclosure. The failure of any such individuals or entities to 
submit to such background checks and provide the required 
disclosure could jeopardise the Group’s eligibility for a required 
licence or approval. 
Any person who is found unsuitable by a relevant gaming 
authority may be prohibited by applicable gaming laws or 
regulations from holding, directly or indirectly, the beneficial 
ownership of any of the Company’s securities.
The Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association 
include provisions to ensure that the Company has the 
required powers to continue to comply with applicable 
gaming regulations. 
These provisions include providing the Company, in the event 
of a Shareholder Regulatory Event (as defined in the Articles),  
with the right to:
(a)  suspend certain rights of its members who do not  
comply with the provisions of the gaming regulations  
(the Affected Members);
(b) require such Affected Members to dispose of their  
Ordinary Shares; and
(c) subject to (b) above, dispose of the Ordinary Shares  
of such Affected Members.
The Company considers that these rights are required in order 
to mitigate the risk that an interest in Ordinary Shares held  
by a particular person could lead to action being taken  
by a relevant Regulatory Authority which in turn could lead  
to the withdrawal of existing licences held by the Group 
or the exclusion of being awarded further licences in other 
jurisdictions that the Group seeks to pursue. This potential 
Regulatory Authority action could therefore cause substantial 
damage to the Group’s business or prospects.

Shareholder agreements and consent requirements 
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights are held by a person other than the holder of the shares. 
Relationship Agreement 
Any person who exercises or controls, on their own or together with any person with whom they are acting in concert, 30% or 
more of the votes able to be cast at general meetings of a company is known as a “Controlling Shareholder” for the purposes 
of the UK Listing Rules. The UK Listing Rules require companies with Controlling Shareholders to enter into an agreement 
which is intended to ensure that the Controlling Shareholders comply with certain independence provisions in the UK Listing 
Rules. Sinitus Nominees Limited in trust on behalf of Dalia Shaked, O Shaked Shares Trust and Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust 
(together, the Principal Shareholder Trusts) are “Controlling Shareholders” of the Company. 
The Company entered into a relationship agreement with the Principal Shareholder Trusts on 14 September 2005 which was 
amended on 28 August 2015 and 22 November 2015 (the Amended Relationship Agreement). 
The Amended Relationship Agreement includes the following provisions in respect of the independence of  
888 Holdings plc (in accordance with the UK Listing Rules) which provide that each of the Principal Shareholder Trusts shall, 
and  shall procure as far as it is legally able, that each of their respective associates: 
 ♦ will conduct all transactions and relationships with 888 Holdings plc and any member of the Group on an arm’s length basis 
and on a normal commercial basis; 
 ♦ will not take any action which precludes or inhibits 888 Holdings plc, or any member of the Group, from carrying on its 
business independently of them; 
 ♦ will not take any action that would have the effect of preventing the Company, or any member of the Group, from complying 
with its obligations under the UK Listing Rules; and 
 ♦ will not propose or procure the proposal of any shareholder resolution which is intended, or appears to be intended, 
to circumvent any proper application of the UK Listing Rules. 
It further provides that each of the Principal Shareholder Trusts will not solicit Group employees without consent, that only 
independent directors can vote on proposals to amend the Relationship Agreement, that the Principal Shareholder Trusts 
will consult the Company prior to disposing of a significant number of shares in order to maintain an orderly market and 
shall not disclose confidential information unless required to do so by law or relevant regulation or having first received the 
Company’s consent. 
The Amended Relationship Agreement also includes restrictions on the Principal Shareholder Trusts’ power to appoint Directors 
and includes obligations on the trusts to exercise their voting rights to ensure that the majority of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, is independent. 
The Principal Shareholder Trusts can nominate a non-executive director for appointment to the Board. In the event that this right 
is exercised and it results in fewer than half the Board (excluding the Chairman of the Board) being Independent Directors, such 
appointment shall only become effective upon the appointment to the Board of an additional Independent Director acceptable
to the Nominations Committee. There are no such nominated directors at present. 
Such restrictions and obligations apply in respect of the O Shaked Shares Trust and Sinitus Nominees Limited in trust on behalf 
of Dalia Shaked whilst they collectively hold not less than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the Company.  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
45
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
The obligations of the parties to the Amended Relationship 
Agreement are at all times subject to all relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements and obligations of the parties thereto 
in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar or elsewhere. 
Confirmation of independence 
As required pursuant to LR 9.8.4(14)R, the Board confirms  
that during the financial year 2016: 
 ♦ the Company has complied with the independence 
provisions included in the Relationship Agreement; 
 ♦ so far as the Company is aware, the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by the controlling shareholders and their associates; and 
 ♦ so far as the Company is aware, none of the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts or any of their respective associates 
proposed or procured the proposal of any shareholder 
resolution which circumvented the proper application of 
the UK Listing Rules. 
There were no instances in which an independent 
director of the Company did not support the Board’s 
statements regarding compliance with the aforementioned 
independence criteria.
 
Shareholders’ Agreement
The Company has been informed that the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts and certain other shareholders entered  
into a shareholders’ agreement on 14 September 2005  
(the Shareholders’ Agreement).
Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, restrictions are 
imposed on substantial disposals of Ordinary Shares by 
any of the parties to the Shareholders’ Agreement without 
first offering such Ordinary Shares to the other Principal 
Shareholder Trusts. With respect to the Principal Shareholder 
Trusts, a substantial disposal is a disposal of more than 1% 
of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. This 
provision does not apply to: (i) disposal in the context of 
a recommended public takeover for the Company; or (ii) 
transfers to another Principal Shareholder Trust or a party 
associated to a Principal Shareholder Trust.
In addition, the Shareholders’ Agreement requires that 
the Principal Shareholder Trusts all vote in favour of any 
resolution(s) proposed at a general meeting or all vote against 
such resolution(s) or, failing agreement amongst the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts, vote in such manner as maintains the status 
quo. The other parties to the Shareholders’ Agreement will 
vote or act in accordance with the vote cast or action taken  
as the case may be, by the Principal Shareholder Trusts.
The Shareholders’ Agreement shall terminate in the event that: 
(i) the E Shaked Shares Trust and the O Shaked Shares Trust, 
and their respective associates, collectively have an interest 
in less than 5% of the issued share capital of the Company 
and the Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust and its associates 
collectively have an interest in less than 5% of the issued share 
capital of the Company; or (ii) all the parties and the associates 
of the Principal Shareholder Trusts collectively, in aggregate, 
have an interest in less than 10% of the issued share capital  
of the Company.
On 22 November 2015, in connection with the transfer of the 
entire shareholding in the Company held by E Shaked Shares 
Trust to Sinitus Nominees Limited in trust on behalf of Dalia 
Shaked, a deed of adherence was executed pursuant to which 
Sinitus Nominees Limited in trust on behalf of Dalia Shaked 
undertook to observe, be bound by and comply in all respects 
with the provisions applicable to it as a shareholder pursuant 
to the Shareholders‘ Agreement, and to assume the benefits 
of the Shareholders‘ Agreement, as if it had executed the 
Shareholders‘ Agreement and was named as a party to it. 
Change of control 
A change of control in the Company may, in the event of failure 
to fulfil any applicable consent requirement, give rise to certain 
revocation or termination rights under the Group’s gaming 
licences or certain contracts to which Group companies are 
a party.
 
Donations
The Group did not make any donations to any political party 
(including any non-EU political party) or organisation or 
independent election candidate or incurred any political 
expenditure during the year. 
Financial instruments
The Company considers the Group’s exposure to financial 
risks, including and exposure to specific countries and trading 
counterparties, to be low. During 2016, hedging of the Group’s 
foreign currency risks was carried out solely with leading banks 
including Barclays plc. Further information on the Group’s 
use of financial instruments is set out in note 24 to the annual 
accounts on page 107.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Company to 
indemnify its Directors in certain circumstances, as well as to 
provide insurance for the benefit of its Directors. The Company 
has undertaken to indemnify certain of its Non-executive 
Directors: (a) in defending any proceedings, whether civil or 
criminal, in which judgment is given in favour of such Non-
executive Director or in which such Non-executive Director 
is acquitted; or (b) in connection with any application under 
Section 477 of the Gibraltar Companies Act (pursuant to which 
the court may provide relief to such Non-executive Director 
in any proceedings for negligence, default, breach of duty or 
breach of trust on grounds that such Non-executive Director 
has acted honestly and reasonably, and that, having regard to 
all circumstances of the case, including those connected with 
his appointment, he ought fairly to be excused from liability 
on such terms as the court thinks fit). The Company also 
undertook in favour of Aviad Kobrine to indemnify him to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law and 888’s Articles 
of Association in connection with the execution of his duties 
and/or exercise of his powers, authorities and discretions 
pursuant to his employment agreement. In addition, certain 
special indemnities were provided to the Executive Directors 
in connection with the compliance and licensing procedures 
relating to 888’s business in the United States, details of which 
were provided in 888’s 2011 Annual Report.

Auditors
A resolution for the reappointment of Ernst and Young LLP 
and EY Limited, Gibraltar, (together, EY), as auditors of the 
Company will be proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
 
During the year ended 31 December 2016, Ernst and Young LLP 
were reappointed auditors for the purposes of the Company 
preparing financial statements as required pursuant to the 
UK Listing Rules. EY Limited, Gibraltar, which is approved as 
a registered auditor under the Gibraltar Financial Services 
(Auditors) Act 2009, is the statutory auditor of the Company 
including for the purposes of issuing an audit report pursuant 
to the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014.

charged 888 US$0.4 million in audit fees and US$3.4 million  
in non-audit fees (out of which US$3.3 million was associated 
with the proposed acquisition of bwin.party digital 
entertainment plc).
 
Directors’ statement of responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies  
Act 2014.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s 
and the Group’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements”. In 
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU.  
A fair presentation also requires the Directors to: 
 ♦ consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
 ♦ present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and 
 ♦ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the EU is 
insufficient to enable members to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group, for safeguarding the assets, 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of  
a Directors’ report which complies with the Gibraltar 
Companies Act 2014.
Financial statements are published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements,  
which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website 
is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity 
of the financial statements contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual  
report and the financial statements. The Directors are required 
to prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and have also chosen to 
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
47
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to  
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model  
and strategy.
Each of the Directors confirms, to the best of his knowledge: 
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; and
(b) the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of 
any information needed by the Company’s auditors for the 
purposes of their audit, and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any 
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Company is admitted to the UK Official List and its shares 
are traded on the London Stock Exchange under a Premium 
Listing. As such, despite being incorporated in Gibraltar, the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code” or “UK Corporate 
Governance Code”) applies to the Company pursuant to the 
UK Listing Rules and is available at www.frc.org.uk. The version 
of the Code published in September 2014 applied to the 
financial year under review, and 888 has applied the version of 
the Code published in April 2016 since its financial year end. 
The Board remains committed to the principles of corporate 
governance in the UK Corporate Governance Code which it 
considers to be central to the effective management of the 
business and to maintaining the confidence of investors.  
This report explains how the Company has applied the 
main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The statement contained in this section explains the key 
features of the Company’s governance structure and 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
Where the Company has not complied with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, explanations are given below. 
This statement also includes items required by the UK Listing 
Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, 
including how the “Main Principles” of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code have been applied. 
The Board remains committed to the principles of  
corporate governance in the UK Corporate Governance  
Code which it considers to be central to the effective and 
efficient management of 888’s business and to maintaining  
the confidence of investors for its long-term success. 
This report explains how the Company has applied the 
main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
During 2016, the Company was in material compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, other than as 
regards the following:
 ♦ A.2.1: The roles of chairman and chief executive were  
exercised by the same individual, Brian Mattingley,  
until the appointment of Itai Frieberger as Chief Executive 
Officer of the Company and Brian Mattingley as Chairman, 
on 2 March 2016. 
 ♦ A.4.1: There was no designated Senior Independent Director 
until Ron McMillan’s appointment in May 2016.
 ♦ C.3.1/D.2.1: As there are only two Independent Non-
executive Directors serving on the Board, it has not been 
possible for the Board to appoint three Independent 
Non-executive Directors to the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. The appointment of an additional Non-
executive Director to the Board was delayed in light of 
potential corporation transactions which were under 
discussion during the year. The Board is in advanced stages 
of appointing one additional Non-executive Director to the 
Board; in addition, a recruitment agency has been engaged 
with a view to recruiting a further Non-executive Director.
Leadership
The Directors consider it essential that the Company should 
be both led and controlled by an effective Board.
Board responsibilities and procedures
The Board focuses upon the Company’s long-term objectives, 
strategic and policy issues and formally and transparently 
considers the management of key risks facing the Group, 
as well as determining the nature and extent of significant 
risks it will take in achieving its strategic objectives, 
maintaining sound risk management and internal control 
systems and reviewing annually the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 
The Board is responsible for acquisitions and divestments, 
major capital expenditure projects and considering the 
Company’s budgets and dividend policy. The Board also 
determines key appointments. The Board receives regular 
updates on shareholders’ views. 
Board-level responsibilities of the Chairman are clearly  
and formally defined, with the Chairman being responsible  
for the effective operation of the Board as a whole, leadership  
of the Board in achieving a culture of constructive challenge 
by Non-executive Directors (including the Senior Independent 
Director), regularly agreeing and reviewing each Director’s 
training and development needs, and supporting key external 
relationships; the CEO has the overall executive responsibility 
for the running of the Company’s business; and the Non-
executive Directors (including the Senior Independent Director) 
are responsible to constructively challenge and help develop 
proposals on strategy; no one individual has unfettered powers 
of decision.
The Board has an established calendar of business. This covers 
the financial calendar, strategic planning, annual budgets 
and performance self-assessments, as well as the conduct of 
standing business. The calendar forms the basis for effective 
integration of business activities as between the Board and its 
principal committees (see pages 48 to 53), which individually 
consider their own operating frameworks against the Board’s 
business programme.
The Directors have wide-ranging business experience, and 
no individual, or group of individuals, dominates the Board’s 
decision making.
Reserved powers and delegation
A schedule of matters reserved to the Board has been 
adopted and its content is reviewed to align it with operational 
needs and the Board’s preference to monitor and, where 
appropriate, approve matters of substance to 888 as a whole. 
Senior executives have given written undertakings to ensure 
compliance within their business operations with the Board’s 
formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision  
or approval.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Brian Mattingley, who served as Chief Executive Officer from 
March 2012, became Executive Chairman in May 2015, a role 
which he fulfilled until the appointment of Itai Frieberger 
as Chief Executive Officer on 2 March 2016, at which time 
Mr Mattingley became a non-executive Chairman. The Board 
consulted with 888’s major shareholders in 2016 with regard  
to these succession planning matters. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
49
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
Itai Frieberger was appointed as Chief Executive Officer on  
2 March 2016. Mr Mattingley and Mr Frieberger have a close 
working relationship to ensure the integrity of the decision 
making process of the Board and the successful delivery of 
888’s strategy. There is now a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the CEO, which the Board 
considers an important part of its corporate governance.
Non-executive Director independence
Amos Pickel served as a Non-executive Director of 888 since 
March 2006. During 2016, the Board carefully considered 
whether Mr Pickel’s length of service had compromised his 
independence and concluded that he remained independent in 
character and judgement and that there were no relationships 
or other circumstances which were likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, his judgement. Moreover, from the rigorous 
review carried out by the Board of its members’ performance, 
it concluded that Mr Pickel continued to bring invaluable 
experience and insight to the Board and to contribute 
positively to Board and committee deliberations. The Board 
was therefore entirely satisfied as to Mr Pickel’s performance 
and continued independence.
Ron McMillan was appointed Senior Independent Director 
during 2016 and the Board is confident that he is and remains 
independent in character and judgment and that there are no 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or 
could appear to affect, his judgement.
Directors’ insurance cover
The Company has arranged and maintains, at its expense,  
a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy in respect 
of legal actions against its Directors, as recommended by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. To the extent permitted by 
Gibraltar law, the Company may also indemnify the Directors. 
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where 
a director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Diversity policy
Details of the Company’s diversity position and involvement 
of women in management of the Group are set out in the 
Corporate Responsibility section of the Strategic Report 
on pages 36 to 39.
EFFECTIVENESS 
Board composition
During 2016, the Board consisted of five Directors, as follows: 
a Senior Independent Director (Ron McMillan), an independent 
Non-executive Director (Amos Pickel), a Chairman (Brian 
Mattingley who was Executive Chairman until the appointment 
of Itai Frieberger as Chief Executive Officer on 2 March 2016), 
and two Executive Directors (Itai Frieberger as the Chief 
Executive Officer (Chief Operating Officer until 2 March 2016) 
and Aviad Kobrine as the Chief Financial Officer). 
The biographical details of all of the Directors, setting out 
their relevant skills and experience and their professional 
commitments, are given on pages 40 and 41. 
Independent Directors 
Half of the Directors, excluding the Chairman, are  
Non-executive Directors determined by the Board  
to be independent for the purposes of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The role of the Senior Independent Director is to provide  
a sounding board for the Chairman, to evaluate the Chairman’s 
performance and lead the Board’s succession planning,  
and to serve as an intermediary for the other Directors  
where necessary.
Ron McMillan was appointed as the 888 Board’s Senior 
Independent Director on 9 May 2016.
Nominations Committee 
The Board considers succession planning matters on an 
ongoing basis, with particular focus on succession planning  
for the CEO role as well as for senior management. At Board 
level, the Board has prioritised the recruitment of experienced 
Non-executive Directors, although appointments were delayed 
during 2016 due to potential corporate transactions.
The Board has established a nomination committee to 
lead the process for Board appointments and to make 
recommendations to the Board (the Nominations Committee). 
During the year, the Nominations Committee comprised 
independent Non-executive Director Amos Pickel (Chairman), 
and Senior Independent Director Ron McMillan.
The Nominations Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board. 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing, 
from time to time, the structure of the Board, determining 
succession plans for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
and identifying and recommending suitable candidates for 
appointment as Directors. In accordance with the Nominations 
Committee’s terms of reference, the Committee Chairman does 
not chair the Nomination Committee when it is dealing with 
the appointment of a successor to the chairmanship, and the 
Nomination Committee is tasked with preparing a description 
of the role and the capabilities required for particular roles.
The Nominations Committee’s terms of reference are available 
on the Company’s website, corporate.888.com.
The Nominations Committee and the Board will continue its 
efforts in 2017 to recruit suitable and experienced independent 
Non-executive Directors.
The Nominations Committee is also responsible for pursuing 
diversity within the scope of its mandate, including setting 
any measurable objectives and monitoring progress on 
achieving such objectives. In considering new Board 
appointments, diversity (including gender diversity) is one 
of the criteria considered by the Nominations Committee. 
The Company’s statement regarding diversity is set out in 
the Corporate Responsibility section of the Strategic Report 
on pages 36 to 39.  50

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT

Re-election and appointment of Directors
All Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders on 
an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
When proposing Directors for re-election, the Board rigorously 
reviews the performance of each Director and assesses 
whether the individual’s performance continues to be effective 
and that he or she continues to demonstrate commitment 
to the role, taking into account the need for progressive 
refreshing of the Board. 
The Board may appoint any person to be a Director of the 
Company and such Director shall hold office only until the next 
AGM, when he or she shall be eligible for reappointment by the 
shareholders. 
Commitment 
The opportunity to hold office as Non-executive Directors 
of other companies enables the Directors of 888 to broaden 
their experience and knowledge, which benefits the Company. 
Executive Directors may be allowed to accept non-executive 
appointments with the Board’s prior permission, so long as 
these are not likely to lead to any conflict of interest. Executive 
Directors may be required to account for fees received from 
such other companies. Non-executive Directors are required 
to allocate sufficient time to perform all applicable roles and 
to both disclose any external appointments and consult with 
the Company prior to accepting any new major external 
appointments. During 2016, the Board considered Amos 
Pickel’s executive role with Swiftstake Technologies S.A. and 
concluded that it did not derogate from his commitment of 
sufficient time to his Non-executive Director role with 888. 
The Chairman has disclosed details of his other significant 
commitments to the Board during 2016 and these are detailed 
in his biography on page 40. 
The Board considers that Brian Mattingley’s other 
commitments do not interfere with the discharge of his 
responsibilities to the Group and is satisfied that he makes 
sufficient time available to serve 888 effectively. 
The terms of appointment for each Non-executive Director, 
including expected time commitment are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours and at the AGM. 
Meetings and attendance 
The Board plans to meet six times a year. When urgent 
decision making is required between meetings on matters 
reserved to the Board, there is a process in place to facilitate

discussion and decision making. The Directors regularly 
communicate and exchange information irrespective of 
the timing of meetings. 
During 2016, the Board met eight times. Set out below 
are details of the Directors’ attendance record at Board 
and Committee meetings in 2016. The reason for holding 
more annual meetings than the usual six was primarily the 
Company’s proposed takeover offer of William Hill plc which 
was subsequently withdrawn.
The Chairman has responsibility for ensuring that agendas for 
Board meetings are set in advance. Board papers are issued to 
Directors sufficiently in advance of meetings to facilitate both 
informed debate and timely decisions. If a Director is unable 
to attend a meeting, he is given the opportunity to raise any 
issues and give any comments to the Chairman in advance.
None of the Directors have raised any concerns about the 
running of the Company or a proposed action which needed 
to be recorded in the Board minutes of the Company or in 
a statement to the Chairman for circulation to the Board.
Meetings with Non-executive Directors 
The Chairman holds meetings at least once per year with  
the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present.
The Non-executive Directors meet once per year without  
the Chairman present in order to appraise the performance  
of the Chairman and take into account the views of the 
Executive Directors. Under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, it is part of the role of the Senior Independent Director 
to lead this process.
Board evaluation
The Board has established a formal process for the annual 
evaluation of its performance, and the performance of its 
committees and individual Directors. The evaluation process 
covers a range of issues such as Board processes, Board roles 
and responsibilities, Board agendas and committee processes. 
An externally facilitated evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees relating to performance in 2016 was carried out  
in September 2016, and included evaluation of the performance 
of the Board and each Committee as a whole as well as 
evaluation of individual Directors and the Chairman against 
criteria and minimum requirements set by the Board. The 
evaluation was carried out by Mr Raymond Dinkin of Consilium 
Board and Leadership Development, a London based 
management consulting firm to Boards and executives which 
has no other connection with 888. The evaluation included  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
51
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
questionnaires and face to face meetings with Board members, 
senior management, representatives of major shareholders and 
888’s external legal advisers.
The evaluation culminated in a number of recommendations, 
including as regards succession planning, the structure 
of Board meetings, tracking of Board decisions and 
financial reporting to the Board. The Board adopted 
all recommendations which arose from the evaluation. 
The evaluation concluded that the Board and its Committees 
are well-balanced and effective, and are a forum for meaningful 
deliberation and constructive challenge with regard to the 
matters of strategic importance to the Company.
Following the evaluation, the Board was satisfied that each of 
the Non-executive Directors continues to be effective and to 
demonstrate commitment to their respective roles. The Board 
proposes Ron McMillan for re-election to the Board and notes 
that Amos Pickel will not be offering himself for re-election at 
the 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
Development and advice 
The Board understands that there should be a formal,  
rigorous and transparent procedure for the induction  
of new Directors, which has been formulated with the  
guidance of the Nominations Committee. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and the Company’s nominated advisers, 
who are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed. Directors are able to seek independent professional 
advice, if required, at the Company’s expense provided that 
they have first notified the Company of their intention to do so.
No new Directors were appointed during 2016. On 9 May 2016, 
Ron McMillan was appointed Senior Independent Director.  
On 2 March 2016, Itai Frieberger was appointed as Chief 
Executive Officer, at which time Brian Mattingley became  
a non-executive Chairman.
As noted above, the Chairman regularly agrees and reviews 
each Director’s training and development needs. Members of 
the committees receive specific updates on matters that are 
relevant to their role. Members of the senior management team 
with responsibility for the Group’s business make periodic 
presentations at Board meetings about their functions, 
performance, markets and strategy. 
Information and support 
Each of the Directors has access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary. Under the direction of the 
Chairman, the Company Secretary’s responsibilities include 
ensuring information flows within and between the Board, its 
Committees and senior management, as well as facilitating 
induction, evaluation and professional development activities, 
and advising the Board on corporate governance, legal and 
procedural matters. 
The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary  
is a matter for the Board as a whole. 
Conflicts of interest
Conflicts of interest of the Directors are dealt with in 
accordance with the procedures set out in the Company’s 
Memorandum & Articles of Association and are monitored by 
the Chairman. Specifically, a Director does not vote on Board or 
Committee resolutions in which he or persons connected with 
him have an interest (other than by virtue of a shareholding 
in the Company) which is to his knowledge material, except 
in specific limited circumstances. Such procedures operated 
effectively during the year.
ACCOUNTABILITY 
Risk management and internal control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal control, for setting policy on 
internal control and risk management, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control and risk management. 
The Directors monitor the Company’s systems of internal 
control and risk management on an ongoing basis, including 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Company. The Board believes that its risk management 
process accords with the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting 
and carries out an annual review of its effectiveness covering 
all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls.
The annual review considers individual risk control 
responsibilities, reporting lines and qualitative assessments  
of residual risks. Such a review was carried out in respect of the 
processes that were in place throughout 2016 up until the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. No significant 
failings or weaknesses were identified in the review. 
It is management’s role to implement Board policies  
on risk and control, including reporting. The system of internal 
control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee also reviews the appropriateness and 
adequacy of systems of internal control and risk management 
in relation to the financial reporting process on an ongoing 
basis and makes recommendations to the Board based  
on its findings.
888’s internal control and risk management systems in relation 
to the process of preparing consolidated accounts include  
the following:
 ♦ Identification of significant risk and control areas of 
relevance to group-wide accounting processes;
 ♦ Controls to monitor the consolidated accounting  
process and its results at the level of the Board and at 
the level of the companies included in the consolidated 
financial statements;
 ♦ Preventative control measures in the finance and 
accounting systems of the Company and of the companies 
included in the consolidated financial statements and 
in the operative, performance-oriented processes that 
generate significant information for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements including the Strategic 
Report, including a separation of functions and pre-defined 
approval processes in relevant areas;
 ♦ Measures that safeguard proper IT-based processing of 
matters and data relevant to accounting;
 ♦ Reporting information of companies around the Group 
which enable the Company to prepare consolidated 
financial statements including management accounts. 52
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
continued
The reporting structure relating to all the companies  
included in the consolidated financial statements requires that 
significant risks are to be reported immediately to the Board 
on identification.
Audit Committee and auditors 
The Board has established an Audit Committee. Details of 
the Audit Committee’s functions, together with its specific 
activities in 2016, are set out in the Audit Committee Report  
on pages 67 to 70.
During the year the Company’s Audit Committee comprised 
Senior Independent Director Ron McMillan (Chair) and 
Independent Non-executive Director Amos Pickel. As there are 
only two Independent Non-executive Directors serving on the 
Board, it has not been possible for the Board to appoint three 
Independent Non-executive Directors to the committee. 
During 2016, Deloitte carried out the Company’s internal audit 
function, reporting to the Audit Committee; during 2016, the 
internal auditor provided seven reports to the Audit Committee 
and discussed the internal audit working plan for 2017. 
888’s payment risk management team, based in Gibraltar, 
has developed stringent payment risk management and 
fraud control procedures. The team makes use of external 
and internal systems to manage the payment risks. Detailed 
procedures exist throughout the Company’s operations and 
compliance is monitored by operational management and the 
internal audit function.
Details of the Company’s risk management strategy and the 
Board’s assessment of the Company’s viability in light of its 
risks are set out on pages 26 and 35 respectively.
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the 
framework of executive remuneration and its cost. It is 
required to take account of any recommendation made by 
the Remuneration Committee in determining the remuneration, 
benefits and employment packages of the Executive Directors 
and senior management and the fees of the Chairman.
During the year the Company’s Remuneration Committee 
comprised Independent Non-executive Director Amos Pickel 
(Chair) and Senior Independent Director Ron McMillan. 
As there are only two Independent Non-executive Directors 
serving on the Board, it has not been possible for the Board 
to appoint three Independent Non-executive Directors to 
the Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the Chairman’s 
and Executive Directors’ fees, whilst the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors determine the fees paid to the  
Non-executive Directors. Further details are provided  
on page 61.
The Remuneration Committee is advised by New Bridge Street, 
a trading name of Aon Hewitt, being a subsidiary of Aon plc, 
which has no other connection with 888. Further details are 
provided on page 66. 
All new long-term incentive schemes and significant changes 
to existing long-term incentive schemes are put to the 
shareholders of the Company for approval before they are 
adopted (save for certain circumstances as set out in the 
Listing Rules).
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, which outlines the 
Remuneration Committee’s work and details of Directors’ 
remuneration, is on pages 54 to 66. The Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website, corporate.888.com.
Gaming Compliance Committee
In accordance with Nevada Gaming Control Board 
requirements, the Board has appointed a Gaming Compliance 
Committee. Its members are Michael Alonso (an external 
consultant to the Company), Ron McMillan and Amos Pickel. 
The Gaming Compliance Committee is entrusted with making 
sure that the Group’s licensed gaming activity is carried out 
with honesty and integrity, in accordance with high moral, legal 
and ethical standards, and free from criminal and corruptive 
elements. As such, the committee is responsible and has the 
power to identify and evaluate situations arising in the course 
of the Company’s and its Affiliates’ business that may adversely 
affect the objectives of gaming control. 
The Committee is not intended to displace the Board or the 
Company’s executive officers with decision-making authority 
but is intended to serve as an advisory body to better ensure 
achievement of the Company’s goals of avoiding unsuitable 
situations and in entering into relationships exclusively with 
suitable persons. 
The Committee’s work is being done independently and 
impartially. To this end, its members are appointed by and 
report directly to the Board of Directors.
Whistle-blowing policy
The Company’s whistle-blowing policy sets out the overall 
responsibility of the Board for implementation of the policy,  
but notes that the Board has delegated day-to-day 
responsibility for overseeing and implementing it to the 
designated whistle-blowing officer. The policy provides that 
where an employee is not comfortable making a disclosure  
to his/her respective direct line manager, disclosure can be 
made to the designated whistle-blowing officer whose details 
are provided. If the subject of the disclosure in any way 
involves the designated whistle-blowing officer, the disclosure 
may be made directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
or to another member of the Group’s senior management. 
Whilst employees are permitted to make disclosures 
anonymously, disclosing employees are encouraged to reveal 
their identity to the designated whistle-blowing officer in order 
to allow a full and proper investigation to take place; measures 
can be taken to preserve the confidentiality of the disclosure 
where appropriate. The Board commits to investigating all 
disclosures fully, fairly, quickly and, where circumstances 
permit, confidentially. Undertakings are made to employees 
who raise genuinely held concerns in good faith under the 
procedure that they will not be dismissed or subjected to any 
detriment as a result of his/her action. Employees of the Group 
are regularly sent reminders regarding the whistle-blowing 
policy as part of general refreshers of various Group policies. 
No reports of incidents under the whistle-blowing policy  
were received in 2016 and up to the date of this annual report. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Relations with shareholders and  
key financial audiences
The Company maintains an active and regular dialogue with 
principal and institutional shareholders and sell-side analysts 
through a planned programme of investor relations and 
financial PR activity. The Board also keeps up to date with the 
views of major shareholders through meetings and discussions 
with shareholder representatives throughout the year. 
The outcome of this dialogue and meetings is reported to the 
Board. The programme includes formal presentations of full 
year and interim results, analysts’ conference calls and periodic 
roadshows and discussion of the Company’s strategy and 
governance. Discussions were held with shareholder advisory 
bodies in 2016, in particular to discuss Directors’ remuneration 
and matters relating to the remuneration policy.
The Senior Independent Director and Non-executive Director 
are available to talk to shareholders if they have any issues  
or concerns or if there are any matters where contact with  
the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer is inappropriate or where such contact has failed  
to resolve the issue.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting (scheduled to be held on 9 May 2017) and 
private investors are encouraged to take advantage of the 
opportunity given to ask questions. All Board members 
(including the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees) will attend the meeting and be 
available to answer questions.
Compliance with statutory provisions
As the Company is registered in Gibraltar, it is subject to 
compliance with Gibraltar statutory requirements. The main 
corporate legislation relevant to the Company in Gibraltar 
is the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014. The Company is in full 
compliance with the Gibraltar Companies Act.
Going concern
After careful review of the Group’s budget for 2017, its 
medium-term plans, liquid resources and all relevant matters, 
the Directors are confident that the Company and the Group 
have adequate financial resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and for a period of at  
least 12 months from the approval of this Annual Report.  
They have therefore continued to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are 
disclosed in the Risk Management Strategy report on page 26.
Viability Statement
The Company’s Viability Statement is set out on page 35.
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement

for monitoring corporate social responsibility within 888.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to shareholders. 
As a company incorporated in Gibraltar, 888 Holdings plc is 
not bound by UK law or regulation in the area of Directors’ 
remuneration to the same extent that it applies to UK 
incorporated companies. However, by virtue of 888’s Premium 
Listing on the London Stock Exchange and reflecting the 
Committee’s approach to good governance, we have adopted 
in full the disclosure requirements of a UK incorporated 
company, and shareholders will be given the opportunity to 
approve our Annual Report on Remuneration, which is subject 
to an advisory vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration and strategy
Our goal is to reward executives fairly, by providing an 
appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration, 
linked to the achievement of suitably challenging performance 
measures. As highlighted at the front of this Annual Report,  
our strategy focuses on the following pillars:
 ♦ Development of core B2C brands;
 ♦ Driving margin growth through operational efficiencies;
 ♦ Expansion in regulated markets;
 ♦ B2B partner of choice; and
 ♦ Continue to protect our customers and act responsibly.
Our incentive plans are aligned to profitability of the 888 
business and shareholder value, which we believe derive from 
implementation of this strategy. 
Pay outcomes for 2016
The annual bonus was focused on the achievement of 
stretching like-for-like adjusted EBITDA growth
1
 targets. Like-
for-like adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 was 24%, resulting in 
bonuses to the Directors of the maximum amount of 150% of 
salary. For full details of Executive Directors’ bonuses and the 
associated performance delivered see page 61.
In relation to long-term incentives, the awards granted in 
2014 under the All Employee Share Plan vested based on 
a performance measure comprising 50% of an absolute 
EPS growth target and 50% on relative TSR. EPS growth 
performance was measured over the three year period to  
31 December 2016; EPS growth performance over this period 
was 89% against a target range of 15.76% (5% p.a. compounded) 
to 72.80% (20% p.a. compounded).TSR performance was 
measured over three years to 31 December 2016; TSR 
performance was 50%, putting it above the stretch target. 
This will result in 100% of the 2014 award vesting in March 2017. 
Overall, in light of the annual and long-term performance 
delivered, the Committee is satisfied that there has been  
a robust link between performance and reward.
Remuneration Policy
No changes are proposed to the Remuneration Policy 
adopted by the Company at its 2016 Annual General Meeting, 
which is reproduced in the following pages for reference.
The second section of this report is the Annual Report on 
Remuneration which provides detailed disclosure on how the 
remuneration policy will be implemented for 2017 and how 
Directors have been paid in 2016. The disclosures provide 
shareholders with the information necessary to form a 
judgment as to the link between Company performance and 
how the Executive Directors were paid. This Annual Statement 
together with the Annual Report on Remuneration will be 
subject to an advisory vote and I hope that you will be able to 
support the resolution at the forthcoming AGM.
The Committee is committed to maintaining an open and 
constructive dialogue with our shareholders on remuneration 
matters and I welcome any feedback you may have.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Purpose and link to strategy To recruit, motivate and retain high-calibre Executive Directors by offering salaries 
at market competitive levels.

Operation Reviewed annually with any changes normally effective from 1 January. Positioning 
and annual increases are influenced by:
 ♦ our sector, where the market for executive talent is intense 
 ♦ the experience and performance of the individual;
 ♦ changes in responsibility or position;
 ♦ changes in broader workforce salary; and
 ♦ the performance of 888 as a whole.
Benchmarking is carried out on a total remuneration basis and takes into account pay 
levels for comparable roles at a range of organisations of similar size and sector – including 
pay practices in other UK listed companies and in the international gaming industry.
Opportunity Any increase to directors’ salaries will generally be no higher than the average increase 
for other employees. However, a higher increase may be proposed in the event of a role 
change or promotion, or in other exceptional circumstances.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Market competitive structure to support recruitment and retention. 
Medical cover aims to ensure minimal business interruption as a result of illness.
Operation Executive Directors may receive various benefits in kind as part of their employment terms. 
These may include an accommodation allowance (where 888 has required the executive 
to relocate), use of a company car (or car allowance), health insurance (or a contribution 
towards a health insurance scheme), “study fund” (a common savings benefit in Israel), 
disability and life assurance, relocation expenses, directors’ indemnities and directors’ 
and officers’ insurances to the extent permitted by law and other ad hoc benefits at the 
discretion of the Committee.
Opportunity The value of benefits is based on the cost to 888 and there is no pre-determined maximum 
limit. 
The range and value of the benefits offered is reviewed periodically.
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Contribution towards the funding of post-retirement life.
Operation 888 offers a defined contribution pension scheme (via outsourced pension providers) 
or cash in lieu of pension.

Annual bonus
Purpose and link to strategy Rewards the achievement of annual financial and, if appropriate, non-financial strategic 
targets.
Operation Bonus targets (percentage of salary) are based on objective and disclosable calculations 
for financial and non-financial performance where possible.
The precise weightings between metrics may differ each year, although there will be always 
be a greater focus on financial as opposed to non-financial performance.
Any bonus payment in excess of 100% of salary is deferred into shares which vest in equal 
tranches after one, two and three years.
A dividend equivalent provision operates enabling dividends to be accrued (in cash or 
shares) on unvested deferred bonus shares (or up to the point of exercise in the case of nil 
cost options).
The bonus is subject to a recovery and withholding provision if the financial statements of 
888 were materially misstated or an error occurred in assessing the performance conditions 
on bonus and/or if the Executive ceased to be a Director or employee due to gross 
misconduct.
Opportunity The maximum opportunity is 150% of base salary.
The level of pay-out for the achievement of target performance, as set by the Committee 
is 50% of the maximum amount. Presently the target is based on like-for-like Adjusted 
EBITDA growth in addition to exceeding budgeted Adjusted EBITDA for the year as 
approved by the Board.
The threshold level of payment may be up to 25% of the maximum.
Performance metrics Financial Performance
The financial component is based on 888’s key financial measures of performance. This will 
normally be based on like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth but may include other financial 
KPIs.
A sliding scale of targets applies for financial performance targets which are measured 
annually.
The degree of stretch in targets may vary each year depending on the business aims and 
the broader economic or industry environment at the start of the relevant year. 
Non-financial Performance
There is no intention initially to use non-financial performance conditions, but the 
Committee wishes to retain flexibility to do so, for a minority of the bonus opportunity. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Long-Term Incentives (LTIP)
Purpose and link to strategy Rewards Executive Directors for achieving superior returns for shareholders over a longer-
term timeframe.
Enables Executive Directors to build a meaningful shareholding over time and align goals 
with shareholders.
Operation 888 sought shareholder approval for the 2015 LTIP at the EGM held on 30 September 2015. 
This replaced the previous share plans which expired in August 2015.
LTIP awards are made annually in the form of nil cost options or conditional awards with 
vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions over at least three 
financial years, commencing with the year of grant.
Awards are subject to a recovery and withholding provision if there is a material 
misstatement in 888’s financial statements, an error in the calculation of any performance 
conditions or if the Executive Director ceases to be a Director or employee due to gross 
misconduct.
A dividend equivalent provision operates enabling dividends to be accrued (in cash or 
shares) on LTIP awards to the extent they vest.
Opportunity Award levels are determined primarily by seniority. A maximum individual grant limit of 
200% of salary applies, based on the face value of shares at the date of grant. The current 
award level is 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the Chief 
Financial Officer.
Performance metrics Awards vest at the end of a three year performance period based on performance 
measures reflecting the outputs of the long-term strategy of the business at the time of 
grant. 
Awards are currently based 50% on adjusted EPS and 50% on relative total shareholder 
return (TSR), but the choice and weightings of metrics may differ for future award cycles. 
Where possible TSR will be compared to a basket of 888’s peers, but recognising the level 
of consolidation in the sector the selection criteria may be broadened to the Leisure Sector 
or listed companies more generally.
The Committee will review the weightings between measures and the target ranges prior to 
each LTIP grant to ensure that the overall balance and level of stretch remains appropriate.
A sliding scale of targets applies for financial metrics with no more than 25% of the award 
vesting at threshold performance.
For TSR, none of this part of the award will vest below median ranking and awards will vest 
on a sliding scale for performance between the threshold and stretch targets.
Share ownership guidelines
Under the guidelines, Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain an interest equivalent in value to no less than 
two times salary. Beneficially owned shares and fully vested unexercised nil-cost options (valued on a net of tax basis) will be 
included when determining the extent to which the guideline holding is achieved. Until such time as the guideline threshold is 
achieved. Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of the net of tax value of awards that vest under the LTIP or deferred 
annual bonus. 58

Remuneration policy table continued
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ (NEDs) fees
Purpose and link to strategy To recruit, motivate and retain a Chairman and Non-executive Directors of a high calibre 
by offering a market competitive fee level and which takes account of the specific 
circumstances of 888.
Operation The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the fees paid to the Non-executive 
Directors. The Chairman’s fees are determined by the Remuneration Committee with 
reference to prevailing fee rates amongst other gaming companies. Fees paid to the 
Non-executive Directors are set by reference to an assessment of the time commitment 
and responsibility associated with each role, and the Chairman and Executive Directors 
have reference in this respect to prevailing fee rates amongst other gaming companies. 
Levels take account of additional demands placed upon individual Non-executive Directors 
by virtue of their holding particular offices, such as Committee Chairman and/or Senior 
Independent Director, and travel time to Board meetings (which are held outside the UK). 
Additional fees may be paid as appropriate to reflect increased time commitments of the 
role.
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any 
bonus plan, pension plan, share plan, or long-term incentive plan of 888. The Chairman 
and Non-executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for any reasonable travel and 
accommodation expenses incurred in the performance of their duties (including any tax 
incurred thereon).
Opportunity No maximum.
Annual report on remuneration 
This Annual Report on Remuneration together with the Chairman’s Annual Statement, as detailed on page 54 will be subject 
to an advisory vote at the 2017 AGM. The information on page 60 with respect to Directors’ emoluments and onwards through 
page 66 has been audited.

for 2017 is set out below.

the 2017 Annual General Meeting, it is intended that 
Ron McMillan’s appointment will be extended for 
a further three year term.
Amos Pickel Non-executive Director  Until 9 May 2017.
Annual bonus
For 2017, the CEO and CFO will have a bonus opportunity of 150% of salary.
Bonus will be based on a sliding scale range of like-for-like EBITDA targets for 25% to 100% vesting, which will be disclosed 
retrospectively in next year’s annual report on remuneration. 
Any bonus above 100% of salary will be paid in deferred shares.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Award levels
The CEO and CFO will be granted awards worth 200% of base salary and 150% of salary respectively.
Performance conditions
2017 LTIP awards will be subject to EPS and relative TSR performance conditions, each with a 50% weighting. These metrics 
were chosen as EPS provides a focus on 888’s underlying financial performance, and relative TSR provides an objective reward 
for delivering value to shareholders compared to 888’s peers.
Detail and target ranges 
EPS target range for 2017 awards:
 ♦ Threshold – 3 year CAGR of 5%;
 ♦ Maximum – 3 year CAGR of 20%
None of the award will vest if EPS is below threshold, 25% will vest at threshold, and 100% will vest at maximum. 
Performance between threshold and maximum is determined on a straight-line basis.
TSR target for 2017 awards:
888’s TSR will be compared against a comparator group comprising five peer companies as follows: GVC Holdings plc, 
Ladbrokes Coral Group plc, Playtech plc, Paddy Power Betfair plc, William Hill plc.
 ♦ 0% will vest if 888’s TSR is below the TSR of the median company in the comparator group;
 ♦ 25% will vest if 888’s TSR is equal to the TSR of the median company in the comparator group (“Threshold”); and 
 ♦ 100% will vest if 888’s TSR is 33% (i.e. 10% per annum) or more above the TSR of the median company in the comparator  
group (“Maximum”).
 ♦ Vesting will be on a proportionate basis for performance between Threshold and Maximum. 60

it was paid save for the annual cash bonus which is converted into US Dollar at the year-end exchange rate. The recorded decrease in Aviad 
Kobrine’s salary, pension and annual bonus amounts reflect fluctuations in the USD:GBP exchange rate, and not a decrease in the GBP amounts.
2 Remuneration of Itai Frieberger is shown with respect to the period following his appointment to the Board on 13 May 2015. Itai Frieberger  
was appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 2 March 2016.
3 Salaries for 2016 were ILS 2,948,982 for Itai Frieberger and GBP 416,000 for Aviad Kobrine. The 2016 salary anticipated in Remuneration 
Scenarios set out in the 2015 Annual Report for Itai Frieberger was ILS 3,024,495, which was an annualised figure based on his updated salary 
as of 2 March 2016. 
4 Benefits for Aviad Kobrine include car allowance and health, disability and life insurance; and for Itai Frieberger include convalescence and 
health insurance for Itai Frieberger and his family, contribution to “study fund” up to the Israeli tax-free ceiling with the excess up to 7.5% of

5 A breakdown of the 2016 annual bonus targets and the extent of their achievement is set out overleaf. Out of the total bonus payment made to 
Itai Frieberger of ILS 4,423,473 (total of 150% of salary), an amount of ILS 2,948,982 (100% of salary) was granted in cash, and an amount of ILS 
1,474,491 (50% of salary) will be deferred into shares of the Company under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan once approved by the

salary) was granted in cash, and an amount of GBP 208,000 (50% of salary) will be deferred into shares of the Company under the Company’s 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan once approved by the Board.
6 Performance-based long-term incentives are disclosed in the year in which they vest. A breakdown of the performance conditions applying to 
the payments under long-term incentives is set out on page 62. Brian Mattingley’s long-term incentive relates to the phantom award granted 
in 2012 which vested on 27 March 2016. Aviad Kobrine’s long-term incentive in 2015 was governed by the 888 All-Employee Share Plan; Aviad 
Kobrine and Itai Frieberger’s long-term incentives in 2016 were governed by the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan 2015. In 2016, 213,000 nil-cost 
options granted to Aviad Kobrine, and 279,407 Ordinary Shares granted to Itai Frieberger on 7 April 2013 and due to vest on 7 April 2016 subject 
to fulfilment of the performance conditions set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report in 2015, vested in full.
7 In accordance with standard practice in Israel, Itai Frieberger was granted personal pension scheme contributions in an amount of 13.33% of 
base salary until July 2016, and 14.03% of base salary from such date, in addition to 0.6% of base salary contribution for loss of working capacity. 
Aviad Kobrine receives a cash payment in lieu of pension in the amount of 15% of base salary.
8 Other items in the nature of remuneration includes share awards and nil-cost options (including dividends accrued thereupon) that are not 
subject to performance conditions, and which were granted in the reporting year, regardless of vesting date. These are valued by reference to 
the  market price of the shares upon grant. In 2015, this includes 136,524 nil-cost options granted to Aviad Kobrine as a like-for-like replacement 
for options previously granted under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan which expired on 4 October 2015, of which 136,000 were vested 
immediately and 524 will vest on 28 August 2018 in accordance with their terms.

Annual bonus payments in respect of 2016 performance
As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, each Executive Director participates in the annual bonus plan, under which performance 
is measured over a single financial year. 
The annual bonus opportunity was 150% of base salary and the bonus was determined by reference to challenging like-for-like 
adjusted EBITDA performance conditions.
EBITDA performance
The extent to which the EBITDA performance conditions were achieved is as follows: 
 Threshold Target Max Actual
Performance Measures (25% pay-out) (50% pay-out) (100% pay-out) performance Bonus awarded
Like-for-like adjusted EBITDA  
growth per annum 5% 12.5% 20% 24% 150% of salary
     Itai Frieberger – ILS 4,423,473
     Aviad Kobrine – GBP 624,000
The Committee determined that like-for-like adjusted EBITDA growth, for the 2016 bonus onwards, would be measured on 
a constant currency basis.
The Committee considered that the overall bonus out-turn was reflective of the exceptional performance of the Company 
and the management team over the year and that the pay-out levels were appropriate.
As noted on page 59, the proportion of bonus awarded in excess of 100% of salary, will be deferred in shares under the Deferred 
Share Bonus plan once approved by the Board. 62

On 1 February 2016, the acquisition of bwin.party by GVC Holdings plc was completed. As of such date, bwin.party was delisted and therefore 
peer group data reflects the share price of GVC Holdings plc from 2 February 2016. In addition, during 2016, Ladbrokes plc acquired Gala Coral 
and changed its listing to Ladbrokes Coral Group plc; and Paddy Power plc acquired Betfair plc and changed its listing to Paddy Power Betfair 
plc. Playtech Ltd listed on 2 July 2012 and is referred to as Playtech plc.

50% of an award is subject to an EPS performance condition requiring annual EPS growth of between 5% and 20% p.a., and 50% is subject to 
a TSR performance condition versus a peer group comprised of GVC Holdings, Ladbrokes Coral Group plc, Playtech plc, Paddy Power Betfair 
plc and William Hill plc (25% of the TSR awards vest for median performance with full vesting achieved for out-performance the median by 10% 
p.a.). Separate awards were made on 23 March 2016 and 9 May 2016 due to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2016 of the revised 
Remuneration Policy which increased the maximum individual grant limit to the Executive Directors to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive 
and 150% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer (100% of salary under the prior Remuneration Policy).
Loss of office payments
In 2016, no loss of office payments were made to Executive Directors, and no payments were made to past Executive Directors.

Performance graph 
The following graph shows 888’s performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index.

Percentage change in CEO remuneration compared to the average for other employees
As the Chief Executive position remained vacant for a significant portion of 2016, as well as for most of 2015, it is not possible 
to provide meaningful year-on-year analysis for this disclosure requirement.
Relative importance of spend on pay
The following graph sets out the actual expenditure by 888 in financial years 2015 and 2016 on various items, including  
on remuneration to Group employees.
* Employee pay & benefits is calculated in accordance with note 6 of the financial statements, and include share benefit charges  
of US$6.7 million (2015: US$4.1 million).
** Includes corporation tax of US$7.7 million (2015: US$3.0 million), VAT of US$8.3 million (2015: US$10.2 million) and gaming duties  
of US$63.5 million (2015: US$58.4 million).
The comparables chosen were the following:
 ♦ The employee pay figure includes employee benefits in accordance with the financial statements (including both  
staff costs and share benefit charges). 
 ♦ Sales and marketing expenses – This reflects the amount invested in development of the future revenue stream  
of 888 driven by customer acquisition.
 ♦ Dividends – This reflects amounts distributed to shareholders.
 ♦ Taxes and duties – This is a necessary cost of doing business in a regulated business environment. 66

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear shareholders,
The Audit Committee exercises oversight of 888’s financial reporting policies, monitors the integrity of the financial statements 
and considers the significant financial and accounting estimates and judgments applied in preparing the financial statements. It 
also ensures that disclosures in the financial statements are appropriate and obtains from the external auditors an independent 
view of the key disclosure issues and risks. The Committee has reviewed the narrative at the front end of this Annual Report and 
considers that sufficient information has been provided to give shareholders a fair, balanced and understandable account of the 
Company’s business.
To achieve its objectives, the Committee works closely with the Board to ensure that all significant risks are considered on 
an ongoing basis, and that all communications with shareholders are properly considered.
A key responsibility of the Committee is to review the scope, nature and effectiveness of internal and external audits.
Internal audit work is conducted by Deloitte and the scope of their work is agreed with both management and the Audit 
Committee. The Committee also monitors and reviews the key aspects of 888’s external audit, which is conducted by EY.
In relation to risks and controls, the Committee ensures that these have been identified and that appropriate responsibilities  
and accountabilities have been set.
Amongst other things, during the year the Committee considered:
 ♦ The complex legal and regulatory environment in which 888 operates, together with changes in laws and regulations 
which may impact 888’s business, sector and market.
 ♦ 888’s exposure to corporation tax, VAT and gaming duties in various jurisdictions.
 ♦ The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets and related disclosures in the financial statements.
 ♦ The adequacy of 888’s IT systems and controls.
 ♦ The adequacy of the systems and controls on which management relies.
 ♦ The Board’s assessment of risk and the risk register prepared by management.
 ♦ The viability statement and going concern statement prepared by management. 
 ♦ 888’s anti-slavery and human trafficking obligations.
 ♦ 888’s anti-bribery obligations.
 ♦ 888’s anti-money laundering obligations.
Further information on the Committee’s responsibilities and the manner in which they are discharged are set out below  
and are available on 888’s corporate website corporate.888.com. 
I will be available at the Annual General meeting in May 2017 to answer any questions and would like to thank my colleague  
on the Committee for his help and support.
Sincerely,
RON MCMILLAN
Chairman of the Audit Committee 68
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
Committee composition
The Committee comprises two members, Senior Independent 
Director Ron McMillan and Independent Non-executive Director 
Amos Pickel.
Two members constitute a quorum. The Committee  
requires the inclusion of at least one financially qualified 
member with recent and relevant financial experience.  
The Committee’s Chairman fulfils that requirement. Both 
members of the Committee are expected to have an 
understanding of financial reporting, 888’s internal control 
environment, relevant corporate legislation, the functions of 
internal and external audit and the regulatory framework of 
the business, in addition to competence relevant to the online 
gaming sector. Amos Pickel has extensive industry experience 
through his various roles in the leisure and gaming industry, 
and Ron McMillan has served in the past as the auditor of 
betting and gaming companies. Details of meetings of the 
Audit Committee are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 52. 
The timing of Audit Committee meetings is set to 
accommodate the dates of release of financial information at 
the half year and full year ends and the approval of scope and 
outputs from work programmes executed by the internal and 
external auditors.
In addition to scheduled meetings, the Chairman of the 
Committee met with the Chief Financial Officer and the  
internal and external auditors on a number of occasions. 
Although not members of the Committee, the Chairman,  
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer normally 
attend meetings together with representatives from the 
internal and external auditors.
Responsibilities
The committee is responsible for:
 ♦ Monitoring the integrity of 888’s financial statements and 
reviewing significant financial judgments and estimates in 
advance of these being considered by the Board;
 ♦ Reviewing internal financial controls and management’s 
response to required corrective actions identified in both 
internal and external audit reports;
 ♦ Monitoring and reviewing the role and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function, including activities and resources;
 ♦ Overseeing the role and effectiveness of the external 
auditors, reviewing and monitoring their objectivity and 
independence and agreeing the scope of work and fees for 
audit and non-audit services; and
 ♦ Assisting the Board in its consideration of relevant risk 
factors and determining appropriate mitigation actions.
Activities
The key matters discussed by the Committee during the year 
included the following:
Legal and regulatory environment 
888 operates within an increasingly regulated marketplace  
and is challenged by regulatory requirements across the Board. 
This creates risk for the business as non-compliance can lead 
to financial penalties, reputational damage and the loss of 
licences to operate.
The Company manages its regulatory risk with input from its 
legal advisors and seeks to balance regulatory requirements 
with those of the business. The Company works with its 
lawyers to produce regular updates so that the Board and 
Audit Committee understand what is happening in the 
regulatory landscape.
During 2016, the Audit Committee received a detailed 
regulatory briefing from the Company’s lawyers and 
reviewed updates on the management of regulatory risk from 
management, as well as reviewing the status of litigation 
involving 888 and the accounting for 888’s obligations in the 
financial statements.
Taxation 
The Board oversees and sets the Company’s tax strategy and 
evaluates tax risk. In undertaking this task the Company uses 
its legal advisors and receives reports from its external auditors 
on its audit work. During the year, the Company’s legal advisors 
have kept the Audit Committee apprised of both existing and 
emerging tax risks and, where appropriate, these have been 
elevated to the Board for consideration in conjunction with 
888’s commercial strategy.
In 2016, the Board and Audit Committee again received a 
detailed tax briefing from the Company’s lawyers regarding 
tax, VAT and gaming duty obligations to which the Group may 
be exposed. The Committee noted that the Group registered 
for taxes in relevant jurisdictions in order to ensure timely 
reporting and payment on the correct basis in the appropriate 
jurisdictions, whilst reserving its position concerning contesting 
its liability in appropriate cases. Uncertainty remains as to 
whether VAT is due in respect of certain services provided by 
888 to customers in some EU Member States prior to 2015. 
However, based on a legal assessment, the Board and the 
Committee again concluded that it is unlikely that any liability 
will arise and again decided not to record any liability in the 
financial statements.
For further information, see notes 8 and 26 to the 
financial statements.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
continued STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
Goodwill and intangible assets 
As set out in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, 
888 has significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
relating to the acquisitions of businesses and the development 
of gaming platforms and software. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the cash flow forecasts 
supporting the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets including the key assumptions and estimates, and 
satisfied itself that no impairments were required in relation 
to carrying values. In addition, the appropriateness of the 
capitalisation of costs relating to the development of gaming 
platforms and software was reviewed in light of reports 
received from management and the external auditor. 
IT systems
888’s IT systems are complex and in the main are developed  
in house. The success of the business relies on the 
development of IT platforms which are innovative and 
appealing to customers. In addition, the integrity and security 
of the IT systems are vital from a commercial standpoint.
During the year, the Audit Committee has reviewed 
reports from management on data security and disaster 
recovery planning. In addition, the Committee reviewed a 
report of the Company’s external auditor regarding the IT 
control environment.
Internal controls and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the 
Company maintains a sound system of internal control. 
There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control 
and no system can provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatements, loss or failure. Equally, no system can guarantee 
elimination of the risk of failure to meet the objectives of 
the business. Against this background, the Committee has 
continued to help the Board develop and maintain an approach 
to risk management which incorporates risk appetite and 
tolerance, the framework within which risk is managed and  
the responsibility and procedures pertaining to application  
of the policy.
The Company is proactive in ensuring that corporate and 
operational risks are identified, assessed and managed by 
identifying suitable controls. A corporate risk register is 
maintained which details:
1. The risks and impact they may have
2. Actions to mitigate risks
3. Risk scores to highlight the likelihood and implications  
of occurrence
4. The owners of risks
5. Target dates for actions to mitigate.
A description of the principal risks is set out on pages 27  
to 30.
The Board has confirmed that it has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 888, including those 
which threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. 
In addition to the matters described above, the work of the 
Committee during the year included:
 ♦ Reviewing the draft interim and annual reports  
and considering:
1. The accounting principles, policies and practices adopted 
and the adequacy of related disclosures in the reports;
2. The significant accounting issues, estimates and judgments 
of management in relation to financial reporting;
3. Whether any significant adjustments were required arising 
from the audit;
4. Compliance with statutory tax obligations and the 
Company’s tax policy;
5. Whether the information set out in the Strategic Report 
was balanced, comprehensive, clear and concise 
and covered both positive and negative aspects of 
performance; and
6. Whether the use of “alternative performance measures” 
obscured IFRS measures.
 ♦ Meeting with internal and external auditors, both with and 
in the absence of the Executive Directors.
 ♦ Overseeing the management of the Company’s 
whistleblowing procedures which contain procedures for 
the Committee to receive, in confidence, complaints and 
notifications on all operational matters.
 ♦ Reporting to the Board on how it has discharged  
its responsibilities.
 ♦ Making recommendations to the Board in respect of 
its findings in respect of all of the above matters.
 ♦ Reviewing the going concern position of 888 and 
the Viability Statement set out on page 35.
The Board considers that the processes undertaken by the 
Audit Committee continue to be appropriately robust and 
effective and in compliance with the guidance issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. During the year, the Board has  
not been advised by the Audit Committee of, nor identified 
itself, any failings, frauds or weaknesses in internal control 
which it has determined to be material in the context of the 
financial statements.
The Committee believes that appropriate internal controls 
are in place through the Group, that 888 has a well-defined 
organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility and a 
comprehensive financial reporting system. The Committee also 
believes that the Company complies with the FRC Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. 70
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
Performance of Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s performance was evaluated as part  
of the Board evaluation carried out during 2016, as detailed  
on page 51.
Internal auditors
The Company’s internal audit function is outsourced to 
Deloitte. The Audit Committee reviewed and modified the 
internal audit plan in accordance with the principal risks 
to 888’s business as set out in the Risk Register. It has also 
reviewed reports from Deloitte in relation to all internal audit 
work carried out during the year and monitored response and 
follow up by management to internal audit findings. In the 
past three years, the internal auditors have reviewed various 
aspects of 888’s customer services and business operations, 
finance, B2B and B2C activities, product technologies, human 
resources, global operations and regulation. In 2016, Deloitte 
issued reports on payroll audits (various locations), customer 
credits, software licences management, treasury and PSPs, 
change management, insurance, and procurement. Whilst no 
critical issues were identified by Deloitte, a number of matters 
were identified which required modifications to procedures 
and improved controls which either have been or are being 
implemented by management. The Committee has evaluated 
the performance of Deloitte and has concluded that they 
provide constructive challenge and consistently demonstrate 
a realistic and commercial view of the business.
External auditors
EY has been the Company’s external auditor since their 
appointment in 2014. The partners responsible for the external 
audit are Jose Julio Pisharello, a partner in EY’s Gibraltar 
office, and Cameron Cartmell, a partner in EY’s London 
office. Jose Julio and Cameron have been responsible for the 
audit since EY was appointed. The Committee has reviewed 
the performance of EY, a process which involved all Board 
members and senior members of 888’s finance function. The 
conclusions reached were that EY continued to perform the 
external audit in a very professional and efficient manner, and 
it was therefore the Committee’s recommendation that the 
reappointment of EY be put to shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting in May 2017. If reappointed, EY will hold 
office until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
at which accounts are laid. Given EY’s short tenure to date, 
the Board has no present plans to consider an audit tender 
process.
The Committee reviewed the reports prepared by the  
external auditors (EY) on key audit findings and any significant 
deficiencies in the financial control environment, as well as  
the recommendations made by EY to improve processes  
and controls together with management’s responses to those 
recommendations. EY did not highlight any significant internal 
control weaknesses and management has committed to 
making appropriate changes to controls in areas highlighted  
by EY. 
Non-audit work
The Audit Committee remains mindful of the attitude investors 
have to the auditors performing non-audit services, and has 
updated its approach in light of the UK auditor independence 
rules which are now operative. The Committee monitors the 
appointment of the auditors for any non-audit work involving 
fees above US$0.1 million, with a view to ensuring that non-
audit work does not compromise the Company’s auditors 
objectiveness and independence. From 2016, the Committee 
has committed to ensure that fees for non-audit services 
performed by the auditors will not exceed 70% of aggregate 
audit fees measured over a three year period, and the US$0.1 
million threshold will no longer apply.
In 2016, the external auditors carried out non-audit work 
for 888 involving fees in the aggregate amount of US$0.3 
million (2015: US$3.4 million, out of which US$3.3 million was 
associated with the proposed acquisition of bwin.party digital 
entertainment plc). The non-audit work carried out in 2016 
included audit-related and IT assurance work and corporate 
finance services relating to the proposed transaction between 
the Company, William Hill plc and Rank Group plc which 
eventually did not proceed. With regard to the latter services, 
information barriers were implemented between the EY team 
involved in audit of the Company’s financial statements and 
the independent team which were separately engaged to carry 
out the review of the proposed transaction. The Board took the 
decision to engage EY for the corporate finance work in light 
of the cost effectiveness and timing benefits to the Company 
given EY’s familiarity with the online gaming industry. Going 
forward and in line with the Board’s policy the Committee 
will ensure that fees for non-audit services performed by the 
auditors will not exceed 70% of aggregate audit fees measured 
over a three year period.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND RESPONSE TO THAT RISK
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, 
we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, 
consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas. 
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded  
to the Audit Committee
Regulatory and legal risks
 ♦ Given the industry and jurisdictions  
in which the Group operates,  
as described in the Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties on page 27, there  
is a risk that the Group will operate 
without an appropriate licence,  
have an existing licence adversely 
affected or be subject to other 
regulatory sanctions.
 ♦ Judgement is also applied in 
estimating amounts payable  
to regulatory authorities in certain 
jurisdictions. This gives rise to a risk 
over the accuracy of accruals and 
disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
There is also a risk that management 
may influence these significant 
estimates and judgements in order  
to meet market expectations or  
bonus targets.
 ♦ Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 67; significant accounting 
policies (Note 2 on page 82); and 
Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 111).
 ♦ We understood the Group’s process  
and related controls over the 
identification and mitigation of 
regulatory and legal risks and the  
related accounting, and assessed 
whether the controls are designed 
effectively to achieve this.
 ♦ We inquired of management and 
the Group’s legal advisers about any 
known instances of material breaches 
in regulatory or licence compliance 
that needed to be disclosed or 
required accruals to be recorded.
 ♦ Based on the Group’s correspondence 
with regulators and any legal advice 
the Group has received, we understood 
management’s interpretation and 
application of relevant laws and 
regulations. With support from 
our own indirect tax experts, we 
challenged the appropriateness of its 
assumptions and estimates in relation 
to accruals and contingent liabilities 
with reference to historical payments 
made by the Group and the period to 
which any accrued liabilities relate.
Based on our audit procedures on the 
Group’s accounting conclusions in each 
of its major jurisdictions, we concluded 
that the accruals for amounts payable to 
regulatory authorities are conservative, 
within an acceptable range and that the 
disclosures in the financial statements  
were appropriate.
Taxation
 ♦ The Group recognised a taxation  
charge of US$7.7 million in 2016  
(2015: US$3.0 million) and had income 
tax receivables of US$1.1 million  
(2015: US$2.7 million) and payables 
of US$0.1 million at 31 December 2016 
(2015: US$2.8 million).
 ♦ The Group operates in a number of 
countries, resulting in complexities in 
the payment of and accounting for tax. 
The Group faces a risk that given the 
international nature of its operations, 
material tax exposures may not be 
appropriately provided or disclosed in 
the financial statements.
 ♦ Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 67); significant accounting  
policies (Note 2 on page 82); and  
Notes 8 and 14 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (pages 94 
and 101).
 ♦ We discussed with management  
and its legal advisers, with support 
from our tax experts, how the Group  
manages and controls the companies  
in countries in which it operates.
 ♦ We obtained and read the results  
of the third party tax studies  
obtained by the Group and read  
its correspondence with the relevant 
tax authorities, in order to support  
the tax position of the Group.
 ♦ With support from our international 
tax experts we understood 
management’s interpretation and 
application of relevant tax law and, 
based on our experience challenged 
the appropriateness of its assumptions 
and estimates in relation to provisions 
and contingent liabilities. We also 
compared the prior year estimate  
to amounts actually paid.
 ♦ We considered whether the Group’s 
disclosure of its tax estimates were 
in accordance with IFRS requirements.
We concluded that management’s 
judgements in relation to the taxation 
charge, provisions for taxation and the 
related disclosures were appropriate. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue recognition
 ♦ The Group recognised revenue  
of US$520.8 million in 2016  
(2015: US$462.1 million).
 ♦ The Group makes a number of 
judgements in recognising revenue, 
principally in respect of whether the 
Group is acting as a principal or an  
agent with its B2B customers and 
whether certain customer bonuses  
are treated as a deduction from 
revenue or as a cost. Any inappropriate 
judgements could result in a material 
misstatement of revenue and operating 
expenses. There is also a risk that 
management may override controls to 
influence the significant judgements in 
respect of revenue recognition in order 
to meet market expectations.
 ♦ Refer to the significant accounting 
policies (Note 2 on page 82); and 
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 89).
 ♦ We understood and tested the key 
application and manual controls  
over the Group’s principal gaming 
systems. We then applied IT-based 
auditing techniques to re-perform  
the reconciliation between the  
Group’s gaming revenue, cash and 
customer accounts. We also agreed  
a sample of revenue transactions  
to customers’ cash deposits.
 ♦ We read the Group’s contractual 
arrangements and observed how 
they operate in practice to check 
management’s judgement as to  
whether the Group was operating  
as a principal or an agent in its B2B 
contracts with customers, in the context 
of the guidance in IAS 18. We also 
challenged the treatment of certain 
customer bonuses by considering  
the customer’s contractual obligations 
in respect of these bonuses to provide 
marketing services.
We concluded that the revenue recognised 
in the year, including in respect of its B2B 
contracts and the treatment of certain 
customer bonuses, is materially correct.
Capitalisation of development costs
 ♦ The Group capitalised development 
costs of US$10.6 million in 2016  
(2015: US$6.8 million) and had net 
capitalised development costs of 
US$28.8 million at 31 December 2016 
(2015: US$26.5 million).
 ♦ The capitalisation of costs associated 
with the development of the Group’s 
systems, in accordance with the  
criteria set out in IFRS, involves 
significant management judgement 
and is therefore an area of focus for 
our audit. There is a risk that costs are 
capitalised inappropriately, affecting  
the Group’s profitability. There is also  
a risk that management may override 
controls to influence the significant 
judgements in respect of the 
capitalisation of development costs 
in order to meet market expectations 
or bonus targets.
 ♦ Refer to the significant accounting 
policies (Note 2 on page 82); and 
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (pages 96 and 97).
 ♦ We understood and tested the  
process and key controls over the 
Group’s capitalisation of internal 
development costs, including its  
payroll and purchasing systems.
 ♦ For development projects capitalised 
in the year, we made enquiries of 
management with respect to technical 
feasibility of a sample of projects to 
challenge whether the Group met 
the conditions set out in IAS 38 for 
capitalisation. We also tested on a 
sample basis external supplier and 
internal payroll costs capitalised.
 ♦ We considered the impact of the 
capitalisation of development costs 
on the Group’s achievement of bonus 
targets and analysts’ expectations.
 ♦ We compared the useful lives of 
capitalised development costs to 
the Group’s business plans for each 
development project and to historical 
experience of project lives in the online 
gaming industry.
 ♦ We checked that where projects are not 
yet in use and no amortisation has been 
charged, they are still expected to be 
implemented and meet the conditions 
set out in IAS 38.
We concluded that the Group’s 
capitalisation of development costs  
during 2016 was appropriate and in 
accordance with IAS 38.
The above risk areas are consistent with those in the prior year other than that the classification and presentation of exceptional 
items was an area of focus for our 2015 audit given their quantum. However, following a significant reduction in exceptional items 
to US$3.9 million in 2016 (2015: US$23.0 million), auditing this area no longer constitutes a significant proportion of audit effort 
or audit strategy. The Group’s exceptional items are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.  74

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our  
audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, 
changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work  
to be performed at each entity.
The Group operates from a small number of locations and as an online gaming operator the Group’s accounting is centrally 
managed. In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, we determined that there were  
two components, one being a subsidiary in Israel and the other being the remainder of the Group.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of both of these components (“full scope”). The components  
we audited therefore account for the entirety of the Group’s revenue, profit before tax and total assets. This is consistent  
with our approach in the prior year.
 
Involvement with component teams
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken  
at each of the components by us, as the Group audit team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms 
operating under our instruction. The Israeli subsidiary was subject to a full scope audit by a component team in Israel and  
the remainder of the Group was audited directly, as a full scope audit, by the Group audit team. 
The Group audit team performed the majority of its audit fieldwork in Israel and Gibraltar, with visits to both locations  
at the planning, interim and year end phases of the audit.
During these visits the Group audit team attended audit planning and closing meetings, the Group’s Audit Committee  
meetings and conducted and reviewed audit work. For the Israeli subsidiary, in addition to the location visits the Group  
audit team interacted regularly during the various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers, participated in the 
component team’s planning, including its discussion of fraud and error and were responsible for the scope and direction  
of the audit process. The allocation of responsibilities between the Group audit team and the Israeli component team was  
such that the audit work on each of the areas of risk described above was led by the Group audit team. This, together with  
the procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements  
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
“The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and 
extent of our audit procedures.”
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$3.2 million (2015: US$2.7 million), which is approximately 5% (2015: 5%)  
of profit before tax and exceptional items. 
We believe that profit before tax, adjusted for the exceptional items described below, provides us with a consistent year on year 
basis for determining materiality and is the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the Group. The increase 
from the prior year predominately reflects continued growth achieved by the Group.
In calculating materiality, we excluded the effects of certain non-recurring exceptional items from profit before tax. For 2016, 
these related to the exceptional acquisition costs of US$0.9 million and exceptional retroactive duties and associated charges of 
US$3.0 million, as highlighted in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and adjusted our materiality to reflect the reported profit before 
tax and exceptional items. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
75
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
Performance materiality
“The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately  
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.”
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% (2015: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely US$2.4 million (2015: US$1.35 million). 
We increased our performance materiality from 50% to 75% due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a reduction  
in the risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.
Audit work at the Israeli subsidiary for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for that component is 
based on its relative scale and risk to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.  
In the current year, the performance materiality allocated to the Israeli subsidiary was US$1.3 million (2015: US$0.6 million).  
The audit work on the remainder of the Group was undertaken using Group materiality.
Reporting threshold
“An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.”
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$160,000 
(2015: US$135,000), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Statement of Responsibilities set out on page 46, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also 
responsible for the preparation of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, which they have chosen to prepare, being under no 
obligation to do so under Gibraltar law, and the preparation of the Corporate Governance Statement and statement on going 
concern under the Listing Rules. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014 and  
our engagement letter dated 30 November 2015. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required  
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE GIBRALTAR COMPANIES ACT 2014
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and has been properly prepared in accordance with the Act. 76

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Company description and activities 
888 Holdings Public Limited Company (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) was founded in 1997 in 
the British Virgin Islands and since 17 December 2003 has been domiciled in Gibraltar (Company number 90099). On 4 October 
2005, the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Group is the owner of innovative proprietary software solutions providing a range of virtual online gaming services over  
the internet, including Casino and games, Poker, Bingo, Sport, Emerging Offerings (comprising Mytopia social games), and  
brand licensing revenue on third party platforms. These services are provided to end users (“B2C”) and to business partners 
through its business to business unit, Dragonfish (“B2B”). In addition, the Group provides payment services, customer support 
and online advertising.
Definitions 
In these financial statements: 
The Company  888 Holdings Public Limited Company.
The Group  888 Holdings Public Limited Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries  Companies over which the Company has control (as defined in IFRS 10 –  
Consolidated Financial Statements) and whose accounts are consolidated  
with those of the Company.
Related parties  As defined in IAS 24 – Related Party Disclosures.
Joint ventures and associates  As defined in IFRS 11 – Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 – Investments in Associates  
and Joint Ventures.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows: 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”), including International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and Interpretations adopted by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), endorsed for use by companies listed on an EU regulated market. The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for available for sale investments and derivative 
financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value.
The Group has changed its operating segments in the year to reflect a change in the way that the business is managed  
and reported internally. Sport is now presented separately, having previously been reported in Emerging Offerings.  
Brand licensing on third party platforms, which was previously included in Emerging Offerings, is now included in the  
B2B segment. The comparative segment results for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been restated to reflect this  
change, as described in note 3.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars (US$ million) because that is the currency the Group  
primarily operates in. 
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014. 
The significant accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements in the prior year have been applied 
consistently in these consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the amendments to accounting standards  
adopted during 2016. These are described in more detail below.
The following amendments to IAS, issued by the IASB and adopted by the EU, were effective from 1 January 2016 and 
have been adopted by the Group during the year with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position:
 ♦ Amendments to IAS 1 – Disclosure Initiative.
 ♦ Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation.
 ♦ Amendments to IAS 27 – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements.
 ♦ Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 – Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception.
 ♦ Amendments to IFRS 11 – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations.
 ♦ Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle, including minor amendments to IFRS 5 – Non-Current Assets Held for Sale  
and Discontinued Operations, IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 – Employee Benefits and  
IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting.  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The following standards, interpretations and amendments issued by the IASB have not been adopted by the Group as they 
were not effective for the year. The Group is currently assessing the impact these standards and amendments will have on the 
presentation of, and recognition in, its consolidated results in future periods:
 ♦ Amendments to IAS 7 – Disclosure initiative (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017).

Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU requires the Group to make estimates 
and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions 
which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the future.  
These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, which include further commentary  
on the nature of the estimates and judgements made, can be found below: 
Revenue
The Group applies judgement in determining whether it is acting as a principal or an agent where it provides services to business 
partners through its business to business unit. In making these judgements the Group considers, by examining each contract 
with its business partners, which party has the primary responsibility for providing the services and is exposed to the majority  
of the risks and rewards associated with providing the services, as well as if it has latitude in establishing prices, either directly  
or indirectly. This is described in further detail in the revenue accounting policy set out below.
Taxation
Due to the international nature of the Group and the complexity of tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates, the 
Group applies judgement in estimating the likely outcome of tax matters and the resultant provision for income taxes. However, 
in 2015 and early 2016 the Group reached agreement on a number of tax matters with tax authorities in the key jurisdictions from 
which it operates. These agreements materially reduce the level of judgement to be made in preparing the financial statements. 
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are appropriate. For further information see note 8. 84

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. For further information see note 11. 
Internally generated intangible assets
Costs relating to internally generated intangible assets, are capitalised if the criteria for recognition as assets are met. 
The initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgment that technological and economic feasibility criteria are 
met. In making this judgement, management considers the progress made in each development project and its latest forecasts 
for each project. Other expenditure is charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which the expenditure 
is incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. For further information see note 11. 
Contingent liabilities and regulatory matters
The Group makes a number of judgements in respect of the accounting for and disclosure of expenses and contingent liabilities 
for regulatory matters, including gaming duties. These are described in further detail in note 26.
 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are companies 
controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company. Control exists where the Company has power over an entity; exposure, or 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity; and the ability to use its power over an entity to affect the amount 
of its returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Parent gained control until such time as control ceases. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of 
accounting. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any 
excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using consistent 
accounting policies. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised provided that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be  
reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred after deduction  
of certain promotional bonuses granted to customers and VAT, and after adding the fees and charges applied to customer 
accounts, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. 
Revenue consists of income from online activities and income generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer 
deposit and withdrawals and account fees, which is allocated to each reporting segment. 
Revenue from online activities comprises:
Casino and Bingo
Casino and Bingo online gaming revenue is represented by the difference between the amounts of bets placed by customers 
less amounts won, adjusted for the fair value of certain promotional bonuses granted to customers and the value of loyalty 
points accrued.
Poker 
Poker online gaming revenue represents the commission charged from each poker hand in ring games and entry fees for 
participation in Poker tournaments less the fair value of certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued.  
In Poker tournaments entry fee revenue is recognised when the tournament has concluded. 
Sport
Sport online gaming revenue comprises bets placed less payouts to customers, adjusted for the fair value of open betting positions.
Emerging Offerings 
Revenue from Emerging Offerings is mainly comprised of Social games. Revenue represents the Group’s share from the sale  
of virtual goods to customers playing the Group’s games.  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
B2B 
Revenue from B2B is mainly comprised of services provided to business partners and brand licensing on third party platforms.
 ♦ For services provided to business partners through its B2B unit, the Group considers whether for each customer it is acting as 
a principal or as an agent by considering which party has the primary responsibility for providing the services and is exposed 
to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with providing the services, as well as if it has latitude in establishing prices, 
either directly or indirectly:
 ♦ Where the Group is considered to be the principal, income is recognised as the gross revenue generated from use of 
the Group’s platform in online gaming activities with the partners’ share of the revenue charged to marketing expenses. 
 ♦ In other cases income is recognised as the Group share of the net revenue generated from use of the Group’s platform.
 ♦ B2B also includes fees from the provision of certain gaming related services to partners.
 ♦ Customer advances received are treated as deferred income within current liabilities and released as they are earned.
 ♦ Revenue derived from brand licensing on third party platforms represents the Group’s net revenue share from that activity.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses consists primarily of staff costs, payment service providers’ commissions, chargebacks, commission  
and royalties payable to third parties, all of which are recognised on an accruals basis, and depreciation and amortisation.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs and corporate professional expenses, both of which are recognised  
on an accruals basis.
Exceptional items
The Group classifies and presents certain items of income and expense as exceptional, as the Group considers that it allows 
for a better reflection of the underlying performance of the Group. The Group also seeks to present a measure of underlying 
performance which is not impacted by exceptional items. These measures are described as “adjusted” and are used by the 
management to measure and monitor the Group’s underlying performance. The Group considers any non-recurring items  
of income and expense for classification as exceptional by virtue of their nature and size. The items classified as exceptional  
(and are excluded from the adjusted measures) are described in further detail in note 5.
Foreign currency 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant company are 
translated into that functional currency using year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange rate differences on foreign currency 
transactions are included in financial income or financial expenses in the consolidated income statement, as appropriate. 
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US$ are translated  
into the presentation currency at foreign exchange rates as set out below. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recorded  
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a component of other comprehensive income. 
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average is not  
a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income 
and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions).
Taxation 
The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs 
from its tax base. They are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted 
to those instances where it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the difference can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit. The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/assets are settled/recovered. 86

Intangible assets 
Acquired intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately consist mainly of software licences and domain names and are capitalised at cost. Those 
acquired as part of a business combination are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably. 
These intangible assets are amortised over the useful life of the assets, which for software licences is between one and five years 
and for domain names is five years. 
Internally generated intangible assets 
Expenditure incurred on development activities of gaming platform is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new 
or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and 
the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is expensed. Subsequent 
expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset 
to which it relates. The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between three and five years, except for certain licence 
costs which are amortised over either the life of the licence, or up to 20 years, whichever is the shorter period.
Goodwill and business combinations
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration in a business combination over the Group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Consideration comprises the fair value of any 
assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued.
 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income 
statement and not subsequently reversed. Where the fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed 
the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition. 
Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are charged or credited to the consolidated income statement.  
In addition, the direct costs of acquisition are charged immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets are assessed at each balance 
sheet date for indicators of impairment. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their 
estimated residual values over their expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rates are as follows: 
IT equipment 33%
Office furniture and equipment 7-15%
Motor vehicles 15%
Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually and where applicable an impairment loss is recognised immediately  
in the consolidated income statement. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount (being the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly 
through the consolidated income statement. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on 
the asset’s cash generating unit (i.e. the smallest group of assets to which the asset belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable and largely independent cash inflows).  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Investment in equity accounted joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are those entities over relevant activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement  
and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. 
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence over  
the financial and operational policies but does not have control or joint control over those policies.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The Group’s  
share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses in excess  
of the Group’s investment in the joint ventures and associates are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good 
those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures or associates are recognised only to the 
extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the joint ventures and associates. The investor’s share in the profits and losses of the 
investment resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the investment.
Any premium paid above the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the investment. Where there is objective evidence that the investment has 
been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets, and 
any charge or reversal of previous impairments is taken to the consolidated income statement.
 
Where amounts paid for an investment in joint venture and associates are in excess of the Group’s share of the fair value of net 
assets acquired, the excess is recognised as negative goodwill and released to the consolidated income statement immediately.
The Group’s share of additional equity contributions from other joint venture partners is taken to the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.
 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and principally comprise 
amounts due from credit card companies and from e-payment companies. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when 
collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence that the full 
amount may not be collected. 
Fair value measurement
The Group measures certain financial instruments, including derivatives and available for sale investments, at fair value at each 
balance sheet date. The fair value related disclosures are included in notes 24 and 25. Fair value is the price that would be 
received or paid in an orderly transaction between market participants at a particular date, either in the principal market for  
the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for that asset or liability accessible 
to the Group.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available  
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The inputs  
are categorised into three levels, with the highest level (level 1) given to inputs for which there are unadjusted quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level (level 3) given to unobservable inputs. Level 2 inputs are 
directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices.
 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge operational 
risks associated with foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are carried in 
the consolidated balance sheet as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains 
or losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are  
readily convertible to known amounts of cash. They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of three 
months or less.  88

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Equity 
Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received from the issue of shares, net of direct issue costs. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Liabilities to customers 
Liabilities to customers comprise the amounts that are credited to customers’ bankroll (the Group’s electronic “wallet”), including 
provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less fees and charges applied to customer accounts, along with full progressive 
provision for jackpots. These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions.
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which  
it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated. 
 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this  
is when declared by the Board of Directors and paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders  
at the Annual General Meeting.
 
Share benefit charges 
Equity-settled
Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares or options, the cost of those awards, recognised in the 
consolidated income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity, is measured with reference  
to the fair value at the date of grant. Market performance conditions are taken into account in determining the fair value at the 
date of grant. Non-market performance conditions, including service conditions, are taken into account by adjusting the number 
of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the 
vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest. 
Cash-settled
For transactions treated as cash-settled share benefit charges, the Company recognises an expense in the consolidated 
income statement and a corresponding liability as the employees render services. 
Until the liability is settled, the Company measures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date 
of settlement, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to the consolidated income statement. 
 
Severance pay schemes
Severance pay scheme surpluses and deficits are measured as:
 ♦ the fair value of plan assets at the reporting date; less
 ♦ plan liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method, discounted to its present value using yields available  
for the appropriate government bonds that have maturity dates appropriate to the terms of the liabilities; plus
 ♦ unrecognised past service costs.
Remeasurements of the net severance pay scheme assets and liabilities, including actuarial gains and losses on the scheme 
liabilities due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme and any differences between the interest income  
and the actual return on assets, are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which 
they arise.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Group or Company enters into financial guarantee contracts these are classified as financial liabilities and measured  
at fair value, by estimating the probability of the guarantees being called upon and the related cash outflows from the Group  
or Company. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3 SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group has changed its operating segments in the year to reflect a change in the way that the business is managed and 
reported internally. Sport is now presented separately, having previously been reported in Emerging Offerings. Brand licensing  
on third party platforms, which was previously included in Emerging Offerings, is now included in the B2B segment. 
Segmental results are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team comprising mainly the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer. The operating segments identified are: 
 ♦ B2C (Business to Customer): including Casino and games, Poker, Bingo, Sport and Emerging Offering; and
 ♦ B2B (Business to Business): offering Total Gaming Services under the Dragonfish trading brand. Dragonfish offers to its 
business partners use of technology, software, operations, E-payments and advanced marketing services, through the 
provision of offline/online marketing, management of affiliates, search engine optimisation (SEO), customer relationship 
management (CRM) and business analytics. 
There has been no aggregation of these two operating segments for reporting purposes. The management team continues 
to assess the performance of operating segments based on revenue and segment profit, being revenue net of chargebacks, 
payment service providers’ commissions, gaming duties, royalties payable to third parties, selling and marketing expenses.

Severance pay scheme – Israel 
The Group’s employees in Israel are eligible to receive certain benefits from the Group in specific circumstances on leaving the 
Group. As such the Group operates a defined benefit severance pay plan which requires contributions to be made to separately 
administrated funds. 
The current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are measured using the projected unit  
credit method.

Total tax charge for the year     7.7 3.0
Current tax is calculated with reference to the profit of the Company and its subsidiaries in their respective countries  
of operation. Set out below are details in respect of the significant jurisdictions where the Group operates and the factors  
that influenced the current and deferred taxation in those jurisdictions:
Gibraltar
Gibraltar companies are subject to a corporate tax rate of 10%. During 2015, the Group changed certain elements of its tax 
calculation in Gibraltar, which have been agreed with the tax authorities. These changes resulted in adjustments in respect  
of prior years in 2015 and have been applied consistently in 2016.
Israel
The domestic corporate tax rate in Israel in 2016 is 25% (2015: 26.5%). From 1 January 2017 the rate has been reduced to 24%. 
Prior to reporting its 2015 results, the Company’s Israeli subsidiary concluded an assessment agreement with respect to all tax 
years up to and including 2013 and entered into certain transfer pricing agreements with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner  
as regards 2014-2015. This agreement resulted in adjustment in respect of prior years in 2015. The tax charge has increased  
in the current year as a result of tax payable on dividends distributed to 888 Holdings plc.
UK
The Group’s subsidiary in the UK is subject to a corporate tax rate of 20% (2015: 20.25%). During the year, in addition  
to the previously enacted reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from April 2017, the UK government announced  
and substantively enacted a further reduction to 17% from April 2020.

9 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share 
Earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share takes into account all potentially 
dilutive equity instruments granted, which are not included in the number of shares for basic earnings per share. Certain equity 
instruments have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their conditions of being issued were not deemed to 
satisfy the performance conditions at the end of the performance period or it will not be advantageous for holders to exercise 
them into shares, in the case of options. The number of equity instruments included in the diluted EPS calculation consist  
of 7,688,394 Ordinary Shares (2015: 3,423,108) and 101,447 market-value options (2015: 158,484).
The number of equity instruments excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 1,551,580 (2015: 3,051,243).

The Directors believe that EPS excluding exceptional items, share benefit charges and share of post-tax loss of equity accounted 
associates (“Adjusted EPS”) better reflects the underlying performance of the business and assists in providing a clearer view of 
the performance of the Group.

one-off dividend of 10.5¢ per share, both of which will be recognised in the 2017 financial statements once approved.
In 2015 an interim dividend of 3.5¢ per share was paid on 30 September 2015 (US$12.5 million) and a final dividend of 4¢ per share

Impairment
In accordance with IAS 36 and the Group’s stated accounting policy an impairment test is carried out annually on the carrying 
amounts of goodwill and a review for indicators of impairment is carried out for other non-current assets. Where an impairment 
test was carried out, the carrying value is compared to the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash generating unit. In each 
case, the recoverable amount was the value in use of the assets, which was determined by discounting the future cash flows of 
the relevant asset or cash generating unit to their present value.
Goodwill – Bingo online business 
Goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Bingo online business unit arose following the acquisition of the Bingo 
online business of Globalcom Limited during 2007 and the acquisition of the Wink Bingo business in 2009. The income streams 
generated from the Bingo online business, comprising the B2C Bingo cash generating unit and the B2B cash generating unit, 
have been considered together as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed to be sufficiently 
similar. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Key assumptions and inputs used 
Cash flow projections have been prepared for a five year period, following which a long term growth rate has been assumed. 
Underlying growth rates, as shown in the table below, have been applied to revenue and are based on past experience,  
including the positive results in 2016 and 2015 and projections of future changes in the online gaming market. Key assumptions  
in preparing these cash flow projections include moderate growth in revenue, a stable level of costs per customer acquisition  
and the expectation that the Group will continue to operate and be subject to gaming duties (including incremental UK remote 
gaming duty commencing August 2017 driven by the intention to introduce a tax charge on all freeplays) in its core jurisdictions.
The pre-tax discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is the Group’s specific Weighted Average Cost  
of Capital, adjusted for tax, which is considered to be appropriate for the online Bingo cash generating units.

1  The pre-tax discount rate is recalculated every year by taking into account prevailing risk free rates, equity risk premium and company beta and 
having regard to external data commenting upon the Weighted Average Cost of Capital applied to the Group. 
2  Bingo revenue is significantly affected by GBP currency changes with the vast majority of Bingo revenue denominated in GBP. The underlying 
growth rate for 2017 is effected by the expected average GBP exchange rate compared to the average GBP exchange rate in 2016. 
3  Operating expenses exclude marketing costs which are included in the projections as a fixed percentage of revenues.
The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would lead to impairment 
in the Bingo goodwill and intangible assets.
Licences
No impairment tests were considered to be required at 31 December 2016 and the carrying value of licences is considered  
to be appropriate. 
Other intangible assets 
No impairment tests were considered to be required at 31 December 2016 and the carrying value of other intangible assets

US joint ventures
In 2013 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) with Avenue OLG Entertainment LLC (“Avenue”) 
and other minority shareholders to form AAPN Holdings LLC (“AAPN”), under which the Group has a 47% interest in AAPN. 
AAPN has a 100% owned subsidiary, AAPN New Jersey LLC (“AAPN NJ”), which has a B2C gaming offering in New Jersey.
As at 31 December 2016, AGN LLC (“AGN”), the entity which contracted with a Las Vegas casino licensee in connection with  
the operation of a B2C gaming offering in Nevada, remained 100% owned by the Group. However, the Group considers that  
due to the manner in which AGN is operated under the contractual arrangements in the JVA, it is regarded as a joint venture.  
The Group also has an irrevocable commitment to contribute its ownership of AGN to AAPN for no consideration upon fulfilment 
of certain conditions.
On this basis AAPN and AGN have been equity accounted for, reflecting the Group’s effective 47% interest in their aggregated 
results and assets. 100

21 SHARE BENEFIT CHARGES 
Equity-settled share benefit charges
As at 31 December 2016 the Group has equity-settled employee shares and share options granted under two equity-
settled employee share incentive plans – the 888 All-Employee Share Plan, which expired according to its terms in 
August 2015, and the 888 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 which was adopted at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 
29 September 2015. The 888 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 is open to employees (including Executive Directors) and 
full-time consultants of the Group, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Awards under this scheme will 
vest in instalments over a fixed period of at least three years subject to the relevant individuals remaining in service. 
Certain of these awards are subject to additional performance conditions imposed by the Remuneration Committee 
at the dates of grant, further details of which are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 54.
Details of equity settled shares and share options granted as part of the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and the 888

Of these grants, 50% of each are dependent on an EPS growth target, and 50% on total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared  
to a peer group of companies. Further details of performance conditions that have to be satisfied on these awards are set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 57. The EPS growth target is taken into account when determining the number of 
shares expected to vest at each reporting date, and the TSR target is taken into account when calculating the fair value of the 
share grant. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Ordinary Shares granted for future vesting with EPS growth performance conditions are valued at the share price at grant date, 
which the Group considers approximates to the fair value. The restrictions on the shares during the vesting period, primarily 
relating to non-receipt of dividends, are considered to have an immaterial effect on the share option charge.
In accordance with IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment, a charge to the consolidated income statement in respect of any shares or 
options granted under the above schemes is recognised and spread over the vesting period of the shares or options based on 
the fair value of the shares or options at the grant date, adjusted for changes in vesting conditions at each balance sheet date. 
These charges have no cash impact. 
Cash-settled share-based payment
On 27 March 2012, the Company awarded its Chief Executive Officer (now the Chairman) a cash-settled share-based award 
(“Phantom Award”). The Phantom Award vested on 27 March 2015 as all vesting requirements were fulfilled.
Under the terms of the Phantom Award, the amount payable was calculated on an incremental basis, based on the average share 
price over a period of 20 dealing days prior to the vesting date (£1.56), resulting in an entitlement of £3.3 million (US$4.8 million).
Valuation information
As there were no outstanding cash-settled share-based payment awards at either 31 December 2016 or 31 December 2015,  
no amounts have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at either date.

24 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments. Policies and procedures for 
managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer. The Board reviews the 
effectiveness of these procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to mitigate these risks.
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows: 
 ♦ Cash and cash equivalents;
 ♦ Restricted cash;
 ♦ Trade and other receivables;
 ♦ Trade and other payables;
 ♦ Liabilities to customers;
 ♦ Available for sale financial investments.

24 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Capital
The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders. The primary objective of the Group  
is maximising shareholders’ value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most 
suited to the Group’s size, strategy, and underlying business risk. Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 25, there are no 
demands or restrictions on the Group’s capital. 
The main financial risk areas are as follows: 
Credit risk
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables, most of which are due from the Group’s payment service 
providers (PSP). These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers’ virtual 
wallets with the Group. These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of credit card companies. 
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group. The Group reduces  
this credit risk by: 
 ♦ Monitoring balances with PSPs on a regular basis.
 ♦ Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals.
 ♦ Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
 ♦ Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and “Know Your Customer” procedures.
 ♦ Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP and as a limit any concentration of risk.
The Group considers that based on the factors above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good  
credit quality and there is a low level of potential bad debt amounting to US$0.5 million arising from a PSP failing to discharge  
its obligation (2015: US$0.5 million). This has been charged to the consolidated income statement.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards (“chargebacks”)  
or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group. Customers may fail to fulfil their 
obligation to pay, which will result in funds not being collected. These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when occurring, 
will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group. As such the Group provides for these eventualities 
by way of an impairment provision based on analysis of past transactions. This provision is set off against trade receivables and 
at 31 December 2016 was US$1.4 million (2015: US$1.3 million). 
The Group’s in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following 
prevention and verification procedures using internally-developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially-available  
third party measures. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The Group controls its cash position from its Gibraltar headquarters. Subsidiaries in its other main locations maintain minimal 
cash balances as required for their operations. Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank 
accounts controlled by the Treasury function in Gibraltar. 
The Group holds its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with  
a low credit rating. The Group maintains its cash reserves in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors interest rates in order 
to maximise yield.
 
Customer funds
Customer funds are matched by customer liabilities and progressive prize pools of an equal value. 
Restricted short-term deposits
Restricted short-term deposits are short-term deposits held by banks primarily to support guarantees in respect of regulated 
markets licence requirements.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount of financial assets presented above, totalling US$204.2 million  
(2015: US$208.5 million). STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk exists where the Group might encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become due.  
The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations.

1 Excludes taxes payable and deferred income. 
Market risk
Currency risk 
The Group’s financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: 
 ♦ Mismatches between customer deposits, which are predominantly denominated in US$, and the net receipts from customers, 
which are settled in the currency of the customer’s choice and of which Pounds Sterling (GBP) and Euros (EUR) are the  
most significant.
 ♦ Mismatches between reported revenue, which is mainly generated in US$ (the Group’s reporting currency and the functional 
currency of the majority of its subsidiaries), and a significant portion of deposits settled in local currencies. 
 ♦ Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including Pounds Sterling (GBP), Euros (EUR)  
and New Israeli Shekels (ILS).
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure  
is kept to an acceptable level. This includes the use of foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact 
of known liabilities when considered appropriate.
At 31 December 2016 the Group does not have any open foreign exchange forward contracts. 110

Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds. 
The Group’s policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds and in interest bearing bank accounts. The Group 
arranges for excess funds to be placed in these interest bearing accounts with its principal bankers in order to maximise 
availability of funds for investments. 
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no floating rates borrowings. Given current low interest rates a 0.5% 
downward movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year. However, a 0.5% 
increase in interest rates would, based on the year end deposits, increase annual profits by US$0.8 million. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016
25 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
At 31 December 2016 and 2015, the Group’s available for sale investment is measured at fair value. For the remaining financial 
assets and liabilities, the Group considers that the book value approximates to fair value.
Other financial instruments carried at fair value are not considered material. There were no changes in valuation techniques  
or transfers between categories in the period.
26 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS
(a) As part of the Board’s ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, it continues to monitor  
legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate advice  
in respect of these developments. 
(b) Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time to time the Group has received notices, 
communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect of its activities. 
The Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of success of such actions. 
Based on this advice and the nature of the actions, for the majority of these matters the Board is unable to quantify  
reliably any material outflow of funds that may result, if any, and has not made any provisions. For matters where an  
outflow of resources is probable and can be measured reliably, amounts have been accrued in the financial statements.  
These amounts are not material at 31 December 2016.
(c) The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions. Accordingly, and on the basis of tax advice obtained, the Group is filing 
tax returns, providing for and paying all taxes and duties it believes are due based on local tax laws and transfer pricing 
agreements. The Group is also periodically subject to audits and assessments by local taxing authorities. 
 There is significant uncertainty as to whether VAT is due in respect of certain services provided by the Group to customers in 
certain European Union Member States prior to 2015. These uncertainties are in respect of the determination of the place of 
supply of some or all of the services provided by the Group prior to 2015 and, insofar as the place of supply is determined to 
be the Member State in which the customer is located, whether a possible imposition of VAT on relevant services by certain 
Member States would be lawful. There is also uncertainty in certain Member States surrounding the tax base to be applied in 
the event that it is ultimately determined that VAT is due on any relevant services. Based on a thorough legal assessment, the 
Group considers that it is unlikely that any liability will arise and has, therefore, not recorded any liability in the Group financial 
statements. Furthermore, given the uncertainties surrounding the quantification of any VAT which may be payable, the Board 
believes that any attempt to either estimate or quantify the range of the amounts which may reasonably be in dispute would 
potentially be misleading and may be prejudicial to the Group’s position in defending any claims for past VAT.
 In respect of other taxes and duties, other than as provided in the Group financial statements, the Board considers it unlikely 
that any further liability will arise from the final settlement of such assessments.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 GENERAL INFORMATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A description of the Company, its activities and definitions are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union and on an historical basis.
The Company applies consistent accounting policies, as applied by the Group. To the extent that an accounting policy  
is relevant to both Group and Company financial statements, refer to the Group financial statements for disclosure of the 
accounting policy (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Material policies that apply to the Company only  
are included as appropriate.
Investment in subsidiaries
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. 
Share-based payments
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings  
is recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements as an adjustment to its investment in subsidiaries with  
an opposite adjustment to equity. The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 adjustment in its income statement with  
a credit (debit) to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from (dividend to) the Company.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements – impairment testing of investments in and amounts  
due from subsidiaries
The Company’s investments in and amounts due from subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against  
the underlying value of the subsidiaries’ assets.
Under Section 288 of the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own  
income statement. 
2 INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
The Company’s principal subsidiaries are listed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. In the Company’s  
financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less provision for any impairment. The Group applies  
IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment. Consequently, the Company recognises as a cost of investment the value of its own shares  
that it makes available for the purpose of granting share options to employees or contractors of its subsidiaries. The movement 
in investment in subsidiaries during the year was US$8.3 million (2015: US$2.2 million) included within this were share-based 
payment charges of US$6.2 million in 2016 (2015: US$2.1 million) and a capital contribution of US$2.1 million in respect  
of incorporation of a new subsidiary.

At 31 December 2016, the net amounts owed by subsidiaries to the Company were US$60.6 million (2015: US$53.0 million). 
10 DEFERRED TAXES 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s deferred tax assets and 
liabilities resulting from temporary differences, some of which are expected to be settled on a net basis, are as follows:

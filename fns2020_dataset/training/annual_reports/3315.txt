Chairman’s Statement
Key positioning
within prolific South Atlantic margins
“Our key focus is 
on developing our 
Namibian assets 
whilst at the same 
time looking to 
bring the first oil 
date forward.”
Peter Kidney 
Non-Executive Chairman
It is with pleasure that I present the 
latest results for Chariot Oil & Gas 
Limited, reporting on a year that saw 
transformational changes within our 
Company. The Board was delighted to 
welcome Paul Welch as CEO in October 
2009 and Chariot has made significant 
steps forward with our exploration in 
Namibia, furthered efforts on numerous 
new business opportunities and built a 
strong in-house technical team. The 
Board was also very pleased to 
welcome George Canjar who joined us 
as a non-executive director post period.  
He has extensive experience in the oil 
and gas industry which will be of great 
value to us going forward.
Namibia – frontier region, high 
impact exploration
Since our last report, there have been a 
number of major discoveries in deeper 
water environments. Brazilian 
exploration continues its unprecedented 
success and high profile discoveries 
have also been reported in West Africa, 
both in the established West African 
Basins and in new offshore areas such 
as Ghana and Sierra Leone.  These 
latter discoveries prove the prolific 
capability of African Atlantic margin plays 
outside the proven basins indicating 
positive implications for Namibia which 
lies in a comparable geologic setting. 
The recent reported discovery offshore 
the Falklands is also highly encouraging.  
Deep water exploration and production, 
pioneered across the Atlantic in the Gulf 
of Mexico and in Brazil, is leading to 
increased interest in the remaining 
underexplored high potential West 
African areas with majors, national oil 
companies and governments looking to 
secure acreage and future supply. 
Chariot in Namibia – one of the 
largest licence holdings and biggest 
work programmes
Chariot, through its wholly owned 
subsidiary Enigma Oil & Gas Exploration 
(Pty) Limited (“Enigma”) holds one of 
the largest net acreage positions in 
Namibia (after the Namibian State Oil 
Company, Namcor). This totals an area of 
38,725 km², and we have committed to 
and fulfilled the largest exploration work  Chariot Oil & Gas Limited

programme offshore Namibia to date. We 
have been very pleased with our results 
from the seismic acquisition which we 
completed across all of our blocks of 
interest. This has identified gross unrisked 
prospective resource volumes of 8.5 
billion barrels and provided us with a 
more detailed understanding of the 
structural composition and prospectivity 
of the region. Net unrisked prospective 
resources attributable to Chariot have 
increased 89 per cent from 3.9 billion 
barrels as reported at the time of listing 
on AIM in 2008 to the current estimate 
of 7.4 billion barrels. 
We feel that we are very well positioned 
within the Namibian margin with licence 
areas situated in three distinct geological 
settings. Our work continues to develop 
our knowledge and understanding  
of our blocks of interest as we look to 
further define targets for drilling. 
 
Our focus on Africa
Creating value is at the core of the 
Company’s strategy and we are focused 
on developing our high impact 
exploration whilst looking to balance  
our risk profile. As part of this strategy, 
concurrent with our farm-out efforts,  
we are looking to secure nearer term 
development opportunities and bring 
our first oil date forward in order to 
generate production cash flow. 
Our focus is on African plays and this  
is where most of our expertise lies. Africa 
is a rapidly emerging region on the world 
energy stage, possessing a multitude  
of business opportunities for investors. 
Having worked on the continent for 
many years, our management team has 
a broad range of experience in both 
finding and producing oil whilst working 
with governments and other partners. 
Africa holds a wealth of energy potential, 
a fact that is becoming ever more 
apparent as more companies focus on 
the region. 
Financial review
The Group incurred a loss of US$3.1m 
(2009: US$28.5m loss) for the year 
ended 28th February 2010. The other 
administrative expenses were 
US$3.03m; this is comparable to the 
prior year balance of US$3.2m. 
Capitalised exploration costs for the 
period totalled US$17.6m which are 
primarily related to the acquisition of 3D 
seismic data. The farm-out agreement 
with Petrobras in relation to block 
2714A allows the Group to recharge  
50 per cent of the exploration costs and 
a portion of the overhead costs related 
to this block. 
The Petrobras farm-out agreement 
included a payment of US$16.04m to 
Chariot, and this reduced the capitalised 
exploration costs for the period. 
Petrobras have also agreed to pay 
Chariot a production bonus of up to 
2 million barrels of oil equivalent or 
US$1 18m from its share of the first 
production from block 2714A, whichever 
occurs first. As this bonus is contingent 
on future production, it has not been 
included in the financial statements.
During the year, the Group terminated its 
services agreement with High Resolution 
Technology & Petroleum Ltd (“HRT”), 
this was subsequently referred to 
arbitration. A settlement was achieved  
in February 2010, whereby both parties 
agreed that there will be no payment  
of damages by either side and that each 
party pays their own respective costs 
incurred during the dispute. As part of 
the settlement HRT agreed to provide  
all outstanding data and reports to the 
Group. A US$2.9m provision for payment 
to HRT which was provided for in  
the 28th February 2009 financial 
statements, for unpaid exploration  
costs, was released upon settlement. 
Conclusion
The Group has overcome many 
challenges since floating on AIM in 2008. 
It has also substantially exceeded its  
work commitments in Namibia and has 
attracted the attention of many major 
international oil companies. Furthermore, 
the Group is debt free, issued no  
new shares in the financial period and 
held cash balances of US$16.2m at 
28th February 2010 (2009: US$28.9m).
I wish to thank my fellow Directors and 
the management and staff of the 
Chariot Group for their hard work and 
achievements of the past year. I look 
forward to an exciting year as we 
progress our strategic growth objectives.

Chief Executive Officer’s Report
“I believe Chariot 
presents a real value 
add opportunity. 
Our Namibian 
acreage is a solid 
platform from which 
to develop, and over 
the coming years  
I believe that Chariot 
can grow from 
being a junior 
exploration 
company  
into a mid-tier E & P 
player with both 
exploration and 
production success.” 
Paul Welch 
Chief Executive Officer
I am very pleased to report on my first 
set of full year financial statements as 
CEO and I am delighted with the 
progress we have made since I joined 
Chariot. I am also honoured to be part  
of a company that I believe has the 
potential to deliver a great deal of value 
to shareholders and to put Namibia 
firmly on the oil producing map. I am 
pleased to recount our progress and look 
forward to continuing developments 
throughout the coming year. 
Progress to date 
Since our interim results, published in 
November 2009, we have completed 
all planned seismic acquisition 
programmes across our blocks of 
interest, the final programme in the 
Northern block concluded in January 
2010. Such acquisition programmes 
were extensive, in some licences 
significantly exceeding the requirements 
as agreed with the Namibian Ministry, 
providing a strong indication of our 
commitment to developing our assets. 
Due to our large acreage position and 
the substantial amount of newly 
acquired seismic data, we negotiated 
licence extensions for our blocks in the 
second quarter of last year in order to 
have the time to pursue our exploration 
efforts to the best of our ability. All of 
our licences are in good standing.
With the completion of the 2D 
acquisition and interpretation 
programme, we were very pleased to 
announce resource volumes for our 
Central blocks. Three new leads have 
been identified with 3.3 billion barrels 
of prospective resources. This increased 
our previous estimate of gross unrisked 
prospective resources by 62 per cent  
to 8.5 billion barrels (net prospective 
resources of 7.4 billion barrels) and 
underscored our belief in the oil 
potential of the Namibian margin. 
We announced in February the opening 
of a dataroom in London in order to 
seek out further farm-outs for our 
blocks of interest. Having partners 
alongside us will help to mitigate the risk 
and expedite our exploration activity. 
Since the dataroom opened, we have

“I was delighted  
to welcome new 
technical staff to the 
Group; all of whom 
have worked in the 
industry for many 
years and whose 
experience is 
proving invaluable.  
I look forward to the

welcomed a number of interested 
international oil companies and we 
expect further visitors over the coming 
quarter. The expressions of interest have 
significantly increased from the visits to 
our first dataroom with parties keen to 
view the newly acquired 3D seismic 
information. As we have previously 
stated, this is a key part of our strategy 
as we look to secure industry partners 
to share in the costs and rewards of 
exploration going forward. We continue 
to liaise closely with Petrobras on block 
2714A in the south and look forward  
to working alongside other interested 
parties in due course.
Our new business opportunity 
evaluation efforts continue across  
the African continent as we seek out 
additional prospects. As previously 
stated, we are looking to balance  
our current portfolio with nearer  
term production potential in order to 
introduce production cash flows and 
reduce our risk profile. This process  
is ongoing using our in-house skills  
and expertise.
I was delighted to welcome new 
technical staff to the Group during the 
period: Matthew Taylor (Director  
of Exploration), Julia Kemper (Senior 
Staff Geophysicist), Martin Richards 
(Development Engineering Manager) 
and Alex Green (Commercial Manager), 
all of whom have worked in the industry 
for many years and their experience is 
proving invaluable.
Operating in Namibia
Namibia is a country that I am very 
familiar with from my earlier activities 
with Shell and Hunt Oil – both early 
entrants into the country. As well as the 
interesting geology that the offshore 
basins offer, Namibia is a superb place 
to do business. Namibia has recently 
celebrated the 20th anniversary of  
its independence and inaugurated 
President Hifikepunye Pohamba for a 
second five-year term. It has a stable 
democracy with a competitive fiscal 
regime and sound investment profile. 
The government has pursued free-
market principles designed to promote 
commercial development, has good 
relations with its neighbours, and 
actively encourages international foreign 
investment. We have an excellent 
working relationship with the Ministry  
of Mines and Energy and Namcor and  
it is a continuing pleasure to work there.
Chariot – the future
I believe Chariot presents a real value 
add opportunity. Our Namibian acreage 
is a solid platform from which to 
develop, and over the coming years  
I believe that Chariot can grow from 
being a junior exploration company  
into a mid-tier E & P player with both 
exploration and production success. 
Whilst securing new opportunities is  
a priority for us, our position offshore 
Namibia remains our key focus. The 
team that we have in place now is  
one that I am extremely pleased to  
be working with and I value their input 
immensely. We now possess the 
in-house skills to both further develop 
the Namibian potential and expand the 
business by acquiring additional assets. 
We believe that we have an enviable 
strategic position within one of the  
few remaining high impact exploration 
frontier regions off the West African 
coast. I relish the prospect of an  
exciting year ahead which will see 
significantly increased activity levels  
and I look forward to updating 
shareholders accordingly.

Review of Operations
Namibia – three basins, distinct 
geology
Chariot is well positioned with our 
blocks situated in three geologically 
distinct settings:
The “Northern blocks” in the  •	
Namibe Basin, located north  
of the Walvis Ridge. 
The “Central blocks” straddling  •	
the Luderitz/Walvis Basins.
The “Southern blocks” in the  •	
Orange Basin.
The Namibe Basin forms part of  
the prolific West African “salt basin”, 
bounded to the south by the Walvis 
ridge. Prior to the Atlantic Ocean 
opening, the Namibe Basin lay adjacent 
to the Santos Basin of Brazil, in which 
recent super-giant oil discoveries have 
been made. The Luderitz and Walvis 
Basins are virtually unexplored with  
only four wells drilled to date, in an  
area similar in size to the prolific UK 
North Sea Central Graben, where 
hundreds of exploration wells have 
been drilled. The Orange Basin contains 
the very large delta of the Orange River 
system and also hosts the giant Kudu 
gas field.
Exploration in Namibian margin  
to date
Sporadic exploration activity in the 
Southern African Atlantic margin led to 
the discovery of the giant Kudu gas field

development, and the Ibhubesi oil and

gas fields (in South African waters). 
There has only been one phase of 
exploration, in the early 90s, which  
was targeted at the primary Namibian 
margin and culminated in the drilling  
of eight exploration wells, all located in 
the shallow waters on the shelf and 
slope portions of the basin due to 
technical and commercial limits that 
existed at that time. Our newly acquired 
seismic data combines evidence of 
large structural features with direct 
hydrocarbon indications which provide 
strong support for the move into the 
deeper water sections of these basins. 
These were areas that were technically 
out of reach to the early explorers  
in Namibia. 
Prospectivity
The Namibian margin south of the 
Walvis Ridge is proven to host 
productive rift system source rocks as 
well as Lower Aptian marine oil prone 
facies (equivalent in age to source rich 
sequences in the Aptian salt basin to 
the north) and Cenomanian-Turonian 
source rocks. Although gas is the 
dominant phase found to date this 
appears to be a function of high 
maturity in the local fetch area of the 
main discovery (Kudu) which lies below 
the very thick Orange delta sediment 
deposits. Source rock characteristics are 
oil prone and oil is the expected phase 
in most of the prospectivity identified in 
Chariot’s exploration areas. The absence 
of salt has inhibited trap development 
on the shelf and slope (hence the poor 
exploration record of past drilling) but 
deepwater seismic demonstrates a 
wide range of large structural and 
stratigraphic traps that appear to be 
associated with large rotated rift fault 
blocks. Chariot has positioned itself to 
exploit this, as yet, untapped potential. 
Key features of Chariot’s licences
Prospect portfolio includes several •	
large structural traps and combination 
structural/stratigraphic closures in 
three different geological settings.
Prolific hydrocarbon generation is •	
proven in the Orange Basin with the 
giant Kudu gas field, demonstrably 
sourced from an oil prone, but locally 
over mature source rock.
Extensive seabed gas hydrates,  •	
gas chimneys and other Direct 
Hydrocarbon Indicators (“DHIs”),  
all positive indicators of both gas  
and oil generation. 
Past drilling, even where unsuccessful, •	
has revealed interbedded sandstone 
and shale intervals providing multiple 
sealed reservoir target levels for  
future exploration.
Despite poor trap development on the •	
shelf, discoveries have been made 
and oil shows encountered proving a 
petroleum charge system.

Review of operations continued
“We remain 
confident about the 
significant potential 
of offshore Namibia 
and believe that  
we are well placed 
to develop and 
realise the value  
of our assets.”
Northern Blocks
Blocks 181 1A and B are situated to the north of the Walvis Ridge. Multiple leads 
are mapped including a very large fault block overlain by Aptian age carbonates. 
Chariot undertook two acquisition programmes across the Northern blocks in 2009 
completing an initial programme of 900 km² which was followed up with a further 
600 km² focusing on an area of specific interest over the previously identified 
Zamba prospect. The area of 3D seismic data acquired totalled 1,500 km
2
 and 
processing and interpretation has commenced and will be completed in the near 
future. As well as the Zamba prospect, four stacked leads have been identified in 
the Tapir Complex. A seismic line through this prolific section is shown here.
This area has proven hydrocarbon potential as evidenced by the Kunene-1 well in 
adjacent block 171 1 which shows potential for up to 14 Tcf gas, (as reported by the 
Namibian Ministry of Mines and Energy). Basin modelling demonstrates potential for 
oil in Chariot’s licence area.
Central Blocks
The blocks are located on an arch between the Walvis and Luderitz Basins 
and can be charged by hydrocarbons from a thick rift section in either,  
or both flanking basins. Large structural features have been mapped and 
hydrocarbon indicators seen in the Chariot concessions resulting in a lead 
portfolio being defined. 
Chariot completed over 3,000 line km of 2D seismic data acquisition across its 
2312A and B blocks in the period. Following the processing and interpretation this 
data the Company announced, in March 2010, that these licences contain 3.3 billion 
barrels of unrisked prospective resources. Prior to this announcement, no volume 
potential had been assigned to this area. Three leads were reported, Klipspringer, 
Hartebeest and Oryx all of which lie in relatively deepwater depths of 2,000–
2,500 m. The leads are interpreted to lie within a mapped Cretaceous channel-fan 
system with seismic character indicative of deep marine sandstone facies. These high 
graded leads are identified as combination traps with a component of structural dip 
closure (apparent following depth conversion) with upside stratigraphic trapping 
potential. Preliminary source maturity modelling suggests that the leads are oil prone. 
(Only the volumes contained within the structural closure have been included in the 
prospective resource volume estimates.) 
Southern Blocks
Blocks 2714A and B are situated to the south of the Luderitz High, on the 
northern edge of the Orange Delta. The mapped leads are mainly early 
Cretaceous turbidites and transitional phase Kudu type pinch-outs. 
On blocks 2714A and B, 3D seismic processing continues, the results of which will 
be available in the near future. Chariot, as Operator, completed 3,000km² of data 
acquisition across these blocks, the latter 1,500 km² in partnership with Petrobras. 
The Company has been buoyed by the interest of Petrobras in the period, resulting 
in the farm-in agreement being signed and announced in May 2009. Chariot looks 
forward to developing a closer relationship with them as the partners assess drilling 
prospects on block 2714A. 
Conclusion
We feel that we are very well positioned within the Namibian margin with our 
licence areas situated in three distinct geological settings. Our work continues to 
develop our knowledge and understanding of our blocks of interest as we look to 
further define targets for drilling.

The Group supports the growing awareness of social, environmental and ethical matters when considering business practices. 
This statement provides an outline of the policies in place that guide the Group and its employees when dealing with social, 
environmental and ethical matters in the workplace.
Code of conduct
The Group maintains and requires the highest ethical standards in carrying out its business activities in regard to dealing with 
gifts, hospitality, corruption, fraud, the use of inside information and whistle-blowing.
Equal opportunity and diversity
The Group promotes and supports the rights and opportunities of all people to seek, obtain and hold employment without 
discrimination. It is our policy to make every effort to provide a working environment free from bullying, harassment, intimidation 
and discrimination on the basis of disability, nationality, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion or belief.
Employee welfare
The Group aims to assist employees at all levels to improve their professional abilities and to develop their skills.
The Group will practise manpower and succession planning in regard to the number and type of personnel resources that will 
be required in the future. Individual career progression activities are developed with this in mind.
Joint venture partners, contractors and suppliers
The Group is committed to being honest and fair in all of its dealings with partners, contractors and suppliers. The Group has a 
policy to provide clarity and protection, within its terms of business, to ensure the delivery and receipt of products and services  
at agreed standards. The Group also closely guards information entrusted to it by joint venture partners, contractors and 
suppliers, and seeks to ensure that it is never used improperly.
Operating responsibly and continuous improvement
The Group is committed to a proactive quality policy to ensure that stakeholders are satisfied with the Group’s results and the 
way in which the business operates and to promote continuous improvement in the overall operation of the Group. In pursuit  
of these objectives, the Group will use recognised standards and models as benchmarks for its management system.
Environmental policy
The Group adopts an environmental policy which sets standards which meet or exceed industry guidelines and host 
government regulations. This will be reviewed on a regular basis. As part of the environmental assessment, Chariot employed 
marine mammal observers to travel on board the seismic vessels. These observers were able to compile marine mammal and 
bird count statistics which will assist in the preparation of future environmental impact assessments. Social impacts will also form 
part of these assessments and preliminary work in this area will consider the impact of the Namibian coastline in the event that it 
becomes a petroleum province.

Corporate Governan Ce Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements for the Group in accordance with 
applicable Guernsey law and regulations.
Guernsey legislation requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that the financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transaction, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial 
statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. A fair 
presentation also requires the Directors to:
consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies; •	
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and •	
understandable information;
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to •	
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Group to continue as a •	
going concern, management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or have no realistic alternative to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with The Companies 
(Guernsey) Law 2008. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable  
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in Guernsey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information 
needed by the Company’s auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that 
information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
BDO LLP were appointed as auditors of the Company by the Directors. BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in 
office and a resolution to re-appoint them as auditors will be proposed at the next general meeting.

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial

Independent Auditors’ Report
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International

Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors  
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free

irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements.

give a true and fair view, in accordance with International •

then ended; and
have been properly prepared in accordance with  •

1 General information
Chariot Oil & Gas Limited is a Company incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey with registration number 47532. The address 
of the registered office is Sydney Vane House, Admiral Park, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 3EL. The Company’s administrative & 
head office is in Guernsey. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report 
and in the Review of Operations and the Financial Review.
The functional and presentational currency of the Group is US dollars (US$).
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS and IFRIC 
interpretations), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European Union.
In accordance with the provisions of section 244 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, the Group has chosen to only report 
the Group’s consolidated position hence separate Company only financial statements are not presented.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost accounting convention on a going concern basis.
Going concern
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to undertake its planned 
programme of exploration and appraisal activities over the forthcoming 12 months.
New accounting standards
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the 
Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1st March 2010 or later periods and which the Group has decided not to adopt 
early. These are:
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations:

Except for the adoption of IFRS 3 Revised, which would materially affect the presentation and financial impact of a business 
combination, the above standards, interpretations and amendments will not significantly affect the Group’s results or financial 
position. The adoption of IFRS 9 will eventually replace IAS 39 in its entirety and consequently may have a material affect on the 
presentation, classification, measurement and disclosures of the Group’s financial instruments.
Items marked* had not yet been endorsed by the European Union at the date that these financial statements were approved 
and authorised for issue by the Board.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group. There will be additional presentational and disclosure impacts affecting the 
presentation of the financial statements.
Intangible fixed assets
The Group applies the full-cost method of accounting under which all expenditure relating to the acquisition, exploration, 
appraisal and development of oil and gas interests, including an appropriate share of directly attributable overheads, is capitalised 
within cost pools. Capitalised costs are amortised on a unit of production basis. The Board regularly reviews the carrying values 
of intangible assets and writes down capitalised expenditure to levels it considers to be prudent. Costs pools are determined on 
the basis of geographical principles. The Group currently has one cost pool, relating to offshore exploration interests in Namibia.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charge for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted and are expected to apply in the year 
when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

2 Accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in  
which they operate (“their functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss, except for foreign currency 
borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.
When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that 
gain or loss shall be recognised in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is 
recognised in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into US dollar at rates approximating to those ruling when the 
transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those 
operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net 
assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or fair value on acquisition less depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a 
straight line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful 
economic life. The residual value is the estimated amount that would currently be obtained from disposal of the asset if the 
asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives over a range of 
2.5–5 years.
The carrying value of tangible fixed assets is assessed annually and any impairment charge is charged to the income statement.
Leases
Rent paid on operating leases is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the 
consolidated income statement over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the 
number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the 
fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the 
market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options,  
measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the consolidated income statement over the 
remaining vesting period.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the consolidated income statement is charged with the 
fair value of goods and services received. Where the equity instruments are granted for goods and services are capital in nature, 
the fair value is changed to the intangible asset value.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or 
business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements present 
the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and 
balances between the Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial assets consist of current account or short-term deposits at variable interest rates, loans and other 
receivables. Any interest earned is accrued and classified as interest. Trade and other receivables are stated initially at fair value 
and subsequently at amortised cost.
The Group’s financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables. All are non-derivative assets. The trade and other payables are 
stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.  Chariot Oil & Gas Limited

Joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are those in which the Group has certain contractual agreements with other participants to engage in joint 
activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business on its own. The Group includes its share of assets, liabilities, 
and cash flows in joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to 
the Group’s interest in the joint arrangement. The Group’s exploration, development and production activities are generally 
conducted jointly with other companies in this way.
 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The Group makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based 
on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. In the future, actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are as follows:
 
Recoverability of intangible assets
Under the full cost based method of accounting, the Group capitalises exploration costs until it is capable of determining 
whether its exploration efforts were successful and, if they were successful, whether any impairment charges may be required to 
bring the net book values of assets in line with their economic values.
Impairment review
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and, if there is any indication that an asset 
may be impaired, its recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of its net selling price and its value 
in use. 
Estimates on impairment are limited to an assessment by the Directors of any events or changes in circumstance that would 
indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. 
Any impairment loss arising from the review is charged to administrative expenses whenever the carrying amount of the asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount.
Share-based payments
Directors best estimate of the valuations underlying the share-based payments are based on assumptions made by Directors 
using updated models previously prepared by external consultants. See note 20 for further details of these assumptions.
3 Segmental analysis
In the opinion of the Directors, the operations of the Group companies comprise one single class of business including oil  
and gas exploration. The Group operates in one geographic area, Namibia. The financial information presented reflects all the 
activities of this single business.

9 Taxation
The Company is tax resident in Guernsey, where corporate profits are taxed at zero per cent.
No taxation charge arises in Namibia as the Namibia subsidiary has recorded a taxable loss for the period.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the current period
The reasons for the difference between the actual tax charge for the year and the standard rate of corporation tax in Guernsey 
applied to profits for the year are as follows:
 
      Year ended Year ended
      28th February  28th February
      2010 2009
      US$’000 US$’000

Loss on ordinary activities for the year before tax      (3,126) (28,570)
Loss on ordinary activities at the standard rate of corporation tax in Guernsey of 0% (2009: 0%)  – –
Difference in tax rates in local jurisdictions at the applicable tax rate of 35% (2009: 35%)  (1,366) (2 41 )
Disallowable expenses      – 1
Deferred tax effect not recognised      1,366 240
Total taxation charge      – –
Deferred tax not recognised in respect of losses carried forward in Namibia total US$1,120,909 (2009: US$498,576). The 
Company had tax losses carried forward on which no deferred tax asset is recognised. Deferred tax assets were not recognised 
as there is uncertainty regarding the timing of future profits against which these assets could be utilised.
Namibian taxation and royalties
Normal taxation
The petroleum income tax is payable annually at a rate of 35 per cent of the taxable income received by or accrued to any 
person from a license area in connection with exploration, development or production operations in that area. Each licence area 
is assessed separately and losses in one cannot be set off against profits in another.
Additional profits tax
In addition to the above tax, annually there will be paid an additional profits tax (“APT”). APT shall be payable at the end of each 
tax year on each petroleum licence area and determined on the basis of the rate of return on the project. It is levied on the 
project’s net cash receipt, the after tax net cash flow achieved above certain defined tiers of threshold rate of return on the 
project. The first tier rate of APT is 25 per cent. 
10 Loss per share
The calculation of basic loss per ordinary share is based on a loss of US$3,126,000 (2009: loss of US$28,570,000) and on 
141,173,471 ordinary shares (2009: 132,261,953), being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the 
year. Potentially dilutive options are detailed in note 20, however these are anti-dilutive as the Group reported a loss for the year 
consequently a separate diluted loss per share has not been presented.

During 2009, after review of the results of the aeromagnetic survey the Directors considered the carrying value of the on-shore 
assets to be nil, therefore an impairment charge of US$3,098,000 was charged to the income statement in 2009 representing 
all the costs incurred on the onshore licences to date. This view was taken given the expected recoverable prospects of this 
licence which was subsequently relinquished. 
The Group signed a farm-out agreement with Petrobras for a 50 per cent stake in one of the four licences offshore in Namibia; 
Block 2714A. This agreement included a payment of US$16.04m which has been paid in full.

19 Financial instruments
The Board of Directors determine, as required, the degree to which it is appropriate to use financial instruments or other hedging 
contracts or techniques to mitigate risk. Throughout the year ending 28th February 2010 no trading in financial instruments was 
undertaken (2009: nil).
There is no material difference between the book value and fair value of the Group cash balances, short-term receivables 
and payables.
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that future cash 
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), and foreign exchange rates 
(currency risk). Throughout the period the Group has held surplus funds on deposit, principally with its main bankers Barclays, 
on fixed short-term deposits covering periods of one week to three months monitoring rates of return whilst assuring the ability 
to meeting working capital requirements.
The Directors have not disclosed interest rate sensitivity analysis on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at the year end as 
the risk is not deemed to be material.
The Group’s treasury policy is that all significant cash balances are held in the parent company. Therefore the market risk is not 
deemed significant in any of the subsidiary undertakings.
Currency risk
The Group has very limited currency exposure in respect of items denominated in foreign currencies comprising:
Transactional exposure in respect of operating costs and capital expenditure incurred in currencies other than the functional •	
currency of operations.
This risk is managed with funds being held principally in US dollars to recognise the trading currency of the industry with a limited 
balance maintained in sterling and Namibian dollars to meet ongoing corporate and overhead commitments.
At the year end, the Group had cash balances of US$16.2m as detailed in note 14.
Other than the non US$ cash balances descried in note 14 no other financial instrument is denominated in a currency other 
than US dollars. A 10 per cent adverse movement in exchange rates would lead to an increase in the foreign exchange loss of 
US$32,100 and a 10 per cent favourable movement in exchange rates would lead to a corresponding reduction, the effect on 
net assets would be the same as the effect on profits (2009: US$250,500).
Restricted cash balances are detailed in note 14.
Capital
The Company considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium and retained earnings as well as the 
share-based payments reserve (“Other reserve”).
In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its 
working capital and strategic investment needs. The Group has met its work programme commitments and with the receipt of 
the farm in proceeds, the Group currently holds sufficient capital to meet its ongoing needs for the next 12 months.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s practice is to regularly review cash needs and to place excess funds on fixed term deposits for periods not 
exceeding three months with an institution that are top band rated by Standard & Poors. 
The Group has sufficient funds to continue operations for the forthcoming year and has no perceived liquidity risk.
20 Share-based payments
Share Option Scheme
During the year, the Company operated the Chariot Oil & Gas Share Option Plan (“Share Option Scheme”). The Company 
recognised total expenses (all of which related to equity settled share-based payment transactions) under the plan of:

The Option Plan provides for an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company shares on the date of the grant. 
The options expire if they remain unexercised after the exercise period has lapsed. For options valued using the Black-Scholes 
model there are no market performance conditions or other vesting conditions attributed to the options.
The following table sets out details of all outstanding options granted under the Share Option Scheme.

The range of the exercise price of share options exercisable at the year end falls between US$0.38 (25p) – US$1.98 (130p), 
(2009: US$0.55 (38.5p) – US$1.87 (130p)).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise US$0.39 (26p), using exchange rate of £ = US$ 1.5224.  
(2009: US$1.37 (95p), using exchange rate of £ = US$ 1.4347).
The estimated fair values of options which fall under IFRS 2, and the inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate those 
fair values are as follows:
 
 Estimated   Expected   Expected
Date of grant fair value Share price Exercise price volatility Expected life Risk free rate dividends

15th January 2010 £0.19 £0.28 £0.25 80% 5 years 4.3% 0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the annualised standard deviation of the daily changes in the share price.
Long-term incentive scheme
The Plan provides for the awarding of shares to employees. The award will lapse if an employee leaves employment. 
During the year 1,531,427 awards were granted to employees, none of whom are Directors of any Group company. The shares 
will vest in equal instalments over a three year period.

The range of the exercise price of warrants outstanding at the year end falls between US$0.46 (30p) – US$1.87 (130p),  
(2009: US$0.93 (65p) – US$1.87(130p)).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise is US$0.46 (30p) using exchange rate of £ = US$ 1.5224  
(2009: US$1.77 (124p), using exchange rate of £ = US$ 1.4347).
The warrants issued during the year were a part of the fee for the Facilitator of the farm-out agreement with Petrobras and the 
cost is capitalised within exploration and appraisal cost. In 2009, the warrants were issued to the Company’s brokers and the 
cost set against the share premium account.
Since the year end, 2,653,281 warrants lapsed and 342,738 warrants were exercised therefore at the date of this report 
2,614,036 warrants are outstanding.
The estimated fair values of warrants which fall under IFRS 2, and the inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate those 
fair values are as follows:

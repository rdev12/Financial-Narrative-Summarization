Social housing
CONSTRUCTION AND  
SUPPORT SERVICES ORDER BOOK HOUSING UNIT SALES
The market for our housing business has been 
tough with 18.6% fewer sales achieved this 
year compared with last year and a continuing 
deterioration in reservation levels. We have 
responded to reduced demand by restructuring the 
Homes division from five administrative centres 
to one with the regrettable but necessary 60% 
reduction in Homes staff numbers. This has resulted 
in one-off reorganisation and restructuring costs 
of £9.5m partially offsetting the profit arising from 
the sale of the Hairmyres Hospital PFI investment 
of £16.2m during the year. In addition, we have 
reviewed the carrying value of residential and 
commercial land and work in progress at 30 June 
2008 in the light of current market conditions 
and have written those values down by a total of 
£31.3m; £26.6m in Homes and £4.7m in Property.
Cash, one of our key measures particularly within 
the Construction division, has been strong. Net cash 
inflow from Group operating activities was £56.6m 
(2007: £114.8m) leading to year-end net cash 
balances of £143.9m (2007: £148.4m).
We have experienced strong order intake leading 
to record year-end combined order books for 
Construction and Support Services of £3.7bn 
(2007: £3.5bn). Our Homes division is experiencing 
a continued reduction in reservations with order 
books at 31 August 2008 at about half of last 
year’s levels.
The Board proposes a 10% increase in the total 
dividend for the year to 55p (2007: 50p). The final 
dividend of 37p will be paid on 28 November 2008 
to shareholders on the register on 26 September 
2008 and there will be a scrip dividend alternative.
Board changes
Dick Side, who joined the Board in January 2003 as 
managing director of Kier Regional, will be retiring 
from the Board and the Group at the Company’s 
annual general meeting in November 2008. Dick 
has served Kier with great distinction for over 25 
years and his experience and knowledge have 
contributed greatly to our business. On behalf 
of the Board I would like to thank Dick for his 
contribution and wish him well in his retirement;  
he will be greatly missed by us all.

Paul Sheffield, who has been deputy managing 
director of Kier Regional since October 2005, will 
assume responsibility for all of our Construction 
activities following the annual general meeting. 
Other changes in responsibilities have taken effect 
from 1 July 2008. Ian Lawson, managing director 
of Kier Support Services also took responsibility 
for our Homes business embracing both private 
housing and our Partnership Homes business. Dick 
Simkin, managing director of Kier Property has also 
taken responsibility for our PFI business together 
with a new business stream, Kier Asset Partnership 
Services, established to focus on local authority 
asset management and development.
These changes have been implemented to reflect 
changes to our business structure designed to  
bring our operations closer together.
Finally I should like to thank Peter Warry, who 
retired as chairman of the Board in December  
2007, for his contribution during his ten years with 
the business and particularly the last three years  
as chairman.

product diversification coupled with the quality and 
commercial capability of our staff will continue to 
provide stability in the current environment. Clearly 
2009 is going to be a challenging year but we have 
a strong balance sheet, good cash resources and 
healthy order books and I am confident that Kier 
will respond positively to our changing markets as 
we enter 2009.

REVENUE PROFIT BEFORE TAX
John Dodds | Chief Executive
I am pleased to report another year of increased 
underlying profits for Kier Group for the year ended 
30 June 2008. Despite the very difficult market 
conditions facing our Homes business the Group has 
achieved record levels of revenue and underlying 
pre-tax profit for the year to 30 June 2008. This 
has been driven by our Construction and Support 
Services businesses; each of them achieving new 
records of revenue and profits underpinned by higher 
quality contracts achieved through an increase in 
frameworks, negotiated and partnered work.
Overview
Our Homes division sold 1,438 homes in the year; 
18.6% fewer than last year’s 1,767 homes with the 
credit crunch having a significant impact on the 
second half of the financial year resulting in 35% 
fewer unit sales than in the same period in the 
previous year.
In Property we secured a number of development 
sales in the early part of the year which maintained 
our profits for 2008 at similar levels to the previous 
year. In our Infrastructure Investment business we 
sold our 50% PFI investment in the Hairmyres 
District General Hospital project in Scotland, 
Kier’s first ever PFI contract. The sale completed in 
February 2008 and contributed a profit of £16.2m 
in the year. The value attributed to the equity sold 
implies a net present value calculated using an 
average discount rate of less than five per cent.
Conditions in the housing market have continued 
to deteriorate and we have responded to this by 
reorganising our Homes division; our overhead 
costs have been reduced and we have aligned it 
more closely with our Partnership Homes business 
to focus on regeneration and affordable housing 
opportunities. We have incurred exceptional 
restructuring charges of £9.5m against profits for the 
year largely representing redundancy and severance 
payments to around 60% of our Homes workforce. 
We have also examined the carrying values of our 
Homes and Property land and work in progress, 
in the light of current market conditions, and have 
written down certain sites and properties by a 
total of £31.3m; £26.6m in our Homes business, 
including £1.0m relating to aborted land purchases; 
and £4.7m in our Property business. Our priority 
continues to be to reduce our investment in work 
in progress and we have reinforced our controls 
over build expenditure and are limiting our land 
expenditure to settling land creditors, committed 
payments and exercising options where appropriate.
Our Construction and Support Services businesses 
have seen steady demand throughout the year. We 
have continued to focus on long-term relationships 
and have successfully extended our range of 
long-term framework agreements, partnership 
programmes and negotiated and repeat business 
both in the public and private sectors. In the UK 
construction market, education has continued to 
provide us with plenty of opportunity, much of it

and in record time, completed the Ely 
rail bridge replacement in December 
2007 following a derailment in June. 
Kier Engineering Services provided 
design engineering services.  
www.kier.co.uk/transport/projects
through the Academies Framework and frameworks 
with local authorities. Overseas, our markets in 
the Middle East are buoyant and we have secured 
£150m of new infrastructure projects in Dubai and 
continue to explore expansion opportunities in that 
region. In Support Services our order books have 
grown significantly reflecting both new contract 
awards and the expansion of existing contracts. 
These awards contributed strongly to record 
combined forward order books for Construction and 
Support Services providing us with good visibility of 
revenue for a number of years.
Financial performance
Revenue for the year at £2,374.2m (2007: £2,127.9m) 
was 11.6% ahead of last year with very strong 
growth from both the Construction and Support 
Services divisions. Underlying operating profit was 
7.6% ahead of last year at £83.8m (2007: £77.9m) 
before taking into account the following 
exceptional items:

Profit on the sale of our 50% investment in 
Hairmyres Hospital (PFI) 16.2
Redundancy and reorganisation costs 
associated with our Homes division (9.5)
Provisions against land and work in progress:
 Homes (26.6)
 Property (4.7)
Total exceptional items (24.6)
Underlying profit before tax increased by 12.2% to 
£87.1m (2007: £77.6m) before exceptional items. 
Adjusted earnings per share, before the amortisation 
of intangible assets and exceptional items, increased 
by 10.0% to 174.8p (2007: 158.9p).
This strong trading performance was supported by 
a good cash performance in the year with £56.6m 
generated from operating activities (2007: £114.8m) 
resulting in a year-end net cash position of £143.9m 
(2007: £148.4m). The Construction division 
generated £52.5m of cash (after tax and intra-Group 
dividends) reflecting continued strong trading 
performance and ended the year with another 
record cash balance of £413.7m (2007: £361.2m). 
In Homes our investment in land and work in 
progress continued to climb as the number of unit 
sales planned for the year reduced, absorbing some 
of our Group cash.
Group structure and strategic developments
For the year to 30 June 2008 Kier Group comprised 
five divisions: Construction, Support Services, 
Homes, Property and Infrastructure Investment. 
The Group’s management structure and segmental 
analysis for reporting purposes are based on the 
five divisions.
The benefits of operating a hybrid model have 
been particularly highlighted this year as the four 
principal legs of our business experience different 
market fundamentals. Continued demand in our 
Construction and Support Services businesses has 
contrasted with the sudden and dramatic effect of 
the credit crunch on the demand for private housing 
and development properties.
In response to the reduction in demand for housing 
we have consolidated the operations of Allison 
Homes, Bellwinch Homes, Kier Homes Scotland, 
Kier Homes Northern and Twigden, into one, Kier 
Homes, at our head office in Sandy, Bedfordshire. 
Regrettably this has resulted in around a 60% 
reduction in our Homes workforce but will provide 
us with considerable annual overhead savings.
We have also brought Kier Homes and our 
affordable homes business, Kier Partnership Homes, 
closer together under one Board director with a 
remit to further develop the Group’s activities in 
the affordable housing and regeneration arena. The 
affordable housing sector is one with potential for 
growth in revenue and profit streams for the Group 
in the coming years in response to the government’s 
commitment to major public spending on affordable 
homes and regeneration.
Our Property division and Infrastructure Investment 
division now operate under one Board director 
together with a new business stream, Kier Asset 
Partnership Services, established to focus on local 
authority asset management and development.
These changes, which are reflected in our new 
management structure, are designed to bring the 
Group’s operations closer together and provide 
increased efficiencies. Construction

Overall revenue increased by 17.1% to a record 
£1,653.2m for the year (2007: £1,411.2m) with 
good growth in both Kier Regional and Kier 
Construction. Operating profit increased by 74.9% 
to £38.3m (2007: £21.9m) and the operating margin 
increased from 1.6% last year to 2.3%, well ahead 
of our target for this division in 2008.
Cash generation, one of our key construction 
performance measures, has been extremely strong 
again this year, with cash balances at 30 June 2008 
£52.5m higher than the previous year-end (after tax 
and intra-Group dividends) and average balances 
for the year £59m ahead at £378m. Contract awards 
were strong giving an order book at 30 June 2008 of 
£1,700m (2007: £1,710m).
Kier Regional business review
The performance of our Kier Regional businesses 
was excellent reflecting the high-quality order 
books carried forward at the beginning of 
the financial year, and we achieved further 
advancement in our key performance measures of 
revenue, profit margins and cash balances. Revenue 
was 16.8% ahead of 2007 at £1,413.2m; profit 
margins, supported by an increased proportion of 
negotiated and partnered work, again increased; 
and the cash performance has been strong with 
average cash balances around £54m higher than 
last year, ending the year at another record of 
£377m (2007: £336m).
The level of awards achieved through framework 
and partnership agreements together with 
negotiated and two-stage tenders, grew to around 
80% of the total work secured in the year (2007: 64%) 
and, together with the low average value of our 
contracts at £4.7m (2007: £4.7m), they continue 
to provide us with a high-quality, sustainable order 
book with an attractive risk profile.
The Construction division 
comprises Kier Regional and 
Kier Construction. Kier Regional 
encompasses our ten regional 
contracting businesses, major 
building projects and, for the year 
to 30 June 2008, our affordable 
housing contracting business. 
Kier Construction represents 
the Group’s infrastructure and 
overseas operations which 
include civil engineering, 
infrastructure, rail, mining and 
remediation capabilities.

AWARDS BY SECTOR
1  Kier North West undertook the 
construction of the flagship  
BDP headquarters building at 
Piccadilly Basin, Manchester. This 
striking five-storey, 31,450sq ft 
office building achieved the much 
coveted BREEAM Excellent rating for 
environmental sustainability. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 9
Forty-nine per cent of our total awards arose from 
private sector clients (2007: 55%) and 51% from 
the public sector (2007: 45%). In the private sector 
commercial property, retail and hotel & leisure 
projects provided a good spread of work and in 
the public sector 64% of our awards were through 
framework agreements largely for education, prison 
and healthcare projects.
Demand for commercial property continued to 
be strong again this year representing 22% of our 
awards, partly through Kier Property projects as well 
as awards through our long-term relationships with 
Land Securities Trillium, British Land, Goodman and 
SEGRO. The retail market continued to be buoyant, 
particularly for food retailers, representing around 
11% of our awards largely through our framework 
agreements and partnerships with Tesco, Sainsbury’s 
and Morrisons. During the year we were also 
appointed by BAA plc as one of its commodity build 
framework contractors aimed at delivering a total 
of £650m of projects over five years, including car 
parks, refurbishment works and asset renewals  
at Heathrow, Gatwick and a number of other  
UK airports. 
In the public sector education continues to be 
buoyant with orders this year representing 28% of 
total awards, largely through framework agreements 
and partnerships with government, local authorities 
and individual universities. Our involvement in 
the Contractors’ Framework for Academies and 
Other Educational Facilities is beginning to deliver 
work, with the award of the £27m Milton Keynes 
Academy during the year and several further awards 
imminent. We have also secured the first contract 
through the Primary Capital Investment Programme 
for the London Borough of Barnet.
Local authority frameworks continue to provide us 
with a significant volume of work in the education 
sector including the Improvement and Efficiency 
South East (IESE) partnership of councils in the 
south and south-east of England, our partnership 
agreement with South Lanarkshire Council and 
multiple local authority frameworks with various 
councils across the country. A great success in 
the year was being appointed preferred bidder by 
Kent County Council, as part of the Land Securities 
Trillium consortium, to deliver £100m worth of 
schools in the first wave of Kent’s Building Schools 
for the Future (BSF) programme with the opportunity 
for a further £150m of work in future waves.
Health projects represented 8% of our awards in the 
year. The seven-year NHS ProCure 21 procurement 
framework, of which we are a part, entered its 
fifth year and has provided us with £326m worth 
of healthcare work to date including 21 projects 
awarded this year with a combined value of £96m. 
New construction, extensions and refurbishment 
work at prisons for the Ministry of Justice Custodial 
Properties’ Framework has continued to provide 
a good level of activity representing around 7% 
of total awards in the year. We delivered over 850 
prison spaces during the year and are progressing 
with a further 486 places.
In the affordable housing sector we completed 
723 affordable housing units (2007: 850 units) 
and were awarded approximately £125m of new 
contracts (2007: £98m) including a £20m scheme 
in Birmingham. This sector has the potential to 
increase markedly on the back of the government’s 
committed investment of £8bn to provide 70,000 
affordable homes per annum by 2010.

Kier Construction business review
Kier Construction saw a 19.0% increase in its 
revenue in the year to £240.0m (2007: £201.3m) 
through a combination of projects in the rail, 
energy and water sectors, our opencast coal 
mining business in Scotland and overseas projects, 
particularly in Dubai and Romania.
The energy sector continues to provide us with 
good opportunities. During the year we successfully 
completed our work to a major Liquefied Natural 
Gas (LNG) receiving terminal at South Hook in 
Milford Haven. Good progress was made on two 
new Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power 
stations at the Langage Energy Centre, Plymouth 
for Alstom Power and at Immingham CCGT power 
station on the Humber. These projects add to our 
considerable experience gained in successfully 
completing similar works on 12 other CCGT power 
stations over the past ten years.
At our privately owned opencast coal mine, 
Greenburn in East Ayrshire, we have now extracted 
2.6m tonnes of coal since production began in 
2004. We expect to continue mining here until 
2013 and have forward sold 70% of the  
remaining 2.0m tonnes of anticipated coal  
at favourable prices.
As part of our five-year infrastructure framework 
for the renewal of rail structures for Network Rail 
in East Anglia, we successfully, and in record time, 
completed a rail bridge replacement project at 
Ely in December 2007 following a freight train 
derailment in June 2007 which caused extensive 
damage to the existing 140-year-old structure.
Overseas, our markets in the Middle East are 
buoyant. We have secured £150m of new 
infrastructure projects in Dubai and continue to 
explore expansion opportunities in that region. In 
Saudi Arabia we are establishing a new phosphate 
mine development in joint venture with our local 
partners and we start mining in 2009 for a period of 
eight years. In Romania we have had a busy year on 
water infrastructure projects as well as major retail 
and residential schemes. In the Caribbean we have 
completed our successful work on the transport 
interchange in Kingston, Jamaica and the Norman 
Manley airport extension is nearing completion.
Construction markets and outlook
Our framework agreements in both the public and 
private sectors continue to provide us with a steady 
stream of work which will help to safeguard us 
from uncertainties in the commercial property and 
private residential construction markets. We were

and One School Pathfinder Projects in Shropshire 
(£25m), the Wirral (£23m) and Sefton (£42m).  
We are also bidding for a further £200m of  
similar education opportunities.
We are one of three contractors chosen by Argent 
for their £2bn central framework contract at King’s 
Cross, which includes around 8.0m sq ft of mixed-
use development over a 10 to 15-year period.
In the energy sector our track record continues to 
provide us with more work and we were delighted 
to be awarded a £95m contract to provide civil 
engineering works for a 1,200MW CCGT power 
station at West Burton, Nottingham for EDF Energy. 
Opportunities also exist in the waste sector and 
we are preferred bidder on a waste treatment plant 
in Wakefield for VT. In the nuclear sector we have 
been selected by AWE as one of two contractors 
to develop a portfolio of work valued at £200m at 
Aldermaston. We are expanding our presence in 
Dubai as significant opportunities come forward 
in the infrastructure and drainage sector where we 
have a long track record.
We enter the new financial year with strong 
construction order books of £1,700m (2007: £1,710m) 
and a healthy pipeline of ‘probable’ awards. 
Frameworks and long-term partnerships will help 
to insulate us from longer-term uncertainty in the 
construction market and together with our wide 
geographic coverage and low average contract 
size we can view our construction marketplace  
with confidence. Support Services

Support Services business review
Revenue in Support Services rose 24.8% to 
£393.7m (2007: £315.5m). Operating profit, before 
deducting the amortisation of intangibles of £2.1m, 
increased by 27.9% to £15.6m (2007: £12.2m) at 
an improved margin of 4.0% (2007: 3.9%) in line 
with our target for the year.
Once again, the cash position within the division 
was strong with £1.6m generated to give year-end 
cash balances of £17.4m (2007: £15.8m) which 
includes our investment in plant of £21.1m. The 
order books have grown significantly standing 
at £2,023m at 30 June 2008 (2007: £1,788m), 
reflecting both new contract awards and the 
expansion of existing contracts.
The largest and fastest growing business is Kier 
Building Maintenance, with revenue in the year 
up 33.4% to £288.7m (2007: £216.4m). New 
contracts worth £460m were secured during the 
year including Newham, Hammersmith & Fulham 
and Stoke-on-Trent. The Stoke contract was awarded 
in February 2008, in partnership with Stoke-on-
Trent City Council, to maintain its 20,000 housing 
stock and carry out works through the Decent 
Homes programme. This contract provides us with 
annual revenue of £40m for ten years, extendable 
for a further five years. It also provides a great 
opportunity to attract additional work both through 
the contract and through third-party projects using 
the resources available in the partnership. In June 
we were awarded a contract with East Durham 
Homes to carry out planned maintenance and 
adaptation work on their 8,800 homes in Peterlee, 
County Durham. This contract will provide revenues 
of £5.5m per annum over four years and brings the 
total number of public sector homes we look after 
in England to 220,000.
A major challenge in the north during the first part 
of the year was our response to the devastating 
flooding that struck Yorkshire and Humberside 
in June 2007 which saw our Hull, Sheffield and 
Leeds Building Maintenance teams providing 
emergency repairs and maintenance and the 
subsequent clearing-up operations. Kier Sheffield

and continues to expand with regional housing 
association work and capital works for Sheffield

In the south, Kier Islington continues its efficiency 
improvements including co-locating its client 
services with the council’s as well as setting up 
a single resolution team with the council to deal 
with any customer complaints. Work commenced 
with Harrow Council on 1 July 2007 to undertake 
a full range of responsive maintenance and Decent 
Homes upgrades. Worth £125m over five years, 
this gives us the opportunity to provide additional 
capital projects, such as building schools and a 
leisure centre, with £60m of such work already 
secured and being carried out by Kier Regional. In 
Harlow, an award in February 2007 and one which 
includes Kier Street Services, improvements have 
been made to the service which is now rated ‘good’ 
compared with the ‘poor’ rating in 2004.
After a period of consolidation, Kier Managed 
Services has won three significant new contracts this 
year. In Northampton we are to provide facilities 
management services and lifecycle replacement 
for a PFI scheme for the provision of mental health 
services to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Trust. 
At the University of Glamorgan, where we have 
provided facilities management services for over ten 
years, we won the contract to provide full facilities 
management services for the newly built campus for 
the Cardiff School of Creative & Cultural Industries. 
We also secured a £7.0m per annum facilities 
contract for Legal & General during the year.
We have had a strong year in Kier Plant and have 
continued our investment in upgrading our fleet. 
This has included the purchase of eight new tower 
cranes, bringing the inventory to 102 such cranes, 
a 70-tonne crawler crane, 26 new telehandlers and 
710 new site accommodation units, including our 
own trademarked Green Space and Green Step 
 eco-cabins, bringing our holding to 3,600 units.
Support Services markets and outlook
There are continuing opportunities both with local 
authorities and the private sector for our Managed 
Services business.
In Building Maintenance our order book gives us 
long-term visible earnings at consistent margins 
extending beyond 2017. The long-term contracts 
and relationships allow us to expand our activities 
through organic growth and provide opportunity for 
other Kier businesses to participate. There is a strong 
pipeline of new contracts to bid including a £40m 
per annum ten-year contract for North Tyneside on 
which we are shortlisted as one of two bidders.
We have a strong track record of delivery on  
high-value building maintenance contracts which 
places us in an excellent position when tendering 
for large contracts.

Conditions in the housing market started reasonably 
well for the first half of the year but we experienced 
a significant downturn in demand for houses as we 
entered the second half of the year initially caused 
by a reduction in mortgage availability and the 
tightening up of mortgage terms.The market continued 
to deteriorate during the last quarter of the year with 
reservations rates falling significantly year-on-year. 
Despite this, Kier Residential sold 1,438 homes in the 
year (2007: 1,767 homes) representing a fall of 18.6% 
over the entire year compared with last year. We sold 
827 units in the first half of the financial year (2007: 
819 units) and 611 units in the second half, 35% fewer 
than the second half of the previous financial year.

low-rise. Nevertheless our work in progress has 
increased and we are focused on reducing our 
stock swiftly given the current market conditions.
Homes markets and outlook
We are very cautious on the outlook for 2009 
hence our actions to reduce our cost base. Gross 
reservations for the first two months of the new 
financial year are around 76% below the same 
period last year reflecting continued tightening 
of mortgage availability and a general slow down 
in demand hence our order books at 31 August 
contain 49% fewer units than at the same time 
last year.
We have reinforced our controls over build 
expenditure and work in progress and have 
limited land expenditure to settling land creditors, 
committed payments and exercising options until 
the outlook for the housing market becomes clearer.

Average selling prices were lower for the year 
at £168,800 (2007: £179,300) reflecting a 
higher proportion of the lower value Kier Homes 
Northern properties, an increased proportion of 
social housing units than the previous year (18% 
compared with 16% in 2007) as well as some price 
discounting. Revenue of £242.8m was generated 
from housing sales (2007: £316.8m) and there were 
no land disposals (2007: revenue of £8.3m from 
land sales). Operating profit from housing sales 
declined by 36.0% to £30.5m (2007: £47.6m) at a 
reduced margin of 12.6% (2007: 15.0%).
We incurred exceptional costs of £9.5m relating to 
redundancy and reorganisation which will reduce 
our costs by £17m on an annual basis. We have also 
examined the carrying values of our land and work 
in progress and have written down land values by 
£25.6m together with a further £1.0m relating to 
aborted land purchases, representing 5.7% of our 
residential land and work in progress.
During the year £88.2m was spent on selective land 
purchases (2007: £87.5m) and at 30 June 2008 the 
land bank contained 6,233 units (2007: 6,465 units). 
In addition to land with planning consent,  
we hold approximately 12,000 plots of strategic 
land (2007: 11,500 plots) mostly under option.
Our sites are principally located outside major 
cities and exclude high-rise flats. In Lincolnshire, 
Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire our sites are

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW PROPERTY CONTINUED
Property business review
Despite tough market conditions the Property 
division recorded another successful and profitable 
year. Revenue increased from £61.3m last year 
to £69.6m with operating profit, before property 
write-downs, at similar levels to last year of £12.0m 
(2007: £12.1m) representing a margin of 17.2% 
(2007: 19.7%). The commercial property market is 
more difficult than we have seen for some time with 
exit yields shifting upwards and occupiers taking 
time to make decisions. Consequently we have 
examined the carrying values of our developments 
and work in progress and have made exceptional 
provisions against the values amounting to £4.7m, 
representing 4.8% of the book value of our 
developments, predominantly against properties 
acquired in the last two years.
Notable sales during the year included the 
150,000sq ft business park headquarters for 
Electronic Data Systems in Milton Keynes, 
constructed by Kier Regional and sold to Prudential 
during the year. Within the Bank of Scotland joint 
venture a successful 22-unit Trade City industrial 
park was sold to CBRE Investors and a number of 
smaller unit sales were also completed from our 
sites in Weybridge, Enfield and Chelmsford.
Excellent progress is being made at the new 
70,000sq ft UK Supreme Court for the Ministry 
of Justice where Wallis, the Group’s specialist 
refurbishment business, is on target to complete 
the work in the spring of 2009. This will create a 
highly marketable 30-year income stream with a 
government-backed covenant.
Our strategic partnership with Invista continues 
to strengthen. At Reading terms have been 
agreed for Yell to occupy seven of the ten floors 
of the 219,000sq ft building which is now under 
construction by Kier Regional. On the remaining 
two sites tenant interest is being pursued to 
complete the development of this gateway project.
In July 2008 we formed a new joint venture with 
Network Rail. This ground-breaking partnership 
initially gives us the opportunity to develop seven

station-related sites in London and the south-east 
identified for regeneration. These sites include 
east Maidstone, Guildford, Epsom, Twickenham, 
Walthamstow, Enfield and Wembley. Over a 
period of ten years the sites will generate a gross 
development value of £500m and be supplemented 
at a later stage by further opportunities from the 
Network Rail property portfolio.
At Western International Market, near Heathrow, 
construction of a new market for the fruit and 
vegetable traders has now been completed and the 
site previously occupied by the traders has been 
released for redevelopment and a pre-sale or pre-let 
is currently being sought.
Following on from our successful headquarters 
scheme for National Trust, the Ordnance Survey 
headquarters development in Southampton recently 
received planning permission and a start on site 
is anticipated by late 2008. On completion the 
development will release 25 acres of land available 
for a major mixed-use scheme.
Property markets and outlook
The forthcoming year will provide the business 
with new challenges not seen for some years; 
however Kier Property’s low-risk strategy of largely 
non-speculative development will ensure that we 
are not exposed to large holdings of unoccupied 
buildings and that the portfolio is sufficiently robust 
to counter any cyclical movements. Within our 
current development portfolio we have the ability 
to enhance value through the planning process and, 
whilst this may not crystallise short-term profit, it 
will provide a strong foundation to both protect and 
enhance the asset base of the business.
By forming long-term partnerships in the 
development sector, such as the recent Network 
Rail joint venture scheme, we can look forward to 
a secure business stream spread over many years 
into the future. We are also examining the Group’s 
current residential land holdings with the aim of 
identifying potential opportunities for changes 
in planning to create value through alternative 
development including commercial use. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 23

Infrastructure Investment business review
The year to 30 June 2008 has been a productive 
time for KPI with the successful disposal of an 
investment and the completion of construction on 
several projects. At the year-end following the sale 
of an investment during the year, our portfolio of 
PFI projects totalled 12, with all but one completed 
and operational. Our committed equity investment 
in PFI schemes stands at £18.4m (2007: £22.8m) of 
which £14.1m has been invested to date. The most 
significant milestone for the division was the sale  
of our 50% share in our first PFI project undertaken, 
Hairmyres Hospital in Scotland. The sale gave us 
proceeds of £13.8m which, when combined with 
a refinancing gain deferred from August 2004, 
generated a profit of £16.2m. The value attributed 
to the equity sold implies a net present value 
calculated using an average discount of less  
than 5%.
Three projects reached construction completion 
during the year, with a fourth due for completion 
in the autumn of 2008. Significantly, the delivery 
of all of these schemes has involved our Regional 
construction companies and three of them involve 
Kier Managed Services as facilities management 
providers. Completed projects include the Oldham 
Schools PFI project involving two 1,500-place 
secondary schools; the Garrett Anderson Centre at 
Ipswich Hospital and the highly successful North 
Kent Police Station. Good progress has been made 
2   The Garrett Anderson Centre was 
completed in 2008 and provides a

the facilities management services

Managed Services.

on the six new schools under the Norfolk County 
Council PFI Schools Scheme with three completed

completion in the autumn of 2008.
Infrastructure Investment markets and outlook
The PFI procurement route continues to provide us 
with opportunities for further investment. Whilst 
we have a firm anchor in the education, healthcare 
and local authority sectors of the PFI market, 
we are exploring other opportunities including 
fire stations, waste handling centres and student 
accommodation.
The remaining committed investment of £18.4m  
has a directors’ valuation of approximately £40m  
at 30 June 2008 based on discounting the cash 
flows from investments in financially closed 
projects at a rate of 7%. The secondary market for 
investments remains good and we are exploring 
other potential disposals.

Kier Project Investment (KPI) manages the 
Group’s PFI interests. The core strength of 
KPI is its ability to bring together the diverse

Group and combine these with a financial 
package to deliver high-quality buildings  
and services to meet the needs of the  
public sector.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Health & Safety
In 2008 Kier Group businesses have diligently 
focused on getting back to basics to ensure 
we create and maintain safe sites. This simple 
approach is having a significant effect on our safety 
performance with some spectacular results across 
our sites including seven million accident-free 
man-hours in Dubai. The progress made last year on 
people issues has helped shape our current strategy 
which aims to ensure a practical safety approach 
that facilitates safe working processes on site. Our 
Accident Incidence Rate (AIR) of 588 per 100,000 
staff and subcontractors (2007: 640) compares 
favourably with a Health & Safety Executive (HSE) 
target rate of 865 per 100,000.
People
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all 
of our people for their hard work over the last 12 
months and for their continuing commitment and 
support in making Kier the successful business it 
has become. 2008 has been a difficult year for some 
parts of the business and I suspect 2009 will be no 
easier. It is at times such as these that the businesses 
and teams need to pull together even more strongly 
to deliver the Group’s goals and objectives. We have 
many skilled, talented and committed people in this 
Group and I am confident that, together, we will 
successfully steer our way through these  
uncertain times.
Objectives and prospects
We are reporting at a time of increasing uncertainty 
in the UK economy with the credit crunch having a 
major effect on our Homes and Property businesses 
and the recent banking crisis sending shockwaves 
throughout the global economy. However our 
Construction and Support Services businesses are 
busy, our order books are strong and, importantly, 
our enquiry levels remain high, underpinned by our 
many framework agreements.
2009 is going to be a difficult year but we have 
skilled management teams in place in all of our 
businesses, many of whom have seen economic 
downturn in the past and have the experience to 
respond promptly to change as it arises. We have 
a strong balance sheet, good cash resources and a 
commitment to succeed. All of which will stand us 
in good stead over the next few years.

Our vision is to be the most highly respected 
Group in the industry. This means we aspire to gain 
the highest respect of all our investors, clients, 
employees, supply chain partners and peers as 
well as the public at large for the quality of our 
service, the integrity of our business practices and 
our ethical and sustainable approach to economic, 
environmental and social issues. We are committed 
to delivering that vision.
To do so, we concentrate on our people: their 
health, welfare, safety, training and development. 
We also take seriously our approach to business 
ethics, including corporate governance, compliance 
with competition legislation, fraud awareness and 
other policies reinforced by a robust whistleblowing 
process. Accredited environmental management 
systems and processes remain a core part of our 
approach to sustainability including recycling, 
waste and energy-saving initiatives and biodiversity. 
Ensuring good, positive community relations is a 
fundamental part of how we deliver our business.  
To this end, our central disciplines have increasingly 
worked together and with our businesses to help 
deliver our vision. 
This financial year has been characterised by 
considerable efforts by all businesses in the Group 
to put into practice the objectives of the Group 
Strategy for Sustainability policy that was launched 
in the summer of 2007. At the same time, we have 
made considerable inroads into coordinating our 
processes and measurement criteria to enable the 
Group to report consistently on CR issues.
Third-party organisations and benchmarks
In the context of reporting, the Group has worked 
closely with several highly respected organisations 
that will help us to measure, benchmark, monitor 
and establish targets for improvement in all aspects 
of CR. From 1 July 2007 the Group became a 
corporate member of Business in the Community 
(BITC), having piloted the scheme for nearly a year 
through Moss Construction, and we began work 
on benchmarking responsible business practice 
through the BITC Corporate Responsibility Index. 
From 1 January 2008 the Group became an 
Associate Member of the Considerate Constructors 
Scheme (CCS), whose third-party auditing and 
reporting we now use as benchmarks throughout 
the Group.
We have also engaged in dialogue with Ethical 
Investment Research Services (EIRIS) Limited to seek 
advice and guidance on meeting the criteria for 
potential listing in the FTSE4Good Index, possibly 
in 2009.
Similarly, we are preparing for the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment (CRC), the new legally 
binding climate change and energy-saving scheme 
that is a central part of the UK’s strategy for acting to 
reduce our carbon footprint and deliver ambitious 
emission reduction targets set out in the Climate 
Change Bill. The CRC scheme begins to operate in 
April 2010 but requires action in 2009.
Kier Group became a corporate member 
of Business in the Community on 1 July 
2007 and an Associate Member of the 
Considerate Constructors Scheme on  
1 January 2008.
By maintaining our core values and 
remaining focused on improvement and 
delivery, our vision is to be the most 
highly respected Group in the industry. 
Our positive approach to corporate 
responsibility (CR) and our commitment 
to address sustainability through a 
responsible approach to economic, 
environmental and social issues will 
ensure that our vision becomes reality.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Most of our school-building activities around the country feature Kier staff engaging with 
the teachers and pupils to contribute to the educational process. Here Moss Construction 
sponsored art students at Chosen Hill School, Gloucester, to paint the hoardings  
around the site. 28 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
Business in the Community and Corporate 
Responsibility
Having become a corporate member of BITC in 
July 2007, the Group has worked closely with the 
organisation to participate in the BITC Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) Index. We have been working 
with the BITC secretariat on completing a trial 
index assessment to identify the Group’s current 
reporting capabilities and to address strengths and 
weaknesses in our processes. Once this exercise is 
completed, we intend to submit a full survey for the 
public BITC CR Index 2008 this autumn.
The BITC CR Index assesses corporate strategy, 
including corporate values, advocacy, risk 
management and business conduct, and 
management systems for community, environment, 
marketplace and workplace. It assesses our 
approach to climate change, waste and resource 
management and biodiversity. It also reviews health, 
safety and wellbeing, employee development, 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
employing migrant workers, and community 
investment. The completion of this comprehensive 
survey will become the basis for our future CR 
reporting criteria. 
In the meantime, BITC has continued to work 
closely with several of our businesses. Moss 
Construction, which piloted membership of the 
scheme in 2007, continued to work with BITC 
locally to further develop its own corporate 
responsibility policy and this year evolved a formal 
policy under the banner of ‘Connecting – people, 
environment, communities’. This has now become a 
model framework which is intended to be launched 
across all Kier Regional businesses. They continue 
to engage widely with communities wherever their 
work takes them.
Kier Sheffield LLP was awarded a Big Tick Award for 
employability by BITC Yorkshire & Humberside for 
the second successive year in 2008 and once again 
participated in the BITC Yorkshire & Humberside 
Environmental Index, improving its score for the 
fourth consecutive year and maintaining its position 
in the silver sector of the Index league table, 
which is an excellent achievement. Kier Building 
Services Engineers also worked with BITC and the 
children’s charity Kids Club in the London Borough 
of Hackney, while Kier Build is involved in the 
Business Action Group coordinated by BITC in the 
delivery of the vast 67-acre brownfield site being 
developed by Argent at King’s Cross.
Once again our Group training & development 
department used BITC to help deliver the Group’s 
executive leadership programme, sourcing three 
projects for nine senior managers/directors on  
the programme to work on community 
engagement activities.
Considerate Constructors Scheme: community, 
safety, environment
From 1 January 2008 the Group became an 
Associate Member of the Considerate Constructors 
Scheme and from that date it became mandatory for 
every eligible Kier site or project to be registered 
with the scheme and to be assessed under its Code

Group as a vital tool in improving our reputation, 
image and, above all, health, safety, welfare 
and environmental performance. It has all the 
ingredients and mechanisms necessary for us to 
monitor, benchmark and improve our performance 
at site and project level through third-party 
assessment across a broad range of issues under 
eight distinct categories:
• Considerate • Respectful
• Environment • Safe
• Cleanliness • Responsible
• Good neighbour • Accountable
Under these headings, the scheme’s third-party, 
independent auditors assess a project, giving each 
category a score up to five (the best score) and a 
full project score up to 40. In this way, we have 
been able to monitor, on a monthly basis, not only 
individual project performances, but also those of 
each operating company and division and, in turn, 
the Group performance against the national industry 
average. It has therefore allowed us to identify 
any areas for improvement under the reporting 
categories outlined above, the type of project, or 
a geographical location. More importantly, it has 
enabled us to demonstrate and share best practice 
within the Group and to set achievable targets for 
every project and company to aim for.
The full-year statistics demonstrate that the Group 
has consistently performed above the industry 
average every single month in the past reporting 
year, completing the final month of the year on an 
average score of 33.6 against the national industry 
average of 31.6. 
It is important to consistently achieve above 
the industry average and, despite the Group’s 
diversity, we have successfully out-performed the 
industry average every month in the year. We use 
these statistics as an internal benchmark against 
the overall industry average in order to promote 
improvement for our own operations.
As part of this exercise, we have begun publishing 
a quarterly Considerate Constructors Scheme 
performance review as an internal auditing 
document to help our project teams improve  
their performance.
Environmental management
During the year, the safety, health & environment 
(SHE) department further developed its structure of 
regional environmental managers. This included 
appointing a sustainability manager for the 
Group Construction division with responsibility 
for coordinating and implementing the Group’s 
sustainability strategy and coordinating our 
environmental management system, which has  
ISO14001 certification. This provides the 
framework, externally audited by BSI and other 
bodies, against which we benchmark our  
environmental performance.
As part of the implementation of this sustainability 
strategy, the Group has been active in promoting 
the environmental aspects of our CR policy, through 
both the individual businesses, and various Group 
forums. In November 2007, we held a Kier Group 
carbon footprint seminar covering the role of 
design in achieving zero-carbon and low-carbon 
development, the Code for Sustainable Homes, 
client demands on carbon footprint for the retail 
sector and on carbon footprint and the property/
commercial sectors.
As a result of these debates and seminars, several 
new initiatives have been developed. The first is the 
Carbon Footprint Reduction Initiative. This requires 
businesses across the Group to monitor the energy 
they use and put in place measures to reduce 
energy consumption. The aim is to reduce our 
carbon footprint by 10% over the next 12 months. 
Supported by a poster campaign and a monitoring 
proforma issued to all businesses, this initiative is 
being rolled out in the autumn of 2008. 
Kier Group was well prepared for the introduction 
of the Site Waste Management Plan regulations 
that came into effect in 2008. We engaged BRE 
to produce a bespoke version of their web-based 
SMARTwaste Plan, which has been adopted by all 
Kier Group businesses.

staff and operatives at the Greenburn 
surface mine near New Cumnock to 
mark the achievement of five years 
of operation at the site without any 
reportable accidents. Receiving 
the award is Harry Simpson, works 
manager at Greenburn.
3  Kier Dubai LLC has set a significant 
new record for the region by achieving 
5,000,000 man-hours without a lost-
time accident – representing almost 
two years of accident-free working. 
In recognition of this milestone, an 
award was presented to Kier Dubai 
general manager Shree Kulkami by Kier 
Construction general manager  
Andrew Keir. 30 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
Using SMARTwaste Plan has ensured a uniform 
approach to managing construction waste and 
provided a source of reliable data. The plans 
are being used not only to demonstrate legal 
compliance, but also to identify opportunities to 
reduce waste. These will then be implemented 
Group-wide.
Kier Regional is currently supporting a Construction 
Industry Research and Information Association 
(CIRIA) project to develop an environmental training 
resource pack based on its successful publication 
C502 Environmental Good Practice on Site. This 
training pack comprises a series of presentations 
together with detailed guidance notes and case 
studies covering a variety of environmental issues, 
which can be delivered individually or combined 
to produce a more comprehensive training session. 
CIRIA will launch this innovative training resource, 
which should prove invaluable to the construction 
industry, towards the end of 2008.
Regionally, all Group businesses have been engaged 
with a variety of bodies and local initiatives that 
are collated at the centre to share best practice 
throughout the organisation. For example, 
protecting and enhancing a site’s biodiversity is one 
of the aims of the Group strategy for sustainability 
and is a highly visible means of demonstrating 
our commitment to sustainable development. 
Marriott Construction recently undertook to protect 
the wildlife on its EDS project, resulting in their 
project manager addressing the Construction 
Industry Environmental Forum’s seminar on putting 
biodiversity into sustainable construction. Likewise, 
Kier Eastern’s Norwich Schools projects have 
involved providing bat bricks in the new school

grounds, and building bug boxes and compost 
bins amongst other activities. Moss Construction 
continues to gain national awards (18 to date) for 
its environmental flagship building of the National 
Trust headquarters in Swindon.
Amongst others, Kier South East, Kier Eastern and 
Kier Retail have been organising a series  
of workshops to help key members of their 
respective supply chains develop their own 
environmental management systems. Facilitated 
by White Young Green Environmental and funded 
by the Government BREW (Business Resource 
Efficiency & Waste) programme, these workshops 
aim to provide environmental management system 
guidance for companies to be independently 
audited and then accredited through various 
phases to achieve BS8555, a stepping stone to 
the Group’s own ISO14001 accreditation. Several 
subcontractors have now been accredited at various 
levels of BS8555 due to these Group initiatives.
Donations to charities
During the year ended 30 June 2008, the Group 
companies donated, directly and indirectly, 
£127,000 (2007: £109,000) to a wide variety of 
charities and other establishments across the UK 
and overseas. As in the past, we record direct 
Group cash donations annually (see directors’ 
report on page 41), but within this report we are 
again monitoring all of our external sponsorship, 
including those sums raised by individuals and 
teams in sporting activities.
Towards the end of the year, the Board agreed 
to sponsor Team GB in some way for the Beijing 
Olympic Games. Rather than donate to the generic 
cause, we directly supported the Huntingdon 
Gymnastics Club, being local to the Group head

Embracing Diversity
Kier Building Maintenance 
has worked with performance 
improvement experts HouseMark 
to produce a guide showing how 
a variety of social landlords and 
maintenance providers have found 
practical ways of addressing diversity, 
such as:
 meeting the needs of their diverse • 
customer base to provide an 
excellent and accessible service
 embedding the values of diversity • 
in their workforce
 ensuring that the composition  • 
of their repairs and maintenance 
workforce reflects the communities 
they work for.
The guide demonstrates that 
additional funding and dedicated 
resources are not always necessary to 
provide opportunities and a sensitive, 
responsive and accessible service.

Sustainable procurement policy
A key component of the Group’s 
overall sustainability strategy is 
having in place a robust  
procurement policy.
The policy’s objective is to ensure 
that, as far as is practicable, we 
purchase materials and services 
that through their use, sourcing, 
or manufacture, have the smallest 
impact on both society and  
the environment. 
We will look to achieve this through:
 raising awareness of the policy • 
within the Group
 providing training and guidance • 
to enable staff to make informed 
and responsible decisions when 
purchasing materials and services
 ensuring that our supply chain, • 
including clients, designers, 
subcontractors and suppliers, are 
aware of this policy
 working with our supply chain to • 
identify those products that have a 
harmful effect on the environment 
and find alternatives that are less 
damaging where practicable
 using, where feasible, products • 
made from reclaimed or recycled 
materials
 influencing the contract • 
specification so as to include, 
where relevant, a requirement for 
sustainable procurement
 taking into account a • 
subcontractor/supplier’s 
commitment to sustainable 
procurement when assessing 
their suitability as a supply 
chain member.
We will monitor our performance 
and include our findings in an annual 
sustainability statement. We will 
ensure that examples of best practice 
are identified and disseminated 
throughout our business.

The key areas of Group support during the year are 
as follows:
At the introductory level of our career development 
programme, we recruited over 115 graduates and 
100 students to start their professional careers in 
2008. We offer a comprehensive and structured 
graduate scheme that includes technical and 
managerial training to recognised professional 
standards. This helps to motivate people in the 
Group to achieve their career goals, and to attract 
high levels of new recruits. The Group continues 
to work with schools, colleges, universities and 
careers advisors to promote the construction 
industry as a career choice and has over 200 people 
currently studying for technical qualifications on 
various training schemes who joined the Group as 
school-leavers. The Group also has over 160 craft 
apprentices in construction skills. Some of these 
apprentices have been recognised by their craft 
guild as outstanding tradesmen through winning 
various skills competitions.
Over 12% of our workforce is on new entry 
training programmes, and this helps us to maintain 
and improve the talent of our workforce. In 
January 2008, we entered 45 school-leavers and 
experienced tradesmen onto a foundation degree 
instigated and designed by the Group and set up 
with Oxford Brookes University. This is a unique 
foundation degree delivered through distance 
learning and block release centred on cutting-edge 
construction practices. The programme delivers 
learning specifically for modern contractors. 
The Group actively encourages all employees 
to achieve full professional membership in their 
relevant discipline. Our graduate scheme trains 
employees to full membership in recognised 
professional institutions. We currently have over 70 
professional and technical staff working towards 
a construction management National Vocational 
Qualification (NVQ). Additionally, we accredited 
over 55 plant operators in specialist plant NVQs at 
our Greenburn opencast mining site. Our technical 
training is based around the findings of various best 
practice groups and helps to disseminate knowledge 
around the Group, adding value for our clients. 
During the last year, we have launched a site 
management academy aimed at our housebuilding

People development and training
The Group is committed to the lifelong  
development of all its employees. Our approach 
involves recruiting talented people into the industry 
and providing a career development framework 
that supports people from entry level to senior 
leadership and prepares our teams to meet and 
exceed our customers’ requirements. Our career 
development framework incorporates a series  
of programmes, covering people at all stages  
of their careers. 
We are committed to our Equal Opportunities 
policy which encourages job applications from all 
sectors of the community. This is demonstrated by 
the diversity of the people recruited.

site staff. This programme has been shortlisted  
for the 2008 Innovation in Training awards  
by the National House-Building Council (NHBC). 
Our aim is to develop our staff into our future 
management. We believe this delivers long-
term continuity and success for the Group. 
Our management development programmes 
have supported us in ensuring that our future 
management is continually developed from  
within the Group. 
The Group runs an executive and directors’ 
development programme based around defined 
competencies providing structured development 
to senior management and directors. This is linked 
to the Group’s strategy of sharing best practice 
around the Group. As part of the programme we 
have incorporated a series of voluntary community 
projects led by the participants to prepare them for 
further corporate responsibility as well as supporting 
their leadership skills development. 
We are very proud that in 2007 Kier Group was 
awarded the Contract Journal award for training 
for the second year in succession, a fantastic 
endorsement by the industry of the quality of our 
approach to people development. 
At the beginning of 2008, we implemented a 
Group-wide employee engagement survey to 
understand how our people feel about working for 
the Group and how we can improve engagement 
levels. The results reveal that our people strongly 
identify with the Group and we have a favourable 
level of highly engaged people compared with UK 
industry averages. We have planned improvements 
to enhance the engagement of our people over the 
next two years and intend to use the survey as a key 
business measure every two years. 
The Group works to overcome industry challenges 
such as skills shortages through its work with 
schools, colleges and universities. We focus on 
customers by ensuring our workforce is fully 
competent and able to deliver best practice for 
clients. The continual investment in people is 
embedding a deep-rooted development culture to 
maintain our long-term success.

The Group has delivered approximately 21,500 
training days during the year (2007: 17,000) and 
14% of our construction workforce is engaged on 
new entry training programmes.
Health & Safety
Group companies have in this past year diligently 
focused on getting back to basics to ensure we 
create and maintain safe sites. A strategic review of 
current SHE procedures is being rolled out across 
the Group with the aim of ensuring a simple process 
that is understood by both employees and supply 
chain members. The progress made last year on 
people issues has helped shape our current strategy 
which aims to ensure a practical safety approach 
that facilitates safe working processes on site.
Health & safety training has increased across the 
business and the Group has been instrumental in 
the Major Contractors’ Group (MCG) development 
of the Construction Skills Supervisor course soon 
to be delivered across the industry. This benchmark 
course will set the standard of SHE training for 
construction supervisors not just in the Group but in 
the construction industry UK-wide.
As a Group we are embarking on a positive safety 
leadership campaign that is supported by the 
British Safety Council. This campaign will build on 
our current behavioural successes in Kier Support 
Services and our joint venture water business 
KMI Plus. It will challenge behaviour across the 
Construction division and will help all employees to 
examine their personal behaviour and to implement 
the positive actions required for an improved 
performance in SHE. This approach is needed

to ensure that the positive work that has already 
been delivered throughout the Group is further 
strengthened and developed.
Using the approach of safe and unsafe acts 
recognition, we will reinforce the positives and 
with support and education develop and promote 
a positive safety culture in the weaker areas. 
Our subcontract supply chain members will also 
be asked to partake in this programme and we 
believe this open, honest and proactive leadership 
programme will further enhance the positive safety 
culture partnerships we currently enjoy with our 
supply chain. More details are shown in the AIR 
performance chart above.
Occupational health
We have focused on a number of areas to put the 
‘health’ back into health & safety throughout the 
year. We employed a specialist occupational health 
manager who has reviewed and streamlined the 
occupational health processes that were in place 
and we will continue to develop these processes 
to raise awareness both within the Group and our 
supply chain. One highlight of the occupational 
health programme has been the highly successful 
Men’s Health Roadshow. The occupational health 
team, supported by nurses and consultants, visited 
a large number of our sites throughout the UK 
promoting a host of subjects including personal 
health issues, general health awareness, healthy 
eating and task-related health awareness. This 
proactive site-level approach to occupational 
health was very well received by both employees 
and supply chain members, raising awareness 
of personal health issues in a practical and 
understandable way.
The longer-term education focus will be to 
reinvigorate occupational health issues at induction 
and as a fundamental part of any design and safe 
system of work. This approach will also include a 
health surveillance programme to ensure that we 
continue to promote health awareness.
Our focus for the new year will be to continue to 
raise awareness of safe working and occupational 
health throughout the Group and our supply chain.

Customers
Customer care remains at the heart of our vision 
and core values: By providing our clients with the 
highest possible quality of service and through 
sustainable, profitable growth, our vision is to be 
the most highly respected Group in the industry. 
Our volume of repeat and negotiated business and 
particularly the number of partnering frameworks 
in which we operate clearly demonstrates our 
commitment to customer service, quality of service 
and our focus on delivering value and innovation.
The diverse nature of our business divisions 
enables us to enhance our customer relations and 
community relations across a broad spectrum 
from business-to-business on one hand to direct 
consumer relations on the other. The Support 
Services division is not only focused upon the local 
authority clients, but especially upon the residents 
and tenants in whose homes we are working for 
repairs, maintenance, refurbishment and upgrading. 
Similarly, our Homes division delivering private 
homes and Kier Partnership Homes working on 
affordable housing have particular obligations to 
customer care and after-sales service.
In the context of both construction and support 
services, our adoption of the Considerate 
Constructors Scheme and our becoming an Associate 
Member of the scheme signals a further commitment 
by us to assume measurable responsibilities towards 
our customers, the communities in which we work 
and the environment impacted by that work.
We constantly monitor and report every quarter 
through our Kier Regional key performance 
indicator reports on customer satisfaction levels 
based upon feedback on their perception of us 
measured on points up to a maximum of 9.0. It resulted 
in Kier Regional achieving an overall figure of 8.6 
against a target set at 8.0 for the year.
At 30 June 2008 the Kier Group 
AIR was 588 per 100,000 staff 
and subcontractors, measured 
against a HSE benchmark of 865. 
This compares with our 2007 
AIR of 640 per 100,000 staff and 
subcontractors measured against 
an HSE benchmark of 946.

Accounting policies
The Group’s annual consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards. There 
have been no significant changes in accounting 
policies during the year.
Underlying profit before tax and 
exceptional items
Underlying profit before tax and exceptional items 
increased by 12.2% to £87.1m (2007: £77.6m). 
This is stated after deducting joint venture tax of 
£1.1m (2007: £1.4m) and before minority interests 
of £1.0m (2007: £0.8m). The share of minority 
interests relates to Sheffield City Council’s and 
Harlow Council’s share of profits from our building 
maintenance outsourcing contracts.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items amounting to a charge of £24.6m, 
before tax, were incurred in the year as follows:
 £m
Profit on the sale of our 50% investment in 
Hairmyres Hospital (PFI) 16.2
Redundancy and reorganisation costs 
associated with our Homes division (9.5)
Provisions against land and work in progress:
 Homes (26.6)
 Property (4.7)
Total exceptional items (24.6)
During the year we sold our investment in a 
PFI asset, Hairmyres Hospital in Scotland, for a 
consideration of £13.8m which, when combined 
with a refinancing gain deferred from August 2004, 
resulted in a profit on disposal of £16.2m. This 
represents a discount rate of less than 5%.
The exceptional costs relating to the restructuring 
of the Homes division include the cost of 
consolidating five administrative offices into one 
and the redundancy costs associated with 390 
employees, representing around 60% of our Homes 
workforce. These measures have been taken to 
reflect the continuing deterioration of the housing 
market, which has also caused us to examine the 
carrying values of our land and work in progress. 
Consequently we have written down our residential 
land by £26.6m (including £1.0m relating to 
aborted land purchases). We have also reviewed 
the carrying values of our property development 
portfolio and have taken write-downs of £4.7m, 
£1.5m of which relates to our wholly-owned 
business and £3.2m relates to properties held in our 
joint venture with the Bank of Scotland.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate, including joint 
venture tax on joint venture profits but excluding 
exceptional items, is in line with last year at 29.0%, 
which is marginally below the statutory rate of 
29.5%. Exceptional items have been taxed at the 
statutory rate, except the profit on disposal of the 
PFI asset as £8.3m was attributed to a refinancing 
gain which was taxed in an earlier accounting period.
Interest and cash
The interest received for the year comprises the 
following:
 Year to 30 June
 2008 2007 
 £m £m
Group interest receivable 9.8 6.9
Interest payable (2.2) (2.6)
Unwinding of discount (4.3) (4.6)
Share of joint venture interest (2.4) (2.9)
 0.9 (3.2)
The Group interest receivable includes that arising 
from average treasury balances of £95m for the 
year (2007: £65m). The charge of £4.3m relating to 
unwinding of discounts includes £3.1m relating to 
land creditor balances (2007: £3.9m).
Net cash at 30 June 2008 was £143.9m (2007: 
£148.4m) after deducting £30.2m relating to loan 
notes. £56.6m was generated from operations during 
the year after deducting £6.0m (2007: £11.0m) in 
respect of special pension contributions made 
during the year.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
1
Cash, net of debt, at 30 June 2008 includes £44.9m 
(2007: £44.3m) of cash which is not generally 
available for Group purposes, including that held 
by joint arrangements, overseas and other cash 
not readily available to the Group. The liquid 
cash position is affected by seasonal, monthly and 
contract-specific cycles. In order to accommodate 
these flows the Group maintains a range of bank 
facilities of £115.0m comprising £12.5m of 
overdraft facilities and £102.5m of committed, 
revolving credit facilities all on an unsecured basis. 
£10.0m of this expires in January 2009 and £92.5m 
expires in January 2011.
Treasury policy and risk management
The Group has bank facilities amounting to £115m 
and long-term debt of £30m managed by the 
centralised treasury function.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash 
and liquid investments. The Group, largely through 
its PFI and Property joint ventures, enters into 
derivatives transactions (principally interest rate 
swaps) to manage interest rate risks arising from the 
Group’s operations and its sources of finance. We 
do not enter into speculative transactions.
There are minor foreign currency risks arising 
from operations. The Group has a small number 
of branches and subsidiaries operating overseas in 
different currencies. Currency exposure to overseas 
assets is hedged through inter-company balances 
and borrowings, such that assets denominated in 
foreign currencies are matched, as far as possible, 
by liabilities. Where there may be further exposure 
to foreign currency fluctuations, forward exchange 
contracts are entered into to buy and sell  
foreign currency.
Balance sheet and total equity
The balance sheet at 30 June 2008 includes 
intangible assets of £13.4m of which £8.2m relates 
to building maintenance contracts including £5.7m 
for the outsourcing contract at Sheffield which is 
being amortised over ten years, £0.7m for Harlow 
and £1.8m for Stoke which was acquired during 
the year.
Total equity has increased marginally during the 
year to £183.1m (2007: £183.0m).
Inventories
An analysis of inventories is given below:
 At 30 June
 2008 2007 
 £m £m
Residential land 276.0 273.5
Residential work in progress 161.7 112.3
Property land and work in progress 24.8 30.2
Other work in progress 53.9 44.1
 516.4 460.1
The Group conducted a review of the carrying 
value of its housebuilding land at 30 June 2008 in 
accordance with normal practice and accounting 
standards. The review was carried out on a site-by-
site basis using appraisals incorporating forecast 
sales rates and selling prices that reflect trading 
conditions and paying particular attention to sites 
with low sales rates. As a result we recognised an 
impairment of the housing land bank of £25.6m 
together with costs associated with aborted land 
purchases of £1.0m. This represents 5.7% of our 
Residential land and work in progress.
The Group also reviewed the land and work in 
progress held within its Property business taking 
into account the marketplace and in particular 
increasing yields which identified the need for an 
impairment of £3.2m (our share) in our joint venture 
business and £1.5m in our wholly-owned business. 
These write-downs represent 4.8% of development 
book values.
Pensions
The Group participates in two principal schemes, 
the Kier Group Pension Scheme, which includes 
a defined benefit section, and a defined benefit 
scheme on behalf of its employees in Kier Sheffield 
LLP. The financial statements reflect the pension 
scheme deficits and surpluses calculated in 
accordance with IAS 19. At 30 June 2008 the net 
deficit under the Kier Group Pension Scheme was 
£32.9m (2007: £21.9m). The market value of the 
scheme’s assets was £538.4m (2007: £506.7m) and 
the net present value of the liabilities was £584.1m 
(2007: £537.3m). The increase in liabilities 
represents an increase in salary inflation and 
experience losses taken in the year.
We have been addressing the issue of pensions over 
a period of several years and in the last three years 
have contributed £60.5m in special contributions 
including £6.0m during the year to 30 June 2008 
(2007: £11.0m). The special contributions have no 
effect on the income statement for the year, but are 
shown as a reduction in cash and a reduction in the 
pension deficit.
Under the scheme relating to Kier Sheffield LLP 
there was a net deficit of £0.7m for the year 
(2007: surplus of £4.9m).
Pension charges of £7.6m (2007: £11.7m) have 
been made to the income statement in accordance 
with IAS 19.

construction of several hotels and 
hotel extensions. This track record has 
helped deliver exceptional residential 
accommodation for students now 
occupying two four-storey units at 
Fettes College in Edinburgh.
3  Kier Eastern constructed a Ryanair  
hangar and flight simulator at Stansted

Business risks
Core to our continued success is our ability to 
identify and effectively manage the risks to our 
business. Accordingly the Group has well defined, 
rigorous policies and processes designed to identify, 
mitigate and control risk. Risks are specific to each 
of our businesses and are controlled through the 
Group’s risk management processes. The primary 
risks that have the potential to adversely impact 
on our business over the next twelve months are 
considered to be as follows:
•  Contract and build risk: We carry out several 
hundred contracts annually and the risks to which 
the Group is exposed are dependent upon the 
nature of the work, the duration of the contract 
and the legal form of the contract. The Group’s 
appetite for very long-term, large, competitively 
tendered construction contracts is limited, 
driven by the desire to manage risk. Tenders for 
contracts are subject to approval by the Board, 
chief executive and finance director or divisional 
directors depending on the value and nature of 
the contract. Contracts in progress are controlled 
and managed through the Group’s operating 
structure and procedures including rigorous and 
regular review of forecast revenue and costs  
to complete.
•  Land acquisition risk: The cost and quality 
of land is fundamental to the profitability of a 
housing development business. Site evaluation 
is a key process and site appraisals are carried 
out in detail including external advice where 
appropriate. Land acquisitions are subject to 
approval by the Board, chief executive and 
finance director or divisional directors depending 
on the value and nature of the contract. 
Developments in progress are controlled and 
managed through the Group’s operating structure 
and procedures including rigorous and regular 
review of forecast revenue and costs to complete.
•  The housing market: Our ability to sell houses 
depends on the demand for housing which, in 
turn, is linked to consumer sentiment. We manage 
the exposure by ensuring that we closely control 
levels of work in progress to match the level 
of demand. Prices and incentives are reviewed 
regularly and adjusted as appropriate.
•  Property development risk: Similar to housing 
land acquisition, acquiring the right property at 
the right price is fundamental to the profitability 
of the Property division. The division controls its 
development risk by commencing construction 
generally when it has either pre-sold or pre-let 
the development. Board approvals are required 
depending upon the value and nature of the 
development.
•  Investment risk: The Group is selective in the PFI 
projects for which it bids, primarily concentrating 
on the sectors where we have established 
construction expertise.
•  People are the key to this business and good 
people are a scarce resource. It is important that 
we attract the best, look after them and retain 
them. Health & Safety is a key feature and we 
have rigorous health and safety policies aimed at 
minimising health and safety incidents that may 
affect any staff, subcontractors and members  
of the public coming into contact with our 
business activities.
•  Pension scheme deficit: The pension scheme 
liabilities and assets are subject to market 
movements and, although a long-term issue, 
regulations require us to respond to these long-
term issues over the short term. Steps have been 
taken to eradicate our calculated deficit over a 
timeframe agreed with the scheme trustees.
•  Counterparty risk: The Group depends for its 
success on the stability of its customers, suppliers, 
funders, bondsmen and insurers. Considerable 
efforts are made to assess the financial strength 
of counterparties before entering into contract 
and to structure payments so as to mitigate our 
financial exposure to them for the duration of 
our relationship. Where the Group is particularly 
dependant on the continued financial strength 
of the providers of key financial services to the 
Group, we take steps to spread this exposure 
across a range of counterparties so as to diversify 
the risk.

Combined Code
A statement on corporate governance is set out on pages 42 to 44.
Going concern basis
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Donations
Group donations to charity in the United Kingdom were £72,000 
(2007: £71,000). In addition the Group has considerable involvement 
in the community as set out in the corporate responsibility report on 
pages 27 to 33. No political donations were made  
(2007: nil).
Policy on payment of creditors
The Group agrees payments with its suppliers and subcontractors on 
an individual contract basis rather than following a standard code. 
The policy is to abide by these agreed terms whenever it is satisfied 
that the suppliers or subcontractors have provided the goods or 
services in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. The 
aggregate amount owed to trade creditors by the Company at the end 
of the year was nil (2007: nil).
Subsidiary trading companies within the Group, acting in accordance 
with the above policy, exhibit creditor days averaging 28 (2007: 32) in 
respect of suppliers of invoiced goods and services and 18 (2007: 20) 
in respect of certified amounts due to subcontractors. These figures 
exclude amounts not currently due for payment but included within 
trade creditors.
Financial instruments
Details of the financial risk management objectives and policies of the 
Group along with its exposure to material financial risks are set out in 
notes 1 and 26 of the consolidated financial statements.
Auditors
A resolution for the reappointment of the auditors, KPMG Audit Plc 
(KPMG), will be proposed at the annual general meeting. The directors 
who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ report 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are unaware; and each director has 
taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

The Code
The Board recognises the importance of high standards of corporate 
conduct and is committed to managing the Group’s operations in 
accordance with the best principles of corporate governance as 
contained within Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued in June 2006 and has complied with it throughout 
the year except as explained below.
Independent non-executive directors comprise less than half of the 
Board. Consultants have been engaged to conduct a search for an 
additional non-executive director, a process which remains ongoing. 
Furthermore, Mr R W Side will retire in November 2008 and there 
are no plans to nominate any additional director to the board on his 
retirement. It is not currently proposed however that the balance of 
the Board be altered further after these changes, as it is felt vital that 
the diverse elements of the Group be represented by executives at 
Board level and that to match each of these executives with non-
executives would produce a board which would be unwieldy and not 
produce any tangible benefit for shareholders.
Neither the Remuneration Committee nor the Audit Committee 
comprised the three independent non-executive directors required by 
the Combined Code. This will be addressed with the appointment of  
a further non-executive director in due course, as described above.
Independent non-executive directors do not comprise a majority 
of the Nomination Committee. This will be addressed with the 
appointment of a further non-executive director in due course, as 
described above.
Board of directors
The Board of Kier Group plc is responsible to its shareholders for the 
success of the Company. It sets the strategic and financial policies of 
the Group, monitors and reviews business performance and controls 
risk. As part of the Group’s organisational structure (described on 
pages 43 to 44 under ‘Internal control’) the Board has put in place 
standing orders which are designed to ensure the provision to it of 
relevant information on a timely basis, which set authorisation limits 
and which reserve certain matters for the Board or its committees, 
including:
• strategy and financial policy;
• the approval of financial statements;
• risk management;
• major capital expenditure;
• major project approval;
• acquisitions and disposals; and
• certain aspects of human resource policy, including senior 
appointments, general salary reviews, employee share plans and 
pension provision.
The principal matters considered by the Board during the year included:
• the Group’s budgets, strategy and financial requirements;
• the full and interim reports and accounts (taking into account the 
views of the Audit Committee);
• interim management statements;
• the Group’s final salary pension scheme;
• the implications of and proper approach to the issues with the 
Castlepoint Shopping Centre car park, Bournemouth;
• potential acquisitions;
• the implications of prevailing economic conditions and the 
response to them;
• material operational opportunities;
• health & safety strategies and particular issues as they arose;
• the investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into alleged 
cover pricing by a Group company including the introduction 
of a competition compliance policy and the audit of the 
implementation of the policy by PriceWaterhouseCoopers; and
• presentations as to strategic issues from the senior management of 
a number of the divisions.
The Group’s chairman is Mr P M White who leads the Board and 
succeeded Mr P T Warry on 1 January 2008. He is responsible for 
its effectiveness and sets its agenda. He facilitates the effective 
contribution of the non-executive directors and ensures a positive 
and constructive relationship between the executive and non-
executive directors. The chairman is also responsible for effective 
communication with shareholders.
The chief executive is Mr J Dodds who is responsible for the 
operational management of the Group and is accountable to the 
Board for the implementation of the Group’s strategy. In order to 
facilitate this, the chief executive meets monthly with a management 
committee comprising the other executive directors, he also chairs 
monthly management meetings with each of the divisions. As director 
responsible for human resource matters and health & safety he also 
meets regularly with the human resources director and the director of 
safety, health & environment.
The senior non-executive director is Mr C V Geoghegan who 
succeeded Mr P M White in that role on 1 January 2008.
Biographical details of all the directors are set out on pages 38 and 
39. All the directors served throughout the year. The Board considers 
Mr C V Geoghegan and Mr S W Leathes to be independent.
A table of attendance of directors at meetings of the Board and 
its various committees is set out on page 43. In addition to these 
meetings, the full Board attends an annual away-day which focuses 
on strategy, material issues facing the Group and succession planning. 
Outside of the formal schedule of meetings, the non-executive 
directors met without the executive directors a number of times 
during the year.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary and the directors are able to seek independent professional 
advice if necessary at the Company’s expense. Training is available 
for new directors and subsequently as necessary. All directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting 
following their appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals 
of no more than three years. Executive directors are required to seek 
approval from the Board before accepting any external non-executive 
positions, although none is currently held.
The Remuneration Committee and Board encourage directors and 
staff at all levels to acquire shares in the Company and to hold them 
for the longer-term. This sense of ownership is an important element 
of Kier’s culture and of its focus on long-term performance. As far as 
possible the Group prefers to promote individuals from within. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 43
Board evaluation
The chairman carried out an evaluation of the Board in the summer 
of 2008. This included all the committees of the Board. The chairman 
held individual meetings with each director to discuss their views and 
to canvass suggestions. The conclusions were discussed collectively 
by the Board and a number of actions agreed. The performance of 
the chairman is reviewed separately in a process led by the senior 
independent director.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at the registered office and will 
be on display prior to and at the annual general meeting.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the two independent non-executive 
directors under the chairmanship of Mr S W Leathes, a chartered 
accountant with recent and relevant financial experience. The 
Committee met three times during the year in September, March and 
June prior to the Board meetings. These Committee meetings were 
also attended by the finance director and the head of internal audit. 
The KPMG audit engagement director attended the September and 
February meetings. The chairman and executive directors were also 
invited to attend the meetings. The Committee also met with KPMG 
without management being present.
The Committee has clearly defined terms of reference which outline 
its objectives and responsibilities relating to financial reporting, 
internal controls, risk management and the application of appropriate 
accounting policies and procedures. Specific responsibilities include 
reviewing and recommending for approval the annual and interim 
financial statements, reviewing the Group’s accounting policies, 
reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management 
and reviewing the scope and results of the external audit.
The Committee also has responsibility for overseeing the Group 
internal audit function including approval of the annual risk-
based audit plan and monitoring the work, recommendations and 
effectiveness of the function. The head of internal audit reports 
directly to the chairman of the Audit Committee.
At each of its meetings the Committee received and reviewed a report 
from the head of internal audit which highlighted the status of the Group 
risk management processes and audit activity against the approved 
plan together with the findings from internal audits. The chairman of 
the Audit Committee also met regularly with the head of internal audit 
and the Committee has met with the head of internal audit without 
management being present. The Committee carried out a review of the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function at the June meeting.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the independence and 
objectivity of KPMG, the external auditor, and agreeing the level 
of remuneration and extent of non-audit services. The Committee 
received a presentation from KPMG on its audit strategy and the 
scope of work at the February meeting which it agreed. It also 
discussed the firm’s professional ethical standards.
The Committee reviewed the performance of KPMG and the level 
of non-audit fees paid to them during the year, which are set out 
in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The provision of 
non-audit services, other than tax compliance and routine taxation 
advice, must be referred to and agreed by the Committee over a pre 
determined cost threshold and any work costed below that threshold 
must be pre-approved by the Group finance director.
No consultancy related work has been carried out by the auditors 
during the year. The Committee was satisfied, following its review, 
that KPMG’s objectivity and independence had not been impaired.
The Committee agreed and approved the audit fee at the June meeting 
following discussions between divisional management and the 
divisional KPMG audit teams.
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed annually and were 
updated in 2004 in line with the guidance and recommendations of 
the revised Combined Code. The terms of reference are available on 
request and on the Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman and the two 
independent non-executive directors, under the chairmanship of  
Mr C V Geoghegan, who succeeded Mr P M White on 1 January 2008.
Information about the workings of this Committee is contained 
in the directors’ remuneration report on page 45. The Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework 
of executive remuneration and determines, on its behalf, specific 
remuneration packages for each of the executive directors. In doing 
so it takes the advice of independent external consultants. The terms 
of reference are available on the Company’s website.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee presently comprises the chairman, the 
chief executive and the non-executive directors. It is responsible 
for monitoring the composition and balance of the Board, making 
recommendations to the Board on new Board appointments and 
succession planning. The Committee met twice during the year. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website.

Internal control
The Combined Code requires that the directors review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. This extends 
the directors’ review to cover all material controls, including 
operational, compliance and financial controls and risk management 
systems. The directors are satisfied that procedures are in place 
to ensure that the Group complies with the Turnbull Committee 
guidance published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
England and Wales and that the procedures have been applied  
during the year. 44 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

Internal control continued
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Board considers that the Group’s systems and controls are 
appropriately designed to ensure that the Group’s exposure to 
significant risks is properly managed. However, such a system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement. In reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal controls, which have been developed and 
refined over many years, the directors have considered the key risks 
and exposures within the Group.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
principal controls are:
• an established management structure operating throughout the 
Group with clearly defined levels of responsibility and delegation 
of authorities;
• clearly defined operating guidelines and procedures with 
authorisation limits set at appropriate levels. These are set out in 
the Group and divisional standing orders;
• a comprehensive budgeting and forecasting system in place which 
is regularly reviewed and updated;
• a formal quarterly review of each division’s year-end forecast, 
business performance, risk and internal control matters is carried 
out by the directors of each division with the chief executive and 
finance director in attendance;
• monthly management reporting including regular comparison of 
actual results against latest forecasts;
• established policies and procedures governing the Group’s 
investment in land, property and other significant assets, including 
acquisitions and disposals. These include detailed appraisals, 
appropriate authorisation levels and Board approval depending on 
value or perceived exposure;
• investment decisions, including Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
projects and tenders for contracts are subject to approval by the 
Board, the chief executive and finance director or divisional 
directors depending on the value and nature of the investment or 
contract. Individual tender and project review procedures are in 
place prior to bidding and before contract award;
• internal audits are carried out to assess the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal controls. The scope of the internal audit 
work is planned to cover the key risks faced by the business and 
supplemented by cyclical reviews of the core financial process. 
Internal audit findings are reported to the Audit Committee and the 
executive directors on a regular basis;
• risk registers are in place for each business unit which highlight 
the key risks facing that business together with an assessment 
of the effectiveness of controls to mitigate those risks. The risk 
registers are updated regularly and at 31 March;
• an annual process of risk and control self assessment is used 
in the Group whereby all operating companies are required to 
review and confirm that appropriate internal controls are in place 
and operating effectively across the key risk areas identified in 
individual company risk registers. This assessment was carried 
out on 31 March 2008 and the findings reviewed by the Audit 
Committee;
• regular monitoring, review and reporting of safety, health and 
environmental matters; and
• the provision of a confidential method of reporting any suspected 
fraud or other misfeasance to the head of internal audit.
The Board receives regular reports from all operating units to monitor 
their performance and all directors are properly briefed on issues 
arising at Board meetings.
During the course of the year members of the Board visit all 
companies and monitor the control framework of each business.  
The Audit Committee reviews the appropriateness and effectiveness  
of internal controls.
Relations with shareholders
The Board uses the annual general meeting to communicate with 
shareholders and encourages their attendance and participation. The 
chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee 
are available to answer questions from shareholders. The Group also 
maintains a regular dialogue with institutional investors to assist in 
the understanding of the Group’s objectives and the Company has  
a programme of regular communication with investors, analysts and 
brokers. Presentations are made to investors, analysts and press at the 
time of the announcement of the final and half-year results and there 
are regular meetings with analysts and investors which are arranged 
through the Company’s brokers so that the investment community can 
be kept informed. The Board is provided with independent feedback 
from analysts and institutional shareholders periodically.
The Kier website is also maintained to aid communication with 
investors, employees, customers, suppliers and the general public. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 45

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a Board committee consisting of 
independent non-executive directors and the Chairman who was 
considered independent upon his appointment. The following 
directors were members of the Committee for the year ended  
30 June 2008:
Mr C V Geoghegan (chairman)
S W Leathes
P M White
Mr C V Geoghegan was appointed as chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee on 1 January 2008.
The secretary of the Committee is Mr M D Barton, company secretary.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Group’s 
website and on request from the company secretary. The Committee 
meets when necessary, but not less than once a year. The Committee 
consults the chief executive concerning its proposals (except in 
relation to his own remuneration) and takes external professional 
advice as appropriate. In respect of the year ended 30 June 2008 
the Committee appointed Kepler Associates as its independent 
remuneration advisors. Kepler Associates provides no other service 
to the Company. Where necessary, or appropriate, the Committee 
instigates consultation with major institutional shareholders on 
remuneration matters.
Remuneration policy
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive 
remuneration policy for adoption by the Board and determines 
specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors 
on behalf of the Board. The Committee also monitors remuneration 
packages of other senior executives throughout the Group. 
Remuneration and benefits are set at market levels comparable 
with companies of similar size and scope of activity in order to be 
able to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals. The 
Committee’s policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between 
fixed elements of remuneration (basic salary, benefits in kind and 
pension) and performance-related elements (annual bonus and long-
term incentives) and to place much greater emphasis on rewarding 
executives by reference to the Group’s long-term performance rather 
than its short-term results. The remuneration received by each of the 
directors, together with details of share interests and pension benefits, 
are set out on pages 47 to 49.
Executive directors’ remuneration consists of a basic salary together 
with an annual bonus, benefits in kind, awards under a long-term 
incentive plan (LTIP), and membership of a pension scheme. The 
remuneration components are set out below:
Basic salary
Salaries for executive directors take account of external market data 
and the individual’s responsibilities, experience and performance. 
Salaries are reviewed annually.
Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind comprise membership of private health insurance, 
provision of a fuel card and the provision of a company car or  
a car allowance.
Annual bonus arrangements
A bonus is paid to all executive directors at a percentage of 
annualised basic salary (not exceeding 35% for the year ended  
30 June 2008) if Group pre-tax profit attains targets pre-set each year. 
These targets are agreed by the Committee; they are not published 
externally for reasons of commercial confidentiality.
Retirement benefits
Executive directors participate in the Kier Group Pension Scheme 
which has both a defined benefit section and a defined contribution 
plan.
Executive directors in the defined benefits section accrue pension up 
to the value of the lifetime allowance. Where the value of pension 
exceeds the lifetime allowance, future pension accrual ceases and 
executive directors receive a pension allowance of 20% of salary.
Only the basic salary of directors is pensionable. Details of individual 
directors’ pension arrangements are shown in a separate table on 
page 47.
Long-term incentives
Under the Kier Group 1999 LTIP, approved by shareholders, directors 
can receive awards of shares worth up to 100% of salary per annum. 
Awards granted in the year to 30 June 2008 are subject to the Group 
achieving the following adjusted earnings per share growth targets:
• the directors will receive 100% of the award if earnings per share 
increase by at least 20% per annum in excess of inflation (the 
maximum target) over the relevant three-year performance period;
• no awards will vest unless earnings per share over the same period 
increase by at least 5% per annum in excess of inflation (the base 
target) at which point 25% of the award will vest; and
• the proportion of the awards which will vest for performance 
between the base target and the maximum target will be 
calculated on a straight-line basis.
The above targets were selected by the Committee to ensure that the 
Group would have to attain a substantial improvement in underlying 
financial performance before the awards could vest. Growth in 
earnings per share is the key performance measure used by the 
Group. The attainment of the performance targets is verified by the 
Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Company’s auditors.
46.7% of executive directors’ remuneration for the year ended  
30 June 2008 was represented by the vesting under the LTIP on the 
basis of the share values at the time of the vesting. This calculation 
includes lower levels of award for directors within three years of their 
appointment to the Board.
The Remuneration Committee has set a policy whereby it encourages 
executive directors to build up a shareholding in the Company equal 
to at least one year’s salary over a period of up to five years.
Service contracts
The Company has service agreements with its executive directors 
which have a notice period of one year although there is a duty 
to mitigate in the event of termination. As stated in the corporate 
governance statement, executive directors are required to seek 
approval from the Board before accepting any external non-executive 
positions. Any emoluments arising from such positions are taken into 
account by the Remuneration Committee. Currently no paid external 
non-executive positions are held by executive directors.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by 
the Board and reflects the anticipated time commitment to fulfil their 
duties. Non-executive directors do not receive bonuses, long-term 
incentive awards, pension provision or compensation on termination 
of their appointment. The Company has agreements for services with 
each of the non-executive directors, all of which are terminable on no 
more than 12 months’ notice by either party. 46 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

he currently receives a pensionable allowance of 20% of salary.

  50 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (IFRS) and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards and applicable law.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS to 
present fairly the financial position and the performance of the 
Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving 
a fair presentation.
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a directors’ report, directors’ remuneration 
report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law 
and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the 
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(IFRS), and for preparing the parent company financial statements and 
the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with applicable law 
and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities on 
page 50.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion 
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the 
financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report 
includes that information presented in the operating and financial 
review that is cross-referred from the business review section of the 
directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its 
risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other 
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRS, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
30 June 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation;
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2008;
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the 
financial statements.

 | SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Kier Group plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in the United 
Kingdom (UK). The consolidated financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended 30 June 2008 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the Group’s 
interest in jointly controlled entities.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the directors 
on 17 September 2008.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
and approved by the directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS). The 
Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (GAAP). These are presented on pages 83 to 85.
Basis of preparation
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They 
have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative 
financial instruments which are stated at their fair value, certain 
inventories that are valued at net realisable value and certain payables 
on extended terms which are stated at discounted cost.
The following amendments to standards or interpretations are 
mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended 30 June 2008 
and have been adopted by the Group:
IFRIC 10 ‘Interim financial reporting and impairment’. This 
interpretation has not had any impact on the timing or recognition of 
impairment losses as the Group already accounted for such amounts 
using principles consistent with IFRIC 10.
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, and the related 
amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ on capital 
disclosures. This has resulted in additional disclosures but no impact 
on reported profit or net assets.
IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’. This 
interpretation has not had any impact on the Group.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial 
year ended 30 June 2008:
IAS 23 ‘Amendments to borrowing costs’
IAS 27R ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’
IFRS 2 ‘Amendments to share-based payments: vesting conditions 
and cancellations’
IFRS 3R ‘Business combinations’
IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’
IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’
IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum 
funding requirements and their interaction’.
The directors have considered the impact of these new standards and 
interpretations in future periods and no significant impact is expected. 
The Group has chosen not to adopt any of the above standards and 
interpretations early.
In respect of IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’ which 
has not yet been endorsed by the EU, the Group has continued to 
recognise the FRS 5 ‘Reporting the substance of transactions’ finance 
debtors relating to concession arrangements held by PFI joint ventures 
at amortised cost as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement.’ The effect of adopting this policy 
is to maintain the accounting within PFI joint ventures in line with 
existing UK GAAP (with the exception of the treatment of interest 
rate derivatives under IAS 39), while ensuring that the accounting 
treatment complies with existing IFRS. The Group does not expect 
the change in accounting policy to have a significant effect when 
the interpretation becomes mandatory for the accounting period 
commencing 1 July 2008.
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the 
Company drawn up to 30 June 2008. Control exists when the Group 
has direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its 
activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control transfers to the Group until the 
date that control ceases. The purchase method is used to account for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group 
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with 
third parties.
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for 
using the equity method. Under this method the Group’s share of 
the profits less losses of jointly controlled entities is included in the 
consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is 
included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the 
share of losses exceeds the Group’s interest in the entity and there is 
no obligation to fund these losses the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued; future profits are 
not recognised until unrecognised losses are extinguished. Interest in 
the entity is the carrying amount of the investment together with any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the net investment 
in the entity.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, 
that company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities 
and expenses it incurs and its share of the income. Such joint 
arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on 
the same basis.

 | SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly controlled 
entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment 
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in 
the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Negative 
goodwill is recognised in the income statement immediately. On 
disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the attributable 
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 July 2004, being the date 
of transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts at 1 July 2004 subject to being tested for impairment. 
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 
has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets which comprise contract rights are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to cost of sales in the income statement on  
a straight-line basis over the relevant contract period.
Exceptional items
Items which are significantly material by either their size or nature 
to require separate disclosure are reported separately in the income 
statement in the column headed ‘Exceptional items’.
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. It also includes the Group’s 
proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue and profit are recognised as follows:
(a) Private housing and land sales
Revenue from housing sales is recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable on legal completion, net of 
incentives. Revenue from land sales and land exchanges is recognised 
on the unconditional exchange of contracts. Profit is recognised on 
a site-by-site basis by reference to the expected out-turn result from 
each site. The principal estimation technique used by the Group in 
attributing profit on sites to a particular period is the preparation of 
forecasts on a site-by-site basis. These focus on revenues and costs to 
complete and enable an assessment to be made of the final out-turn 
on each site. Consistent review procedures are in place in respect 
of site forecasting. Provision is made for any losses foreseen in 
completing a site as soon as they become apparent.
(b) Property development
Revenue in respect of property developments is taken on 
unconditional exchange of contracts on disposal of finished 
developments. Profit taken is subject to any amounts necessary to 
cover residual commitments relating to development performance. 
Provision is made for any losses foreseen in completing a 
development as soon as they become apparent.
Where developments are sold in advance of construction being 
completed, revenue and profit are recognised from the point of 
sale and as the significant outstanding acts of construction and 
development are completed.
(c) Construction contracts
Revenue arises from increases in valuations on contracts and includes 
the Group’s share of revenue from joint arrangements, and goods and 
services provided.
Revenue is normally determined by external valuations and is the 
gross value of work carried out for the period to the balance sheet 
date (including retentions) but excludes claims until they are  
actually certified.
Profit on contracts is calculated in accordance with accounting 
standards and industry practice and may not relate directly to 
revenue. The principal estimation technique used by the Group in 
attributing profit on contracts to a particular period is the preparation 
of forecasts on a contract by contract basis. These focus on revenues 
and costs to complete and enable an assessment to be made of the 
final out-turn on each contract. Consistent contract review procedures 
are in place in respect of contract forecasting.
The general principles for profit recognition are:
• Profits on short duration contracts (generally less than 12 months) 
are taken when the contract is complete;
• Profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of 
completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be foreseen 
with reasonable certainty;
• Provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing the 
contract to completion as soon as they become apparent; and
• Claims receivable are recognised as income when received or 
certified for payment except that, in preparing contract forecasts 
to completion, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims 
receivable may be included to mitigate foreseeable losses but only 
to the extent that there is reasonable assurance of recovery.
Percentage completion is normally calculated by taking certified 
value to date as a percentage of estimated final value unless the 
adjusted value is materially different in which case the adjusted value 
is used. 58 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

Pre-contract costs
Costs associated with bidding for contracts are written off as incurred 
(pre-contract costs). When it is probable that a contract will be 
awarded, usually when the Group has secured preferred bidder status, 
external costs incurred from that date to the date of financial close are 
carried forward in the balance sheet.
When financial close is achieved on PFI or Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) contracts, external costs are recovered from the special purpose 
vehicle and pre-contract costs within this recovery that were not 
previously capitalised are credited to the income statement, except 
to the extent that the Group retains a share in the special purpose 
vehicle. The amount not credited is deferred and recognised over the 
life of the construction contract to which the costs relate.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Depreciation is based on historical or deemed cost, less the estimated 
residual value, and the estimated economic lives of the assets 
concerned. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible assets 
are depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their 
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows:
Freehold buildings 25-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles 3-12 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of 
the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.
Leases
Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Employee benefits
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group, 
amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. The charge to the income statement reflects the current 
and past service costs of such obligations, and the interest cost on 
scheme liabilities less the expected return on plan assets.
The retirement benefit obligation represents the difference between 
the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme 
liabilities. It is determined biannually by independent actuaries and 
recognised in full in the balance sheet. Differences between the 
actual and expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses 
arising on scheme liabilities during the year, together with differences 
arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised in full directly 
in reserves via the statement of recognised income and expense in 
the year. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 
‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ 
cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 July 2004 were presented 
within the opening retained earnings reserve at that date.
The recognised pension asset is limited to the present value of any 
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to 
the plan expected at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance with 
the rules of the schemes and the recommendation of the actuary.
(b) Share-based payments
Share-based payments granted but not vested, are valued at the fair 
value of the shares at the date of grant. This affects the Sharesave 
and LTIP schemes. The fair value of these schemes at date of award is 
calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
The cost to the Group of awards to employees under the LTIP scheme 
is spread on a straight-line basis over the relevant performance 
criteria period. The scheme awards to senior employees a number of 
shares which will vest after three years if particular criteria are met. 
The Group has the option to make the awards either as shares or as  
a combination of shares and cash based on the share price prevailing 
when the shares vest. The cost of the share-based payment element  
of the scheme is based on the fair value of the shares at the date  
the options are granted, and the cost of the cash based payment 
element is based on the market value of the share options at the 
balance sheet date.
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the Group’s 
share schemes are deducted from retained earnings. No gain or loss is 
recognised within the income statement on the market value of these 
shares compared to the original cost.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank deposits is credited or 
charged to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs qualifying 
assets and has separately identifiable funding. All other borrowing 
costs are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled entities 
relating to the construction of assets in PFI and PPP projects are 
capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Notional interest payable, representing the unwinding of the discount 
on long-term liabilities, is charged to finance costs.
Infrequently a long-term land creditor arises for a parcel or parcels  
of land where the Group has exchanged unconditional contracts,  
and so recognised the creditor and the land inventory, but in 
practice does not have title or access to the land. In these few cases 
the notional interest payable already charged to finance costs is 
then credited to finance costs and added to the cost of inventory in 
accordance with IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ and IAS 2 ‘Inventories’. 
In no circumstances will the cost of such land inventory exceed the 
contracted sum payable. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 59

Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also 
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for  
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
exchange rates in effect when they take place. Resulting foreign 
currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at the 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the  
income statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are 
translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Trading profits or losses are translated at average rates prevailing 
during the accounting period. Differences on exchange arising 
from the retranslation of net investments in overseas subsidiary 
undertakings at the year-end rates are recognised in the translation 
reserve. All other translation differences are reflected in the  
income statement.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 the Group 
has elected to set the previously accumulated translation differences 
relating to investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings to nil at  
1 July 2004.
Mining assets
Opencast expenditure incurred prior to the commencement of 
operating opencast sites is capitalised and the cost less the residual 
value is depreciated over the coaling life of the site on a coal 
extraction basis. The total cost of restoration is recognised as a 
provision as soon as the mine becomes operational. The amount 
provided represents the present value of the anticipated costs. Costs 
are charged against the provision as incurred and the unwinding 
of the discount is included within interest costs. A tangible asset 
is created for an amount equivalent to the initial provision and 
depreciated on a coal extraction basis over the life of the asset.  
Where there is a subsequent change in the estimate of restoration 
costs or discount rate, the present value of the change is recognised 
in the cost of the tangible asset with a corresponding change to the 
restoration provision. The resulting impact on the unwinding of the 
discount is recognised in the year of change.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress, including land held for and in 
the course of development, are valued at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where 
appropriate, labour and production overheads which have been 
incurred in bringing the inventories and work in progress to their 
present location and condition. Cost in certain circumstances also 
includes notional interest as explained in the accounting policy 
for finance income and costs. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Construction work in progress is included within inventories in the 
balance sheet. It is measured at cost plus profit less losses recognised 
to date less progress billings. If payments received from customers 
exceed the income recognised, the difference is included within trade 
and other payables in the balance sheet.
Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised – 
generally after exchange of unconditional contracts.
Property inventory, which represents all development land and work 
in progress, is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing 
and disposing of the development less any amounts received or 
receivable as progress payments or part disposals. Where a property is 
being developed, cost includes cost of acquisition and development 
to date, including directly attributable fees, expenses and finance 
charges net of rental or other income attributable to the development. 
Where development property is not being actively developed, net 
rental income and finance costs are taken to the income statement. 60 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

 | SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and where it is 
probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation and 
the amount can be reliably estimated.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. The principal financial assets and 
liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) Trade receivables and trade payables
Given the varied activities of the Group it is not practicable to identify 
a common operating cycle. The Group has therefore allocated 
receivables and payables due within 12 months of the balance sheet 
date to current with the remainder included in non-current.
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their initial 
value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts.
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are  
stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and recorded 
at their fair value.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash 
at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities 
of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
included within financial liabilities in current liabilities in the  
balance sheet.
(c) Bank and other borrowings
Interest-bearing bank and other loans are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of 
the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise.
(d) PFI assets
Under the terms of a PFI or similar project, where the risks and 
rewards of ownership remain largely with the purchaser of the 
associated services, the Group’s interest in the asset is classified as 
a financial asset and included at its amortised cost within amounts 
receivable from joint ventures under trade and other receivables.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that 
the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future 
periods at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting 
change in fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is 
designated as an effective hedging instrument.
The effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives is 
recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity 
are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged 
items will affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate derivatives 
is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to 
terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge 
against transactional foreign currency exposures. In cases where these 
derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as 
described above. Where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in 
fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement. Fair 
values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, relate 
to revenue and profit recognition and the valuation of defined pension 
scheme assets and liabilities.
Revenue and profit recognition
Details on the estimation techniques used for revenue and profit 
recognition in respect of private housing and land sales, property 
development and construction contracts are given on page 57.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets 
and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. The key 
assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors 
outside the control of the Group:
• Expected return on plan assets
• Inflation rate
• Mortality
• Discount rate
• Salary and pension increases
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 8. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 61

The carrying value of inventories has been written down to net realisable value as a result of a significant deterioration in market conditions.
During the year the Group sold its investment in Prospect Healthcare (Hairmyres) Group Limited for £13.8m which, when combined with a refinancing

 | RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Kier operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below:
Kier Group Pension Scheme
This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan. The assets of the Scheme are held under trust 
separately from those of the Group; the Trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional 
investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002; existing members continue to accrue benefits for future 
service.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 1 April 2005 using the projected unit method. The 
market value of the schemes’ assets at that date were £369.8m which represented approximately 82% of the benefits that had accrued to members 
at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The contributions paid during the year were £17.1m (2007: £24.0m) which include special 
contributions of £6.0m (2007: £11.0m).
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2005 valuation date not covered by the 
above special contributions over a ten-year period to March 2016. The Group expects to pay contributions for future service of £12.6m being 19.1% of 
pensionable pay plus £6.0m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2009.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution 
section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme. The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance with the rates 
specified in their contracts of employment. The contributions paid during the year and the pension charge, amounted to £4.9m (2007: £3.9m).
Kier Sheffield  LLP
Kier participates in this defined benefits scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in the South 
yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003. As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and 
ongoing past service liabilities of £65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Council’s employment to Kier Sheffield LLP upon the start of the contract. New 
employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme. Kier Sheffield LLP is required to pay 
contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier Sheffield LLP’s pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the 
project unit method. The contributions paid during the year were £1.1m (2007: £1.6m). Going forward Kier Sheffield LLP expects to pay contributions 
for future service at the rate of 11.5% of pensionable pay which the funds actuary has determined is sufficient to meet ongoing benefits.
Other schemes
Contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme, and in respect of employees who 
are members of a local government pension scheme. The pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid over the year. 66 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of £8.0m (2007: £10.6m) available for offset against future profits. This is made up of  
£4.4m (2007: £6.8m) of income losses and £3.6m (2007: £3.8m) of capital losses. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £0.1m  
(2007: £2.9m) of income losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future 
profit streams against which these losses could be offset. Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

 | GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
There are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangements, including joint 
arrangements and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business. The Office of Fair Trading has named Kier Regional Limited as one of 
the 112 construction companies in its Statement of Objections (SO) in connection with its investigation into alleged infringements of UK Competition 
Law in the sector. Kier has responded to the SO but it is not possible to predict the effect of the Office of Fair Trading’s investigation on the Group’s 
financial position or results of operations.

Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit 
risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on 
financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board. Treasury is not 
a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest 
and exchange rates. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 79
26
 | FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by 
the major ratings agencies. Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter party are within 
predetermined limits. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following 
a review of individual receivable accounts. There is no Group-wide rate of provision, and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior 
default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers 
that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below:
    2008 2007
    £m £m
Provision as at 1 July    2.1 2.4
Increase in provision during the year    0.2 –
Provision utilised during the year    – –
Provision released during the year    (0.7) (0.3)
Provision as at 30 June    1.6 2.1
There are £63.7m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which £41.3m had been 
received by the end of August 2008. There are no indications as at 30 June 2008 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of 
the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided. The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2008 
that were overdue for payment was 23%. Credit terms vary across the Group; the average age of trade receivables was as follows:
Construction 48 days (2007: 43 days) 
Support Services 38 days (2007: 34 days)
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group has hedged its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of £30.2m of loan notes for ten years from February 2003, 
which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p.a. The balance of the Group’s borrowings are to finance short-term working capital requirements. 
Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Group’s PFI and Property joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry 
significant net debt over the medium-term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of 
unsecured committed borrowing facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed 
to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels. 80 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

Fuel price forward contracts  0.9 0.1 1.0 –
In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk. 
Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without 
recourse to the Group. At 30 June 2008 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held 
is £156.4m. The Group’s share of the total net fair value asset of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2008 amounted to £2.3m which, together with 
the related deferred tax liability of £0.6m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
Financial assets and liabilities – analysis by currency and maturity dates
At 30 June 2008 the Group had cash, overdrafts and long-term borrowings denominated in the following currencies:

Other 6.8 – 6.8 1.7 – 1.7
Total 174.1 (30.2) 143.9 178.6 (30.2) 148.4
There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Group’s aggregate financial assets and liabilities. 
The financial liabilities represent a £17.0m UK sterling loan and a £13.4m US dollar loan, net of £0.2m of capitalised finance costs, from the private 
placement of loan notes made in February 2003. The loans are repayable in one payment in February 2013. The UK sterling loan is at a fixed interest 
rate of 6.4% for the term of the loan. The Group has entered into interest payment and repayment swaps for the US dollar loan, which give an effective 
6.4% fixed interest rate for the term of the loan.
The remaining financial assets and liabilities are cash, short-term deposits and overdrafts at floating rates based on LIBOR.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has £102.5m (2007: £107.5m) of unsecured committed borrowing facilities due for renewal as follows:

 | ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash flow statements’.
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for diminution in value.
Deferred taxation
In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’, deferred taxation is provided fully and on a non-discounted basis at expected future corporation tax rates in 
respect of timing differences between profits computed for taxation and accounts purposes.
Own shares
The cost of the Company’s investment in its own shares which comprise shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust for the purpose of 
funding of the Company’s share option plans, is shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds in retained earnings.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments under the Sharesave and LTIP schemes. The fair value of these schemes at the date of grant is 
expressed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are cash at bank and borrowings. Cash at bank is carried in the balance sheet at nominal value. 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The consolidated financial statements include disclosures in note 26 under IFRS 7 which comply with FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments and Disclosures’. 
Consequently the Company has taken advantage of certain exemptions in FRS 29 from the requirement to present separate financial instrument 
disclosures for the Company.
2
 | PROFIT FOR THE yEAR
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £4,835 (2007: £4,650). No other services were provided to the Company.

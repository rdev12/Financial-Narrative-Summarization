Our performance
 In 2006 there were 16 GAME stores in 
Australia, predominantly in New South 
Wales. Now there are more than 100, 
spread throughout all eight States. This 
rapid growth has demanded an equally 
rapid increase in employee numbers. 
While the difﬁ culty in recruiting employees 
varies from State to State, as a company 
with a youth-oriented culture and 
competitive remuneration, we are viewed 
as being a good employer and have 
at least ﬁ ve, and sometimes as many 
as 50, applicants for each vacancy. 
We recruit people who have a good 
mix of gaming knowledge and sales skills, 
and train them through a mix of theory 
and practice. We begin with GAME UK’s 
Excellence in People Programme – 
modiﬁ ed to suit our society and legislation 
– and continue with a culture of 
continuous personal development. 
Our success depends on the skills of our 
people; their opportunities for career 
development are limited only by their 
individual effort, passion and commitment. 
 For further information, see pages 34 to 35.

Our performance
 Our customers are passionate about 
games – and we are too. Our team’s 
understanding of what our customers 
want, combined with the great 
partnerships we have with the format 
holders and publishers of games, 
guarantees that we have the right 
products in our stores at the right time. 
While customer demand determines 
how long we stock a particular game – 
and preowned helps to extend the 
lifecycle – the life-blood of the business 
is the innovative products we sell.
We work closely with suppliers to create 
excitement about new products and to 
drive pre-orders – the key to predicting 
how a new game will perform. We also 
co-operate with the suppliers to identify 
if there is, for example, content, packaging, 
or extra material which we can use to 
make a unique offer for GAME customers. 
What’s special about GAME and 
Gamestation is the excitement and 
theatre we create for customers 
with every major product launch. 
 For further information, see pages 34 to 35.
Highlights
The average GAME store now has 
a range of 1,200 mint products 
and 800 preowned products.
GAME Group opened 500 stores 
worldwide at midnight on 29 April

Preowned
Our performance
The opportunity for customers to trade 
in their “old”games for credit or cash, and 
to buy preowned games for a lower price 
than new games, is at the core of our offer 
in every territory.
It means we can guarantee customers 
the best deal from our stores – even when 
compared to supermarkets or other 
discounters – as long as they have a game 
to trade or are happy to buy preowned. 
It’s been part of our offer for over a 
decade, and applies to everything we 
sell. Central control, using a detailed 
matrix, ensures we always have good 
stock cover and competitive prices. 
It’s always been popular with core gamers 
because it allows them to play more 
games, and keep pace with the 
constantly improving titles or consoles 
that are released. 
Increasingly mass market gamers
are also discovering the beneﬁ ts of 
trade-in and preowned, and using it to 
save money. We help them by offering 
trade-in cards, regular promotions, 
and product guarantees. 
 For further information, see pages 34 to 35.
Highlights
Group preowned sales increased 
by nearly £100 million in the year, 
up 37 per cent.
Preowned gross margins rose to 
39.1 per cent from 36.9 per cent.
 Preowned
 It is worth 18 per cent of Group turnover 
and growing, and preowned is a vital part of 
our value proposition. Group Planning and 
Business Development Director Mark Axon 
explains why customers value it so much.

Customer loyalty
Our performance
 Customers are at the heart of our strategy 
and we work hard to attract and maintain 
their loyalty. We do this in a number of 
ways: our stores are easy to ﬁ nd and are 
well stocked with a wide range of new and 
preowned, value-for-money games; store 
staff are helpful and friendly; customers 
can buy online; they can trade-in games; 
and we operate Reward Card and gift 
card schemes.
Reward Card customers are given points 
worth 2.5 per cent of their purchase, and 
double points on preorders, and also 
receive exclusive offers. By giving us a 
great insight into customers’ buying habits, 
Reward Cards also enable us to continue 
to deliver what customers want. We are 
succeeding: in recent research, more than 
70 per cent of customers said they would 
buy their next game from one of our stores. 
Gift cards offer customers’ beneﬁ ts on top 
of their obvious use as a gift – customers 
can top them up over a number of months, 
and store the value of their trade-ins on 
them as well.
 For further information, see pages 34 to 35.
Highlights
25,000 new Reward Card customers 
a week at peak in the UK.

Our performance
 In the last few years, GAME Iberia has 
been expanding at a fast pace reaching 
its current level of 258 stores across the 
peninsula. While the majority are in 
commercial centres, we are increasingly 
ﬁ nding opportunities to open on 
high streets as only 15 per cent of our 
stores are currently located on main 
shopping streets.
 
It is undoubtedly becoming more difﬁ cult 
to ﬁ nd prime sites, but new commercial 
centres are still being developed in Spain, 
and the good relationships we build with 
landlords enable us to reserve premium 
space. GAME’s acquisition of Gamestation 
gives us the opportunity to open a second 
brand in the larger malls.
 
In a country which has a population of 45 
million – and is Europe’s fourth-largest games 
market – we will continue to negotiate for 
the best sites to enable us to continue our 
excellent growth and proﬁ tability.
 For further information, see pages 34 to 35.
Highlights
181 new outlets opened across the 
Group in 2008, including 18 new

GAME Group Online is about more than

Our performance
 Having the right supply at the right time 
is vital for any specialist retailer, but in 
France – where all retailers, including 
hypermarkets, sell the same products at 
roughly the same price – we also need 
to differentiate. This is where our special 
relationships with suppliers come 
into play. 
Because the suppliers know how much 
effort we invest in customer relationships 
they are happy to spend time with us on 
creating exclusive extras for the launch 
of a new product – an extension of the 
game when it is played online, for 
example, or a special car that can be 
downloaded. Suppliers are also happy to 
guarantee stock to meet pre-orders at our 
192 stores. It is, then, excellent relationships 
with customers that enable us to build 
business relationships with our suppliers 
– and excellent relationships enable us 
to maintain, and increase, our market 
share in France.
 For further information, see pages 34 to 35.

Our performance
 We distribute to a total of 66 GAME stores 
throughout Scandinavia: we have 44 
in Sweden, 13 in Norway, and nine in 
Denmark. The stores – which are in all 
major towns and cities – are spread over 
a vast geographic area (it is, for example, 
around 900 kms from our warehouse 
in Stockholm to our store in Lulea in the 
north-west of Sweden). To add to the 
complexity of our task, we work in three 
languages, three currencies and, since 
Norway is not a member of the EU, 
across two jurisdictions. 
Our distribution network, which operates 
from our central warehouse in Stockholm, 
is extremely efﬁ cient. We know that speedy 
delivery of the latest merchandise is vitally 
important to the sales teams in our bright 
and customer-friendly stores. In what is a 
highly-competitive market, timely 
distribution is a major factor in enabling 
us to run a successful business.

Our performance
Our core market is the second 
largest video games market in 
the world, and we are the market 
leaders by some way.
In 2008 revenues increased by 26 
per cent to £1.4 billion, like-for-likes 
(lﬂ ’s) rose by 10.7 per cent, and 
we saw good margin increases.
Customer focus
Our dual brand strategy of GAME 
and Gamestation means we are 
able to appeal to all gaming 
consumers and compete more 
effectively. GAME has mass 
market appeal, and Gamestation 
appeals to the core gamer.
Evolving market
In the UK and Ireland we opened 
net 47 stores in 2008, taking the 
total to 696 stores. 52 GAME 
branded concession stores are in 
strong retail destinations such as 
Debenhams, Selfridges, Fenwick,

all make a positive contribution.

We are an international business 
of scale. International operations 
delivered a strong trading 
performance in 2008 with total 
sales growth of 51 per cent and 
operating proﬁ t increasing by

Our international sales represented

Group sales.
Customer focus
We pride ourselves on having 
a leading and consistent offer 
in every market we trade. 
Each operating division has 
developed the GAME consumer 
offer with a particular focus on

territory has a dedicated buying 
team, Reward Card programme, 
and eCommerce operation.
Evolving market
We opened net 134 stores in our 
International business in 2008, 
and made a small acquisition 
in the Czech Republic. We are 
now trading from 646 stores. 
We plan to add 60 to 70 stores 
outside of the UK this year in the 
markets with opportunities for 
market share gains and good 
return on investment. We will also 
continue to invest in eCommerce 
in each territory.
International
Our multi channel strategy is 
a central focus for the Group. 
We trade from three brands – 
GAME, Gameplay and 
Gamestation.

Customer focus
In 2008 we had around 49 million 
unique visitors to our websites, 
an increase of 39 per cent. 
We invested £8 million in our 
eCommerce operations in two 
core areas, our direct to home 
distribution infrastructure and our 
IT development to further improve 
our sites for our customers. 
Evolving market
The combination of our online 
and in-store offer is an important 
differentiator. We are investing 
in improved search capability 
to enhance the customer journey, 
and shopping experience. We also 
offer a pc digital distribution service 
on our game.co.uk website, and 
although it’s a very small part of 
our online operations, we continue 
to learn and monitor its progress.

Through its specialist retail 
proposition and key attributes for 
business growth, brand plays a 
signiﬁ cant element in supporting 
delivery – on the high street with 
GAME and Gamestation and online.
In the current economic climate, 
those brands with market strength 
and a diversiﬁ ed market base are 
best-placed to weather the difﬁ cult 
environment and prosper faster 
in the resultant upturn.
GAME is in a strong position to counter 
reduction in consumer spending with 
a well-established brand presence in the 
value-for-money and fast-growing preowned 
market, and through its branded specialist 
focus – to beat off competition from non-
specialist supermarkets.
The strength and reputation of its brands – 
GAME and Gamestation, is at the heart of 
its dual strategy and business attributes in:
  Customer Relationship Management, and
   Infrastructure and Support
Customer Relationship Management 
Its employees
A specialist retailer with special people to 
deliver specialist knowledge is a core driver 
of brand value in delivering outstanding 
customer relationship management.
Customer experience is driven by the 
effectiveness of GAME’s employees in 
delivering the brand experience, at point-
of-sale and every touch-point between 
consumer and brand.
The strength and depth of product range
Equally the strength and depth of the product 
range is so crucial to this fast-moving market.
Insatiable customer demand for new product 
means that only a specialist with a dedicated 
operation can handle the size and volume of 
product range, speed of innovation in product 
development and short lead-time to shelf. 
GAME’s track record backed by recent 
research has demonstrated signiﬁ cant trust in 
the brand to deliver on high volume, meeting 
the lightening speed of customer demand 
for product range – as well as responding 
to peaks and troughs.
Preowned
This is a key defensive and high margin core 
plank of GAME’s brand philosophy of driving 
customer loyalty.
Being the ﬁ rst major European retail chain into 
this market has given GAME Group a combined 
26 years of experience across both brands, 
signiﬁ cantly in advance of any competitor 
– making them ﬁ rst and best in class.
Trade-in and preowned has proved to be 
extremely popular with its customers across 
both brands, which helps consumers with 
a value-for-money purchase, and/or a 
contribution towards additional products.
“ Recent research has 
demonstrated signiﬁ cant 
trust in the brand.”

Customer loyalty
Keeping and retaining customers is at the 
heart of GAME’s relationship with its customers… 
whether a GAME, Gamestation or online 
customer.
GAME rewards its customers trust in their 
brand with their generous loyalty scheme 
– the Reward Card.
The loyalty card scheme is fast, interactive, 
immediate and delivers tangible beneﬁ ts 
to consumers over a very short period of 
time, including valuable discounts, superior 
trade-in beneﬁ ts, value-added promotions 
and pre-order priority.
It provides valuable customer insights and 
behavioural change information reinforcing 
the relationship GAME has with its customers.
Infrastructure and support
Property
Maximum exposure for the brands, in the 
right locations to support the individual brand 
positioning for both GAME and Gamestation, 
is integral to increasing footfall, improving 
brand image rating and delivering increased 
proﬁ t per square foot.
Recognition of differing shopping environments 
and trends in differing geographic markets is 
part of the regional property strategy, as is the 
landlord relationship.
eCommerce
Signiﬁ cant growth potential for online retail 
is a generic trend.
Customers are as much a part of the GAME 
community regardless of whether they shop 
online, instore or a combination of both… 
and the quality and reputation of the brand 
is dependent on the consumer experience.
Delivering the same level of ﬂ exibility, 
practicality and personal interaction online 
as instore are key to the successful growth 
of GAME’s eCommerce potential.
Business relationships
The strength of the brand is an integral part 
of GAME’s core relationships with its partners – 
Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.
The trust and reputation of the brand means 
a two-way partnership to maximise sales for 
both parties.
The strength of the GAME brand and its 
customer relationships is strong enough to drive 
pre-orders and secure valuable priority stock 
allocation from partners, who have conﬁ dence 
in the brand to reach the market ﬁ rst.
Distribution
The GAME brands are trusted by both consumers 
and suppliers to be ﬁ rst on shelf with new 
games and to meet the needs of key peaks 
in demand.
Distribution is critical to the continuing successful 
growth of GAME brands, by owning its own 
dedicated distribution facilities it is able to 
guarantee the speed of product to customer.
With its dedicated workforce and distribution 
hub in each international market, GAME 
reinforces its commitment to placing its 
customers at the heart of its operations.

Our performance
Independent market report
continued
 After two years of the most dynamic growth 
in the history of the interactive gaming industry, 
expectation of further development remains 
optimistic despite the worsening economic climate. 
The jostling for market share between the three 
consoles will continue this year but fortunes may 
be reversed for better or worse. Online gaming 
has helped to proliferate the market to wider 
audiences and new business models in this 
sector are becoming widely adopted.
Games software, still reaching new record levels
Games software, the most signiﬁ cant component 
of the total games market in terms of sales, and the 
most consistent and revealing measure of the day to 
day consumer desire for gaming, grew by over 13 per 
cent by value on a worldwide basis in 2008 to reach 
record annual sales of €20.6 billion. This compares 
to a CAGR of 5 per cent over the previous ten years.
For the second year running, Nintendo devices 
provided the main thrust with sales from the Wii 
and DS growing in most territories as stock supply 
of hardware was more consistent than in 2007. 
Microsoft lowered the price of the Xbox 360 and 
increased marketing spend in the last quarter to 
improve its market share over the Sony PlayStation 3 
which had to put its glory on hold for another year 
as the corporation was forced to prioritise 
proﬁ tability over growth.
Software sales from the Sony PSP on a global basis 
have proved surprisingly resilient with some markets 
experiencing double digit growth. This reinforces 
the evidence that quality titles drive hardware sales, 
as clearly demonstrated in Japan where one 
title ensured that the PSP became the top selling 
handheld device over several months – no mean 
feat considering its lifecycle and such a formidable 
rival in the DS.
Pc software still manages to occupy a top three 
place in games platform rankings on a unit basis 
and generated €2 billion (10 per cent of global 
software sales). Pc software sales polarise between 
new, premium priced releases at one end and 
budget labels at the other. The momentum of 
premium priced pc titles is maintained from a 
number of online massively multiple online games 
(MMOGS) and new iterations of veteran franchises.
The USA and Europe are similar in size on most 
platforms except on the Xbox 360, which is most 
attractive to core gamers in the UK and USA, but not 
so much on mainland Europe. DS sales declined 
signiﬁ cantly in Japan in 2008 but the new DSi, 
launched there in November, sold a robust 1.3 million 
units. Combined unit sales of the Wii, PS3 and 
Xbox 360 are expected to remain sturdy in 2009 
in the USA and Europe, providing further impetus 
to margin driving software sales.
Western Europe is now the largest games market 
in the world with packaged software revenues in 
excess of €8.5 billion in 2008. Within Europe, the 
UK leads and is now the second strongest market 
on a global basis after the USA, having overtaken 
Japan last year. The UK retailer landscape is 
changing rapidly with key general chains closing 
and consolidation among the specialists resulting 
in fewer players in the high street, while online 
retailers gain meaningful points in market share.
Online gaming has assisted the spread of gaming to 
diverse cultures and demographics over the last few 
years. Although accounting for less than 25 per cent 
of every dollar spent across the whole leisure software 
industry, this share could double within ﬁ ve years 
as more attractive business models proliferate 
and consoles provide a more relevant alternative 
platform to the pc for this type of experience.
A changing European culture and 
economic landscape
The cultural divide in gaming terms, hardcore 
versus casual can be drawn between the North 
and the South of Europe. Northern markets such 
as Scandinavia and the UK play more competitive 
and irreverent games than the warmer markets 
in the south which prefer a family experience. The 
recent economic fortunes of European markets have 
resulted in diverse sales trends across the continent 
where some markets have seen a decline on some 
platforms which are performing better elsewhere.

Our performance
 These were exceptional results 
for the Group with a 67 per cent 
increase in proﬁ t before taxation 
and non-recurring costs to £126.2 
million (2008: £75.5 million) and 
continue a consistent growth trend 
for our business. The Group basic 
earnings per share before non-
recurring costs in the last four years 
have increased by a compound 
annual average of over 44 per cent. 
The principal drivers have been 
third generation formats with many 
products now having a wider 
demographic appeal, the further 
development of our specialist 
credentials, successful international 
expansion and the signiﬁ cant 
beneﬁ ts arising from our acquisition 
of Gamestation.
 We recognise the unusually challenging and 
uncertain economic conditions in which we are 
operating today, and whilst we are not immune 
to wider economic uncertainties, our record 
results during the crucial Christmas period 
provide reassurance about the appeal and 
resilience of the products we sell and therefore 
our business model. We continue to be 
encouraged by the ongoing demand for third 
generation products which is in part being 
driven by their broadening appeal. Video 
games and, in particular, our trade-in and 
preowned offers, which provide consumers 
with a way to buy games for less, offer an even 
more affordable alternative to many other 
family leisure activities. We remain committed 
to delivering our customers the widest choice 
and value for money.
Results
 Group turnover for the 53 weeks ended 
31 January 2009 increased by 32.2 per cent to 
£1,971.9 million (52 weeks ended 31 January 
2008: £1,491.9 million) with lﬂ  sales up by 
8.8 per cent. In the UK and Ireland, total sales 
increased by 25.7 per cent and lﬂ  sales were up 
by 10.7 per cent. In our International operations, 
total sales increased by 50.6 per cent and lﬂ  
sales rose by 4.6 per cent.
The Group’s gross margin improved by 140 basis 
points. The overall improvement was achieved 
through an increase in higher margin new and 
preowned software within the overall sales mix, 
which rose from 59.7 per cent to 62.2 per cent 
and purchasing synergies from Gamestation. 
In addition, later in the period, we delivered 
efﬁ ciency and gross margin improvements 
from our UK preowned business.
Group operating proﬁ t before non-recurring 
costs was £133.1 million (2008: £82.3 million). 
Proﬁ t before tax and non-recurring costs was 
£126.2 million (2008: £75.5 million) and basic 
earnings per share before non-recurring 
costs were 26.61p (2008: 15.88p).

and has a strong balance sheet.
Business development
Our market and position
 We developed the key differentiators of our 
business to ensure we were well positioned 
ahead of the launch of the latest generation 
of formats:
  Our well established supplier relationships 
allow us to source appropriate quantities 
of “must have” new products and present 
innovative offers to our customers;
  GAME and Gamestation’s specialist retail 
proposition allow us to carry the widest 
range of product on the high street;
  Our well trained and knowledgeable 
employees are instrumental in guiding 
consumers to the products, deals and 
choices that best suit their needs;
  Our GAME Reward Card scheme has over 
12 million members; and
  Our trade-in programme and preowned 
product offer allow consumers to maximise 
their purchases from their available 
cash resources. 
In addition, we have opened stores in the 
right territories and the right locations. We now 
have 1,342 stores across two brands and ten 
countries, reﬂ ecting our strategy of building 
our business in the most appropriate markets.
We continue to invest in our multi-channel 
proposition to ensure we can deliver growth 
in the future and maintain our competitive 
position. Our strategy reﬂ ects customers’ 
increasing adoption of multi-channel shopping, 
and we have invested to ensure that the 
qualities of the GAME and Gamestation offer 
are replicated for our eCommerce customers.
We continue to target the Group’s resources 
towards those markets with the strongest 
return on investment characteristics and where 
we believe our expertise can deliver real 
improvements in performance. 
The third generation consoles are all in good 
supply. Demand has continued to be strong 
and the installed console base has now reached 
record levels at over 22.5 million in the key UK 
market. This level of console ownership has 
been achieved in just over three years, while 
second generation consoles took eight years 
to reach 17 million (source: GfK Chart Track).
An expanded base of hardware in the market 
leads to more software being sold, both to the 
more traditional gamer and to new customers 
entering the market for the ﬁ rst time. The 
consumer appeal of pc and video games is 
broadening with more women and families, 
younger children and more mature customers 
buying games in our stores. 
 “ Our record results during 
the crucial Christmas period 
provide reassurance about 
the appeal and resilience 
of the products we sell 
and therefore our business 
model.”

Our performance
 The UK and Ireland
The market
In the ﬁ nal quarter of the period we saw 
unprecedented changes to the retail landscape 
as some retailers of pc and video games 
ceased to trade. Consequently, we are actively 
focused on securing further proﬁ table market 
share and the early signs are encouraging.
We opened a net 47 stores in the UK and Ireland 
across our GAME and Gamestation brands.
Gamestation
In the UK, we are continuing to develop 
the distinctive dual brand position of GAME 
and Gamestation. 
We acquired Gamestation in May 2007 and 
received Competition Commission clearance 
in January 2008. We have been very pleased 
with the performance of the Gamestation 
business in the ﬁ rst full year under our control 
and it has again exceeded our expectations. 
We have continued to grow the Gamestation 
store portfolio with a focus on locations that 
are complementary to the GAME brand. 
We achieved ongoing synergies of £10 million 
in the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2009 of 
which around £8 million was a reduction in cost 
of sales with £2 million being a reduction in 
operating expenses. We are targeting a further 
£6 million of synergy beneﬁ ts for this year, giving 
an annualised rate of £16 million going forward. 
In order to achieve these synergies there will be 
a total non-recurring charge of approximately 
£16 million related to integrating the acquisition, 
of which £9.5 million has been incurred to 
date with £6.6 million in the 53 weeks ended 
31 January 2009 and £2.9 million in the prior 
year. In addition, the total capital expenditure 
required to integrate the acquisition will be 
£7 million of which £2 million has been incurred 
in the 53 weeks to 31 January 2009. 
Concessions
On 29 September 2008, GAME entered into an 
agreement with Borders to open 20 concessions 
within a number of their stores in the UK. This 
store-in-store concept, which is branded GAME, 
has broadened our consumer reach and will 
complement the GAME standalone stores and 
our other 32 concessions with retailers such as 
Debenhams, Selfridges, Hamleys and Fenwick. 
We will continue to review opportunities to 
expand the concession footprint.
International
The International business continues to perform 
well in all territories despite trading conditions 
deteriorating throughout the period, contributing 
29.6 per cent to the Group revenue and 16.1 per 
cent to operating proﬁ t. 
We opened a net 112 international stores this 
year with 16 of these in France, 45 in Iberia, 
47 in Australia and four in Scandinavia. 
As part of our international growth strategy 
we are continuing to buy-in or close existing 
franchises. During the course of the year, we 
completed the purchase of six of the remaining 
seven French franchise stores for a cost of 
€3.2 million (£2.9 million). We also bought 
in four of our Spanish franchises at a cost 
of €0.9 million (£0.8 million) and closed one. 
There are now only seven franchises within 
the Group.

 eCommerce
Our multi-channel proposition continues to 
evolve very successfully and our sales and 
operating proﬁ ts from eCommerce have grown 
85 per cent and 109 per cent respectively 
to £106.8 million (2008: £57.8 million) and to 
£6.1 million (2008: £2.9 million). Each of our 
International businesses is actively participating 
in this area. In the period, GAME invested 
£8 million in distribution infrastructure and 
further consumer facing development. 
Acquisitions
On 21 August 2008, GAME acquired the Czech 
video games retailer JRC Czech a.s. (“JRC”) for 
Czk112.0 million (£3.6 million) in cash of which 
Czk50.8 million (£1.6 million) was payable 
immediately and the balance is payable 
over the course of the next two years.
JRC, based in Prague, is the leading specialist 
retailer of pc and video games in the Czech 
Republic. JRC provides the opportunity to 
develop GAME’s international business in Central 
and Eastern Europe. The company now 
operates 22 specialist pc and video games 
stores, located in the principal cities in the 
Czech market including six stores in Prague, 
and a transactional eCommerce site 
www.jrc.cz. It is the leading retailer in the market 
with market share in excess of 15 per cent. JRC 
has a committed management team with 
more than 15 years of experience.
The Czech business has contributed £0.5 million 
to Group operating proﬁ ts in the year.
Treasury and capital expenditure
Our net cash, as at 31 January 2009, was 
£81.4 million compared with £42.1 million in the 
prior year. The increase was driven by strong 
operating cash ﬂ ows.
In the 2009/10 ﬁ nancial year average net 
debt is anticipated to be around £64 million 
(2008: £67 million). The Board is committed 
to an efﬁ cient capital structure and continues 
to review the dividend policy and a share 
buyback strategy along with continued organic 
or acquisitive growth of the store portfolio.
We anticipate that our total capital expenditure 
for the current year will be around £35 million 
(FY08/09: £53 million). Store openings, 
refurbishment and information technology 
requirements are expected to cost approximately 
£25 million. In addition we expect to spend 
£5 million on eCommerce development and 
£5 million on the Gamestation integration.
The Board
On 3 July 2008, Dennis Woodside (40) was 
appointed as a Non Executive Director. 
Mr Woodside is a senior executive of Google

On 13 January 2009, Terry Scicluna (51) was

Employees
Our employees, at all levels, have worked 
tirelessly to engage with our customers, provide 
outstanding customer service and have 
contributed to a great ﬁ nancial performance 
through their signiﬁ cant efforts and enthusiasm. 
It is an enormous tribute to all of our employees 
that GAME was awarded the prestigious accolade 
of Speciality Retailer of the Year 2008 at the 
Retail Week Awards in March 2009. On behalf 
of myself and the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our employees for contributing to 
our success.
Corporate Responsibility 
Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) is right at 
the heart of GAME. As a responsible retailer, 
we recognise that the way we operate as a 
business has a direct impact on our reputation 
and our brand. We are continuing to develop 
our CR strategy and our stakeholder relationships.
Current trading and future prospects
We have made a very encouraging start to the 
ﬁ nancial year particularly given that the strong 
comparative period in 2008 (when Group lﬂ  
sales were 18 per cent) was driven by the 
launch of a number of popular software titles 
such as Mario and Sonic at the Olympic 
Games and Mario Kart Wii.
In the ﬁ rst 11 weeks to 18 April 2009 the Group’s 
total sales were up by 1.0 per cent and lﬂ  
sales were down by 6.3 per cent. The lﬂ  sales 
reduction is less than we had anticipated 
and the demand remains strong.
In the UK and Ireland, total sales and lﬂ  sales 
were down by 2.4 per cent and 6.6 per cent 
respectively. In our International business, 
total sales were up by 9.9 per cent and lﬂ  sales 
on a constant currency basis were down 
by 5.7 per cent. On a reported currency basis, 
Group lﬂ  sales were down by 3.7 per cent.
Current trading performance is ahead of our 
expectations and this is particularly pleasing 
when set against the double digit growth 
achieved last year. Year to date margin has 
also improved, up 150 basis points as a result 
of higher margin products within the sales mix. 
As a result of these factors, we anticipate gross 
margin for the full year will improve by 150 to 
175 basis points compared to last year.
The unprecedented range of products has 
broadened the demographic appeal of 
gaming, attracting new customers from all 
generations. With a large and growing installed 
base of hardware in the market and a solid 
line up of new software launches, the Board 
is conﬁ dent in the outlook for the year to 
31 January 2010.

The GAME Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 
2008-2009
 I am pleased to report yet another 
strong set of results for The GAME 
Group despite the challenges 
presented by wider economic issues.
 Our success is based on placing our customers 
at the heart of our business. Our specialist 
proposition is designed to give our customers 
a great shopping experience and encourage 
their loyalty so they will come back to us time 
and time again. 
We focus on offering the widest range and 
choice of products available, combined with 
quality teams on hand to give helpful friendly 
advice, extensive product knowledge and 
exceptional service. 
We are ﬁ rst-to-market with leading promotions 
and multi-buy campaigns. 
Our trade-in programme enables our customers 
to access new games for less and we offer 
preowned products as a more affordable 
alternative to buying new and, through our 
Reward Card scheme, we consistently reward 
their purchases and thank them for shopping 
with us.
Lisa Morgan, Chief Executive
Continuing to focus 
on our customers is 
key to our success.

Our performance
Chief Executive’s review
continued
We believe we are positioned strongly to best 
serve customers as they seek ever better value 
and to differentiate our stores and websites in 
a constantly changing market place.
The Group has beneﬁ ted from the continuing 
growth in the appeal of pc and video games. 
With a worldwide market value of nearly 
$50 billion (source: IDG), video games are now 
a signiﬁ cant part of customers’ entertainment 
spend. The variety of product available 
offers something for everyone and, as a result, 
we have seen a much broader range of 
customers enter our stores and visit us online.
The suppliers of hardware and software 
publishers have recognised the diversity of 
demand. Over the course of our last ﬁ nancial 
year we saw the release of titles such as Grand 
Theft Auto IV , Call of Duty: World at War and 
Gears of War 2, all focused at the more 
traditional gamer. At the other end of the 
spectrum, we also saw innovative and 
interactive family products such as Wii Fit 
and Guitar Hero perform extremely well 
in the market place.
We have experienced central teams who work 
closely with our suppliers to ensure we get the 
right products to the right stores, in the right 
quantities, at the right time, supporting our 
store teams so they can focus on looking 
after our customers.
 UK and Ireland
In the UK we trade from over 690 stores through 
our GAME and Gamestation brands. The two 
brands appeal to different sets of customers, 
with Gamestation targeting the more traditional 
core gamer and GAME the family. They 
complement each other extremely well and as 
a result they both traded very successfully last 
year, delivering 70 per cent of Group revenue 
and 84 per cent of Group operating proﬁ t.
The UK games’ retail environment has changed 
considerably over the course of the year, 
with both Woolworths and Zavvi going into 
administration and withdrawing from the 
high street. We are well placed to beneﬁ t 
from these changes.
We further expanded our concession 
partnerships to gain access to new markets 
and customers. GAME concessions were 
opened in 20 Borders book stores across the 
UK – providing a relatively low-cost route to 
expand into new locations and reach even 
more customers.
It was our ﬁ rst full year of trading the Gamestation 
brand, following our acquisition of the business 
in May 2007. Gamestation has exceeded 
our expectations and we have continued 
to develop the brand and open new stores 
in appropriate locations. We expect to see 
further proﬁ t improvements as we complete 
the integration in 2009.
International
We trade from nearly 650 stores in eight 
international territories – France, Spain, Portugal, 
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Australia and 
the Czech Republic. Our acquisition of JRC, 
a 19 store pc and video games business 
based in Prague marked our ﬁ rst entry into 
Central Europe.
We had a busy store opening programme, with 
a net 134 stores opened outside the UK which 
included the buy-in of ten franchises. The size 
of our store portfolios, coupled with the GAME 
specialist offer and the capabilities of our local 
management teams, have enabled us to trade 
the GAME brand successfully in every country 
in which we operate. Our international businesses 
continue to perform well and contributed 
£583.3 million to revenue and £20.4 million 
to our overall operating proﬁ t.
Online
We are extremely focused on further developing 
our multi-channel offer. We operate transactional 
eCommerce websites in all the countries in 
which we trade. Over the course of the last two 
years we have invested nearly £12 million into 
our websites and online back ofﬁ ce infrastructure. 
This has given us a credible eCommerce 
offering that generated £106.8 million of 
revenue this year and positions us well to 
continue our growth trend in this area and 
beneﬁ t from future technological advances.

Our specialist proposition
 Regardless of where we trade, our success is founded on delivering our unique specialist 
proposition which puts the customer at the centre of our activities. 
Our specialist proposition is founded on our desire to provide an experience that consistently 
exceeds our customers’ expectations, builds relationships with them, and better understands 
their needs.
This is underpinned by an impressive, purpose-built, infrastructure and support network. 
 Our core attributes include:
We recruit and train employees with a passion for games and 
an aptitude for retail, who are dedicated to giving our customers 
the highest levels of services and advice. With such a broad range 
of products, requiring varying levels of technical know-how, 
we pride ourselves on matching each customer to the most 
relevant purchase.
The market is now in its third generation of hardware, comprising 
three consoles (Sony PS3, Microsoft Xbox360 and the Nintendo Wii) 
and two handhelds (Sony PSP and Nintendo DS). As a leading 
specialist we receive signiﬁ cant quantities of hardware products. 
As well as offering a full complement of console bundles, we offer 
a large range of software and peripherals, including our own 
brand accessories. We use our expertise and customer insight 
to generate unique product offers and deals. We offer customers 
what they want at prices they can afford.
The ability to trade-in and buy preowned games at GAME and 
Gamestation provides a material beneﬁ t for customers, particularly 
in today’s tougher economic climate. Trading-in games is a unique 
way for customers to save money, using their old games as currency 
against new purchases. Preowned games enable us to offer 
a wider range and better value to today’s more price-conscious 
consumer, allowing them to buy products at prices lower than 
our competitors. 
 Over 25,000 new customers are joining our Reward Card scheme 
every week. Both our GAME and Gamestation brands have built 
up signiﬁ cant levels of customer loyalty. The GAME Reward Card 
helps us to communicate with, and reward, up to 12 million 
customers and we intend to launch a similar programme for 
Gamestation. Through the Card our customers get points on 
every purchase, which can be used as discounts against future 
purchases. The transactional data allows us to learn more 
about our customers and their shopping trends, enabling 
us to continually reﬁ ne and target our offers.

 We aim to continually improve our offering 
and stay ahead of our competition by spotting 
trends and opportunities and by evolving 
our offer accordingly. At the same time, we 
constantly evaluate and invest in those aspects 
of our business that give us the greatest returns 
for the future.
Our customer focus is delivered daily by our 
committed employees. We pride ourselves 
on providing a great place to work: we recruit 
strong retailers, give them excellent training 
in customer service and product knowledge 
and they get the opportunity to work in a fun 
environment, in a constantly evolving industry. 
We encourage our employees to seek 
opportunities within the business with the result 
that many of our talented people within both 
stores and head ofﬁ ce have been promoted 
through the ranks.
Summary
The strength of our performance in the 53 weeks 
to 31 January 2009 was entirely attributable 
to our employees and our credentials as a 
specialist retailer – we will continue to nurture 
and develop these. We will also look to grow 
our store portfolio organically with 70 to 80 new 
stores planned for this year, continue to realise 
the beneﬁ ts of the Gamestation acquisition 
and further enhance our business online.
We recognise that the outlook for the wider 
global economy remains uncertain. However, 
we have seen the pc and video games market 
expand to record levels. It is now a key part of 
mass market entertainment. Console ownership 
continues to grow and innovative products 
continue to attract new customers and we are 
conﬁ dent about our prospects going forward.
Lisa Morgan
Chief Executive
 With over 1,340 stores in the Group, we have strong relationships with 
landlords and good access to new stores which is a key component 
of our property strategy. In each of the countries in which we operate, 
we identify the very best store locations for our customers that we 
believe will give us the best returns on our investment. We constantly 
review store performance and manage our estate to maximise 
our customer reach and our proﬁ tability. 
 We aim to have an online offering that matches the quality and 
reputation of our stores. In whichever way the consumer wants 
to shop with us, our product offer, availability and standards 
of service are consistently high.
To provide customers with our range of products and offers, 
it is vital that we maintain long-term and successful relationships 
with all the key hardware and software suppliers. We are 
committed to working in partnership to constantly improve 
our specialist proposition.
 Our distribution centres are dedicated to moving products quickly 
and efﬁ ciently to ﬁ nal destinations, whether that is large volumes to 
our stores or small individual packages direct to customers’ homes 
via online orders. Our state of the art systems and merchandising 
function ensures that we get the correct products in time to every 
destination, which is key to our customers’ needs.

 Our market
Technology
The pc and video games market is now very 
much part of the mainstream entertainment 
sector, competing alongside music and DVDs. 
This evolution has come about as games 
consoles have taken on multi-media 
functionality as well as using the technology 
to appeal to a very broad demographic. 
The global video games market was worth 
nearly $50 billion in 2008, including $19.5 billion 
of hardware sales. Nintendo’s Wii and DS lite 
handheld represented the majority of those 
sales – with 50 per cent market share. 
Microsoft’s Xbox 360 holds 29 per cent share 
and the Sony PS3, PS2 and PSP handheld have 
21 per cent (source IDG). 
The manufacturers have marketed their 
consoles differently to enhance their customer 
appeal. Sony and Microsoft have emphasised 
the processing power, speed of gameplay and 
quality of graphics which allow gamers to 
experience near life-like game play conditions; 
whereas Nintendo has chosen to enhance the 
aspects of inclusivity and simply having fun.
The appetite of the more “core” consumers has 
already seen the industry produce games such 
as Metal Gear Solid 4 and Assassin’s Creed that 
use over 35Gb of memory. With a Blu-ray player 
and dual processors the Sony PS3 has a 
capacity for discs of nearly 50Gb. Inevitably, 
demand will continue for ever bigger and more 
impressive games. The expense of developing 
higher quality games will continue to rise, which 
is anticipated to drive further consolidation 
amongst games developers.
For the more “casual” gamer it has become 
clear that the focus is on ﬁ nding new ways 
to play and involve friends and family. The 
phenomenal success of the Wii Fit balance 
board, which is controlled by a player standing 
or sitting on it, is just one example of this.

continued
In the short to medium-term, games 
manufacturers will continue to create products 
that realise the potential of the current consoles 
and their entertainment possibilities, in order 
to satisfy the demands of the game-playing 
public. As one example of this, on 3 April 2009 
Nintendo launched the Nintendo DSi, a new 
iteration of their handheld product, with 
signiﬁ cant enhancements to the existing 
machine.
Over the longer term, online gameplay and 
digital distribution are expected to be a way in 
which consumers access their entertainment. 
However, with existing domestic broadband 
speeds averaging 2-3Mb/sec in most of the 
territories in which we operate, and not 
generally exceeding speeds of more than 
8MB/sec, games are slow to download. For 
example, a 25Gb PS3 game can take 24 hours 
to download in the UK at average speeds. 
Gamestation integration
Our acquisition of Gamestation was cleared 
by the UK Competition Commission in 
January 2008. We have progressed an 
extensive integration programme while 
maintaining a dual brand strategy in the 
UK to maximise the strengths of each brand 
and reinforce our competitive position.
GAME stores appeal to mass market 
customers and typically occupy prime site 
shopping centres. Gamestation appeals 
more to the core gamer, and stores are 
typically in secondary locations, with a 
smaller footprint and consume less capex.
We have been very pleased with the 
performance of Gamestation, and have 
continued to grow our UK store portfolio 
with a focus on locations that are 
complementary to both brands and 
offer customers the best of both offers.
 For further information, see page 27.
The integration is progressing very well. We are 
driving more value from an integrated back 
ofﬁ ce and in January 2009 announced plans 
to move the majority of teams from the 
Gamestation ofﬁ ce in York to the Group 
ofﬁ ce in Basingstoke, and to streamline 
our UK distribution infrastructure. We are 
on track to complete in August, well ahead 
of the peak Christmas trading period.
We exceeded our target by delivering 
£10 million of synergies in 2008/9. 
These synergy beneﬁ ts will continue to 
come from three core areas:
 Revenue synergies
 Operating expenses 
 Buying synergies 
In 2009/10 we plan to deliver another 
£6 million to give us an annual saving 
of around £16 million.
Achievements 2008-2009
eCommerce sales and operating proﬁ ts rose 
by 85 per cent and 109 per cent respectively. 
Gamestation integration progressing 
in line with expectations with synergies 
of £10 million delivered for FY08/09 and 
a further £6 million expected for FY09/10.
Preowned revenues increased to £353 million 
from £257 million, and preowned gross 
margin increased to 39 per cent.
Current trading is ahead of expectation 
coupled with gross margin improving 
by 150 basis points compared to last year.
For the 11 weeks to 18 April 2009, total 
Group sales were up by 1.0 per cent.

Our performance
The other markets show a strong growth 
proﬁ le but are still some way away from 
reaching maturity.
Around the globe there are a signiﬁ cant 
number of emerging economies with the right 
infrastructure and customer demographic to 
support a successful pc and video games market.
Consumer
The proﬁ le of a standard GAME or Gamestation 
customer can no longer be categorised as 
a particular age, sex or socio-demographic 
group. The pc and games market has been 
opened up to every member of society, with 
games and products to appeal to all tastes. 
Consumers who spend a lot of time playing 
games, particularly classic “ﬁ rst person 
shooters” such as Halo or “RPG” titles such 
as World of Warcraft, tend to be called 
“core” gamers, with mass market gamers 
characterised as more “casual”.
A specialist such as GAME is ideally placed 
to beneﬁ t from such a broad consumer base. 
Appealing to both “core” and “casual” gamers 
with the depth of our product range, our 
knowledge of the products and the unique 
deals we can offer. The information from our 
own Reward Card tells us that our customer 
base has moved from being predominantly 
male and under 35 to a much more even split 
between males and females, and people of all 
ages. In the late 1990s only 12 per cent of GAME 
customers were female, but by 2008 that has 
risen to 36 per cent.
 
With game sizes continually growing and 
most broadband infrastructures still using DSL 
technology limited to 10MB/sec, consumers 
are unlikely to beneﬁ t from faster downloading 
in the near future. 
Geography
The top three markets are North America, Western 
Europe and Japan (source IDG). Japan and 
America are the national homes of the console 
manufacturers. In Europe the largest video 
game market is the UK followed by France, 
Germany, Spain, Italy and Scandinavia.
The UK market is the most mature that we 
operate in, with more consoles sold than there 
are households, when looking at the installed 
base of third generation hardware units plus 
the second generation Playstation 2 (as shown 
in the table above).

Products
In the market place there are ﬁ ve console 
products from the third generation and 
Playstation 2 from the second generation.
So a good specialist video game retailer 
must sell a wide range of hardware, software, 
accessories and preowned products to 
be successful.
Hardware
Games consoles are able to run software 
and feature multi-media capabilities. These 
are manufactured and supplied by Microsoft 
(Xbox360), Sony (PS2, PS3 and the handheld 
PSP), and Nintendo (Wii and handheld DS Lite 
and DSi). 
 Although most of these formats have been in 
the market for some time, their current price 
points suggest that demand remains strong 
for all of the available products. Historically, 
the manufacturers’ strategy has been to lower 
the suggested retail price to stimulate demand 
of a console as it moves through its life cycle. 
Of the third generation consoles, only the 
Xbox 360 has reduced in price in the last 
12 months, suggesting that Sony and Nintendo 
believe there are many more opportunities 
for their consoles with a series of price cuts 
yet to be announced. 
The sale of hardware products is absolutely 
critical to ensure the follow on sales of software 
and peripherals. GAME tends to make 
signiﬁ cantly less margin on hardware than 
on other products.
Software
Video games for all console formats plus 
game software products for pc. Like other 
entertainment products, longstanding brands 
producing multiple sequels are often the 
most successful.
GAME generates signiﬁ cantly higher margins 
on software sales, so we are always looking 
to maximise the number of pieces of software 
we sell compared to hardware.
Last year the Group made 22.3 per cent margin 
on new hardware and software combined.
Accessories
“Casual” games are increasingly reliant 
on accessories to maximise the gameplay – 
including microphones for singing titles, mock 
guitars for music games, steering wheels for 
driving games and add-ons for the Wii such 
as the Wii Fit. In the year to 31 January 2009 
we have seen a real proliferation of accessory 
products, particularly with respect to games 
such as Wii Fit, Mario Kart, Rock Band, Guitar 
Hero and You’re in the Movies. 
Preowned
Console software and hardware that is traded 
in for cash, credit or a discount off another 
purchase. Trading in games is an important 
way for customers to save money, using their 
old games as currency against new purchases. 
Preowned games allow us to offer a broader 
range and great value to today’s more price 
conscious consumers. To run a proﬁ table 
preowned business, it is vital to get the buy price 
and sell price correct, ensuring that stock builds 
are carefully managed. Last year preowned 
sales achieved margins of 39.1 per cent.
Our business
The proﬁ le of the pc and video games market 
suits the qualities of specialist retailers like GAME 
and Gamestation. A very diverse range of 
customers, looking for the best products and 
offers from an array of suppliers, in a cutting-
edge technology sector. GAME is Europe’s 
leading pc and video games specialist and we 
ensure that we put forward a consistent customer 
relationship model wherever we trade:

  Employees – Trained to give the very highest 
level of customer service and information 
on the products we sell.
  Product and range – Offering the broadest 
range of products with unique deals and 
promotions.
  Preowned – Allowing customers to trade-in 
old games for new.
  Loyalty – Rewarding customers for shopping 
with us and using the trading information 
to continually enhance our offer.
To ensure these customer relationship areas 
work to the very highest levels, we insist on 
excellence in our infrastructure and support:
  Property – Having the right locations and 
a compelling shopping environment.
  eCommerce – Providing the same quality 
online as we do in store.
  Business relationships – Working with suppliers 
to get the right offerings for our customers.
  Distribution – Getting product to customers 
as efﬁ ciently as possible.
 Our focus on these areas differentiates us from 
our competitors. With the increasing proﬁ le of 
the pc and video games industry we have seen 
a number of retailers enter the market place, 
from small independents to generalists and the 
supermarkets. Each of these entrants can and 
do provide a competitive threat, but none 
of them combine all of the attributes of the 
specialist (as shown in the table below).
 Sales cycle
The performance of our business can be 
impacted more by technological advance 
than the state of the wider economy. Our 
market is driven by “core” gamers who are 
prepared to spend most of their available 
resources on pc and video games product and 
“casual” gamers who are seemingly switching 
their entertainment spend towards games. 
The entrance of a console to the market will 
drive sales, initially for the new product itself 
and then for the software and attachments 
associated with it. With ﬁ ve third generation 
formats in the market, all having launched 
over the last three years, GAME is beneﬁ ting. 
All of the formats are selling well and their 
price points, a reﬂ ection of the demand for the 
product, are holding up longer than historical 
consoles. Sales of software are expected to 
grow year on year, due to the installed base 
and range of innovative products available.
As a leading specialist pc and video games 
retailer, GAME receives a signiﬁ cant allocation 
of hardware products. Although hardware sells 
through at a relatively low margin, it is vital to 
increase the installed hardware unit base in the 
market to drive subsequent software and 
accessory sales.

Our employees understand the importance 
of hardware sales to our business and to the 
long-term relationship with every customer that 
buys one. We invest in extensive training for our 
store teams to ensure their service skills are 
excellent, and they offer the best advice to 
customers as they open a new relationship 
with GAME or Gamestation. We offer a number 
of tools to support this, including points on 
our Reward Card loyalty scheme representing 
2.5 per cent of the purchase price.
Our marketing campaigns highlight our ability 
to source the widest selection of games with 
attractive bundle deals and offers, and 
combined with the loyalty card discount, to 
make GAME and Gamestation very attractive 
destinations for consumers to buy their 
additional software. 
Our preowned programme gives customers 
the opportunity to trade-in their old games for 
cash or credit. Each of our stores can retain the 
traded in product, refurbish it and put it back 
on sale as preowned. Each trade beneﬁ ts us by: 
  providing a stock of products that we can 
sell at value prices, 
  encouraging consumers who trade-in to 
buy another product from us. 
We sell preowned products at lower prices 
but with the same guarantees as the new 
equivalent. This drives consumer trust in 
our service.
Store proﬁ les
We aim to produce a fairly standard store 
format across our portfolio, with an average 
size of just over 1,000 sq.ft., although this 
varies a little by territory. 
Each store is merchandised to provide an 
extensive range of products across all formats, 
with clear offers and promotions and, most 
importantly, an easy and satisfying shopping 
experience for our customers. We are constantly 
updating our proposition to keep up with the 
latest consumer trends and demands, ensuring 
the customer remains at the heart of everything 
we do.
UK and Ireland
GAME is the leading video games retailer in 
the UK and Ireland. Stores are located in prime 
locations in shopping centres, high streets and 
out-of-town retail parks. We also have concessions 
in Borders, Hamleys, Selfridges, Debenhams, 
Bentalls and Fenwick. Gamestation stores are 
located mostly in secondary locations and 
appeal more to the “core” gamer.

France
GAME is the number two specialist in the French 
market. Other than shopping in specialist stores, 
the French consumer has traditionally favoured 
making pc and video game purchases from 
the large hypermarkets, but our specialist 
proposition is winning market share.
Iberia
GAME is the number one retailer of pc and 
video games product. We have beneﬁ ted from 
the rapid growth of shopping centres and are 
represented in every new retail development 
in the country.
Scandinavia
The Scandinavian market has a strong pc 
presence and consequently we have tailored 
our offer in Sweden, Denmark and Norway 
to meet this demand. 
Australia
We have experienced very strong growth in the 
Australian market since entering the country in 
2006. The maturity proﬁ le of the market clearly 
highlights the opportunities for GAME in the region.
Czech Republic
We entered the Czech market with the 
acquisition of a 19 store chain, JRC, in August 
2008. The Czech market, currently very pc 
oriented, shows good opportunity for growth 
and it will also allow us to learn more about 
other Central European markets.
Operating infrastructure
In each of our markets our store portfolio is 
supported by a local distribution centre and 
head ofﬁ ce. This means that we can respond 
to the particular demands of each of our 
markets quickly.
Business relationships – Our local management 
teams have built up long-term and sustainable 
relationships with their local suppliers of pc 
and video games product. This allows us 
to put the strongest offers and unique deals 
to our consumers.
Distribution – A key feature of the pc and video 
games market is that the customer wants product 
as soon as it is available. Having local distribution 
facilities and experienced allocation teams 
allows us to get the right quantity of product 
to the right places at the right time.
Online retailing, online gaming and 
digital distribution
Ecommerce is becoming an increasingly more 
important part of the GAME operating model. 
We have invested strategically in both the 
customer facing elements and infrastructure 
of our main trading website, game.co.uk. This 
has given us a market leading web proposition 
in the UK, where we compete directly with 
Amazon.co.uk and Play.com. We have 
transactional websites in all of the territories 
in which we operate. 
We have already started to explore and 
develop online gaming and digital distribution 
opportunities. The size of the games, and the 
limited capacity of the broadband infrastructures 
in the countries in which we operate, make 
digital distribution an opportunity for the future. 
We already see the beneﬁ t of online games 
such as World of Warcraft and Counter Strike 
as players often purchase both software and 
time cards from a games retailer before they 
access the online world.
Planning for future growth
We aim to maintain our leading position by 
adhering to the core principles of our Group 
as a specialist retailer, continuing to roll out new 
stores across our markets and enhancing our 
online proposition. We have a proven specialist 
operating model that has generated year on 
year growth and we are conﬁ dent as we look 
towards the future. We do, however, remain very 
aware of the challenging economic conditions 
facing all of our markets.
In the current year we expect the total capital 
expenditure including information technology 
and head ofﬁ ce expenditure for the Group to 
be in the region of £35 million. We will focus 
on territories and activities that give us the 
best return for our investment.
We will continue to keep tight control of 
our operating costs throughout the business. 
Our operating model has always been based 
on efﬁ cient processes and we will actively seek 
out further improvements to the ways we work. 
As part of this process we are now bringing the 
back ofﬁ ce functions of our two UK businesses, 
GAME and Gamestation, into one location in 
Basingstoke. This will contribute towards further 
synergies from our Gamestation purchase, 
of approximately £6 million in the current year.

 Proﬁ t and loss account
Revenue
Total sales increased by 32.2 per cent from 
£1,492 million to £1,972 million and lﬂ  sales 
increased by 8.8 per cent.
Average sales per annum per sq. ft. increased 
by £141 to £1,416.
Gross margin
Overall gross margin was 26.2 per cent 
compared to a prior year margin of 24.8 per 
cent. This increase in gross margin was in line 
with our expectations. It was caused by the 
increased participation of new software and 
preowned product in our sales mix and the 
buying synergies we have been able to 
deliver through the integration of GAME 
and Gamestation.
Operating expenses
Total operating costs have increased by 30.8 
per cent from £237.3 million to £310.3 million, 
excluding Gamestation and non-recurring 
costs, and as a percentage of sales were 
15.7 per cent compared to 15.9 per cent 
last year. On a cash basis our operating 
expenditure has increased year on year 
but this is in line with the increase in volumes 
traded across our business. The decrease 
in operating costs as a percentage of sales 
is a testament to our ability to control our 
expenditure across the operating chain.
Proﬁ t before tax
We achieved a proﬁ t before tax of £119.6 million 
compared to a proﬁ t before tax of £68.4 million 
for last year. 
Taxation
The effective rate of Corporation Tax was 
28.6 per cent (2008: 31.0 per cent) and we have 
continued to provide deferred taxation in line 
with IAS 12. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 24.70p compared 
to 13.79p last year, an increase of 79 per cent. 
Diluted earnings per share were 24.62p compared 
to 13.65p last year, an increase of 80 per cent. 
Preowned
 For further information, see page 34.
Last year, we saw excellent growth with 
total revenues increasing from £257 million 
to £353 million. This is particularly pleasing 
given the signiﬁ cantly better margins 
achieved in this area and its potential 
to drive our overall Group proﬁ tability.
It also provides a material beneﬁ t for our 
customers. Trading in used products gives 
customers a unique way to save money, 
using their old games and consoles as 
currency against new purchases. 
Traded-in products are used to supply 
our preowned range, giving customers 
extended choice and a cheaper alternative, 
especially important for the more price 
conscious consumer.
GAME and Gamestation stores are proud 
to offer preowned products, and we will 
continue to drive customer awareness 
of its beneﬁ ts in every market.
Increased preowned sales across the Group
Preowned is the Group’s value proposition. 
It has been a key component of our 
customer offer and a vital part of our 
business model for over 12 years.

Dividend
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 
3.71p per share, which will give a total dividend 
for the period of 5.50p compared to 4.40p last 
year an increase of 25 per cent. The dividend 
will be paid on 17 July 2009, to shareholders 
on the register at the 29 May 2009.
Balance sheet
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the period, excluding 
acquisitions, amounted to £53 million. 
Approximately half of this expenditure was 
undertaken to open new stores internationally 
and in the UK. Additionally we invested in the 
IT infrastructure, distribution facilities and web 
operations across the Group. In summary:

Stock
Stock at the end of the period represented 
£136,000 per owned store compared to 
£127,000 for the same period last year. The 
increase in the average stock holding per store 
reﬂ ects the fact that we were holding higher 
levels of hardware product to meet ongoing 
consumer demand.
Cash ﬂ ow
Net cash generated by operations was 
£118 million compared to £172 million last year. 
This reﬂ ects a very strong year on year trading 
performance offset by the movements in 
working capital. In particular, our trade creditor 
payments schedule has normalised with 
payments, to the majority of our suppliers for 
December deliveries, made just after the year 
end in both years.
Reporting
In the coming year we will adopt IFRIC 13 on 
Customer Loyalty Programmes. This requires the 
business to recognise an element of revenue 
on accounting for Loyalty Card points, where 
previously we have only recognised the cost 
of those points. This is likely to result in a charge 
to the proﬁ t and loss for 2009/10 of £1 million; 
and a prior year adjustment for the 2008/09 
proﬁ t and loss of £3 million.
When entering into leases in France, businesses 
are required to pay key money (called “Droit 
au bail” in France). The key money is not 
depreciated but the carrying value is assessed 
annually on the basis of a formal property 
market valuation. We have assessed the 
carrying value, based on a representative 
sample of properties, as at 31 January 2009 and 
concluded that there is no material diminution 
in value. The carrying value of the key money 
in our books is approximately £31 million. 
We will continue to review the position in 2009.

Risks and uncertainties
 For further information, link to www.gamegroup.plc.uk/
Competition
The pc and video games market 
has become an increasingly 
attractive proposition for retailers. 
Seasonality
The Group’s business is seasonal 
with the key trading period 
being the Christmas season. 
Technology
As with music and DVD 
entertainment, the opportunity 
exists for pc and video games 
to be distributed digitally via the 
internet. Pc games which tend to 
have smaller ﬁ le sizes are available 
from a number of websites whereas 
with video games digital content is 
offered in a limited way via ofﬁ cial 
format channels, e.g. Microsoft’s 
Xbox Live service.
Reputation
As a specialist retailer our 
customers demand that we 
stock the broadest range 
of product. 
Risk description Potential impact Mitigation activities
We have seen new entrants 
to the market place, including 
specialists, existing generalists 
and supermarkets and online 
players.
Turnover, operating proﬁ t and 
cash ﬂ ow may be adversely 
impacted by variations in 
demand during this period.
As broadband technology 
improves there is a risk that 
more gamers start playing their 
games online. This will reduce 
the number of people buying 
boxed product from retailers 
such as ourselves. 
This means that we deal with 
a variety of video games, 
for example age restricted 
products. Mis-selling such titles 
is illegal.
We believe that the specialist has 
all of the attributes to succeed in 
the pc and video games market 
place. We measure our stores’ 
performance against speciﬁ c 
kpis to ensure our proposition is 
always appealing and relevant 
to consumers.
The Group works closely with 
suppliers to secure stock and 
implement high proﬁ le preorder 
campaigns in advance of all 
major releases. The Group also 
undertakes extensive marketing 
campaigns to drive consumer 
awareness, and ﬂ exes headcount 
in stores to maximise the 
sales potential.
Given the ever increasing size 
of pc and video games (up to 
50Gb), the existing broadband 
infrastructure in all of the 
countries in which we operate 
is not currently sufﬁ cient to allow 
rapid downloads. However, we 
have recognised the increasing 
prominence of eCommerce 
and digital downloading and 
we have invested in state-of-the 
art eCommerce websites.
To mitigate any issues that may 
arise through the mis-selling 
of these games we employ the 
very highest levels of training 
throughout our organisation. 
We conduct due diligence 
exercises in the UK to ensure 
that enforcement training 
is effective and best in class.
Risk review
Global economic conditions
There is a high degree of uncertainty in the global economy, with issues around government and 
bank liquidity, business failures, and rising unemployment rates. We recognise that all of these 
factors may have an impact on our customers’ willingness or ability to spend.
Our trading performance to date suggests that compared to some sectors of retailing we are not 
being as signiﬁ cantly impacted by these wider economic issues. We will continue to put forward 
compelling product offers to meet the more value conscious demands of our consumers.

progress and initiatives to the Board. The 
scorecard serves a number of purposes: 
  It is a method of capturing all the activities 
and initiatives we have going on around 
the business;
  It serves as a reporting tool for our Board 
of Directors;
  It enables us to check that each initiative 
we embark upon has a bone ﬁ de business 
justiﬁ cation; 
  It ensures that we have decided what 
will constitute success in each area; and
  It can be used year on year to measure 
our success.
Our CR committee, under the chairmanship of 
David Thomas, keeps the scorecard up to date 
and drives forward the initiatives. 
We have set out the attributes of our business 
and how they make up our unique specialist 
retail proposition. In the next few pages we 
will outline how we ensure those attributes are 
managed responsibly and how we monitor 
our practices on behalf of our stakeholders. 
We have then picked a number of case studies 
to illustrate GAME corporate responsibility 
in action.
Employees
Our hard-working, knowledgeable, employees 
play a vital role in our specialist retail proposition. 
Equal opportunities
We are committed to treating each employee 
equally and, of course, all our employment 
decisions, policies and practices are made 
without reference to an individual’s gender, 
race, colour, religion, creed, sexual preference 
or national origin. We also ensure the provision 
of equal opportunities for all disabled persons 
who are able to discharge the job duties and 
functions required as part of employment in the 
Group. We do not tolerate any acts of sexual 
or racial discrimination for any reason at any 
level of the organisation.

Health and safety
It is our policy to do all that is reasonably 
practicable to ensure a safe and healthy 
working environment for our employees. We 
provide instructions, training, supervision and 
information to enable employees to perform 
their work safely. We comply with all health and 
safety laws and take all possible steps to ensure 
that everyone in our stores and places of work 
is safe. We monitor and record our health and 
safety performance so that we can continually 
improve upon it.
Rewards and beneﬁ ts
Our employees share in the beneﬁ ts of our 
success and we offer a variety of ﬁ nancial 
rewards across the business. We offer a number 
of awards designed to recognise and reward 
employees for length of service. We operate 
a scheme of sales incentives and management 
bonuses that focus employees on the 
achievement of key objectives. We operate 
a Performance Share Plan to aid retention and 
align the objectives of our senior managers 
with those of our shareholders and we offer 
a tax efﬁ cient sharesave scheme to all our 
permanent employees to allow them to 
share in the success of the business.
Employee communication
Communication is a two way process and so, 
while we keep our employees up to date with 
regular business brieﬁ ngs, internal conferences 
and written communications, we positively 
encourage feedback from our people. We use 
an annual survey to measure our success 
as an employer and we have a Bright Ideas 
scheme which encourages and rewards our 
employees for coming up with ideas that will 
enhance our working environment and 
operating performance.
Career development and training
We recognise the importance of a 
knowledgeable and driven workforce and 
are committed to enhancing the skills of 
our people. We offer both NVQ courses and 
our own bespoke training programmes, for 
instance, our “Xcite” training programme which 
covers core selling and customer service skills. 
This initiative engages regional and store 
managers and store employees across the UK. 
The training is delivered through workshops and 
in-store activity based learning. The programme 
recognises that the knowledge and enthusiasm 
of our employees is one of our greatest assets 
and that their own love of games can bring 
the products to life for the customer. We feel this 
type of training genuinely adds to employee 
job satisfaction and enhances our employees’ 
customer focus which improves the whole 
shopping experience. As an added bonus, 
the training programme won the Silver Industry 
Award for Effective Communications at the 
International Visual Communication Association 
annual awards and won the National Sales 
Training Award of the Year.
To support our staff in understanding the 
qualities of the latest technologies on the 
market, we offer staff discounts on purchases 
and a lending library. This contributes to the 
strong, games’ focussed knowledge that our 
customers experience when discussing 
products with our employees.
“ We recognise the importance 
of a knowledgeable and 
driven workforce.”

Protecting our young customers
We want to be able to provide all our customers 
with the widest product range possible, however, 
at the same time we want to ensure that our 
younger customers only have access to 
appropriate material. We are well aware 
of our responsibilities and refuse to sell any 
products to our younger customers which are 
not age appropriate. We operate a “challenge 
21” policy and will not sell certain products 
without proof of age. This might mean we lose 
sales but we simply cannot afford to jeopardise 
our reputation as a responsible retailer. We also 
work closely with various trade bodies such 
as the Entertainment and Leisure Software 
Publishers Association (ELSPA), the Video 
Standards Council (VSC) and the Entertainment 
Retailers’ Association (ERA) to advise and share 
best practice across the industry. Our internal 
training programmes are vigorous and we want 
employees to feel empowered and supported 
when they are making difﬁ cult decisions to 
withhold sales. We employ mystery shopper 
processes to monitor the success of our training 
and our employee support.
Management of waste
By offering preowned games, giving our 
customers the opportunity to trade-in their old 
games, and by offering a repair service for 
damaged CDs and hardware, we encourage 
our customers to look at alternatives to 
discarding old games and consoles. However, 
our recycling efforts do not stop there. We also 
operate an electrical waste take back system 
for customers to meet WEEE requirements. 
In our Distribution centre we recycled 507 tonnes 
of cardboard in 2008 (2007: 413 tonnes).
In 2008 we began a major drive to encourage 
employees to recycle as much as possible 
and we are pleased to say that now, in our 
Basingstoke head ofﬁ ce, plastics, batteries, 
paper, lamps and cans are all recycled. 
Also in head ofﬁ ce, 24 tonnes of general and 
conﬁ dential paper is recycled per annum whilst 
in our UK stores 40 per cent of the total waste 
produced has been recycled through 
registered carriers. 
Energy management
As we open new stores they are ﬁ tted with the 
latest energy-saving technology, including digital 
inverter air conditioning, energy efﬁ cient lighting 
and single switch control – which minimises 
energy consumption when the store is closed. 
In 2008 we consolidated our electricity suppliers 
for both GAME and Gamestation and reduced 
energy consumption by 10 per cent through 
better awareness and training of store staff 
and design of buildings. 
Communication with our stakeholders
The GAME business is supported by its 
shareholders, its bankers and its lenders. We 
attach great importance to the effectiveness 
of our communications with these stakeholders 
and we aim to provide all the ﬁ nancial and 
strategic information they need on a regular 
basis. We do this through presentations and by 
the publication of information on our website. 
We are proud that our relationships with our 
ﬁ nancial partners go back many years.
Our responsibility to the community
We want to be a positive inﬂ uence within 
the communities in which we operate and, 
throughout 2008, we have donated a number 
of pc and video games to non-proﬁ t making 
bodies and ofﬁ cial charities in sectors 
including, community health and welfare 
and the environment.

  Case study: Making a difference 
in Stourbridge
As part of GAME’s support for charity partner, 
Action for Children, a team of GAME staff from 
across the UK took part in a ‘Challenge’ event 
at the charity’s Children and Family Centre 
in Stourbridge. Volunteers redecorated rooms, 
planted a garden and generally transformed 
a rundown bungalow into a multi purpose 
building that now offers recreational, 
counselling, training and IT facilities. 
The newly decorated Centre will primarily 
be used by young carers, young people under 
the age of 18 who are responsible for a parent, 
brother or sister, with a physical or mental illness 
or disability. These young people take on 
caring responsibilities that are inappropriate for 
their age, meaning they have very little time to 
enjoy themselves as children. Harry Potter star 
Matthew Lewis, who plays Neville Longbottom 
in the popular ﬁ lms and is an Ambassador for 
Action for Children, came along to support the 
challenge and to help distribute a range of 
games, consoles and software donated by 
GAME to a group of delighted young carers. 
The GAME employees involved in the challenge 
were very moved by the experience and 
expressed their admiration for the young carers 
they met, who cope so amazingly well in such 
difﬁ cult situations and for the project workers 
who provide such fantastic support.
 Case study: Reduction in electricity use 
at our Manchester Denton store 
The use of automated half hourly electricity 
meters has given us better information on 
electricity usage. A study of the energy usage 
data produced by the meters clearly showed 
that the reduction in electricity use overnight 
compared to daytime use was limited. The 
study of the data at head ofﬁ ce led to better 
education for the store staff who now realise 
the importance of switching off all equipment 
not in use, especially at night.
Understanding the energy usage at all our 
stores has enabled our store design teams 
to reduce costs by improving equipment 
speciﬁ cation and installing controls to ensure 
energy is not wasted. For example, the use 
of a last man switch to turn off power on leaving 
the building, energy efﬁ cient equipment, toilet 
lights and fans on timed sensors all help to 
save energy and costs.

  Case study: Action for Children Week
Throughout 2007 and 2008 GAME has been 
supporting Action for Children, one of the UK’s 
leading children’s charities, which works in 
partnership to run nearly 500 services for over 
178,000 of the UK’s most vulnerable children, 
young people and their families. Action for 
Children was previously known as National 
Children’s Home. It re-branded in 2008 to 
become Action for Children.
During February 2009, employees in GAME 
stores across the UK and in the Basingstoke 
ofﬁ ce took part in a wide variety of fundraising 
events and activities from parachute jumps to 
sponsored head shaves and 5-a-Side Football 
Matches to Cycle Challenges. In addition, 
GAME made a donation for every product 
sold within a designated range of titles during 
half term. As a result of these widespread 
fundraising activities we were able to achieve 
our challenging fundraising target of £250,000. 
The money raised will be used to support Young 
Carer projects throughout the country helping 
Action for Children deliver much needed support 
to this most vulnerable group of young people.
  Case study: GAME “Challenge 21”
 In 2008 the Group upgraded all training and 
support facilities for enforcing video games age 
ratings. New training packs featuring role play 
exercises, work books and a realistic training 
ﬁ lm were developed with the Video Standards 
Council (VSC) and independent legal experts. 
The exclusive packs are now used in all 700 UK 
stores to give teams the best support when faced 
with the difﬁ cult task of asking customers about 
their age, and offering advice on alternative 
products or declining sales if appropriate.
The “Challenge 21” principle for selling 18 rated 
games was also introduced in all stores, and 
we have partnered with ofﬁ cial Citizencard 
programme to offer customers a card for half 
price. Feedback from the stores was excellent. 
Employees cited the training video as one of 
the most useful tools in helping them deal with 
the reality of enforcing age ratings. It outlined 
how employees can face criticism or abuse 
when asking customers to prove their age, and 
the ﬁ rst hand account of an employee who was 
formally interviewed by Trading Standards ofﬁ cers 
after an age rated game was sold to a minor.
Thankfully such incidents are rare, because 
the Group takes its responsibilities very seriously, 
and provides every employee with all the 
tools and support they need to sell age rated 
games effectively.

Corporate governance 
statement
 The Board notes that the Chairman has been 
a Director for more than nine years but considers 
that Peter Lewis makes a signiﬁ cant contribution 
to the Company and that his period of 
ofﬁ ce does not impair his independence. 
In accordance with Code provision A.7.2, 
Peter Lewis will stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for good governance and the 
statements set out below describe how the 
principles identiﬁ ed in the Combined Code 
are applied by the Group.
Directors
The Board consists of a Non Executive Chairman, 
Peter Lewis, four other Non Executive Directors 
and three Executive Directors, of which Lisa Morgan 
is Group Chief Executive. All of the Non Executive 
Directors are considered by the Board to be 
independent of management and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
There is a clear division of responsibility between 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
Biographies of Board members appear on 
page 57. These indicate the seniority and range 
of business experience, which are essential to 
manage effectively a business of the size and 
complexity of the Group.
The full Board meets at least six times each year 
and more frequently where business needs 
require. The Board has a schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision, including inter alia 
statutory matters; approval of ﬁ nancial statements 
and dividends; appointments and terminations 
of Directors, ofﬁ cers and auditors; appointments 
of committees and setting of terms of reference; 
review and approval of Group performance 
against budgets; approving risk management 
strategy and material contracts; and determining 
of authority levels within which management 
is required to operate.
 There is a commitment to high 
standards of corporate governance 
throughout the Group. The Board 
conﬁ rms that the Company and the 
Group have complied during the 
year ended 31 January 2009 with 
the principles set out in Section 1 
of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued in July 2003, as 
revised in June 2006 (the ‘Combined 
Code’), except where detailed.
As Company Secretary I am responsible 
for advising the Board on corporate 
governance and ensuring that Board 
committees operate effectively. It is part 
of my role to alert the Board to any 
developments in the external corporate 
governance regime. Each Board agenda 
has a corporate governance slot and 
I use this to present to the Board, and 
to facilitate debate, on corporate 
governance issues.

Corporate governance statement
continued
There is an agreed procedure for Directors 
to take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense. This is in addition 
to the access which every Director has to the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary 
is charged by the Board with ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed. The minutes of 
all meetings of the Board and each committee 
are taken by the Company Secretary who 
ensures that any unresolved concerns of the 
Directors are recorded in the minutes.
Appropriate Directors’ and Ofﬁ cers’ insurance 
cover is arranged and maintained via the 
Company’s insurance broker, Aon Group, 
and its terms are reviewed annually.
When new members are appointed to the 
Board, they are provided with advice from 
the Company Secretary in respect of their role 
and duties as a public company director. 
Christopher Bell is the Senior Non Executive 
Director. Concerns relating to the executive 
management of the Company or the 
performance of the other Non Executive 
Directors may be raised with the Senior Non 
Executive Director. The Senior Non Executive 
Director is also available to shareholders if they 
have concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive 
or Finance Director have failed to resolve or for 
which such contact is inappropriate. The Senior 
Non Executive Director also makes himself 
available to listen to the concerns of employees.
To enable the Board to function effectively and 
the Directors to discharge their responsibilities, 
full and timely access is given to all relevant 
information. In the case of Board meetings, 
this consists of a comprehensive set of papers, 
including regular business progress reports and 
discussion documents regarding speciﬁ c matters.

governance regime. For instance, the 2006 
Companies Act was in the process of being 
implemented and directors’ duties had 
been codiﬁ ed. There had also been 
changes to the directors’ conﬂ icts of interest 
regime. The Company Secretary’s ﬁ rst step 
was to put together an induction pack of 
all the Board’s governance documents 
and all the recent Board papers that dealt 
with corporate governance topics. She 
then arranged for a training session with 
our corporate lawyers, Clifford Chance. 
At the same time I followed an in depth 
business induction, visiting stores and 
meeting all levels of employees. I now 
feel conﬁ dent that I not only know the 
business through and through, but I am 
also fully aware of my accountabilities 
to our shareholders.

Appointments to the Board
The Board ensures that plans are in place for 
the orderly succession of appointments to the 
Board and to senior management; taking into 
account the need to maintain an appropriate 
balance of skills. Appointments to the Board of 
both Executive and Non Executive Directors are 
considered by the Nomination Committee. The 
recommendations of the Nomination Committee 
are ultimately made to the full Board, which 
considers them before any appointment is 
made. The Remuneration Committee considers 
any remuneration package before it is offered 
to a potential appointee. The members of 
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees are set out on pages 61 to 62.
Any Director appointed during the year is 
required, under the provisions of the Company’s 
Articles of Association, to retire and seek 
election by shareholders at the next Annual 
General Meeting. The Articles also require 
that one-third of the Directors retire by rotation 
each year and seek re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting. The Directors required to retire 
are those in ofﬁ ce longest since their previous 
re-election, and each Director retires at least 
once every three years.
Full details of Directors’ remuneration and 
a statement of the Company’s remuneration 
policy are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report appearing on pages 70 to 77. The 
members of the Remuneration Committee 
and the principal terms of reference of the 
Committee appear on page 62.
Meetings with Non Executive Directors
The Chairman holds meetings as required 
with the Non Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present.
Board performance evaluation
In accordance with the requirements of the 
Combined Code, during the year the Board 
undertook a formal internal evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its committees 
and individual Directors. This review was led by 
the Senior Non Executive Director and included 
an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance. 
A further review will be conducted during the 
current ﬁ nancial year.
Individual attendance by Directors at meetings of the Board and of other committees
 Meetings held from 29 April 2008 to 22 April 2009.

Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises Ishbel 
Macpherson as Chairman, together with 
Christopher Bell, Jean-Paul Giraud and 
Dennis Woodside.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
are available on request and are published 
on the Company’s website.
The Audit Committee’s main objectives are, inter 
alia, to monitor the integrity of the Company’s 
ﬁ nancial statements and any other formal 
announcements relating to the Company’s 
ﬁ nancial performance; review signiﬁ cant 
ﬁ nancial reporting judgements contained 
in such statements or announcements, before 
submission to, and approval by, the Board, 
and before clearance by the external auditors; 
review the Company’s internal ﬁ nancial 
controls and risk management systems; monitor 
and review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit function; and review the 
arrangements by which employees of the 
Company may, in conﬁ dence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of 
ﬁ nancial reporting or other matters.
The Committee also reviews any matters raised 
by the auditors. The Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director are invited to attend part 
of each meeting of this Committee, as are the 
auditors. The auditors have unrestricted access 
to the members of the Audit Committee, and 
the Committee ensures that meetings are 
used as an open avenue of communication 
between the external auditors and the Board.
Following a recommendation from the Audit 
Committee, the Board has adopted a policy 
in relation to the provision of non-audit services 
by the auditors, with the objective of ensuring 
that the provision of such services does not 
impair the external auditor’s independence 
or objectivity. This includes, inter alia, assessing 
all relationships with the audit ﬁ rm, including 
their partners and staff; assessing the nature 
and level of fees for non-audit services in 
relation to the audit fee; obtaining conﬁ rmation 
of independence from the auditors; and 
ensuring the appropriateness of the ﬁ rm 
as providers for non-audit services.
The split between audit and non-audit fees 
for the year under review is disclosed in note 
4 to the ﬁ nancial statements. The non-audit 
fees were principally paid in respect of tax 
compliance services and are considered 
by the Audit Committee not to affect the 
auditors’ independence or objectivity.
As Chair of the Audit Committee I see my 
role as a “critical friend” to the Executive 
team, both challenging and supporting 
them in their ﬁ nancial management 
of the business. In addition to monitoring 
the integrity of ﬁ nancial statements and 
announcements, the Committee also 
assesses the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management strategies, whistle-blowing 
policy and internal and external audit 
processes – reporting its ﬁ ndings up to 
the Board.

Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
Jean-Paul Giraud as Chairman, together 
with Christopher Bell, Ishbel Macpherson and 
Dennis Woodside. The work of the Remuneration 
Committee is covered further in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 70 to 77.
Copies of Executive Directors’ service contracts 
and the terms and conditions of appointment 
of the Non Executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s ofﬁ ce during 
normal business hours.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee are available on request and are 
also published on the Company’s website.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Peter 
Lewis as Chairman, together with Christopher 
Bell, Jean-Paul Giraud, Ishbel Macpherson 
and Dennis Woodside.
It meets as required and makes 
recommendations to the Board on all Board 
and Committee appointments, including the 
selection of Non Executive Directors. The terms 
of reference of the Nomination Committee are 
available on request and are also published 
on the Company’s website.
Audit and internal control
The respective responsibilities of the Directors 
and the auditors in connection with the Annual 
Report and Accounts are explained on pages 
67 and 78 respectively and the statement 
of the Directors on going concern appears 
on page 63.
Following the publication of guidance for 
Directors, Internal Control: Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code, the Board 
conﬁ rms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing any 
signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group. This process 
has been in place during the 53 weeks ended 
31 January 2009 and up to the date of approval 
of the accompanying Report and Accounts 
by the Board. The process is regularly reviewed 
by the Board and accords with the Turnbull 
Guidance on Internal Control.
The Board of Directors acknowledges its 
responsibility for the Company’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness 
over ﬁ nancial, operating and risk management 
controls. The system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable (but not absolute) 
assurance against material misstatements 
or loss.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control during the year by 
reference to budgets, management accounts, 
cashﬂ ow projections and reports from the 
internal and external auditors, and covers 
ﬁ nancial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems.
It is essential that the Board is able to 
demonstrate a clear and sensible strategy 
for the remuneration of its Executive Directors 
and the Committee must weigh external 
market forces against the needs and 
resources of the business. The structure 
of the reward package is as important 
as the amount. Incentive targets need 
to be constructed to ensure that the 
achievements, for which the Executive 
Directors are rewarded, are aligned to the 
needs of the business and the shareholders.

Directors and Governance
Corporate governance statement
continued
The risks facing the Group in each country 
of operation have been identiﬁ ed and the 
appropriateness of the associated direct 
controls and indirect controls have been 
assessed. This risk matrix is reviewed and 
updated on a regular basis.
The key procedures that the Directors have 
established to ensure that internal controls 
are effective are commensurate with a group 
of this size, a key control procedure being the 
day-to-day supervision of the business by the 
Directors. Other internal control procedures and 
reviews for effectiveness by the Board include 
the following:
  preparation, maintenance and review of 
a Group risk register;
  review of ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance reports from management; and
  review of any signiﬁ cant issues arising from 
the internal and external audits.
The Group has an internal audit function which 
focuses primarily on the control of cash and 
stock losses. The Audit Committee consider 
the focus of the function to be appropriate 
for the business and operations of the Group.
The Audit Committee keeps the scope and 
cost-effectiveness of the external audit under 
review. The independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors is also considered on 
a regular basis, with particular regard to the 
level of non-audit fees. The split between audit 
and non-audit fees for the year under review 
appears in note 4. The non-audit fees were 
principally paid in respect of tax compliance 
services and are considered by the Committee 
not to affect the auditors’ independence 
or objectivity.
Communication with shareholders
The Company attaches importance to 
the effectiveness of its communications with 
shareholders. It publishes regular trading 
statements as well as a full Annual Report. 
The Company maintains a regular dialogue 
with institutional shareholders and the ﬁ nancial 
community. This includes presentations of 
the preliminary and interim results, regular 
meetings with major shareholders, participation 
in stockbrokers’ seminars and site visits. 
The Group holds a variety of investor and 
analyst meetings in order to improve the 
ﬁ nancial community’s understanding of the 
Group and to introduce investors to a broader 
range of management. All shareholders can 
gain access to these and other presentations, 
as well as to the Annual Report and other 
information about the Group, on the Group’s 
website at www.gamegroup.plc.uk. Holders 
of ordinary shares may attend the Company’s 
AGM at which the Company highlights key 
business developments during the year and 
at which shareholders have an opportunity 
to ask questions. The chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
are available to answer any questions from 
shareholders on the work of their committees.
The Company conﬁ rms that it sends the AGM 
notice and relevant documentation to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
date of the AGM. Responsibility for maintaining 
regular communications with shareholders rests 
with the executive management team led by the 
Chief Executive. However, the Board is informed 
on a regular basis of key shareholder issues, 
including share price performance, the 
composition of the shareholder register and 
City expectations. Independent research 
is commissioned annually into institutional 
shareholder perceptions of the Group. The 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and 
the Non Executive Directors make themselves 
available to meet with shareholders as required.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Group and of the Company 
and have concluded that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the Directors continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the ﬁ nancial statements.

dividend of 1.79p (2008: 1.43p) per share, gives a total dividend of 5.50p (2008: 4.40p) per share for the 53 weeks 
ended 31 January 2009.

Directors and Governance
Corporate governance
The Company’s compliance with corporate governance is disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement 
on pages 58 to 63, and this is incorporated into the Directors’ Report by reference.
Conﬂ icts of interest
From 1 October 2008, there has been a requirement that Directors must avoid a situation where they have, 
or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conﬂ icts, or possibly may conﬂ ict, with the Company’s interests. 
Directors of public companies may authorise conﬂ icts and potential conﬂ icts, where appropriate, if a company’s 
articles of association permit and shareholders have approved appropriate amendments. At the Company’s 
AGM in 2008, the shareholders gave this approval.
Procedures have been put in place for the disclosure by Directors of any such conﬂ icts and also for the 
consideration and authorisation of these conﬂ icts by the Board. These procedures allow for the imposition of 
limits or conditions by the Board when authorising any conﬂ ict, if they think this is appropriate. These procedures 
were duly followed to approve appropriate conﬂ icts following the enactment of the conﬂ ict provisions in 
October 2008, and are now included as a regular standing item for consideration by the Board at its meetings.
Charitable and political donations
The Group made charitable donations of over £30,000 to a number of charities including the children’s charity 
Action for Children and Asthma UK. The Group does not make donations to any political party.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy for the 53 weeks to 31 January 2009, for all suppliers, was to agree terms of payment when 
establishing the terms of each business transaction and to abide by the agreed terms of payment. The Group had 
an average 37 days’ purchases included in trade creditors at the year end. The Company had no trade creditors.
Financial instruments
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency 
risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. Further details on 
the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments can be found in the Statement of Accounting Policies and notes 16 and 17 
to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Corporate Responsibility
The Group recognises that to remain successful over the longer term the business must take an open, honest 
and responsible approach towards all of its key stakeholders – employees, customers, investors and the wider 
community. The full report is set out on pages 48 to 53.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are detailed on page 47.
Share capital
Details of changes in share capital during the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2009 are set out in note 20 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
As at 31 January 2009, the Company had an unexpired authority to repurchase shares up to a maximum 
of 33,986,814 shares. During the year 500,000 ordinary shares were purchased in the market for cancellation.

Rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares
This section summarises certain provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association relating to the ordinary 
shares of the Company, and forms part of the Directors’ Report.
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share which is divided into ordinary shares of 5p each.
Voting
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, each share (other than those held in treasury) entitles 
the holder to one vote, at general meetings of the Company on votes taken on a poll. On a show of hands 
at a meeting, every member present (not being present by proxy) and entitled to vote has one vote and every 
proxy present who has been duly appointed by a member entitled to vote on the resolution has one vote. 
No member is entitled in respect of a share held by him to be present or to vote, either in person or by proxy, 
at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of class of shares or on a poll, or to exercise other 
rights conferred by membership in relation to the meeting or poll, if a call or other amount due and payable 
in respect of the share is unpaid.
Transfers
The Board may refuse to register a transfer of shares in certain circumstances.
Dividends
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend 
to be paid to the members according to their respective rights and interests, but no dividend may exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. The Directors may also declare and pay interim dividends if they consider 
that the ﬁ nancial position of the Company justiﬁ es it. Subject to shareholder approval, the Directors may pay 
dividends by issuing shares credited as fully paid up in lieu of cash dividends. No dividend carries a right to 
interest from the Company unless speciﬁ ed by the rights attaching to the share. If dividends remain unclaimed 
for 12 years they are forfeited and revert to the Company.
Variation of rights
The rights attached to shares can only be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75 per cent 
of the nominal amount of the issued shares of that class (excluding any share of that class held as treasury 
shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued 
shares of that class in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Partly paid shares
The Company has a ﬁ rst and paramount lien on all partly paid shares for an amount payable in respect of the 
share, whether the due date for payment has arrived or not. The lien applies to all dividends from time to time 
declared or other amounts payable in respect of such shares.
Sanctions
Unless the Board decide otherwise, if a shareholder is given a notice that he has failed to provide information 
required in relation to any shares pursuant to a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006, that member 
will be unable to vote those shares both in general meeting and at a meeting of shareholders of that class. 
If such shareholder holds more than 0.25 per cent or more of the issued shares of a class (excluding treasury 
shares) and is in default of a section 793 notice, the Directors may also state in the notice that: (i) the payment 
of any dividend shall be withheld; and (ii) that there can be no transfer of the shares held by such shareholder.

Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the Group, for safeguarding the assets of the Company, for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ 
Report and Directors’ Remuneration Report which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. The Directors are also required to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for the Group 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The Directors have chosen to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for the Company 
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.

Group ﬁ nancial statements
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁ nancial statements present fairly for each ﬁ nancial year the 
Group’s ﬁ nancial position, ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows. This requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the deﬁ nitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework 
for the preparation and presentation of ﬁ nancial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
•  consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; and
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁ c requirements in IFRSs is insufﬁ cient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
ﬁ nancial position and ﬁ nancial performance. 
Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year which give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing these ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business; 
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

Directors and Governance
Treasury risk management
Group treasury matters are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors. 
The treasury group monitors and reviews treasury matters on a regular basis. A written summary of major 
treasury activity is presented to each Board meeting. The Group’s treasury policies are set out in the Statement 
of Accounting Policies.
Disclosure of information to auditors
So far as each Director at the date of approval of this Report is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have 
taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware 
of that information.
Directors’ indemniﬁ cation provisions
The Directors have the beneﬁ t of ‘qualifying third-party indemnity provisions’ for the purposes of sections 232 
and 234 of the Companies Act 2006 pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association. A copy of the Articles of 
Association is available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce. The indemnity provisions in the Articles 
of Association were amended at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 3 July 2008 to take 
advantage of changes in legislation allowing companies to grant wider indemnities than previously permitted.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint BDO Stoy Hayward LLP as auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.

 Statement of compliance
As well as complying with the provisions of the Combined Code as disclosed in the corporate governance 
statement and with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has applied the principles relating 
to Directors’ remuneration as described below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Jean-Paul Giraud as Chairman, together with Christopher Bell, 
Ishbel Macpherson and Dennis Woodside. 
The Board has overall responsibility for Directors’ remuneration, but has delegated this responsibility to the 
Committee. The Committee is responsible for all aspects of remuneration for the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors and for determining the policy of the remuneration of the Directors of the principal operating 
subsidiaries. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee’s policy, for current and future years, is to remunerate the Group’s Chairman, Executive Directors 
and management fairly in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably 
qualiﬁ ed personnel. The measurement of their performance and the determination of the annual remuneration 
package of the Executive Directors are undertaken by the Remuneration Committee who utilise the services 
of external professional advisers to assist them in this area, and also take into account the annual remuneration 
packages of executives within the Company’s peer group. The main elements of the remuneration package 
are basic salary, beneﬁ ts, performance related bonus, pension contributions and share based long-term incentives. 
Part of this policy is to ensure that a signiﬁ cant proportion of overall remuneration is performance related.
The Remuneration Committee may seek external advice generally and may also call on specialist advice on 
areas such as pensions. During the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2009, the Committee did not choose to take any 
external advice but Lisa Morgan, David Thomas and the Company Secretary have presented to the Committee 
on speciﬁ c issues.
Base salaries
The Remuneration Committee aims to pay competitive salaries having regard to market practice, internal 
relativities, performance and affordability. No salary increases have been awarded to the Executive Directors 
for the ﬁ nancial year commencing 1 February 2009.
The remuneration of the Non Executive Directors is determined by the Board. No Director plays a part in any 
decision about his or her own remuneration. 
Each element of remuneration payable to Executive Directors is discussed in more detail below.
Basic salary and beneﬁ ts
Basic salaries for all Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee. In addition to basic salary, 
each Executive Director is entitled to the following main beneﬁ ts:
•  25 days holiday per annum;
•  fully expensed company car or cash equivalent;
•  critical illness cover and permanent health insurance; 
•  health cover for themselves, their spouse and minor children; and
•  life assurance cover equal to four times basic salary.

Directors and Governance
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to accept outside appointments, but no 
such appointments have yet been authorised. Salaries for senior management below main Board level are 
benchmarked against appropriate market comparisons.
Performance related bonus
As referred to above, part of the Remuneration Committee’s policy on remuneration is to ensure that a 
signiﬁ cant proportion of overall remuneration is performance related. To the year ended 31 January 2009, 
the executive bonus scheme bonus scheme had the following principal features:
•  the potential bonus opportunity for Executive Directors was restricted to 125 per cent of base salary;
•  64 per cent of the bonus opportunity was determined by reference to stretching proﬁ t targets, with the other 
36 per cent being determined by reference to clear objectives set for each Executive Director; and
•  to further align the interests of Executive Directors further with those of shareholders, only the ﬁ rst half of the 
maximum bonus potential will be paid in cash (i.e. a maximum of 62.5 per cent) with any excess to be 
deferred into contingent shares for three years. During this period, the executive will not be entitled to receive 
dividends on those shares and they will be subject to forfeiture if the executive voluntarily resigns or is 
dismissed. There are, however, no further performance targets attached to the award.
The bonus opportunity for subsidiary company directors does not exceed that of the Executive Directors and 
may be subject to similar deferral arrangements.
Bonus entitlements in respect of the year ended 31 January 2009 were as follows: 
     Total

Terry Scicluna*  25,000 – 25,000 –
*Terry Scicluna was appointed to the Board on 13 January 2009.
The principal features of the bonus scheme will remain in place for the present ﬁ nancial year and 64 per cent 
of the bonus opportunity will continue to be determined by reference to stretching proﬁ t targets, with the other 
36 per cent being determined by reference to clear objectives set for each Executive Director. To align the 
interests of the Executive Directors to those of shareholders, only the ﬁ rst half of the maximum bonus potential 
will be paid in cash (ie a maximum of 62.5 per cent) with any excess to be deferred into contingent shares for 
three years. During this period, the executive will not be entitled to receive dividends on those shares and they 
will be subject to forfeiture if the executive voluntarily resigns or is dismissed. There are, however, no further 
performance targets attached to the award.
Directors’ pension policy
The Executive Directors are entitled to receive company contributions to their deﬁ ned contribution pension 
schemes at a prescribed percentage rate of basic salary, which in 2009 is 20 per cent of basic salary.

Long-term incentives
The Committee believes that share ownership by Executive Directors strengthens the link between their personal 
interests and those of shareholders. 
The Performance Share Plan was introduced in 2004 to replace the 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme 
(“the 1998 scheme”). Following the introduction of the Performance Share Plan, no further grants of options 
to the Executive Directors were made under the 1998 Scheme.
The following disclosures (up to and including page 75) on Directors’ remuneration have been audited, 
as required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
Performance Share Plan
Under the Plan, eligible employees may receive a conditional award of shares, which will normally be released 
after three years subject to continued employment and the achievement of challenging performance 
conditions, based on earnings per share. This measurement was chosen as representing the most appropriate 
basis as earnings per share growth should lead to an improvement in share price for the beneﬁ t of all 
shareholders. The Executive Directors have Awards under the Plan as follows:

* The Board of Directors granted extensions to the life of these awards beyond the expiry dates owing to company 
close periods and in line with the rules of the plan. There has been no change in the fair value of these awards 
as a result of these changes.
The exercise price for the above awards is £1 for the entire amount of the ordinary shares to which an Award 
relates. The Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary after the grant subject to continued employment 
and the meeting of an earnings per share performance condition. The targets range from EPS growth at the 
rate of RPI + 15 per cent over a ﬁ xed 3 year period (at which 25 per cent of any Award will vest) increasing on 
a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of at least RPI + 30 per cent. No consideration was paid for the 
grant of any of the above Awards. The Awards are not subject to retesting and expire six months after the earliest 
exercise date. 
Any ordinary shares required to fulﬁ l entitlements under the Performance Share Plan are provided by the 
Employee Beneﬁ t Trust. As at 31 January 2009, the Employee Beneﬁ t Trust held 3,129,834 ordinary shares 
(2008: 2,844,094 ordinary shares).

During the year, the Group modiﬁ ed the process for the exercise of unapproved share options which means 
the employees now have a choice of settlement. The employee is now able to settle their options by receiving 
shares or cash. There has been no change in the fair value of these awards as a result of these changes.
As at 5 April 2009, there are outstanding options under the 1998 Scheme to subscribe for 1,250,792 ordinary 
shares pursuant to employees’ share schemes, which represent 0.36 per cent of the issued share capital. If the 
authority to purchase ordinary shares were used in full, the options would represent 0.40 per cent of the issued 
share capital.

Executive Director shareholding requirements
The Remuneration Committee has conﬁ rmed to the Executive Directors that in order to further align their interests 
with those of the shareholders, it is desirable for them to hold shares to the value of at least 100 per cent of 
salary. This shareholding should be achieved over a three year period. The deferred share element of Executive 
Directors’ bonuses, which are held in trust, are taken into account when calculating the value of the shares the 
Executive Directors hold.

The GAME Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 
2008-2009
We have audited the Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements (the “ﬁ nancial statements”) of The 
GAME Group plc for the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Recognised Income and Expense and the related Group notes, the Parent Company Balance Sheet and 
the related Parent Company notes. These ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
and for preparing the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements and Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on

We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether, in addition, the Group ﬁ nancial statements

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. 
It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the

then ended;
•  the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;

Annual Report and Accounts

Statement of Accounting Policies
 Basis of preparation
The accounting reference date of The GAME Group plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings (the “Group”) 
is 31 January. The comparative year’s results are for the 52 week period ended 26 January 2008. The current 
year’s results are for the 53 week period ended 31 January 2009. 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the results of the Group made up to 31 January 2009. 
The Group has used the acquisition method of accounting to consolidate the results of subsidiary undertakings. 
The results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition.
The Group consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and those IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective 
and endorsed by the European Union as at the time of preparing these ﬁ nancial statements. 
Estimates and judgements
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the ﬁ nancial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Signiﬁ cant items subject to such assumptions and estimates include the useful lives of assets, the measurement 
and recognition of provisions, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for potential corporation tax. 
The most critical accounting policies in determining the ﬁ nancial condition and results of the Group are those 
requiring the greatest degree of subjective or complex judgements. These relate to inventory valuation; lease 
costs; the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; share-based payments and taxation. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Adoption of new and revised standards
The Directors have chosen to early adopt IFRS 3 “Business Combinations amendment” which is effective for 
ﬁ nancial statements commencing after 1 July 2009 although this interpretation is not yet endorsed by the EU. 
The impact of the adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on the results, cash ﬂ ows or ﬁ nancial 
position of the Group or the Company.
Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted
The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
have issued the following standards and interpretations to be applied to ﬁ nancial statements with periods 
commencing on or after the following dates:
213541_GAME_REPORT_P80-128_n.indd   84 213541_GAME_REPORT_P80-128_n.indd   84 26/5/09   10:51:53 26/5/09   10:51:53 85

*These standards and interpretations are not endorsed by the EU at present. 
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material 
impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRIC 13 “Customer Loyalty Programmes” is effective for ﬁ nancial statements commencing after 1 July 2008. In 
the coming year we will adopt IFRIC 13 on Customer Loyalty Programmes. This requires the business to recognise 
an element of revenue on accounting for Loyalty Card points, where previously we have only recognised the 
cost of those points. This is likely to result in a charge to the proﬁ t and loss for 2009/10 of £1 million; and a prior 
year adjustment for the 2008/09 proﬁ t and loss of £3 million.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁ nancial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain the beneﬁ ts from its activities.
The results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting 
policies into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. A list of the 
principal subsidiaries is included in note 15 to the Company Financial Statements.

Statement of Accounting Policies continued
Revenue
Revenue comprises the value of sales (excluding VAT and similar taxes, trade discounts and intra-group 
transactions) of goods and services provided in the normal course of business. Revenue is recognised at the 
point of sale, for high street retailing, to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁ ts will ﬂ ow to the 
Group. Online revenue is recognised when the goods are despatched.
Non-recurring costs
The Group presents as “Non-recurring costs” on the face of the income statement those costs which, because 
of the nature and expected infrequency of events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to better understand the ﬁ nancial performance in the year. The Group’s policy is to expense 
these costs in the period in which they were incurred.
Non-recurring costs include the costs of integrating a new business.
Reward Card scheme 
The Group operates a Reward Card programme which allows members to accumulate points on purchases, 
get exclusive offers and other special beneﬁ ts. The estimated direct incremental cost of providing free goods in 
exchange for redemption of points earned by members is accrued as members earn points from the purchase 
of goods. These costs are charged to selling costs. The value of points issued is deferred and recognised as 
revenue on redemption of the points by the customer. The incremental cost of providing free goods is 
recognised when the points are redeemed.
The accrued cost is based on various estimates with respect to the costs incurred in providing such schemes. 
Additional assumptions are made, based on general customer behaviour, regarding the likelihood of a 
customer redeeming the points. 
Gift vouchers
Revenue from gift vouchers and gift cards sold by the Group is recognised on the redemption of the gift voucher 
or gift card. Monies received are shown as deferred revenue prior to redemption.
Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of the Group is pounds sterling.
Foreign currency transactions of individual companies are translated at the exchange rates ruling when 
they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance 
sheet dates. 
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year and their 
balance sheets translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets of foreign subsidiary undertakings 
and from translating the proﬁ t and loss account at an average rate are taken to reserves.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange 
reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the income statement as part 
of the proﬁ t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and fair value adjustments are treated as assets/
liabilities of the foreign operation and are expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments are translated at the closing rate in the same manner as any other assets 
and liabilities. The Group has taken advantage of the provisions under IFRS 1 to avoid applying this to 
acquisitions made before the transition date (1 February 2004).

Interest
Interest payable is charged to the income statement as incurred, except where the borrowing ﬁ nances property, 
plant and equipment in the course of construction. Such interest is capitalised until the asset has reached 
practical completion and is then written off by way of depreciation of the relevant asset.
Dividends
The annual ﬁ nal dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual General Meeting whilst interim 
dividends are charged in the period they are paid.
Goodwill and other intangibles
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is the difference between the fair value of the 
consideration paid and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. The impairment review 
is assessed by reference to the value-in-use, using internal forecasts and a discount rate based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash ﬂ ows and the 
choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash ﬂ ows. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
The valuation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations is based on assumptions and the 
Directors draw upon a variety of external sources to aid them in the determination of appropriate data to use 
such valuations.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁ t 
and loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS (1 February 2004) has been retained 
at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂ ows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An intangible asset with an indeﬁ nite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. If the recoverable amount of 
an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
as income immediately.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment loss. 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less estimated residual values of all property, plant and equipment, 
on a straight-line basis, over their expected useful lives at the following annual rates:
Short leasehold property – over period of lease
Improvements to leasehold property – 10% 
Freehold land – 0%
Freehold property – 1% to 5% 
Fixtures, ﬁ ttings and equipment – 20% to 33%
The residual values of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed on an annual basis. 
Computer software and web development
Computer software and web development are accounted for as intangible assets where the criteria of IAS 38 
“Intangible Assets” has been met. Intangible assets are valued at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis 
over 5 years unless the asset can be demonstrated to have an indeﬁ nite life. Intangible assets with ﬁ nite lives are 
reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible 
assets with an indeﬁ nite useful life are tested for impairment annually.
Leased assets 
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding 
liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁ nance lease obligation. Lease payments are 
apportioned between ﬁ nance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income, 
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance 
with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease.
Premiums paid or received on the acquisition of short leasehold properties are transferred to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated to include, where 
applicable, duties, handling, transport and other directly attributable costs.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling prices less further costs expected to be incurred 
in selling and distribution.

Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect 
is material, expected future cash ﬂ ows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects the risks speciﬁ c 
to the liability. Calculations of these provisions require judgements to be made, which include forecast 
consumer demand and inventory loss trends.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year. Taxable proﬁ t differs from the net proﬁ t as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation 
of taxable proﬁ t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the tax proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁ t.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries 
and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to 
be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Pension contributions
The Group makes payments to a number of deﬁ ned contribution pension schemes. The assets of these schemes 
do not form part of the assets of the Group. The pension cost charge represents contributions payable during 
the year.

Share-based payments
Share-based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the Group’s share option, incentive and 
sharesave schemes. Share options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place since 
7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are 
charged to the income statement over the performance or vesting period of the scheme. The annual charge 
is modiﬁ ed to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the performance or vesting 
period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely that the 
option will vest.
When shares and share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to the income statement. 
The associated deferred tax is charged to the income statement with any excess deferred tax being recorded 
directly in reserves in accordance with IAS 12.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Black-Scholes model is the most appropriate due to its simplicity and 
is deemed the most accurate when taking into account the expected timing of the exercise of options. The 
options model requires highly subjective assumptions to be made and the Directors draw upon a variety of 
external sources to aid them in the determination of appropriate data to use in such calculations. During the 
vesting period of share options, an assessment is required of the likelihood of whether non-market performance 
conditions will be met, which affects the estimate of the number of share options that will vest, and hence the 
amount charged to the income statement.
Employee Beneﬁ t Trust 
The cost of the Company’s shares held by the Employee Beneﬁ t Trust is deducted from the shareholders’ funds 
in the Group balance sheet. Any cash received by the Trust on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised 
directly in shareholders’ funds. Other assets and liabilities of the Trust (including borrowings) are recognised as 
assets and liabilities of the Group.
Any shares held by the Trust are treated as cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Financial risk management 
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of ﬁ nance and the management 
and control of liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates. The function operates as a cost centre and 
manages the Group’s treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, ﬁ nance leases, cash and short 
term deposits. The main purpose of these ﬁ nancial instruments is to raise ﬁ nance for the Group’s operations. 
The Group has various other ﬁ nancial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise 
directly from its operations. The Group also enters into interest rate swaps derivative transactions. Their purpose 
is to assist in the management of the Group’s ﬁ nancial risk. These instruments are also used, where appropriate, 
to generate the desired effective interest rate proﬁ le. The Group hedge accounts for commercial purposes 
and not for accounting purposes.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁ nancial instruments 
shall be undertaken.

Our results
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency 
risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are 
summarised below:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt 
obligations and deposits. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using interest rate swaps, where they 
are considered appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
Due to the international nature of its activities, the Group’s reported proﬁ ts, net assets and gearing are all affected 
by foreign exchange movements.
Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises, Group exposure to currency 
risk at a transactional level is minimal. The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in 
local currencies.
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, credit worthy third parties. The Group does not enter into derivatives 
to manage its credit risk. At the balance sheet date there were no concentrations of credit risk.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other ﬁ nancial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash 
equivalents and derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter 
party with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. Derivative counterparties 
and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality ﬁ nancial institutions. The Group has policies that limit 
the amount of credit exposure to any one ﬁ nancial institution. Cash surpluses are placed on deposit only 
with ﬁ nancial counterparties with a short-term credit ratings of A1/P1 or better and long-term ratings of A1/A+ 
or better.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂ exibility through the use 
of borrowings with a range of maturities. The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufﬁ cient 
medium- and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements. 
To achieve this it seeks to maintain cash balances to meet expected requirements for a period of at least 
60 days. The liquidity risk for each country is managed centrally. Budgets are set locally but agreed by the 
Board in advance to enable the Group’s cash requirements to be anticipated.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classiﬁ ed into the following speciﬁ ed categories: “ﬁ nancial assets at fair value through 
proﬁ t or loss (FVTPL)”, and “loans and receivables”. The classiﬁ cation depends on the nature and purpose 
of the ﬁ nancial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. The Group does not hold any 
“held-to-maturity” investments or AFS ﬁ nancial assets.
213541_GAME_REPORT_P80-128_n.indd   91 213541_GAME_REPORT_P80-128_n.indd   91 26/5/09   10:51:54 26/5/09   10:51:54 92
The GAME Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 
2008-2009
Statement of Accounting Policies continued
Financial assets at FVTPL
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see Financial liabilities section for out-of-money 
derivatives). They are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement in ﬁ nance income or expense line. The Group does not have any assets held 
for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any ﬁ nancial assets as being at fair value through proﬁ t or loss.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have ﬁ xed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market are classiﬁ ed as loans and receivables. 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables. This provision represents the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash ﬂ ows. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits at call with banks, bank overdrafts and unpresented 
cheques. Bank overdrafts where there is no right of set off are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the 
balance sheet.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Debt and equity instruments are classiﬁ ed as either ﬁ nancial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangements. Financial liabilities are classiﬁ ed as either “ﬁ nancial liabilities 
at fair value through proﬁ t or loss (FVTPL)” or “other ﬁ nancial liabilities”.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives.
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with 
foreign exchange or interest ﬂ uctuations. Such derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value with subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement.
Net interest arising on interest rate agreements is taken to the income statement.
Other than these derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, the Group does not have any liabilities held for trading nor 
has it designated ﬁ nancial liabilities as being at fair value through proﬁ t or loss.
The fair value for the Group’s interest rate swaps derivatives is based on broker quotes for similar instruments.

Other ﬁ nancial liabilities
Trade and other payables are recognised on the trade date of the related transactions. Trade payables are 
not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost, with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting 
all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern 
while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s 
overall strategy remains unchanged from 2008.
In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to ensure its continued ability to provide a consistent 
return for its equity shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions. In order to achieve 
this objective, the Group seeks to maintain a gearing ratio that balances risks and returns at an acceptable 
level and also to maintain a sufﬁ cient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and 
strategic investment needs. In making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these aims, either 
through altering its dividend policy, new share issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group considers not only 
its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.

10 Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share for the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2009 is based on the proﬁ t after 
taxation of £85,440,116 (2008: £47,178,969). The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on a weighted 
average number of 345,895,311 (2008: 342,198,365) shares in issue during the year. The number of shares used 
in these calculations and the reconciliation of denominators used for basic and diluted earnings per share 
calculations is set out in the table below:

12 Intangible ﬁ xed assets (continued)
Goodwill principally relates to the GAME and Gamestation brands. The goodwill is allocated, for impairment 
testing purposes, to cash-generating units as follows:
     £’000
UK and Ireland     135,033
International     25,419
Total     160,452
The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed on a value-in-use basis. The key assumptions for the calculations 
are those regarding growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs. The growth rates are 
based on industry forecasts, changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations 
of future changes in the market. The Group prepares cash ﬂ ow forecasts derived from the most recent ﬁ nancial 
budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash ﬂ ows for no more than 13 years 
using a steady growth rate applicable to the relevant market. This rate does not exceed the average long-term 
growth rate for the relevant markets. The cash ﬂ ows were discounted using pre-tax discount rates between 8 per cent 
and 13 per cent dependent on the territories concerned and GAME’s operations in those territories. No impairments 
were recognised in the year.
To cause the carrying value of any of the Group’s business units to exceed their recoverable amount would require 
material and signiﬁ cant adverse changes in one or a number of the assumptions made. The Board do not consider 
these to be reasonably possible changes.
13 Inventories
    2009 2008
    £’000 £’000
Finished goods and goods held for resale    181,965 145,041
The Directors consider that the replacement value of inventories is not materially different from their carrying 
value. The stock provision in the current year is £20,338,000 (2008: £11,748,000).
14 Trade and other receivables
    2009 2008
    £’000 £’000
Amounts falling due within one year:
Trade receivables    16,197 18,921
Other receivables    22,066 14,050

Total trade and other receivables    38,327 33,295
Prepayments and accrued income    17,138 20,550
    55,465 53,845
A large proportion of the trade receivables of the Group relates to customers using credit cards or similar 
arrangements to purchase goods. GAME bears no risk of recovery and as a result, the risk of impairment 
of accounts receivable is not considered by the Directors to be signiﬁ cant.
As at 31 January 2009 and 31 January 2008 there were no amounts which were past due and no amounts 
which were impaired.

The Directors review any requirement for interest rate hedging during the year dependent upon the level 
of borrowings.
(a) Interest rate and currency of borrowings
The currency and interest rate exposure of the Group’s borrowings is shown below:
    2009 2008
    £’000 £’000
Floating rate Euro borrowings    2,131 14,412
Floating rate Sterling borrowings    56,041 81,164
Floating rate AUD borrowings    – 271
    58,172 95,847
The ﬂ oating rate borrowings comprise bank borrowings and ﬁ nance leases bearing interest rates based upon 
LIBOR and EURIBOR. 
The Group holds a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £70 million to be used for general corporate and working 
capital purposes. As at 31 January 2009 an amount of €nil (2008: €15 million) was drawn down for use in Spain. 
The interest rate on the RCF is based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The ﬂ oating rate sterling borrowings comprise a £55 million Term Loan taken out in order to fund the purchase 
of Gamestation and reﬁ nance the existing debt at GAME. The interest rate on the loan is based on LIBOR. 
The second repayment was made in January 2009 and two further instalments are due.
The terms of the loan facility includes a ﬁ xed charge over the freehold property and a ﬂ oating charge over assets.
(b) Interest rate and currency of cash balances
The currency and interest rate exposure of the Group’s ﬂ oating rate cash balances is shown below:

(c) Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions 
constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, 
for example a change in interest rate and a change in foreign currency interest rates. The sensitivity analysis 
prepared by management for foreign currency risk and interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value 
or future cash ﬂ ows of a ﬁ nancial instrument will ﬂ uctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
At 31 January 2009, if interest rates on the ﬂ oating rate borrowings denominated in sterling had been 100 basis 
points higher with all other variables held constant, proﬁ t after tax for the period would be £1,137,427 lower 
(2008: £1,037,910 lower).
At 31 January 2009, if interest rates on the ﬂ oating rate borrowings denominated in euros had been 100 basis 
points higher with all other variables held constant, proﬁ t after tax for the period would be £145,682 lower 
(2008: £173,231 lower).
The Directors consider that 100 basis points is the maximum likely change to sterling and euro interest rates 
over the next year, being the period up to the next point at which the Group expects to make these disclosures. 
The tables in (a) and (b) above present ﬁ nancial liabilities and assets denominated in foreign currencies held 
by the Group in 2009 and 2008. If the euro weakened or strengthened by 10 per cent against sterling, with all 
other variables held constant, proﬁ t after tax and equity would reduce by £850,255 (2008: reduce by £352,146). 
(d) Fair value of borrowings and ﬁ nancial assets
Set out below is an analysis of all the Group’s borrowings and ﬁ nancial assets by category. The fair value of 
ﬂ oating rate borrowings is the amortised cost because the interest rate payments are based on market value.
    2009 2008
    £’000 £’000
Trade and other receivables    38,327 33,295
Net cash and cash equivalents    139,614 137,899
Current portion of long-term debt    (26,325) (38,038)
Non-current portion of long-term debt    (31,847) (57,809)
There is no material difference between the book value and current value of these borrowings. 
(e) The Group had no material monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in the functional 
currency of the operating unit involved.
(f) As at 30 March 2009, the Group had undrawn working capital facilities available to it of £32.0 million 
(2008: £20.8 million) and €nil (2008: €nil). There are no signiﬁ cant conditions attached to these facilities.

During the year the Group modiﬁ ed the process for satisfying the exercise of unapproved share options. 
Employees now have a choice of settlement on exercise and can either pay for and receive the full number 
of shares under option, or can use a net settled cashless exercise facility run by the Company, which results 
in a lower number of shares being issued than are under option. There has been no change in the fair value 
of these awards as a result of these changes and no material liability arises.

(e) Equity-settled Executive Share Option Plan
The Group Executive Share Option plan provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price 
of the Group shares on the date of grant. The options will vest after three years subject to meeting the following 
performance conditions. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the 
options vest. 
For awards up to 100 per cent of salary awards are subject to achieving an earnings per share (EPS) growth 
of at least RPI +9 per cent over three years. This condition may be re-tested at the end of years four and ﬁ ve, where 
EPS growth must be at least RPI +12 per cent and RPI +15 per cent respectively over the period since grant. 
For awards between 100 per cent and 200 per cent of salary awards are subject to achieving EPS growth 
of 15 per cent. This may be re-tested in years four and ﬁ ve with RPI +20 per cent and RPI +25 per cent respectively. 
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the forward weighted historical volatility of the Group’s share 
price over a period equal to the expected life. The expected life used in the model is the mid point of the 
exercise period.
(g) Equity-settled Long-Term Incentive Scheme (LTIP)
The Group long-term incentive scheme has a vesting period of three years from grant, and must be exercised in 
the six month period following vesting. Furthermore, shares are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before 
the awards vest. Twenty-ﬁ ve per cent of awards vest if EPS grows by RPI +15 per cent over the performance 
period, 100 per cent of the award vests if EPS grows by RPI +30 per cent. The award vests on a pro-rata basis 
between these points.

As the awards under both the Executive Share Option Scheme and the Long-Term Incentive Scheme are subject 
to the satisfaction of EPS performance conditions, the total charge is calculated based on the fair value of the 
options and the total number of options expected to vest based on the Company’s estimate of meeting the 
performance conditions. The charge is also adjusted for management’s judgements in relation to the number 
of leavers.
Given the above assumptions, the Group recognised total expenses of £1,968,777 (2008: £1,204,493) related 
to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year (see note 7).

£271,000, £785,000, £222,000, and £294,000 to turnover respectively and £237,000, £36,000, £113,000, £9,000 and 
£31,000 to operating proﬁ t respectively. If these acquisitions had been completed on the ﬁ rst day of the ﬁ nancial 
year, it is not anticipated that the operating proﬁ t would have been materially different. No fair value adjustments 
were required on these acquisitions. 
From the date of acquisition Gamestation added £273 million to turnover and £12 million to operating proﬁ t. If the 
acquisition had been completed on the ﬁ rst day of the ﬁ nancial year, Group revenues for the year would have 
been increased by £67 million and the Group proﬁ t attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been 
decreased by £1.5 million.

27 Risks
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group have been and are as at the date of this report:
Competition
The Group faces strong competition from a diverse range of competitors including supermarkets, online retailers, 
conventional high-street retailers and independents. The Group expects increased competition from food 
retailers who are expanding their range of non-food items. 
Seasonality
The Group’s business is highly seasonal with the key trading period being the Christmas season. Turnover, 
operating proﬁ t and cash ﬂ ow may be adversely impacted by variations in demand during this period.
Technology
Playing games online is a growing part of the market, whereby software content is sent digitally, direct from the 
publisher to the gamer. This may lead to reduced product sales for mainline retailers.

 Notes to the Company Balance Sheet
at 31 January 2009
1 Basis of accounting
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985, except for the fair valuing of certain ﬁ nancial instruments.
The required consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement has been included within the consolidated accounts of the Group.
As permitted by FRS 8, no related party disclosures for the Company have been included.
2 Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
Investments
Investments held as ﬁ xed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at year end rates of exchange. Gains and 
losses arising on equity investments denominated in foreign currencies are taken to reserves. Other exchange 
differences are taken to the proﬁ t and loss account. 
Where foreign currency loans from the Company to a subsidiary are deemed to be as permanent as equity they 
are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date they were deemed to be as permanent as equity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or liability, at appropriate rates, in respect of transactions and events 
recognised in the accounts of the current and previous periods which give the entity a right to pay less, or an 
obligation to pay more, tax in future periods. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent it is probable 
that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which they can be recovered.
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would arise from the future disposal of any ﬁ xed 
assets shown in the accounts at valuation, except to the extent that at the balance sheet date there is a binding 
sale agreement.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Employee beneﬁ t trust
The cost of the Company’s shares held by the Employee Beneﬁ t Trust is deducted from the shareholders’ funds in 
the Company. Any cash received by the Trust on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised directly in the 
shareholders’ funds. Other assets and liabilities of the Trust (including borrowings) are recognised as assets and 
liabilities of the Company.
Any shares held by the Trust are treated as cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Share-based payments
The Company has a number of share-based payment plans that certain employees participate in. Accounting 
for these is in accordance with FRS 20 and is also in accordance with the Group accounting policy and the 
disclosures provided in Note 20 to the Group consolidated ﬁ nancial statements which have been prepared 
under IFRS 2, “Share-based payment”.

14 Contingent liabilities
The Company has guaranteed certain liabilities and bank borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings. At 31 January 
2009 the liabilities covered by these guarantees amounted to £2,130,572 (2008: £14,411,685). In addition the 
Company has guaranteed certain operating leases of its subsidiary undertakings with an annual lease 
commitment of £1,905,855 (2008: £2,142,255). Where the Company enters into ﬁ nancial guarantee contracts to 
guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance 
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract 
as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee.

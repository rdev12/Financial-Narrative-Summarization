Chairman’s Statement
Despitetheongoingrealityofarecessionaryenvironment,
ourtradingperformancebearswitnesstothefruitsofhard
work across the Group.
IamdelightedtoreportthatFinsburyFoodshasachieved
an increase in top and bottom line growth in the current
trading period.
For the ﬁrst time in our history,Group sales have
surpassed £200m.Revenue from cakes across UK and
Europehasgrownby9%,BreadandFreeFromregistering
acombineduplift of 10%.
Traditionalareasofstrengthcontinuetoexpandwhileother
sectors oﬀer further encouragement.The introduction
of fresh gluten free bread received a warm welcome in
the marketplace while our expansion into retailers own
brands continues apace.In addition,Vogels speciality
breads enjoyed a successful relaunch and Nicholas &
Harrisotherspecialitybreadproductsperformedstrongly.
One area of notable growth is in our 50% owned
subsidiary Lightbody Europe.Over the last 18 months,
therangeofoﬀeringshascontinuedtoexpand,broadening
beyond cakes into other UK branded products.
While the trading performance is clearly encouraging,
satisfaction must be tempered with concern at events
beyond our power to inﬂuence.
Input price inﬂation continues to impact on operating
margins with prices for commodities such as sugar and
eggs moving steadily upwards.
The situation for consumers shows little sign of
improvement.Our customers are faced with shrinking
disposable incomes and the very real dilemma of trying
to make ends meet while buying good food.
Weoperateinatreatcategory.Peoplewanttocomedown
the cake aisle and purchase our products for themselves
and their families.They are willing to be engaged;they
want to see something new,bakery goods that are
appealing and aﬀordable.
Ourresponsehasbeentoengageandinnovate.Overthe
last 12 months,Finsbury Foods has increased spend on
Category Management initiatives,conducting market
research and trialling new products with the speciﬁc
aim of stimulating consumer awareness.
Our major customers actively value our input.They are
looking to us as a large bakery Group to help them ﬁnd
ways of reﬁning and improving their product range
to generate growth.
Theeﬃcacyofourapproachisborneoutbyrobustlevels
ofcashﬂowgeneration.Havingrenegotiatedourbanking
facilities with HSBC during 2011,the Group paid oﬀ
£3.2 million of deferred consideration with £1.2 million
remaining at the end of the year,an important marker
in terms of how people see the business.
Intoday’senvironment,debtishardlyviewedinapositive
light.Reducingourleveloftotaldebtincludingdeferred
consideration to EBITDA to 2.7 by the 30 June 2012
year end represents another major accomplishment.
Aslongaswecontinuetogeneratecashﬂowatpresent
levels,the Group will break free of self imposed
constraints regarding new investments.
Business has never been more of a challenge.Steering a major
bakery Group through the stormy seas of an economic downturn
was never going to be painless.Navigatingacoursetosafehaven

We cannot make something for nothing.The sheer hard

for maintaining progress in the second half of the year.
This was despite another exacting year of cost inﬂation
and the necessity of having to conduct diﬃcult

BroaderBrushstrokes
Organic growth in the current environment provides
a ringing endorsement of our products.However,cost
inﬂation continues to exert considerable pressure on
margins,the prospect of further price increases casting
a shadow over our eﬀorts.
Restructuring measures in recent years have generated
exceptional cost savings across the business.Over the
last 12 months,with such savings primarily realised,
eﬃciency measures moved centre stage.

We are constantly striving to reap the scale beneﬁts
of our businesses,becoming more eﬃcient in the use
ofrawmaterials.Stringenteﬀortshavebeenmadeto
remove non value-added processes in all our factories,
squaring the circle of keeping costs down to oﬀset the
rising price of raw materials.
We have also tried to do things diﬀerently,using
ingredients in a more inventive fashion.One prime
example was the creation of a higher value Disney Car
cake,a distinctive product enjoying prime position
on supermarket shelves.

28 CriticalAccountingEstimatesandJudgements
The Group is required to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future.These estimates and judgements are based on historical experience and
other factors,including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.The resulting accounting estimates will,
by deﬁnition,seldom equal the related actual results.
Accounting estimates and judgements have been required for the production of these Financial Statements.The following are those that are deemed
to require the most complex judgements about matters that have the most signiﬁcant eﬀect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
• Impairment of goodwill can signiﬁcantly impact the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year.The Group estimates
the recoverable amounts based on historical experience of margin,volumes and cost structure and expectations of future events.The Group’s weighted

TheaccountingpoliciessetoutbelowhavebeenappliedconsistentlytoallperiodspresentedintheseconsolidatedFinancialStatements,exceptasexplained
in the basis of preparation,which addresses any changes in accounting policies resulting from new or revised standards.
BasisofConsolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.Control exists when the Group has the power,directly or indirectly,to govern the ﬁnancial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.In assessing control,potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are
taken into account.The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences
untilthedatethatcontrolceases.Theaccountingpoliciesofsubsidiarieshavebeenchangedwhennecessarytoalignthemwiththepoliciesadoptedbythe

ForeignCurrency
TransactionsinforeigncurrenciesaretranslatedtothefunctionalcurrencyofGroupentitiesattheforeignexchangeraterulingatthedateofthetransaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign
exchange rate ruling at that date.
Any exchange diﬀerences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates diﬀerent from those at which they
were initially recorded are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations,including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation,are translated to the Group’s
presentational currency,Sterling,at foreign exchange rates ruling at the period end date.The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated
at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.This revaluation
is recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Changes in the market value of interest rate swaps have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as ﬁnancial
income or expense.Changes in the market value of foreign exchange hedges have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income within administrative costs.
Non-derivativeFinancialInstruments
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities,trade and other receivables,cash and cash equivalents,loans
and borrowings,and trade and other payables.
TradeandotherReceivables
The value of trade and other receivables is deemed to be the amount that would be received if the debt was cleared on the period end date.
TradeandotherPayables
The value of trade and other payables is deemed to be the value that would be payable to settle the liability at the period end date.
CashandCashEquivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-bearingBorrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method,less any impairment losses.

RecognitionandMeasurement
Itemsofproperty,plantandequipmentaremeasuredatcostorfairvalueatthedateofacquisition,lessaccumulateddepreciationandimpairmentprovisions.
Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materialsand
direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use,and the costs of dismantlingand
removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located.Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment
is capitalised as part of that equipment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write oﬀ the cost,less estimated residual value,of the property,plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated
useful economic lives to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.When parts of an item of property,plant and equipment have diﬀerent
useful lives,they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property,plant and equipment.
The depreciation rates used are as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% – 20% Plant and equipment 10% – 33%
Leasehold property Up to the remaining life of the lease Assets under construction Nil
Fixtures and ﬁttings 10% – 33% Motor vehicles 25% – 33%
Impairment reviews of ﬁxed assets are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
LeasedAssets

the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.Subsequent to initial
recognition,the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Assets acquired by ﬁnance lease and hire purchase are depreciated over the lease term or their useful lives.
Obligations under ﬁnance leases are included in liabilities net of the ﬁnance charge allocated to future periods.The ﬁnance element of the rental payment

OperatingLeasePayments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease.
FinanceLeasePayments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the ﬁnance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.The ﬁnance charge is allocated
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
IntangibleAssetsandGoodwill
Goodwill
Goodwillisstatedatcostlessanyaccumulatedimpairmentlosses.Goodwillisallocatedtocash-generatingunitsandisnotamortisedbutistestedannually
for impairment.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration for the business exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired.Where the excess is negative
(negative goodwill),the amount is taken to retained earnings.Goodwill is capitalised and subject to impairment reviews both annually and where there
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

are identiﬁable and have a ﬁnite life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed at each period end date to determine whether there is an indication
of impairment.Intangibleassetsandgoodwillareconsideredtobeimpairedifobjectiveevidenceindicatesthatoneormoreeventshavehadanegative

For goodwill and intangible assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life,the recoverable amount is estimated at each period end date.
An impairment loss would be recognised whenever the carrying amount of an intangible asset,goodwill or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount.Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

DeferredConsideration
The provision for deferred consideration is initially stated at the net present value of the expected future payment and the discount is accrued by increasing
the amount of the provision up to the expected payment date.The charge relating to the unwinding of the discount is recorded within ﬁnance costs.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.Cost is determined on the ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out basis,and includes all direct costs incurred
and attributable production overheads.Net realisable value is based upon estimated selling price allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal.

A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of a past event,that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year,using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date,and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for taxation purposes.The following temporary diﬀerences are not provided for:
• The initial recognition of goodwill;
• The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that aﬀect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt other than in a business combination;and
• The diﬀerences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.

32 2 RevenueandSegmentInformation
Operating segments are identiﬁed on the basis of internal reporting and decision making.The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered
to be the Board of Directors as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance by segment.
The Board uses operating proﬁt,reviewed on a regular basis,as the key measure of the segments’performance.Operating proﬁt in this instance is deﬁned
as proﬁt before the following:
• Net ﬁnancing expense
• Share option charges
• Non-recurring signiﬁcant items
• Fair value adjustments relating to acquisitions
• Pension charges or credits in relation to the diﬀerence between the expected return on pension assets and interest cost on pension liabilities and
• Revaluation of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group’s operating segments are“Cake”and“Bread & Free From”.The primary driver of this segmental structure is the commonality of the product
categories operated in.
The Cake segment sells ambient cakes to the UK’s multiple grocers.This segment primarily comprises the operations of Memory Lane Cakes Ltd,
Lightbody Group Ltd and Campbells Cake Company Ltd,and also includesYumYum’s which are produced at United Central Bakeries.
The Bread & Free From segment sells speciality bread and morning goods into the bakery sectors of the UK’s multiple grocers.This segment is primarily
made up of the operations of United Central Bakeries Ltd,Livwell Ltd and Nicholas & Harris Ltd.In addition to these operations,the‘In Store Bakery’
rangemanufacturedatLightbodyofHamiltonandMemoryLaneCakesLtdisalsoincludedintheBread&FreeFromsegmentasthenatureoftheproduct
and their location in the multiple grocers’product range is similar.

to reﬂect the synergies achieved from obtaining resources centrally giving beneﬁts across the operating segments.Operating proﬁt levels have been chosen
as the basis,as this reﬂects the underlying performance of the segment and is also the return the Group expects from those segments.
Apurchasingpremiumof2%ischargedfromGroupoperations,andiscalculatedonmaterialsandpackagingspendatsegmentallevel.Thischargeisbased
on the rationale that Group operations,through its Group buyers,optimises the Group’s procurement spend through leveraging its purchasing power.
This has resulted in a proﬁt of £1.9m (2011:£1.9m) being presented within the Group operations segment.
The Group’s ﬁnance income and expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated to the individual operating segments.

The parent company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £229,560 (2011:£248,690.This asset has not been recognised in these Financial Statements
as suitable proﬁts to utilise the underlying losses are not expected to arise in the future).
The impact of the reduction in the UK tax rate from 26% to 24% from April 2012 amounts to £96,000 lower charge in the ﬁnancial year to 30 June 2012.
The adjustment in 2012 for prior year relates primarily to utilisation of losses brought forward £150,000 and additional tax relief on qualifying R&D
expenditure for prior periods of £80,000.The adjustment in 2011 in respect of prior year relates to the release of accrual of £200,000 for a prior year tax
inquiry which has been shown as a signiﬁcant non-recurring item in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and £254,000 relates
to additional tax relief on qualifying R&D expenditure for the ﬁnancial year to 2 July 2011 and to 4 July 2009.Claim for tax relief on qualifying R&D
expenditure is deemed to be a recurring item.
9 EarningsPerOrdinaryShare
Basic earnings per share for the period is calculated on the basis of proﬁt for the year after tax,divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue
53,374,000 (2011:52,746,000).

An adjusted earnings per share and an adjusted diluted earnings per share have also been calculated as in the opinion of the Board this will allow
shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.These adjusted earnings per share exclude:
• Reorganisation and other signiﬁcant non-recurring costs
• IAS 39‘Financial Instruments:Recognition and Measurement’fair value adjustment relating to the Group’s interest rate swaps and foreign
exchange contracts
• IAS 19‘Accounting for retirement beneﬁts’relating to the net income

11 Intangibles
Intangible assets comprise licences and goodwill.
a)Licences
The value of the licensing agreements is calculated by reference to the additional cash ﬂow they are expected to generate over unbranded sales.The perio d
over which the value is amortised varies between licences depending on their remaining life.
The licenses recognised were purchased as part of the acquisition of Goswell Enterprises Ltd in June 2009 and relate to the exclusive licensing agreements
for Cranks,Doves Farm breads andVogels.The period over which the value is amortised is the life of the license which is ﬁve years.

b)Goodwill
Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions and reﬂects the future economic beneﬁts arising from assets that are not capable of being identiﬁed individually and
recognised as separate assets.The goodwill reﬂects the anticipated proﬁtability and synergistic beneﬁts arising from the utilisation of the Group’s existing
distribution channels and customer relationships in the cake and Bread & Free From sector.The goodwill is the balance of the total consideration less fair
value of assets acquired and identiﬁed.The carrying value of the goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.

The Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis,or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.The recoverable

InterestRateSwapsatFairValue
The Group has entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge its risks associated with interest rate ﬂuctuations:
£5.0m for ﬁve years from 1 May 2008 (ﬁxed) at 5.5%
£10.0m for four years from 1 June 2010 (ﬁxed) at 4.9%
£5.0m for ﬁve years from 1 July 2011 (ﬁxed) at 3.6%
There are two forward dated swaps:
£3.0m for four years from 22 May 2013 (ﬁxed) at 1.7%
£6.0m for three years from 2 June 2014 (ﬁxed) at 1.9%
In addition one interest rate swap matured during the year:
£11.0m over ﬁve years from 23 February 2007 (reducing to £3.5m over 5 years) at 5.8% matured February 2012
Changes in their fair value are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income resulting in a credit of £84,000
(2011:£564,000) as indicated above.
They are shown as liabilities as a result of the current low levels of base and LIBOR interest rates.
ForwardForeignExchangeContractsatFairValue
The Group has entered into a number of forward foreign exchange contracts to minimise the impact of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates,changes in their
fair value are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
44 14 PensionSchemes
A number of companies within the Group operate deﬁned contribution pension schemes with one company also operating a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme.

A £65,000 contribution was paid during the ﬁnancial year 2012 from Memory Lane Cakes (2011:£11,000).The Group’s contribution has been agreed
based on the outcome of the full actuarial valuation dated 31 May 2010.The valuation of the Scheme on an equity/bond basis and projected unit method,
showed that there was a deﬁcit of £170,000 equivalent to a 1% deﬁcit of liabilities over assets.The valuation was conducted by a qualiﬁed independent
actuary.This deﬁcit is payable over a three year period at a rate of £65,000 pa.The full actuarial valuation diﬀers from the ﬁnancial year end valuation
deﬁcit of £3,075,000.

Actuarial gains and losses arise due to changes in the key assumptions such as inﬂation,mortality rates and discount rates as well as experience gains and
losses.The actuarial gain for the prior period includes the impact of the change in the inﬂationary measure from RPI to CPI which has acted to reduce
the liabilities of the Scheme by around £2,630,000 at the review date.

Recognised in the ﬁnancial year (2,357) 2,224
Cumulative amount at end of ﬁnancial year (4,583) (2,226)
Principal long-term actuarial assumptions at the year end were as follows:
2012 2011
CPI price inﬂation assumption 2.1% 2.9%
Increases to pensions in payment 2.1% 2.9%
Discount rate for liabilities 4.6% 5.5%
Expected rate of return for plan assets 7.8% 7.9%
The ﬁnancial assumptions are based on market conditions as at the review date of 30 June 2012 with discount rates based on the yields on long-dated high
quality corporate bonds.The discount rate is lower than the discount rate used last year reﬂecting the decrease in bond yields over this period.
Salary inﬂation assumptions are as determined by the Board with regard to price inﬂation.The salary inﬂation from 31 May 2010 when the Scheme closed
to future accrual was assumed to be in line with inﬂation.
The expected rate of return takes into consideration the fact that over 90% of theplan assets are held in a target return fund which targets three month
LIBOR +3% pa (which is assumed long-term to be broadly equivalent to RPI +5%).This expected return rate has decreased by 0.1% since year end 2011
reﬂecting a slightly diﬀerent mix of investment.The expected return on cash is based on the current Bank of England base rate rather than long-term
deposit rates.

CPI Inﬂation is assumed to be at 2.1% (2011:2.9%) per annum.The diﬀerential between the assumed rate of inﬂation and the discount rate for liabilities
is 2.5% (2011:2.6%).
Changing the year end 2012 assumptions to those of 2011 year end listed above,the deﬁcit would have been £2,490,000 compared to the reported deﬁcit
of £3,075,000.

credit exposure.Therefore,the maximum exposure to credit risk for the trade receivables at the period end date was £27.2 million (2011:£25.5 million)
and the ageing of trade receivables at the period end date was:

The above numbers are net of impairment.Group policy is to provide in full against all receivable balances whose full recovery is signiﬁcantly in doubt.
The provision is netted oﬀ the gross receivable.
The Group’s strategy is to focus on supplying UK multiple grocers,the nature of these customers is such that there is relatively low risk of them failing

c)MarketRisk
i)InterestRateRisk
The Group’s interest rate risk exposure is primarily to changes in variable interest rates.The Group has entered into three interest rate swap arrangem ents
in order to hedge its risks associated with any ﬂuctuations.Details of swaps are given in Note 13.
The proﬁle of the Group’s loans including deferred consideration and overdraft at the period end date were split as follows:
2012 2011
£000 £000
Fixed rate liabilities 549 3,135
Variable rate liabilities 37,104 37,282
Non interest-bearing liabilities - 1,186
37,653 41,603
Swaps amounting to £20,000,000 (2011:£24,321,000) limit the risk associated with the variable rate liabilities,the weighted average interest rate
at 30 June 2012 is 4.7% (2011:4.9%).
Sensitivity
A 1% increase in the base rate or LIBOR would have the following impact on interest charges and associated net assets for the Group,this sensitivity
relates to interest-bearing bank borrowings and interest rate swaps only and excludes possible changes in pension ﬁnancing costs.
2012 2011
£000 £000
Proﬁt decrease 206 199
Decrease in net assets 206 199
A 1% decrease in the base rate or LIBOR would have an equal and opposite impact to those listed above.
The above movement is not equal to 1% of interest-bearing loans because of interest rate swap cover that is in place.

d)DebtandCapitalManagement
The Group’s objective is to maximise the return on net invested capital while maintaining its ongoing ability to operate and guaranteeing adequate returns
for shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders,within a sustainable ﬁnancial structure.The Directors do not recommend paying a dividend as with
limited funding currently available they believe that it is more appropriate to invest to grow the business.They remain conﬁdent about the future prospects
and intend to re-establish the dividend as soon as cash ﬂow and debt levels allow.
The Group manages its capital by monitoring its gearing ratio on a regular basis,there are also covenant tests which are monitored regularly and presented to
the Group’s bank every 6 months.There have been no breaches of covenant tests during the year and the gearing ratio has fallen during the year to 0.7
(2011:0.8).The gearing ratio is calculated taking total net debt including deferred consideration over net assets.
The Group considers its capital to include share capital,share premium and capital redemption reserve.
The Group does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
25 CapitalandReserves
The reconciliation of movement in capital and reserves is shown as a primary statement Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.Within retained
earnings is the net exchange diﬀerence balance at the year end of £6,000 loss (2011:£181,000 gain).
Equity comprises the following:
• Share capital representing the nominal value of equity shares
• Share premium representing the excess of the fair value of consideration received for the equity shares,net of expenses of the share issue over nominal
value of the equity shares
• Capital redemption reserve representing the buyback and cancellation of shares at nominal value
• Retained earnings represent retained proﬁts.

Statement of Directors’Responsibilities
in Respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements 70
Report on Corporate Governance
Although not formally required to do so,the Directors have sought to embrace the principles contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code (2011),
applicable to fully listed companies,in formulating and applying the Group’s corporate governance policies.These policies are monitored to ensurethat
they are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the provisions of the Code given the size of the Company.
The Board operates as an eﬀective Board in directing the activities of the Group.The Board meets at least six times during the year and all the Directors
make every eﬀort to attend these meetings.The Board maintains a schedule of matters which are reserved to it for decision,including acquisition policy,
approval of major capital expenditure and approval of annual budgets.
TheBoardconsistsoftheNon-ExecutiveChairman(MartinLightbody),twofulltimeExecutiveDirectors(JohnDuﬀyandStephenBoyd),aparttime
Executive Director (Crawford Currie) and four Non-Executive Directors (Paul Monk,David Marshall,Ian Farnsworth and Edward Beale of whom
the last three are independent).Consideration is given to character,judgement and business relationships when considering the Directors’independence.
The role of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Oﬃcer are separate.The Chairman is responsible for running the Board and he meets regularly
and separately with the Chief Executive and the other Non-Executive Directors to discuss matters for the Board.
Edward Beale is the Chief Executive of City Group and David Marshall is a Director of City Group.City Group is a subsidiary of London Finance
and Investment Group Plc,a substantial shareholder in the Company.City Group provides a full set of company secretarial services to the Board
on an outsourced basis and its fees are set out in the related party note,Note 30.The Company is not yet large enough to justify the employment
of a full time Company Secretary.
BoardCommittees
The Board has separate Remuneration and Audit Committees which meet on a timely basis.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Ian Farnsworth with Edward Beale as the other member.Edward Beale is a chartered accountant and a member
of the Accounting Council.
Further details are given in the Audit Committee Report on page 71.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Ian Farnsworth with Edward Beale as the other member.

InternalControls
TheBoardisresponsibleformaintainingasoundsystemofinternalcontrolstosafeguardshareholders’investmentandtheGroup’sassets,aswellasreviewing
its eﬀectiveness.The system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives andcan
only provide reasonable,rather than absolute,assurance against material loss and mis-statement.
DialoguewithShareholders
The Board maintains a general policy of keeping all interested parties informed by regular announcements and update statements.
In implementing this policy the Board keeps in mind the distribution of shareholders between direct,nominee and institutional shareholders.
Communications are then distributed between these groups accordingly.
Speciﬁc methods of communication are:
• Annual general and extraordinary meetings with shareholders
• Broker brieﬁngs
• Broker and analysts visits to operating sites
• Letters to shareholders when appropriate
• Corporate website (www.ﬁnsburyfoods.co.uk)
• One to one meetings with investors.
Care is taken to ensure that information is made available to all shareholders at the same time. 71
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility from the Board to monitor and review areas such as risk management,internal controls and ﬁnancial
reporting.The Audit Committee is also responsible for maintaining an objective and professional relationship with the Group’s auditors,monitoringtheir
eﬀectiveness and agreeing their fees.It receives reports on these issues from the relevant Executive Directors and external advisers and reports back to the
Boardontheactionpointswithinthosereportsandanyrecommendationsarising.Aspartoftheseresponsibilitiesitconsiderstherequirementforaninternal

Membership
The Audit Committee is chaired by me,Ian Farnsworth.Edward Beale,a Non-Executive Director,is the other member.Both of us are considered
to be independent Directors.Edward Beale is a member of the Accounting Council and is able to provide technical input to committee discussions.
Procedures

are invited to attend any meetings involving Financial Statements.Time is set aside during at least one meeting each year for the Committee to hold
discussions in private with the external auditors in the absence of management and Executive Directors.A representative of City Group Plc attends

KeyAgendaItems
During the year,the Committee speciﬁcally discussed issues arising from:
• Interest rate and currency hedging
• Review of risks and appropriate level of internal controls
• Impairment reviews.
Certain tax and pension advice has been received from the auditors and the use of auditors was approved in advance.This advice was of limited nature
and we do not believe it compromises the auditors’independence.
If any readers of these accounts have suggestions for improvement in the content or the presentation of the Financial Statements,please can they let
me know by writing to info@ﬁnsburyfoods.co.uk.

and salary increases given to other Group employees.

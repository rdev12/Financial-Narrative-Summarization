Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 03  I am delighted to have joined Rolls-Royce at a time when the
 
Group is well positioned to take advantage of past investments.
 
Our ﬁnancial results for 2004 demonstrate continuing 
improvement. Proﬁts increased by 21 per cent, earnings per share 
by 19 per cent, and debt levels were signiﬁcantly down on last year. 
The directors are proposing that the Group maintains its payment 
to shareholders. 
In 2004, the Group celebrated the centenary of the ﬁrst
 
meeting between Charles Rolls and Henry Royce. During its 
 
100-year history, Rolls-Royce has created one of the world’s most
 
powerful and renowned brands and is today ﬁrmly established 
 
as a successful, international power-systems business.
 
The Group has developed a portfolio of products and 
services with leading market positions and is particularly well 
represented on the new generation of platforms that will shape 
the power-systems market for the next 50 years.The long-term 
nature of these programmes and the increasing number of engines 
in service should generate more stable and yet growing returns for 
the Group over many years. 
I would like to thank my fellow Board members for their 
support and their contribution to this success. I would also like to 
pay tribute to the commitment and excellence of our management 
and workforce at a time of considerable change for the Group. 
I owe a particular debt to Euan Baird, our former Chairman, 
who retired in June following an illness. He made a very strong 
contribution in the short period he served as Chairman and I wish 
him well for the future. I would also like to thank Lord Moore very 
much for his skilful stewardship of the Group over the last year and 
for the contribution he made to the Board as a non-executive director. 
There have been a number of other important 
 
Board changes.
 
Sir John Taylor joined the Board as a non-executive director 
last November and his technical and engineering background will 
be invaluable to the Group. 
Iain Conn was appointed as a non-executive director 
 
last month and will bring to the Board a wealth of international
 
business experience.
 
Sir Robin Nicholson will be retiring at the conclusion of 
our next Annual General Meeting and I would like to pay particular 
tribute to the signiﬁcant and lasting contribution he has made over 
the many years he has served on the Board. Sir John Weston retired 
in December and again I would like to thank him for his support 
and contribution in his time as a non-executive director. 
Rolls-Royce is emerging from a period of difﬁcult market
 
conditions. Recent results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
 
business model and its ability to generate value for shareholders.
 
While market conditions remain challenging, we look forward to
 
the future with conﬁdence.

Chief Executive’ s review 
Our steady evolution 
as a global company 
based on our own state-
of-the-art technology, 
and a consistent strategy 
was evident in many 
encouraging respects 
Our business performance in 2004 improved our ﬁnancial position 
across the board.We continued to win new orders and to 
enhance our existing customer relationships in ways that augur 
well for our future growth, as we contemplate a worldwide market 
worth perhaps US$2 trillion over the next 20 years. And we kept 
up our constant drive for technical innovation and greater 
operational efﬁciency. 
Continuing progress 
Iamparticularly pleased to report that, in what was our centenary 
year, we grew our total sales by ﬁve per cent to £5.9 billion and 
lifted our underlying proﬁts before taxation by 21 per cent to 
£345 million.There was also a strong cash ﬂow performance: 
we generated a cash inﬂow of £243 million, which resulted in a 
reduction of our year-end net debt to £80 million from £323 million 
at the end of 2003. Average net debt for the year, at £560 million, 
was at its lowest level since 1998. 
Across our four operating businesses, we booked £8.7 billion 
of ﬁrm new orders and announced a further £2.4 billion that will 
go into the order book in due course.This was a record intake for 
the Group, as was the year-end ﬁrm order book that closed at 
£18.9 billion. Our order book has now grown in each of the past 
ten years, at a 12 per cent compound annual growth rate. 
Solid progress was made across all four of the Group’s 
target markets: 
– 	 in civil aerospace, the Trent 1000 engine was adopted by 
Boeing for its new 787 Dreamliner programme, and was 
selected for the purchase of 50 aircraft by All Nippon Airways, 
ensuring that Rolls-Royce will be the launch engine for 
this programme; 
– 	 in defence aerospace, the European governments 
participating in the Euroﬁghter Typhoon conﬁrmed 
Tranche 2 of the programme, resulting in an order worth 
more than £750 million for the Group; 
– 	 in the marine sector, the MT30 derivative of the Trent 
engine was selected for the Lockheed Martin version of the 
US Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, complementing our earlier 
success with the demonstrator programme for the DD(X) 
US destroyer; and 
– 	 in the energy sector, important contracts were won for 
the West-East China Pipeline Project and in the Middle East 
for the Dolphin Energy Limited gas pipeline, which is the 
ﬁrst oil & gas application for the industrial version of the 
Trent engine. 
These and other successes during the year ensured that 
Rolls-Royce continued to enhance its strong market position in 
each of its four chosen sectors. In civil aerospace, we won 40 per 
cent of all new orders placed – our best ever performance. In the 
oil & gas sector, the success of the industrial Trent enhanced our 
position in the market for aero-derived engines. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 05  Chief Executive’ s review continued 
Sir John Rose 
Every time that Rolls-Royce sells an engine, we have signiﬁcant 
opportunities to secure future revenues for services that will add 
value for our customer and add predictability to our own future 
earnings.The Group continued to build up this aspect of the 
business in 2004. Revenue from services grew by 14 per cent to 
£3.2 billion, which represented 55 per cent of total sales and 
brought the compound annual growth rate for this side of the 
business to 12 per cent for the past ﬁve years. Orders for future 
services accounted for £7.3 billion or 39 per cent of the year-end 
ﬁrm order book. 
Innovation 
Innovative technology and engineering are at the core of our 
business, and we pushed ahead with various important initiatives 
during the year. Rolls-Royce last year prepared 250 applications 
for new patents, a record total for the Group in any one year. 
Many initiatives involved partnering with research and 
development centres overseas. Indeed, we have now set up an 
international network of technology-oriented relationships and 
more than 50 per cent of the Group’s total spending on technology 
programmes will be directed outside the UK . Partners based in 
Asia are increasingly important to us.Towards the end of the year, 
we signed a Technology Agreement with a number of research 
institutions in Singapore covering a range of research activities. 
Further links of this kind are sure to follow. 
As a global business we are in the fortunate position of 
being able to recruit the most able students in all the countries in 
which we operate and conduct research. However, my colleagues 
and I cannot fail to be concerned over the contrast evident in the 
UK, where fewer students study the sciences each year. If we are 
going to sustain our leadership in an intensely competitive 
marketplace, then we will need to ensure a reliable supply of 
talented young engineers and scientists. 
The remedy will have to include stimulating more interest 
in science at the classroom level, which is why, in July, we launched 
the Rolls-Royce Science Prize. It is a £1 million award programme 
that has been designed to act over a number of years as an 
incentive to encourage excellence in science teaching. We hope 
it will also inspire more young people to look at the possibility of 
a career in our industry. 
A highly-skilled workforce, of course, demands a best-
practices workplace. Investing in people and technology means 
investing also in our infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities. 
One of the most visible signs of this is our factory renewal 
programme. Last October, we opened our new compression 
systems facility at Inchinnan in Scotland.It is one of a number of 
facilities that will be developed and opened over the next few 
years, reﬂecting a total investment of more than £200 million. 
As well as rationalising our manufacturing facilities, 
we remain focused on improving our manufacturing processes, 
simplifying our supply chain and reducing the lead-time involved 
in component delivery.This process delivered a ﬁve per cent 
reduction in our unit costs in 2004, and we are targeting continuing 
cost reduction in 2005. 
Prospects 
The four sectors of the power-systems market on which Rolls-Royce 
is focused – civil aerospace, defence aerospace, marine and energy 
– all enjoy strong demand trends stretching well into the future. 
Rolls-Royce is well placed to beneﬁt from this demand, 
having invested heavily in new products.Taking advantage of the 
common technological base underpinning all four sectors, the Group 
has directed its investment into the development of a robust 
portfolio of products that can be adapted and applied to respond 
to new market opportunities.Thus, the investment in the Trent 
family of engines provided the technical foundation for us to bid 
successfully last year on the new Boeing 787 and has also formed 
the basis for new products in other sectors, such as the MT30 in the 
marine sector and the industrial Trent in the energy sector. 
The potential for service revenues is similarly encouraging. 
The growing number of Rolls-Royce engines in service and their long 
service lives promise to ensure attractive returns over many years. 
This aspect of the Group’s business is evolving rapidly with a 
signiﬁcant level of investment being made in support capabilities 
such as engine repair and overhaul facilities, engine leasing and 
predictive data management.We expect to see a steady rise in the 
number of long-term service agreements with our major customers. 
Across its four sectors, Rolls-Royce has now established 
a sound position within programmes that will shape the power-
systems market for many years to come: 
–	 i n civil aerospace, conditions remain difﬁcult for some 
airlines but Rolls-Royce has a broad spread of products 
and customers.The Trent engine family has secured a 
50 per cent share of the engine market serving wide-bodied 
aircraft.Trent engines will power the launch of the 
Boeing 787 and Airbus A380 aircraft.The Trent 900 was 
certiﬁed on time, paving the way for the ﬁrst ﬂight of the 
A380 in 2005. We also offer a competitive range of engines 
for the regional airlines and corporate aircraft sectors; 
–	 i n defence aerospace, our position on a broad range of 
mature and new programmes enables us to mitigate the 
impact of volatility on individual programmes and provides 
a stable outlook; 
–	i	n the marine sector, our naval business is well positioned 
on a number of important new programmes and orders 
in the offshore market recovered strongly in the second 
half of 2004; and 
–	i	n the energy sector, our oil & gas business has a strong 
order book and the industrial Trent is well placed to secure 
a growing share of the power generation market. Earlier 
this year we established a joint venture with a consortium 
of companies in Asia as a further step in the process of 
bringing to market our solid-oxide fuel cell technology. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 06  The Group is exposed to exchange rate movements on foreign 
currencies, particularly the US dollar which continued to weaken 
relative to sterling throughout 2004. We have, however, continued 
to pursue our strategy of hedging future net dollar revenues and 
at the end of 2004 had approximately US$9 billion of forward cover. 
Our strong order book, the long-term services revenue 
stream and our focus on operational performance underpin the 
Group’s expectations of continued growth in proﬁts and reduction 
of average net debt in 2005. We continue to target a ten per cent 
return on sales over the medium term, across all our businesses, 
as the business model develops and our operational efﬁciency 
continues to improve. 
A memorable year 
We celebrated our centenary in 2004 with a huge variety of events, 
from Highland games (in Derbyshire) to open-air concerts and 
air shows, including an aerobatics display by the Red Arrows. 
Employees enjoyed the opportunity to entertain their families in 
5
the workplace at all of our main sites around the world. We also 
sponsored many special events – notably a series of concerts in 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing by the London Symphony 
Orchestra, which, like us, was celebrating its 100th year. 
So it was a year in which the unique character of 
Rolls-Royce was more than usually apparent to all of those who 
work in the Group, a fact we were proud to acknowledge by 
presenting every employee with a copy of a beautifully produced 
book tracing the history of the company’s ﬁrst 100 years. 
As we set out on the next 100, I would like to thank all our 
employees for the huge contribution that they made in 2004.It is	 
only through their dedication and co-operation that the Group 
can look forward to retaining its competitive vigour and delivering 
value to customers and shareholders.

Capture substantial 
aftermarket opportunities 
Add value for our customers through the 
provision of product-related services. 
Our large installed base of engines provides a 
substantial opportunity to add value for our 
customers.More than half of our revenue now 
comes from services and this part 
has been growing by 12 per cent per annum 
compound over the last ﬁve years.  Review of operations
 
Our success in the modern widebody sector,with a 50 per cent 
market share, has been further reinforced by our launch position on 
the Boeing 787.This is important as the aircraft addresses a growing 
sector of the civil market, which we anticipate will require almost 
US$100 billion of new engines in the next 20 years. 
We secured signiﬁcant new risk and revenue sharing 
partnerships on the Trent 1000 programme. In Japan, MHI joined 
KHI, our long-term partner on the Trent programme, between 
them taking a 15 per cent share in the Trent 1000 programme. 
Our strategy to offer innovative long-term services through 
TotalCare and CorporateCare has continued to be successful, 
with £1 billion of contracts signed during the year taking coverage 
to 38 per cent of the ﬂeet.The 500th customer of Aeromanager, 
the e-business portal which provides users access to a broad 
range of aero-engine aftermarket services, was signed up recently. 
In addition, we enhanced our service support infrastructure with 
the Derby 24/7 Operations Room, which went live in March 2004.

The programme had been subject to speculation for some time 
and we had already taken a prudent approach to our modest 
ﬁnancial exposure in our 2004 results. 
Our broad product range provides power for more than 
30 different civil aircraft types, for international airlines, regional 
airlines and corporate operators. 
We strengthened our presence in the civil aero-engine 
industry during 2004, through a combination of strong positions 
on the new aircraft under development (Airbus A380 and 
Boeing 7E7, now renamed the 787) and a growing market share, 
including a market-leading position on modern wide-bodied 
aircraft. Overall we achieved a record market share of 40 per cent 
for orders announced during the year. 
Engine deliveries were higher than originally anticipated, 
at 824, reﬂecting a recovery from the ‘trough’ year in 2003, when we 
delivered 746 engines. We expect continued growth in engine 
£3 ,040m 
deliveries in 2005. 
The corporate jet market showed signs of recovery in 2004. 
We expect this to continue in 2005, whereas the regional market,

The Rolls-Royce civil ﬂeet ﬂying hours increased by 
15 per cent compared to 2003, as a result of a recovery in world 
trafﬁc growth and increased ﬂeet size.The Trent 500 engine 
passed the one million ﬂying hours mark in December.

Our defence business is broadly based, with a strong portfolio 
of products and services covering the key defence aerospace 
market sectors, from combat and trainer to transport, tactical 
aircraft and helicopters. 
In 2004, we continued to expand our services offerings 
and customer base while increasing the ﬂeet of installed engines. 
In the combat market, the order for Tranche 2 of Euroﬁghter 
Typhoon aircraft will mean new engine sales worth more than 
£750 million to Rolls-Royce.The contract covers 519 engines 
for which Rolls-Royce will produce the combustion system, 
high pressure turbine, intermediate casing and other components. 
The Group will also assemble, test and deliver 195 engines for the 
RAF .Work on Tranche 2 engines will start in 2005 and Rolls-Royce 
plans to produce approximately 40 engines a year over the next 
ﬁve years to fulﬁl the RAF order. 
2004 was a momentous year for the F-35 Joint Strike 
Fighter (JSF), F136 engine, in which Rolls-Royce is a 40 per cent 
partner.The engine successfully performed its ﬁrst engine test. 
Soon afterwards we were awarded a US$45 million follow-on 
contract to complete the concept demonstration work on the 
F136, which will compete in a potential international market 
estimated at approximately 5,000 aircraft. 
The Rolls-Royce LiftSystem®, which provides vertical lift for the F-35, 
continued to beat programme requirements. At the beginning of 
the year, the unique LiftFan
TM 
test cell was dedicated in Indianapolis. 
Testing of the whole propulsion system, including the LiftSystem®, 
commenced ahead of schedule and the LiftSystem® performed 
well. Over 1,000 hours of rig and system testing has been 
undertaken since the beginning of the System Development 
and Demonstration phase of the programme. 
These great strides in the Euroﬁghter and JSF programmes 
have helped to maintain our position at the forefront of two of the 
world’s major combat aircraft programmes. 
A further ten Pegasus engines were ordered by the 
 
Spanish and Italian navies to support their Harrier AV-8B aircraft.
 
The transport market, in which Rolls-Royce is the global 
leader, was another area of strength in 2004, particularly in the 
United States.T56 turboprop business remained strong in this 
engine’s 51st year of production and the improved Series IV engine 
secured the Advanced Hawkeye development programme for 
the next generation of that aircraft.The AE 1107C-Liberty engine 
continued to perform well in Operational Assessment testing of the 
V-22 Osprey in severe environments and multiple mission scenarios. 
In the summer, the US Air Force took possession of its ﬁrst AE 2100­
powered C-130J aircraft. In Europe, the preliminary design review of 
the TP400-D6 engine for the Airbus A400M transport aircraft was 
successfully concluded, followed by on-schedule initial testing of 
the ﬁrst engine hardware. 
In the helicopter market, the RTM322 continued to grow in 
orders and power.The selection by Oman of the latest increased 
power version, to power 20 helicopters, increased the number of 
customers who have selected the RTM322 for the NH90 to nine 
out of ten.The ﬁrst production NH90 made its maiden ﬂight in 
May, powered by the RTM322. Civil certiﬁcation of the engine, 
enabling it to be used in non-military helicopters, was also achieved 
in the summer.

The Federal Aviation Administration certiﬁed the T800 engine 
for the Super Lynx 300 helicopter, the ﬁrst of which were formally 
handed over for Thai and Omani customers. First deliveries of the 
MTR390-powered Tiger took place in the second half of the year. 
The company also received a large order for Model 250 engines 
when the US Border Patrol selected the Bell 430 helicopter. 
The Model 250 engine also powered the MD500E to a new 
round-the-world speed record. 
In the tactical aircraft market, four BR710 engines powered 
the Nimrod MRA4 reconnaissance aircraft for its maiden ﬂight 
and ﬁve Rolls-Royce engines – four AE 2100s and one T800 – 
powered the Japanese US1A-Kai ﬂying boat on its ﬁrst ﬂight. 
The AE 3007 continues to demonstrate superb performance 
in Global Hawk, which has now exceeded 4,000 ﬂying hours. 
The AE 3007 also powers the ERJ-145 which has been selected 
for the Aerial Common Sensor programme. 
The provision of services contributed 56 per cent of the 
Group’s defence sales and we continued to service existing contracts 
successfully and win new ones. Over 1,100 military engines and 
1,800 military engine modules are now covered by Mission Ready 
Management Solutions long-term service contracts. 
After achieving record engine availability during the ﬁrst 
year of the Adour support contract for the T-45 US Navy trainer 
aircraft, the following year’s option was exercised early. A similar 
performance-based logistics programme is under way to support 
the AE 2100 powering the US Marine Corps C-130J ﬂeet, providing 
superior availability while controlling costs. 
Rolls-Royce is also supporting a guaranteed level of EJ200 
availability to power the UK Royal Air Force’s initial Typhoon training 
operations. With more than 1,100 hours ﬂown, the programme is 
exceeding contractual requirements. In addition, we have extended 
existing availability-based contracts for modules for the RB199s 
in Tornado aircraft, as well as winning new business to support 
Pegasus modules in the Harrier. 
2004 has been a notable year across all of our market 
sectors and our balanced portfolio enables us to look forward 
to the future with well-founded conﬁdence.

* restated following the transfer of the diesel business from energy to mar ne. 
It has been a year of steady progress for the marine business with 
growth in naval markets and a recovering commercial sector. 
In the naval market sector, our MT30 gas turbine 
programme continues to gather momentum. Lockheed Martin 
selected the engine for the ﬁrst prototype in the US Navy’s Littoral 
Combat Ship (LCS) programme.This new coastal defence vessel 
will also be powered by Rolls-Royce Kamewa waterjets. 
The MT30, which is the world’s most powerful marine gas 
turbine, achieved further milestones during the year by earning 
full naval and commercial certiﬁcation.The engine completed 
both the endurance test running for American Bureau of Shipping 
certiﬁcation and gained DNV (Det Norske Veritas) design approval. 
The MT30 programme reﬂects a core Rolls-Royce 
philosophy, which is to invest in technology once and then 
reap the rewards across our different market sectors.The engine 
has 80 per cent commonality with the Trent 800 aero engine, 
developed for the Boeing 777. 
The ﬁrst MT30 to be delivered was handed over to 
Northrop Grumman in early 2004 as part of the land-based 
demonstrator for the US Navy’s DD(X) destroyer programme. 
Rolls-Royce is therefore well positioned on both DD(X) and 
LCS programmes when they move into full production. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 20  The two largest warships ever to be built for the Royal Navy will 
be powered by the MT30.The engine has been nominated for the 
two aircraft carriers (CVF) and interest has also been expressed for 
the next generation of French aircraft carrier – the P A2. 
Our submarine business accounted for 54 per cent of our 
naval sales. Our manufacture and support of nuclear propulsion 
systems for the UK’s submarine ﬂeet stretches back to the 1960s 
and our expertise and technology is acknowledged as being 
world-class. 
This success moved onto a new level during the year when 
Rolls-Royce was awarded the NATO Submarine Rescue System 
contract by the UK Ministry of Defence, acting on behalf of the 
UK, France and Norway.The contract recognises our ability to act 
as project manager for the design, build and support of the new 
system over a ten-year period.The system will also be equipped 
with the revolutionary Rolls-Royce sodium/nickel chloride ZEBRA 
batteries, which have almost twice the energy density, in a reduced 
volume, compared to traditional lead/acid installations. 
During 2004 our commercial business supplied the largest 
waterjets ever made for the Japanese Techno-Superliner ferry, 
which will begin operations this year on 16-hour voyages between 
Tokyo and Ogasawara-Gunso.The waterjets will help propel the 
140m long, aluminium ferries at a service speed of 38 knots. 
The offshore market recovered strongly in the second half of 
2004, when we announced ﬁrm orders worth £166 million to supply 
design and equipment packages for service and support vessels in 
the offshore oil & gas industry. Demonstrating our ability to supply 
complete systems, we are designing and will help equip 26 new 
support vessels, based on our UT-Design. Nearly 500 of these 
ships are in service or are on order since their introduction in the 
mid-1970s.They showcase our ability to integrate design, control, 
automation and propulsion equipment into a single package. 
We are enhancing our sales opportunities by taking offshore 
technology into new markets.We have diversiﬁed into the coastguard 
sector by supplying coastal protection vessel design and equipment 
packages to France and Norway and pollution control variants to 
India, all based on the UT-Design. 
In what we believe may herald a new growth market for us, 
ABG Shipyard, the largest private yard in India selected Rolls-Royce 
to design and provide equipment for three Indian coastguard ships 
which will prepare them for potential environmental crises such 
as oil spills.The 3,300 tonne ships will be equipped with a range 
of Rolls-Royce propulsion, steering and motion control equipment 
with the ﬁrst due for delivery in 2006. 
Another new technology we launched in 2004 was the 
Azipull thruster which is being ﬁtted to inshore tankers and some 
UT-Designs.The new thrusters allow higher speeds and more 
stable running than traditional propulsors and can create extra 
space on ships. 
Revenues from aftermarket business or service streams have 
continued to grow. In 2004, the marine business made around 
41 per cent of its sales from services.This market is growing as more 
navies acquire gas turbine technology. During the year we provided 
refurbished gas turbines for two ex-Royal Navy Type 22 frigates 
entering service with the Romanian Navy. Orders were also signed 
with the Chilean Navy to service gas turbines for the next 20 years 
on ﬁve new ships in its ﬂeet. A key element of Chile’s transformation 
of its ﬂeet to gas turbine technology. In commercial markets, 
where the service business has not been as large in relation to 
manufacturing, a signiﬁcant growth opportunity exists and we 
are looking at ways of developing this further. 
Much of the world’s shipbuilding now takes place in 
Asia and our structures reﬂect this regional shift.We gained orders 
from the Republic of Korea Navy for nine AG9140RF gas turbine 
generator sets, which will be supplied to the Republic’s KDX III 
destroyer programme in partnership with Samsung.We are also 
providing propellers and associated equipment and services for 
the same ships in conjunction with Doosan Heavy Industries. 
Such agreements are part of the Rolls-Royce strategy for growing 
its marine business in North East Asia. 
In 2005 we are opening a factory in Shanghai, to manufacture 
marine equipment. We have a similar operation in Korea. Our goal 
is to be closer to our customers and position the business to reﬂect 
the emerging global shipbuilding markets while retaining core 
technical skills in the UK, North America and the Nordic countries.

* restated following the transfer of the diesel business from energy to mar ne. 
The gas turbine is at the heart of our business, and we stay focused 
on this core competency in all that we do; from new product 
development to sales and marketing; to manufacturing and 
assembly; to aftermarket services. We continue to look for every 
opportunity to leverage Rolls-Royce technology in energy markets. 
We strive to be world class in the execution of our 
business by differentiating ourselves from our competition through 
consistent, dependable, reliable and responsive customer service, 
from pre-order to post-installation. 
In 2004 we continued to develop a solid foundation for 
sustained proﬁtability and growth. 
In oil & gas, the RB211 was the clear market leader for aero-derived 
industrial gas turbines in its size range. We also launched the 
industrial Trent gas turbine into the oil & gas market with orders 
for six industrial Trent gas compression packages for the Dolphin 
Energy Limited gas pipeline in the Middle East.The industrial Trent 
is the ﬁrst aero-derived gas turbine in its class to be selected for a 
major gas compression application. In addition, we commenced 
shipment and achieved successful start-up of the ﬁrst RB211-driven 
compressor packages for the West-East China Pipeline Project, 
and we remain on schedule for delivery of all 20 packages ordered 
for this important project. 
In customer service,we continued to respond to the 
growing customer trend for long-term service agreements. 
2004 was a record year with over US$160 million booked in 
new contracts. We received the 2004 ‘Great Operator’ award from 
BP , having signiﬁcantly improved the product performance on its 
Bruce platform in the North Sea. 
As we predicted, the worldwide power generation market 
remained sluggish in 2004.We continued to use this period to 
restructure our power generation business and enhance new 
product development to take advantage of the expected market 
recovery. Both Dry Low Emissions (DLE) and Wet Low Emissions 
(WLE) versions of the industrial Trent are now available for sale, 
and are accumulating thousands of operating hours each month. 
Gas turbines are the technology of choice in this market, and the 
industrial Trent is the most powerful and efﬁcient aero-derived 
gas turbine in its class. 
We completed a new cost-competitive Trent package that 
provides our customers with a world-class design for installation 
and maintainability.This new package is applicable to both power 
generation and oil & gas units, and is being embodied in the Trent 
units provided for the Dolphin Energy Limited gas pipeline. 
Our expansion of the geographic footprint of our installed 
base in the oil & gas sector continued with signiﬁcant orders from 
customers in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, West Africa and Brazil. 
We received orders for eight RB211 packages for the third 
and ﬁnal phase of the BP Azeri project, offshore Azerbaijan, in the 
Caspian Sea.This has taken our total orders from BP over the last 
three years for this project to 28 RB211 packages. Our goal of 
entering the offshore Kazakhstan market, also in the Caspian region, 
was realised with orders for four RB211 generating sets that will be 
installed on a barge to provide power to adjacent offshore facilities. 
Five additional RB211 packages were ordered for offshore West 
Africa, making nearly 20 packages ordered for offshore service there 
in recent years. Brazil remains a key market area and we received 
orders for seven additional offshore RB211 packages in 2004 from 
Petrobras, who have now ordered a total of 19 units for their 
offshore service operations. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 22  As we expand into new market regions of the world, we also 
recognise our responsibility to establish the critical infrastructures 
required to support our customer installations.We are developing 
facilities to support operations in the Caspian region, Brazil and 
China, and are considering further opportunities in West Africa 
and other regions of the world. 
2004 also saw signiﬁcant change in our manufacturing
 
facilities as we transformed our operations into an organisation 
 
that can more responsively meet the needs of our customers,
 
and ultimately, enhance our proﬁtability.
 
In 2004, we increased investment in our fuel cell 
technology. Earlier this year we established a joint venture with a 
consortium of companies in Asia as a further step in the process of 
bringing to market our solid-oxide fuel cell technology.The Asian 
group has bought a 25 per cent share in Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell 
Systems and will contribute both ﬁnancial and technical resources 
to this development programme. 
For 2005, our priorities remain focused on increasing our 
return on sales and continuing to position the business for healthy 
growth. We will achieve these goals by maintaining our leadership 
position in oil & gas, building a strong, complementary global 
power generation business, particularly for the industrial Trent 
engine, and further improving operational excellence. Above all, 
we will seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition with 
a focus on customer service that continues to enhance customer 
value and provide our business with signiﬁcant returns.

Research and development is key to the success of the Group. 
Last year we invested a total of £601 million in research and 
development and prepared 250 patent applications. Our aim is 
to maximise the beneﬁt of this investment by creating technology 
and methods once, but using them in many parts of our business. 
We address the whole product life cycle, from applied 
research in new materials, manufacturing methods, analytical tools 
and design concepts to the development of new products and the 
management of their operational lives through the development 
of our service capabilities. 
We have continued to expand our external research 
network.The opening of the new University Technology Centres 
(UTCs) at Genoa and the University of Manchester in the exciting 
new technology ﬁelds of fuel cells and electrical systems in extreme 
environments, respectively, were examples of this.The technology 
demonstration programme for our special solid-oxide fuel cell 
concept continued to make good progress.The ﬁrst tests at 
temperature and pressure of a cell sub-system fully conﬁrmed the 
anticipated high efﬁciency levels that will be unique to our design. 
An Advanced Technology Centre has been created in 
Singapore to investigate a number of research ﬁelds including 
advanced low cost manufacturing methods, new materials, 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 23  Review of operations continued 
Focused investment in technology continued 
particularly related to fuel cells, and high performance computing, 
particularly related to advanced computational ﬂuid dynamics which 
is applied to aerospace, energy and marine product programmes. 
Good progress has been made on the JSF propulsion system 
programmes.The ﬁrst full engine test of the integrated F135 LiftSystem® 
took place on schedule. The unique LiftFan
TM
,which provides vertical 
lift for the F-35 (JSF), has wide-chord fan blade technology, derived 
from our large civil engine programme. Advanced analysis developed 
by our University Technology Centre (UTC) at Imperial College was 
used to ensure the blades could operate efﬁciently and reliably in 
the harsh aerodynamic environment demanded by JSF . The alternate 
engine for the JSF is the joint GE/Rolls-Royce F136 and the demonstrator 
had a successful ﬁrst run. 
The Trent family has continued to progress with the ﬁrst 
ﬂight and on-time engine certiﬁcation of the Trent 900 for the Airbus 
A380 aircraft and the launch of the Trent 1000 for the Boeing 787 
Dreamliner.We believe that cost effective, high performance engines 
are produced best by building on the proven design of the Trent 
family and inserting new technology when appropriate to this reliable 
base. Both engines have the advanced technology swept fan blades 
developed for minimal environmental noise impact using new 
analytical techniques from our Noise UTC at Southampton University. 
The Trent 1000 will feature a unique power off-take system 
for improved fuel efﬁciency, which is being designed with support 
from the Transmissions UTC at Nottingham University.The Trent 900 
and Trent 1000 will feature advanced condition monitoring systems 
and improved materials and designs to further improve the life 
and reliability of the Trent family and to give cost effective service 
to our customers. 
Our strategy of invent once and use many times is typiﬁed 
by the adaptation of the Trent 800 for the marine and energy markets. 
The marine variant, the MT30, has achieved certiﬁcation and 
installation design work is well advanced for the US Navy DD(X) 
Destroyer and Littoral Combat Ship demonstrator programmes. 
The energy variant, the industrial Trent 60, has achieved qualiﬁcation 
for mechanical drive applications and will be delivered in 2005 for 
the Dolphin Energy Limited gas pipeline. Each variant requires a 
combustion system speciﬁc to that market but we use common 
tools and materials to design combustors for each application. 
The industrial Trent 60 utilises the advanced low emissions design 
essential for the energy sector and incorporates a low vibration-
damping concept which was created by the Combustion UTC at 
Cambridge University.This same concept is being applied to the 
development of a new, environmentally friendly, low emission 
combustor for future engines for civil aircraft. 
We will continue to pursue advances in technology, 
processes, products and services through focused investment in 
research and development using the exceptional and extensive skills 
within our own workforce and by collaboration with universities, 
partners, suppliers and customers.

Highlights of the year 
Gross operating margins improved from 17.4 per cent to 19 per cent. 
Product cost reduction continued successfully. 
Product quality improved signiﬁcantly. 
Agreements reached on Modern Working Practices at all UK sites. 
IT costs signiﬁcantly lowered whilst service levels improved. 
Work ng capital utilisation improved. 
We entered the year with plans that anticipated 2004 being 
the ‘trough year’ in this civil aerospace cycle. By the end of the ﬁrst 
quarter it was apparent that market conditions had improved and 
we could expect growth to resume. By the end of 2004 production 
load in aggregate was running at some 20 per cent above the rate 
at the end of 2003. In consequence restructuring expenses were 
lower than planned and there was substantial productivity 
improvement, which allowed the load increase to be delivered 
without increasing the workforce in Operations. 
Local load/capacity imbalances produced a degree of 
disruption to deliveries but our workforce and our supply chain 
again demonstrated considerable commitment in seeking to 
overcome this and I take this opportunity to compliment them 
for their efforts. 
In 2004 we continued to make progress in the restructuring 
of our supply chain. We further reduced our supplier base by 
seven per cent to 711 after adding one new supplier. Our sourcing 
in emerging, low cost markets increased from four per cent to 
six per cent of purchases. 
Our drive to lower operating costs persisted in 2004 against 
a background of rising volume. Both our factories and our supply 
chain were able to deliver the planned ﬁve per cent year-on-year 
product cost reduction. Increased overtime costs and some 
primary materials cost increases were more than offset by higher 
productivity, better quality and improved ﬁxed cost absorption. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 24  We reached agreement on the implementation of Modern Working 
Practices with our UK workforces at our sites in Derby, Hucknall, 
Barnoldswick and Bristol.This formed an essential part of the business 
cases for new factories in these locations. Construction work has 
commenced in all locations except Bristol where planning 
permission is pending. 
Discussions on Modern Working Practices have opened 
in a number of other Rolls-Royce locations around the world. 
Agreement has been reached with all of our workforces for 
the implementation of a Global Works Council which will be put in 
place in early 2006 to cover both represented and unrepresented 
Rolls-Royce employees globally. 
We launched a culture change programme under the 
banner of ‘Process Excellence’ aimed at developing a culture of 
systematic, continuous improvement, targeting world-class quality 
performance for both operational and transactional processes. 
In 2004 we achieved a signiﬁcant improvement in product related 
quality with parts-per-million (ppm) defect rates halving to close 
at approximately 1,000 ppm for our whole supply chain. 
In conjunction with our IT supply chain and our principal 
outsourcing partner, EDS, we achieved substantial operating cost 
reduction for our IT estate.This resulted from a multi-year initiative 
driving standardisation, productivity and improved service levels. 
Our lean manufacturing initiatives coupled with a speciﬁc 
focus on non-cash working capital resulted in further improvement 
to working capital utilisation from 6.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent of sales. 
In 2005 our priorities will be to persist with our lean 
manufacturing and Process Excellence initiatives, continue to drive 
product cost reduction, build our new UK factory infrastructure 
and manage the anticipated continuing growth in load. 
Services 
Miles Cowdry 
Director – Services 
The aftermarket created by the 54,000 engines we have in service 
around the world offers a signiﬁcant opportunity to Rolls-Royce 
and represents about 55 per cent of our total business. 
Increasingly we are addressing this opportunity by 
taking responsibility for the management of the maintenance 
and associated logistics for our engines and systems, monitoring 
the equipment in service to deliver the system availability our 
customers require with predictable costs. Our strategy is to align 
our interests with those of our customers.This gives us an incentive 
to improve the reliability and extend the service intervals of our 
products, increasing our customers’ revenue earning potential 
and the operational effectiveness. 
Our approach continues to ﬁnd acceptance in the marketplace 
in each of the sectors in which we operate.TotalCare and 
CorporateCare business worth £1 billion was contracted in 2004, 
building on the success of previous years. A total of 4,300 civil 
engines are now under management. 
We have also seen notable contract awards in other sectors 
of our business.The Royal Air Force has agreed a £65 million contract 
extension for the Spey engine which powers the Nimrod maritime 
reconnaissance aircraft.This is a follow-on from the successful initial 
contract in which all the key targets were met. Similarly, the US 
Department of Defense awarded Rolls-Royce a US$60 million 
Power By The Hour® contract for the F405-RR-401 (Adour) engines 
that power the US Navy’s T-45 training aircraft.This logistic support 
contract was developed in line with civil aerospace agreements 
demonstrating the value to be gained from applying commercial 
best practice. It is an excellent example of how Rolls-Royce is 
partnering with its customers and suppliers to provide customised 
solutions, expanding further the Group’s range of services. 
In the marine sector, the Chilean Navy awarded a 20 year 
support contract for ﬁve gas turbine powered ships and in the 
energy sector the Long-Term Service Agreement portfolio has 
continued to grow with contracts covering £260 million of equipment. 
We have a record of innovation in the service arena, 
including early entry into the engine leasing business and 
sophisticated remote diagnostic and data management services 
through our joint venture Data Systems & Solutions. This business 
now monitors over 4,000 gas turbines on behalf of Rolls-Royce 
and its customers.We have continued to innovate during 2004 
and have brought our ‘Operations Room’ on-line as the hub for 
managing our TotalCare contracts.We have expanded our offerings, 
particularly with respect to the management of customer inventories 
and ﬁeld maintenance, through our Component Care and On-Wing 
Care services. 
In response to market demand we are increasing and 
improving our repair and overhaul capacity. £45 million is to be 
invested in a new state-of-the-art overhaul facility in East Kilbride, 
replacing the old facility.This new factory will be completed in 2006 
and will enable signiﬁcant productivity improvements. We also 
announced that the location of our N3 joint venture with Lufthansa 
Technik will be on a site near Erfurt in Thuringia, Germany.The 
facility will provide technical support and overhaul services for the 
Trent 500, 700 and 900 engines which power the Airbus A340-500/ 
-600, A330 and A380 aircraft respectively.

Increase in underlying proﬁt before tax 
over 2003 
We made good progress in 2004. Better market conditions, growing 
services sales and increased efﬁciency all contributed to our 
improved ﬁnancial performance. 
Results for the year 
Underlying proﬁt before tax* increased by 21 per cent to £345 million 
(2003 £285 million), and underlying earnings per share* were 14.50p 
(2003 12.20p). Basic earnings per share were 12.07p (2003 7.04p). 
Sales increased by £294 million 
Sales increased by ﬁve per cent, despite an adverse foreign currency 
translation impact of some £200 million. 
– 	 Civil aerospace engine deliveries increased by ten per cent 
to 824 engines. Civil aftermarket sales grew by 25 per cent. 
– 	 Defence aerospace turnover was stable, with a small 
increase in services revenues offsetting a slight reduction 
in original equipment sales. 
– 	 Marine sales were down four per cent. Sales in the offshore 
oil & gas support market sector were weaker than in 2003. 
However, order intake recovered somewhat in the second 
half of the year. 
– 	 Energy sales were ﬂat, with sales in the oil & gas 
sector offsetting the effects of the depressed power 
generation market. 
Group aftermarket services revenues grew by 14 per cent to 
£3.2 billion and accounted for 55 per cent of total revenues. 
Aftermarket revenues have grown by 12 per cent compound 
over the last ﬁve years. 
Eighty ﬁve per cent of sales were to customers outside 
the UK. 
Gross margin, before exceptional items, increased from 
17.4 per cent to 19 per cent. Margins beneﬁted from some 
improvement in market conditions, continuing growth in services 
sales and our focus on cost reduction. 
The net interest charge reduced from £90 million to 
£70 million.This reﬂected a reduction in the level of average net 
debt, which was achieved through the Group’s improving level 
of proﬁtability and its focus on cash management. 
Group interest was covered 7.6 times (2003 4.9 times), 
based upon underlying proﬁt before interest, excluding joint 
ventures. 
Restructuring charges of £37 million (2003 £10 million), 
which were incurred for ongoing operational improvements, 
were included within operating costs. 
The Group made an underlying proﬁt before tax of 
£345 million (2003 £285 million). After charging non-trading items, 
proﬁt before tax was £306 million (2003 £180 million). 
Net working capital as a percentage of sales was 6.4 per cent 
(2003 6.8 per cent), despite some creation of inventory ahead of the 
introduction of new manufacturing facilities. 
* excluding exceptional and non-trading items, deﬁned in note 2 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 26  A ﬁnal payment to shareholders of 5.00p is proposed making a total 
of 8.18p per ordinary share (2003 8.18p).The Company will continue 
to issue B Shares in place of dividends in order to accelerate the 
recovery of its advance corporation tax. 
Order book 
The order book, at constant exchange rates, was £18.9 billion 
(2003 £17.4 billion). Items are included in the order book when 
a ﬁrm, signed contract exists. 
In civil aerospace it is common for a customer to take options 
for future orders in addition to ﬁrm orders placed. Such options are 
excluded from the order book until they become ﬁrm, signed orders. 
In defence aerospace, long-term programmes are often 
ordered for only one year at a time. In such circumstances, even 
though there may be no alternative engine choice available to the 
customer, only the contracted business is included in the order book. 
Long-term service agreements, including TotalCare 
packages for aftermarket services, represented 39 per cent of 
the order book.These are long-term contracts where only the 
ﬁrst seven years’ revenue is included in the order book. 
Business which has been announced but for which 
contracts have not yet been signed is excluded from the order 
book.This amounted to a further £2.4 billion at the year end 
(2003 £1.3 billion). 
Aftermarket services 
The Group continues to be successful in developing its aftermarket 
services activities.These accounted for 55 per cent of turnover in 2004. 
In particular,TotalCare packages in the civil aerospace sector 
now cover 38 per cent of the installed ﬂeet.TotalCare packages cover 
long-term management of the maintenance and associated logistics 
for our engines and systems, monitoring the equipment in service to 
deliver the system availability our customers require with predictable 
costs.The pricing of such contracts reﬂects their long-term nature. 
Proﬁt is taken progressively on a prudent basis resulting in a net asset 
of £389 million (2003 £454 million) on the balance sheet. 
Cash 
The Group cash ﬂow statement is shown on pages 54 and 55 of 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
Net debt for the year reduced by £243 million to £80 million 
(2003 £323 million).The average net debt level reduced from 
£950 million to £560 million. 
The average net debt is expected to reduce further in 2005. 
Net cash ﬂow from operating activities was £640 million 
(2003 £673 million). Net capital expenditure used £219 million 
(2003 £198 million) of funds generated. 
Taxation 
The overall tax charge on the proﬁt before tax was £101 million 
(2003 £64 million), a rate of 33 per cent (2003 36 per cent). 
The tax charge was reduced by £13 million (2003 £12 million) 
in respect of the expected beneﬁt of the UK research and development 
tax credit that was introduced with effect from April 1, 2002. 
The tax charge on underlying proﬁts was £99 million 
(2003 £84 million), a rate of 29 per cent (2003 29 per cent). 
Acquisitions and disposals 
During the year the Group disposed of Rolls-Royce Gear Systems 
Inc. to Triumph Group Inc., resulting in a small proﬁt that has been 
treated as a non-trading item (see note 31). 
Pensions 
For 2004, the charges for pensions costs continue to be calculated 
under SSAP 24 and are disclosed in note 30. Although the full 
implementation of FRS 17 (Post-Retirement Beneﬁts) has been 
deferred pending the introduction of International Financial 
Reporting Standards, certain disclosures are required, including the 
value of pension scheme assets and liabilities using the new rules 
speciﬁed by FRS 17 (see note 30). Under this standard a snapshot 
is taken of pension fund assets and liabilities at a speciﬁc point in 
time, thus movements in equity markets and discount rates will 
create volatility in their calculation. Additionally FRS 17 requires 
a memorandum analysis of the proﬁt and loss charge. 
On this basis and after taking account of deferred taxation, 
there was a net shortfall of assets over liabilities for the UK Schemes 
of £805 million (2003 £855 million).This deﬁcit is subject to prevailing 
equity markets and discount rates. 
During the year the Vickers Group Pension Scheme and 
the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme were subject to actuarial 
review.Together these two funds are around one third the size 
of the principal Rolls-Royce Pension Fund, for which the actuarial 
review was completed in 2003. 
Investments 
The Group continues to subject all investments to rigorous 
examination of risks and future cash ﬂows to ensure that they create 
shareholder value. All major investments require Board approval. 
The Group has a portfolio of projects at different stages 
of their life cycles. Discounted cash ﬂow analysis of the remaining 
life of projects is performed on a regular basis. Sales of engines in 
production are assessed against criteria in the original development 
programme to ensure that overall value is enhanced. 
Gross research and development investment amounted 
to £601 million (2003 £619 million). Net research and development 
was £282 million (2003 £281 million). Net research and 
development investment is expected to remain roughly at the 
same percentage of sales in the future. Investment in training 
was £30 million (2003 £29 million). 
Net capital expenditure, was £219 million (2003 
£198 million) and is expected to be a little ahead of depreciation 
of £223 million over the next few years. 
Partnerships 
The development of effective partnerships continues to be a key 
feature of the Group’s long-term strategy. Major partnerships are 
of two types: joint ventures and Risk and Revenue Sharing Partners. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 27  Finance Director’s review continued 
Andrew Shilston 
Joint ventures 
Joint ventures are an integral part of our business.They are also normal 
business structures for companies participating in international, 
collaborative defence projects.They are involved in engineering 
and manufacturing, repair and overhaul, and ﬁnancial services. 
They share risk and investment, bring expertise and access to 
markets, and provide external objectivity. Some of our joint ventures 
have become substantial businesses. A major proportion of the 
debt of the joint ventures is secured on the assets of the respective 
companies and is non-recourse to the Group.The net recourse 
ﬁnancing obligations total £12 million and are included in contingent 
liabilities (see note 28). 
Pembroke, the Group’s aircraft leasing and management joint 
venture is not regarded as core to the Group’s strategy and, as markets 
permit, the Group will be seeking to extract value from this business. 
Investment in the engine leasing joint venture, Rolls-Royce 
& Partners Finance, a core business activity, amounts to £21 million 
and all of its debt is non-recourse to the Group. 
Risk and Revenue Sharing Partners (RRSPs) 
RRSPs have enabled the Group to build a broad portfolio of engines, 
thereby reducing the exposure of the business to individual product 
risk.The primary ﬁnancial beneﬁt is a reduction of the burden of 
research and development (R&D) expenditure on new programmes. 
The related R&D expenditure is expensed through the proﬁt and 
loss account and the receipts from partners are also recorded in 
the proﬁt and loss account, as other operating income. 
RRSP agreements are a standard form of co-operation in 
the civil aero-engine industry.They bring beneﬁts to the engine 
manufacturer and the partner. Speciﬁcally for the manufacturer 
they bring some or all of the following beneﬁts: additional ﬁnancial 
and engineering resource; sharing of risk; and initial programme 
investment contribution. As appropriate, the partner also supplies 
components and in consideration receives a share of the long-term 
revenues generated by the engine programme in proportion to its 
purchased programme share. 
The sharing of risk is fundamental to RRSP agreements. 
In general, partners share ﬁnancial investment in the programme; 
they share market risk as they receive their return from future sales; 
they share currency risk as their returns are denominated in US 
dollars; they share sales ﬁnancing obligations; they share warranty 
costs; and, where they are manufacturing or development partners, 
they share technical and cost risk. 
In 2004, the Group secured new partners for the 
Trent 1000 engine programme. However, as the number of new 
programmes has reduced and in particular as Government launch 
investment was not sought for the Trent 1000 programme, receipts 
from partners have declined. In 2004, other operating income in respect 
of RRSP agreements amounted to £73 million (2003 £153 million) 
and is expected to be at a similar level in 2005. 
Payments to RRSP partners are recorded within cost 
of sales and increase as the related programme sales increase. 
These payments amounted to £240 million (2003 £179 million). 
Intangible assets 
The Group carried forward £911 million (2003 £863 million) 
of intangible assets. This comprised purchased goodwill of 
£712 million, engine certiﬁcation costs and participation fees of 
£145 million and application engineering costs of £54 million. 
Risk management 
The Board has an established, structured approach to risk 
management.The risk committee (see report of the directors) has 
accountability for the system of risk management and reporting 
the key risks and associated mitigating actions.The Director of Risk 
reports to the Finance Director.The Group’s policy is to preserve 
the resources upon which its continuing reputation, viability and 
proﬁtability are built, in order to enable the corporate objectives 
to be achieved through the operation of the Rolls-Royce business 
processes. Risks are formally identiﬁed and recorded in a corporate 
risk register, which is reviewed and updated on a regular basis, 
with risk mitigation plans identiﬁed for all signiﬁcant risks. 
Financial risk 
The Group uses various ﬁnancial instruments in order to manage 
the exposures that arise from its business operations as a result of 
movements in ﬁnancial markets. All treasury activities are focused 
on the management and hedging of risk. It is the Group’s policy not 
to trade ﬁnancial instruments or to engage in speculative ﬁnancial 
transactions.There have been no signiﬁcant changes in the Group’s 
policies in the last year. 
The principal economic and market risks continue to 
be movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates 
and commodity prices.The Board regularly reviews the Group’s 
exposures and ﬁnancial risk management and a specialist 
committee also considers these in detail. All such exposures are 
managed by the Group Treasury function, which reports to the 
Finance Director and which operates within written policies 
approved by the Board and within the internal control framework 
described in the report of the directors. 
The Group’s policy is to monitor and manage its exposure 
to counterparties. Credit limits are set to cover all ﬁnancial 
instruments for each counterparty.The Group’s policy is that where 
exposure is only linked to the credit quality of the counterparty, 
the related long-term credit rating should be A3/A or better. 
Funding and liquidity 
The Group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of shareholders’ 
funds, bank borrowings, bonds, notes and ﬁnance leases.The Group 
borrows in the major global markets in a range of currencies. 
It employs derivatives where appropriate to generate the desired 
currency and interest rate proﬁle. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 28  The Group performed some reﬁnancing activity during 2004 to 
extend its debt maturity proﬁle and to reduce future reﬁnancing 
risk.The Group successfully raised £500 million following the 
issuance of a seven year a750 million public bond under its Euro 
Medium Term Note programme.The proceeds were used to 
replace a number of maturing borrowing facilities or to retire 
other borrowing facilities early.The Group also reduced the size of 
its main £750 million revolving credit facility to £250 million and 
extended its maturity proﬁle from 2007 to 2009. As at December 31, 
2004 the Group had total committed borrowing facilities of 
£1.8 billion (2003 £2.2 billion). 
The terms for the recently completed reﬁnancings are 
substantially similar to the Group’s previous facilities. 
There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Group’s 
facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any 
facility for a given movement in the Group’s credit rating and no 
material impact on the Group’s interest charge is expected to arise 
from a movement in the Group’s credit rating. 
The Group holds ﬁnancial investments and maintains 
undrawn committed facilities at a level sufﬁcient to ensure the 
Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and 
funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and 
opportunities.The Group from time to time holds cash and short-
term investments which, together with the undrawn committed 
facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk. 
The Group continues to have access to all the major 
global debt markets. 
Credit rating 
The Group subscribes to both Moody’s Investor Services and 
Standard & Poors for its ofﬁcial publicised credit ratings. As at 
December 31 , 2004 the Group’s assigned long-term credit ratings 
were: 
Rating Agency Rating Outlook Category 
Moody’s Baa1 Negative Investment grade 
Standard & Poors BBB Positive Investment grade 
The Group attaches signiﬁcant importance to maintaining an 
investment grade credit rating, which it views as necessary for 
the business to operate effectively. 
The Group’s medium term objective is to achieve, 
through the normal course of business, an ‘A’ category investment 
grade credit rating from both agencies. 
Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates for both 
foreign currency transactions and the translation of net assets 
and proﬁt and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries. 
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary 
companies as long-term investments.The Group has tended to 
manage its translational exposures through the currency matching 
of assets and liabilities where applicable. Any mis-match is kept 
under regular review for materiality and subsequent decisions 
regarding risk mitigation. 
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies.The most 
signiﬁcant transactional currency exposure is the US dollar followed 
by the Euro. US dollar income, net of expenditure represented 
26 per cent of Group turnover in 2004 (2003 23 per cent). 
The Group operates a hedging policy using a variety of 
ﬁnancial instruments with the objective of minimising the impact of 
ﬂuctuations in exchange rates on future transactions and cash ﬂows. 
The permitted range of the amount of cover taken is 
determined by the written policies set by the Board, based on 
known and forecast income levels.The forward cover is managed 
within the parameters of these policies in order to achieve the 
Group’s objectives, having regard to the Group’s view of long-term 
exchange rates. Forward cover is in the form of standard foreign 
exchange contracts and instruments on which the exchange rates 
achieved are dependent on future interest rates.The Group also 
writes currency options against a portion of the unhedged dollar 
income at a rate which is consistent with the Group’s long-term 
target rate.The premium received from the sale of the options 
is included in the Group’s achieved exchange rate. At the end of 
2004 the Group had approximately US$9 billion of forward cover 
(2003 US$10 billion). 
The consequence of this policy has been to maintain 
relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates. Note 24, ﬁnancial 
instruments, includes the impact of revaluing forward currency 
contracts at market values on December 31, 2004, showing a 
value of £986 million (2003 £724 million) which will ﬂuctuate 
with exchange rates over time.The Group has entered into these 
forward contracts as part of the hedging policy, described above, 
in order to mitigate the impact of volatile exchange rates. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group uses ﬁxed rate bonds and ﬂoating rate debt as funding 
sources.The Group’s policy is to maintain a higher proportion of 
net debt at ﬁxed rates of interest having regard to the prevailing 
interest rate outlook.To implement this policy the Group utilises a 
combination of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and 
interest caps to manage the exposure. 
Commodity risk 
The Group has an ongoing exposure to the price of jet fuel and 
base metals arising from business operations.The Group’s objective 
is to minimise the impact of price ﬂuctuations.The exposure is 
hedged in accordance with parameters contained in a written 
policy set by the Board. 
Sales ﬁnancing 
In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on some 
occasions, provide ﬁnancing support for its customers.This may 
involve the Group guaranteeing ﬁnancing for customers, providing 
asset value guarantees on aircraft for a proportion of their expected 
future value, or entering into leasing transactions. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 29  Finance Director’s review continued 
Andrew Shilston 
The Group manages and monitors its sales ﬁnance related 
exposures to customers and products within written policies 
approved by the Board and within the internal framework 
described in the report of the directors.The permitted levels of 
gross and net exposure are limited in aggregate, by counterparty, 
by product type and by calendar year. 
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s sales ﬁnance 
related exposures and risk management activities. Each ﬁnancing 
commitment is subject to a credit and asset review process and 
prior approval by the Chief Executive and the Finance Director. 
The Group operates a sophisticated risk-pricing model to assess 
risk and exposure. Costs and exposures associated with providing 
ﬁnancing support are incorporated in any decision to secure 
new business. 
The Group seeks to minimise the level of exposure from 
sales ﬁnance commitments by: 
–	 the use of third party non-recourse debt where 
appropriate; 
–	 the transfer, sale, or re-insurance of risks; and 
–		e nsuring the proportionate ﬂow down of risk and 
exposure to relevant RRSPs. 
Each of the above forms an active part of the Group’s exposure 
management process. 
Where exposures arise, the strategy has been, and 
continues to be, to assume where possible liquid forms of ﬁnancing 
commitment that may be sold or transferred to third parties when 
the opportunity arises. 
Contingent liabilities 
Note 28 to the accounts describes the Group’s contingent 
liabilities under sales ﬁnancing arrangements. 
The gross contingent liability reduced to £999 million 
(2003 £1,090 million), of which £12 million (2003 £39 million) related 
to sales ﬁnancing support provided to joint ventures.The gross 
contingent liability ﬁgure is calculated by aggregating the 
maximum exposure on all such sales ﬁnancing commitments, 
before applying the value of the underlying security, but offsetting 
sums separately insured and sums provided for in the balance 
sheet. In 2004 provisions against customer ﬁnancing exposures 
were increased by £51 million and £27 million of existing provisions 
were utilised. Provisions of £116 million were carried forward in 
respect of sales ﬁnancing commitments (see note 22). 
The Group’s contingent liabilities are divided approximately 
60:40 between asset value guarantees (AVGs) and credit guarantees. 
They are spread over many years and relate to a number of 
customers and a broad product portfolio.The contingent liabilities 
represent the maximum aggregate gross and net exposure that the 
Group has in respect of delivered aircraft, regardless of the point in 
time at which such exposures may arise. Exposures are not reduced 
to a net present value for the purposes of reporting the Group’s 
contingent liabilities. 
The Group uses Airclaims Limited as an independent appraiser 
to value its security portfolio at both the half-year and year-end. 
Airclaims provides speciﬁc values (both current and forecast future 
values) for each asset in the security portfolio.These values are then 
used to assess the Group’s net exposure. 
After taking account of the underlying security, the Group’s 
net contingent liability increased slightly to £189 million (2003 
£184 million).The year on year movement in reported contingent 
liabilities reﬂects the utilisation of sales ﬁnance commitments in 
the last year, the expiry of existing contingent liabilities through 
natural debt retirement or risk transfer, and, additionally in the 
case of net contingent liabilities, the changes in the level, form, 
and value of any underlying security. 
In reporting the Group’s contingent liability with respect 
to sales ﬁnancing, the Group includes a net exposure stress test 
which incorporates the impact of a 20 per cent fall in the value of 
all securities compared to the Airclaims’ current and future values. 
Application of this stress test results in a net contingent liability 
of £277 million (2003 £262 million). 
The directors regard the possibility that there will be 
any signiﬁcant loss arising from these contingencies as remote. 
The Group took charges and made prudent provisions 
against exposures in 2004. 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
All European Union listed companies are required to adopt 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for their ﬁnancial 
statements from 2005, which will include comparative information 
for 2004. An initial evaluation of the impact of IFRS was provided in 
the 2003 Annual report.The Group has continued its preparatory 
work,to enable it to report under IFRS for the ﬁrst time when it 
announces its interim 2005 results. Prior to this, it is the Group’s 
intention to restate the 2004 results on an IFRS basis, to allow the 
impact to be interpreted and adequately understood. 
The key areas of impact for Rolls-Royce relate to: 
– 	 financial instruments accounting under IAS 32 and IAS 39; 
– 	 capitalisation of development expenditure under IAS 38; 
–	 the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on accounting for RRSP 
receipts and payments; 
– 	 pension scheme accounting under IAS 19; 
– 	 fair valuing share option schemes in accordance with 
IFRS 2; and 
– 	 the cessation of goodwill amortisation in accordance 
with IFRS 3. 
Financial instruments 
As noted earlier, a signiﬁcant element of the Group’s trading is 
denominated in US dollars. In order to reduce the impact of 
currency volatility, the Group takes signiﬁcant levels of forward 
cover. Currently, gains or losses which are realised on these forward 
exchange contracts are taken to the proﬁt and loss account in the 
same period as the underlying transaction.

Underlying EPS* 
*excluding exceptional and non-trading items,
  defined in note 2 
IAS 39 (Financial instruments) requires all hedges to be strictly 
designated against speciﬁc income and the hedge effectiveness 
tested. All such instruments are required to be revalued to market 
values at the balance sheet date. If the hedging criteria are not 
achieved, then the change in value is taken to the proﬁt and 
loss account. 
As contracts may be signed several years in advance of 
delivery, the delivery dates and hence payment dates on contracts 
may change and meeting the strict hedging criteria for all contracts 
may not be practicable, resulting in potential volatility in the reported 
proﬁt and loss account and balance sheet. Similar requirements 
apply to instruments used to manage commodity and interest rate 
exposures, although for the latter, hedging criteria are more easily 
attainable. In assessing the adoption of IAS 39, the Group has no 
plans to amend the underlying policy for the economic hedging 
of its exposures. 
Development expenditure 
The Group’s expenditure on self-funded research and development 
is of the order of £300 million per annum. Since privatisation in 
1987, such expenditure has been expensed as incurred. IAS 38 
(Intangible assets) requires development expenditure meeting 
certain recognition criteria to be capitalised.This standard is to 
be applied retrospectively; hence the intangible asset will include 
amounts expensed in previous years. Impairment testing will be 
required at each balance sheet date. 
The key eligibility criteria for capitalisation relate to technical 
feasibility and the generation of future economic beneﬁt.This is 
unlikely to be achieved until around the time of engine certiﬁcation 
(or its equivalent for non-aero products). 
RRSPs 
The accounting treatment for the majority of RRSPs will not change 
under IFRS. However, certain RRSP arrangements must be treated 
as ﬁnancial instruments under the provisions of IAS 32. Such RRSP 
arrangements will be re-categorised as ﬁnancial liabilities and 
recognised at amortised cost. 
Pension scheme accounting 
Under IAS 19 (Employment beneﬁts) the net position on the 
Group’s pension schemes based on market values will be included 
on the balance sheet.This will be broadly in line with FRS 17 
amounts disclosed in note 30. 
Share options 
Under IFRS 2 (Share-based payments), for all employee share 
schemes, a fair value calculated using an option pricing model 
is required to be expensed. 
Goodwill 
In accordance with IFRS 3 (Business combinations), the amortisation 
of goodwill is prohibited; instead impairment tests are required at 
each balance sheet date. 
Share price 
During the year Rolls-Royce shares increased by 39 per cent from 
177.25p to 247p per share, compared to a 32 per cent increase 
for the aerospace and defence sector and an eight per cent 
increase for the FTSE100. The Company’s shares ranged in price 
from 167.5p in January to 269p in November. 
The number of shares in issue at the end of the year was 
1,705 million, an increase of 38 million of which 2 million related 
to share options, 11 million related to scrip dividends and 25 million 
related to conversion of B Shares into ordinary shares. 
The average number of shares in issue was 1,690 million 
(2003 1,647 million). Underlying earnings per share were 14.50p 
an increase of 19 per cent over 2003. 
The proposed ﬁnal payment per share, of 5.00p will result 
in a total payment of 8.18p per share (see report of the directors 
page 33). 
Financial services 
The ﬁnancial services businesses comprise: engine leasing 
(Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance), aircraft leasing (Pembroke), and 
electrical power project development (Rolls-Royce Power Ventures). 
Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance, the Group’s joint venture 
engine leasing business, owns a portfolio of 273 engines with 
39 customers.The proportion of engines on lease remains high, 
at 99 per cent, by value. 
Pembroke, the Group’s joint venture aircraft leasing 
business, owns 28 aircraft on lease to 13 customers, 100 per cent, 
by value, of the owned aircraft ﬂeet is on lease. A major reﬁnancing 
of Boeing 737 aircraft was concluded during the year without 
parent company support and a charge of £8 million was taken 
in connection with Boeing 717 exposure. 
Rolls-Royce Power Ventures, the Group’s power project 

developer, has 14 power generation projects under way. 

The business continues to be restructured and net charges 

of £5 million were taken.

Rolls­Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 32  Report of the directors

The directors present their report and the audited ﬁnancial statements of 
Rolls­Royce Group plc (the Company) for the year ended December 31, 2004. 
Principal activities 
The principal activities of the Group are described in the proﬁle on the inside 
front cover. 
Results for the year 
The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review and the Finance Director’s 
review describe the year’s operations, research and development activities and 
prospects. 
At the Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May 2004, shareholders 
approved the issue of B Shares as a new method for making payments to 
shareholders rather than paying a cash dividend. Under this arrangement 
shareholders are given the opportunity to redeem their B Shares for cash or to 
convert them into additional ordinary shares in the Company.The Company 
believes strongly that there continues to be considerable beneﬁt from the issue 
of B Shares. Future payments to shareholders will be made through further issues 
of B Shares generally in January and July each year. 
At the AGM on May 4, 2005, the directors will recommend an issue of 50 
B Shares with a total nominal value of 5.00p for each ordinary share which, 
together with the interim issue on January 4, 2005 of 31.8 B Shares for each 
ordinary share, is the equivalent of a total payment to ordinary shareholders of 
8.18p for each ordinary share for the year. 
For those shareholders who have not elected to redeem or convert their 
B Shares, a B Share dividend at a rate of 75 per cent of the London Interbank 
Offered Rate (LIBOR) is payable half yearly in arrears. 
Directors 
Directors who held ofﬁce during 2004 are listed on page 32 with the exception of 
Mr D E B aird, Lord Moore of L ower Marsh and Sir John Weston. Following an illness 
in December 2003, Mr D E Baird resigned as a non­executive director and 
Chairman of the Company with effect from June 21, 2004. Sir John Weston retired 
as a non­executive director on December 1, 2004. Lord Moore of Lower Marsh 
served as Acting Chairman from December 17, 2003 to June 21, 2004. Following 
Mr D E Baird’s resignation on June 21, 2004, Lord Moore served as Chairman on an 
interim basis until his retirement on December 31, 2004. 
Sir John Taylor and Mr I C Conn were appointed as independent 
non­executive directors with effect from November 5, 2004 and January 20, 2005 
respectively. Mr S M Robertson was appointed as a non­executive director with 
effect from N ovember 5, 2004 and as non­executive Chairman with effect from 
January 1, 2005. 
On his appointment, Mr S M Robertson met the criteria for independence 
contained in the Combined Code. Before his appointment, he disclosed to the 
Board his other signiﬁcant commitments which are described on page 32. He has 
since retired from the Board of Invensys plc and will be retiring from the Board of 
Inchcape plc at or before its annual general meeting in 2005. Details of the 
process followed by the Company in respect of Mr Robertson’s appointment are 
given on page 35. 
Under the C ompany’s Articles of Association, one third of the directors are 
subject to re­election every year, with each director also being subject to 
re­election at intervals of not more than three years. Any director appointed 
during the year is separately required to retire and seek re­election by the 
shareholders at the next AGM. For the last two years, the Board has adopted the 
approach of r equiring all the directors to retire each year and to seek re­election 
at the AGM.The Board has reviewed this policy and has concluded that it should, 
in future, adopt the approach contained in the Articles of Association. It will in 
addition require any non­executive director who has served on the Board for 
more than nine years to be subject to annual re­election at the AGM.The Board 
believes that this revised approach is fully consistent with UK corporate 
governance best practice and is in the interests of the Company and its 
shareholders.The directors retiring at this year’s AGM are the Hon A L Bondurant, 
Mr J P Chefﬁns, Mr J M Guyette and Mr A B Shilston. As newly appointed directors 
Mr S M Robertson, Mr I C Conn and Sir John Taylor will also retire at the AGM in 
2005.They all offer themselves for re­election. Sir Robin Nicholson will retire as a 
non­executive director of the Company at the conclusion of the AGM in 2005 and 
will not therefore be seeking re­election. 
The non­executive directors are appointed by the Board on the basis of 
recommendations put to it by the nominations committee. All the non­executive 
directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and 
free of any relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement.The Board reviews the independence of non­executive 
directors at least annually. 
The Board does not accept the view that a non­executive director 
automatically loses his or her independence after serving as a director for more 
than three consecutive terms of three years.The Board considers that in a 
long­t erm, complex and technologically advanced business, it is essential that 
non­ex ecutive directors have the opportunity to acquire, over a number of years, 
the experience and knowledge of the business and the sectors within which the 
Group op erates.The Board therefore concluded that Sir Robin Nicholson who has 
served on the Board for more than nine years remained fully independent during 
the year. 
Lord Moore, who retired on December 31, 2004, had also served on the 
Board for more than nine years. For the reasons explained above, the Board took 
the view that he remained fully independent until June 21, 2004 but that on 
appointment as Interim Chairman, he should no longer be considered as 
independent. He therefore resigned as a member of the audit and remuneration 
committees and ceased to be the Company’s Senior Independent Director with 
effect from that date. 
The Company has entered into separate Deeds of Indemnity in favour of its 
directors.The deeds provide substantially the same protection as that already 
provided to directors under the indemnity in Article 170 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association.The Company has also arranged appropriate insurance 
cover for legal action taken against its directors. 
Corporate governance 
The C ompany is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. 
The Board conﬁrms that throughout 2004 the Company complied with the 
provisions of the Combined Code.This report and, where appropriate, the 
directors’ remuneration report, describe how the Board has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions of the Combined Code. 
The Board 
The Board currently comprises a non­executive Chairman, a Chief Executive, ﬁve 
other executive directors and eight non­executive directors. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive is 
established in writing and agreed b y the Boar d.This document was revised and 
updated prior to the appointment of Mr S M Robertson as Chairman. 
Following Lord Moore’s appointment as Interim Chairman on June 21, 2004, 
Sir Robin Nicholson w as app ointed as the Company’s Senior Independent 
Director. He performed this role until February 9, 2005 when he was succeeded by 
Mr P J B yrom.

Nominations committee 
In 2004 the nominations committee was chaired by Lord Moore of Lower Marsh. 
With effect from January 1, 2005 the committee was chaired by 
Mr S M Robertson. Its members were the Hon A L Bondurant, Sir Robin Nicholson 
and Sir John Rose until May 10, 2004 when Mr P J Byrom, Mr C­P Forster, 
Mr I C Strachan, Mr C G Symon and Sir John Weston joined the committee to 
enable all the then non­executive directors to participate in the search and 
appointment process for a new Chairman. On his retirement from the Board, 
Sir John Weston ceased to be a member of the committee with effect from 
December 1, 2004.The committee met ten times during the year.The number of 
meetings attended by each member is shown in the table on page 34. With 
effect from February 9, 2005, the membership of the committee comprised the 
Hon A L Bondurant, Mr P J Byrom, Mr C­P Forster, Sir John Rose, Mr I C Strachan 
and Mr C G Symon, with Mr S M Robertston continuing to serve as chairman of 
the committee. 
In the ﬁrst quarter of each year the committee reviews the performance of 
each director.The performance of the Chairman is appraised annually at a 
meeting of the non­executive directors chaired by the Senior Independent 
Director. 
The c ommittee also leads the annual process which enables the Board to 
evaluate the effectiveness of its performance.This involves the completion of a 
written questionnaire by all directors of the Company.The results of this exercise 
are subsequently r eviewed by the Board. 
The committee makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment 
of executive and non­executive directors and on the membership of Board 
committees. It is assisted in the f ormer task by external recruitment consultants. 
The committee reviews succession planning for appointments to the Board and 
to other senior positions within the Group. In the case of the appointment of 
Mr S M Robertson as Chairman, the committee conﬁrms that an external 
consultancy was used to assist with the search process.The committee also 
prepared a detailed job description and made an assessment of the time 
commitment required. 
In carrying out its tasks, the committee gives careful consideration to the 
balance of skills required on the Board, including the need to reﬂect diversity, 
international experience and managerial and business skills. Before 
recommending any appointment to the Board, the committee satisﬁes itself that 
the appointee will have sufﬁcient time available to discharge his or her 
responsibilities effectively. 
Remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee’s membership and principal terms of reference are 
set out in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 41 to 51.The committee 
met four times during the year.The number of meetings attended by each 
member is shown in the table on page 34. 
Audit committee 
The audit committee consists exclusively of independent non­executive directors 
and is chaired by Mr P J Byrom who has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. 
In 2004, its other members were Sir Robin Nicholson and Mr I C Strachan. 
Lord Moore served on the committee until June 21, 2004. Mr I C Conn became a 
member of the committee with effect from January 20, 2005.The committee met 
four times during the year.The number of meetings attended by each member is 
shown in the table on page 34. 
The committee has responsibility for reviewing the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting 
and accounting policies, including major announcements to the London Stock 
Exchange and the Group’s approach to International Financial Reporting 
Standards. It is also responsible for the relationship with the external auditors and 
for the internal audit function, which is termed Business Assurance. In addition, 
it reviews the Group’s procedures for detecting, monitoring and managing the 
risk of fraud. 
The committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the 
appointment of the external auditors. It is also responsible for reviewing the scope 
of the audit, approving the audit fee and, on an annual basis, satisfying itself that 
the auditors are independent. 
In addition, the committee is responsible for assessing the Group’s 
internal controls and its systems for assessing and mitigating ﬁnancial and 
non­ﬁnancial risk. 
In order to safeguard auditor independence and objectivity, the following 
policy is applied in relation to services provided by the auditors: 
Audit related services – these are undertaken by the auditors as it is work that 
they must, or are best suited, to perform.It includes formalities relating to 
borrowings, shareholder and other circulars, risk management services, various 
regulatory reports and work in respect of acquisitions and disposals. 
Tax, accounting and mergers and acquisitions – The auditors are used for this 
work where they are best suited to undertake it. All other signiﬁcant consulting 
work in these areas is put out t o tender. 
All other advisory services/consulting – The auditors are generally prohibited 
from providing these services. 
Throughout the year the c ommittee monitors the cost of non­audit w ork 
undertaken by the auditors and is, therefore, in a position to take action if at any 
time it believes that there is a risk of the auditors’ independence being 
undermined through the award of this work. 
The committee reviews and approves the Business Assurance work 
programmes and ensures that this function is adequately resourced and 
co­ordinated with the work of the external auditors.

Mr J P Chefﬁns, Mr C H Green, Mr J M Guyette, Dr M G J W Howse and 
Mr A B Shilston.The committee is responsible for the Group’s risk management 
and for reporting to the Board key risks and the associated mitigating actions. 
Political dona tions 
In line with its established policy, the Group made no political donations 
during 2004. 
Communication with shareholders 
The Company attaches importance to the effectiveness of its communications 
with shareholders. It publishes an Annual review and summary ﬁnancial 
statement as well as a full Annual report.There are also separate reports for 
Environment and Community Relations. 
The Company maintains a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders 
including making pr esentations t o them af ter the preliminary and interim results. 
In October 2004, the Company held a major investors’ seminar in New York at 
which the Presidents of the Business Sectors and other senior executives 
described the G roup’s businesses and key strategic priorities. All shareholders 
can gain access to these and other presentations, as well as to the Annual report 
and other inf ormation about the G roup, on the Group’s website at 
www.rolls­royce.com. 
Rolls­Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 35  Report of the directors continued 
Holders of ordinary shares may attend the Company’s AGM at which the 
Company highlights key business developments during the year and at which 
shareholders have an opportunity to ask questions.The chairmen of the audit, 
remuneration and nominations committees are available to answer any questions 
from shareholders on the work of their committees. 
The Company conﬁrms that it sends the AGM notice and relevant 
documentation to all shareholders at least 20 working days before the date of 
the AGM. For those shareholders who have elected to receive communications 
electronically, notice is given of the availability of documents on the 
Group’s website. 
Responsibility for maintaining regular communications with shareholders 
rests with the executive management team led by the Chief Executive. However, 
the Board is informed on a regular basis of key shareholder issues, including 
share price performance, the composition of the shareholder register and City 
expectations. Independent research is commissioned annually into institutional 
shareholder perceptions of the Group.The Senior Independent Director and 
the non­executive directors also have the opportunity to meet with shareholders 
as appropriate. 
Internal controls and risk management 
Directors’ responsibilities 
The directors ar e responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for 
maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness from both a ﬁnancial and operational 
perspective.The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failur e to achieve business objectives and to provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s approach to internal control is based on the underlying principle of 
line management’s accountability for control and risk management. 
In reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control, the Board has 
taken account of the results of all the work carried out to audit and review the 
activities of the Group. 
There is an ongoing process to identify, assess and manage risk, including 
those risks affecting the Group’s reputation.This process is subject to continuous 
improvement and has been in place throughout the ﬁnancial year to which these 
statements apply and up to the date of their approval. 
The Board has reviewed the risk management process and conﬁrms that it 
complies with the Turnbull Committee Guidance on Internal Control. 
The Board has a risk committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, with speciﬁc 
accountability for the system of risk management and for reporting key risks and 
their associated mitigating actions to the Board. Details of the membership of the 
committee are set out on page 35. 
Organisation 
The Group has a clearly deﬁned organisational structure within which operational 
management have detailed responsibilities and levels of authorisation, supported 
by written job descriptions and operating manuals. 
Rolls­Royce also has a code of business conduct which lays down the 
principles t o be followed by employees in the course of conducting business. 
The code also gives guidanc e to support achievement of the required standards. 
Additionally, conﬁdential reporting lines enable UK and US employees to report, 
outside the normal management chain, any concerns they may have with regard 
to business c onduct. 
Risk management system 
The risk management system is an integral part of management’s approach to 
delivering business objectives and is a systematic process designed to identify, 
assess, treat, manage and communicate risks. It also provides a method of 
escalation and delegation to the appropriate level within the organisation and 
ensures actions are owned, deﬁned, resourced and effective. 
Management is responsible for the ongoing identiﬁcation and evaluation of 
signiﬁcant risks within their areas of responsibility and, using a common process, 
for the operation of suitable controls or mitigation actions. Risks are recorded in 
regularly updated risk registers operating at all levels of the organisation and are 
continuously reviewed and monitored. During the review processes, signiﬁcant 
emphasis is placed on learning from and sharing prior experience. Risks may arise 
from a variety of internal and external sources.They may be associated with 
regulations, customer requirements and competitor actions or could result from 
the capability of the processes used to execute the business or from external and 
largely unpredictable events, such as terrorist activity or war. 
Risks, irrespective of source, are managed through processes operated by 
project and functional teams. Management reports regularly to the risk 
committee on its view of risks and how they are managed, so that the Board can 
then c onsider and review these risks in terms of their potential impact. 
Management has continued to perform comprehensive risk reviews for all 
key projects, programmes and business change plans. In addition, all the 
processes op erated by the Group are subject to continuous improvement, 
including the risk management process itself. 
Systems of in ternal c ontrol 
The general managers of individual businesses are aware of their responsibility to 
operate systems of internal control which provide reasonable assurance of 
effective and efﬁcient operations, reliable ﬁnancial information and compliance 
with laws and regulations. Financial managers are required to acknowledge in 
writing that their routine ﬁnancial reporting is based on reliable data and that 
their results are properly stated in accordance with Group requirements. 
The Group has a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget 
approved by the Board. Revised forecasts for the year are reported at least 
quarterly. Actual results are reported monthly against budget and variances 
reviewed. 
The activities of the Group are subject to review by the Department of Risk, 
including Business Assurance and Project Risk Assessment, and the assurance 
functions of Health, Safety and Environment, Quality and Engineering. 
These functions operate to work programmes agreed by the appropriate 
Board member. 
The Business Assurance function, which works closely with the external 
auditors, undertakes a programme of ﬁnancial and operational audits and reviews 
agreed by the audit committee and covering all Group activities.The programme 
includes independent reviews of the systems of internal control and risk 
management. Findings are reported to the audit committee four times a year 
and t o the risk committee twice a year. 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
The G roup c ontinues t o attach imp ortance to the pursuit of excellence as a 
responsible corporate citizen in its operations throughout the world and to 
develop its approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). By far the greatest 
contribution the Group makes in this area comes from the wealth created by 
maintaining highly skilled jobs which arise from its business activities.The Board 
believes tha t progress in CSR will deliver competitive advantage and will 
contribute to the Group’s long­term success.The Group has well­developed 
policies on issues such as health, safety and environment, supply chain, charitable 
Rolls­Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 36  Report of the directors continued 
donations, community involvement, employment policy and employee learning 
and development. Details of these policies are set out on pages 37 to 39. During 
the year, the Group’s strengthened performance in CSR was recognised by the 
Group’s ranking in 10th position in the 2003 UK’s Business in the Community 
Corporate Responsibility Index and by its continued inclusion in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index. 
Supply chain 
Through its supplier quality system  ‘Supplier Advanced Business Relationships’ 
(SABRe), Rolls­Royce makes its approved suppliers aware of the performance 
standards expected of them. SABRe includes a Supplier Code of Conduct which 
was amended in 2004 to refer more explicitly to Health, Safety and Environment 
issues.The Code is being communicated to suppliers through a series of 
environmental conferences and an external newsletter. Group CSR issues affecting 
suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis, as is the performance of individual 
suppliers. In addition, supplier evaluations are also taking place on a prioritised 
basis.The Supplier Code of Conduct is supported by an equivalent internal 
Rolls­Royce Purchasing Code of Conduct to ensure consistency of approach. 
An annual review takes place to ensure that Rolls­Royce Corporation in the 
USA c ontinues to meet US Government requirements to source from the 
required quota of small and disad vantaged businesses. 
Health, Safety and Environment (HS&E) 
The HS&E committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, is responsible for policy 
development and assurance; setting Group objectives and targets; performance 
review; management system review; and reporting.The Group is supported by 
the Environmental Advisory Board (EAB), the membership of which includes 
external members who are respected authorities in their ﬁelds.The EAB reviews 
and makes independent recommendations on the environmental and 
sustainability aspects of the Group’s activities. 
The Major Incident Board, chaired by the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, reviews 
incidents to make sure that the lessons learnt are effectively communicated 
throughout the Group. Incidents considered during the year related to a diesel 
spill at the Bristol site, a ﬁre at the Indianapolis plant and an engine handling 
incident at the civil aerospace test facility in Derby. 
The corporate HS&E audit programme provides an independent assessment 
of the level of implementation of the Group’s HS&E management system. Several 
HS&E audits were completed in 2004, covering operations in the UK, Germany, 
Norway, South Korea and North America. Good progress continues to be made 
with the implemen tation of the Group­wide standard for an integrated HS&E 
management system. HS&E reviews were also undertaken at joint venture 
operations in South East Asia and at selected suppliers in China. 
During 2004, the environment report ‘Powering a better world’ conﬁrmed the 
successful achievement of the challenging ﬁve year targets, set in 1998, covering 
key performance indicators for HS&E. Following on from this, new three year 
targets have been set covering energy use, solid waste, solid waste recycling, 
hazardous liquid waste and lost time injury rate. Programmes are also in place 
aimed at producing a signiﬁcant change in performance in these areas.The 
Group is continuing to work with Deloitte and Touche LLP , who provided external 
assurance of the 2003 en vironment report. An update, containing data for 2004 
and progress against the targets, will be published on the Rolls­Royce website 
during 2005. 
The G roup op erates three sites in the UK, which manufacture, test and 
support nuclear reactor cores for Royal Navy submarines.The Group continues to 
maintain a strong health, safety and environmental record at these sites. 
Health and safety management 
The Group experienced no work related fatalities during 2004. Efforts continue to 
improve our performance on health and safety, with a particular focus on noise 
induced hearing loss and manual handling. 
Environment 
Businesses in the Group are certiﬁed to the international environmental 
management systems standard ISO 14001.It is the Group’s aim that any newly 
acquired business should achieve certiﬁcation within two years of acquisition. 
During the year, the Group was placed ﬁrst in its business sector amongst 
those companies completing the 2003 Business in the Environment (BiE) index 
of corporate environmental management and 32nd out of a total of 177 
participants. 
The Group continues to participate in the UK carbon dioxide emissions 
trading scheme and the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Under these initiatives, 
the Group has accepted targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions 
from its operations in the UK and North America. Setting and meeting 
challenging energy reduction targets will support the Group’s involvement in this 
initiative. During 2004, the Group exceeded its obligations to reduce its emissions 
under the UK emissions trading scheme and was able to sell some emissions 
units, further enhancing the cost saving beneﬁts of energy reduction. 
In our latest Environment Report, published in 2004, the Group presented 
information r elating to steps being taken on reducing the overall environmental 
impact of its manufacturing operations worldwide. Our performance against 
targets between 1998­2003 is shown in the following table: 
Our targets Target Achieved 
Reduce annual energy consumption by the end 10% 25% 
of 2003 relative to 1998 levels

or recovery by the end of 2003 
The Group has continued to make excellent progress in improving the 
environmental performance of its products.This has been made possible by 
sustained investment in technology development. Over £3 billion has been 
invested in research and development during the last ﬁve years, mainly to create 
new products with increased efﬁciency and reduced emissions. During 2004, 
Rolls­Royce was selected as one of the two engine suppliers for the Boeing 787 
Dreamliner.The Trent 1000 engine, being developed for this aircraft, will have 
outstanding en vironmental performance, in line with or exceeding long­term 
published tar gets.The G roup c ontinues to be involved in a number of industry­ wide initiatives at national and international level aimed at improving the 
environmental performance of power systems.

Occupational Health 
The Group provides a preventative Occupational Health service to its employees 
which focuses on how individuals’ health can affect their work and how their 
work can affect their health. 
Occupational Health continues to concentrate on four main areas of 
rehabilitation, education, health promotion and monitoring.The Group’s objective 
is to provide a  ‘modern, forward looking Occupational Health service recognised 
for delivering best practice’ .The priority in rehabilitation is for early intervention 
and active management of cases. A new training course for managers, entitled 
CARE, has been developed to assist managers in coping with absence and 
rehabilitation effectively. Health promotion campaigns delivered at major 
locations worldwide during 2004 included prostate cancer awareness, a travel 
health week and a low back pain awareness week.The Group sets stringent 
occupational health related objectives and targets for reducing occupational 
disease and work related ill health. A campaign to reduce noise induced hearing 
loss was launched in 2004. 
The Group’s approach to managing workplace pressure continues to evolve 
and is recognised as an example of best practice by the Health and Safety 
Commission and in other external publications. Dr Ian Lawson, the Group’s Chief 
Medical Ofﬁcer, has recently been appointed President of the Society of 
Occupational M edicine. 
Employment policy 
The number of Group employees at the end of the year was 35,372 (2003 35,214). 
The Group’s employment policies and practices support overall business 
objectives b y motivating and de veloping employees to meet the requirements of 
the business and its customers. Policies continue to be reviewed and developed 
to support the changing needs and international nature of the business. 
A strong emphasis is placed on effective worldwide employee 
communications and each business has its own programme of communication 
adapted to its particular needs. 
The Group consults with employees and employee representatives on a 
wide range of topics relating to its overall business objectives. Regular meetings 
are held in each business to discuss opportunities and issues of common interest. 
In recent years, senior employee representatives have worked closely with 
management to improve the quality of consultation and communication, 
resulting in a jointly agreed framework. A Company and Union Forum is now held 
at least twice a year involving senior management and employee representatives 
from across the Group followed by supporting communication in each business. 
In 2004, senior managemen t representatives and a special negotiating body 
of employee representatives agreed to broaden this process through the 
introduction of a Global Council in 2005 covering all employees in the Group. 
The Group is investing in new manufacturing facilities in Derby, Hucknall and 
Bristol in addition to further investment in the plant at Barnoldswick. A new facility 
at Inchinnan in Scotland ofﬁcially opened during 2004. Following consultation 
with employee representatives, agreement was reached on the introduction of 
Modern Working Practices at all these locations. Plans have also been announced 
to invest in a new facility at East Kilbride and to invest in the existing plant at 
Indianapolis. Discussions are currently in progress with employee representatives 
at both lo cations on the ne w working practices required to support the business 
cases for investment. 
The Group has further developed its capability to support the redeployment, 
training and c areer managemen t of employees through a network of 
Resource Centres. 
The Group has also helped to redeploy employees affected by restructuring and 
redundancy across the Midlands through the involvement of more than 
30 organisations in a new partnership approach. In 2004 the Company was 
reaccredited under the Investor in People Standard. 
The Group has a strong equal opportunities policy and recognises the 
importance of developing a diverse and inclusive workforce. It continues to 
support initiatives to attract more women and people from ethnic minorities to 
pursue careers in engineering. A new global policy and framework for Diversity 
and Equality was developed and introduced in 2004 in consultation with 
employee representatives. 
The Group’s policy is to provide, wherever possible, employment, training 
and development opportunities for disabled people. It is also committed to 
supporting employees who become disabled and to helping disabled employees 
make the best possible use of their skills and potential. 
The Group is committed to encouraging employee share ownership. 
All employees are regularly invited to participate in Sharesave plans and have 
committed to save over £100 million to buy shares in the Company. In addition, 
UK employees can receive part of their annual bonus in Company shares and can 
make monthly share purchases from their gross salary, in accordance with 
statutory arrangements. 
Learning and development 
The G roup c ontinues to invest in improving individual and business capability by 
offering development opportunities and training programmes for employees, 
customers, suppliers and people within the communities in which it operates. 
The G roup has a strong tradition of succession planning dr iven by development 
cells in all businesses and functions. During 2004, the leadership programmes 
which support career progression have been redesigned to reﬂect the evolving 
needs of the business. 
In 2004 the Group implemented the Rolls­Royce Development System to 
standardise across its worldwide operations the processes for performance 
management, succession management, and individual and organisational 
development. 
The Group has continued to develop the Rolls­Royce Learning System 
which sets frameworks for leadership, continuing professional development and 
business and operations management. Working with academic partners across 
the world, the Group has a broad range of programmes that cover managerial, 
professional, technical and operating skills. Leadership and technical programmes 
have been designed to support the businesses in improving their processes as 
part of the G roup’s drive for Process Excellence. 
In 2004, the Group spent £30 million on the education and training of 
employees and recruited 170 graduates and 109 apprentices and technicians. 
In addition, there were 364 undergraduate students in the Group for training 
periods of between two and 12 months. At the end of 2004, there were 288 
graduates on formal training programmes and 330 apprentices and technicians 
worldwide. 
Working on local community projects forms a key part of development 
programmes for trainees and managers.These projects involve working with 
external partners in education, the arts, the environment and regeneration. 
Support for lo cal communities also includes free places on internal programmes 
and support for local schools. 
The Group continues to work closely with schools, colleges and universities 
to promote science, technology and enterprise. Its policy is to work with 
government, local and national institutions and education establishments to 
widen studen ts’ experience of industry and promote careers in the aerospace, 
marine and energy sectors. In 2004, the Group launched the Rolls­Royce Science 
Rolls­Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 38  Report of the directors continued 
Prize to promote and reward teamwork in science teaching in schools and 
colleges in the UK and Republic of Ireland. It also piloted Proﬁtable Pursuit, a 
business simulation to stimulate enterprise education in schools. 
The Group supports a wide range of education projects and initiatives 
including Open Industry, Specialist Schools, Education Action Zones, Science and 
Engineering Ambassadors,‘Pack to school’ for underprivileged children and 
Building the Innovation Generation to promote engineering education in schools. 
The Group’s proﬁle as an employer of choice for graduates has further 
strengthened in the UK, as evidenced by the results of a recent leading 
national survey. 
The Group has continued to support our supply chain and our customers 
with development programmes. In the supply chain, this has included training in 
people development and business improvement techniques.We have supported 
our customers and related government departments with management and 
business education. For example, the Group led an initiative to establish the British 
University of Dubai which was opened in 2004.Through the UK government's 
Chevening scheme, the Group also sponsored students from Brazil, China, India, 
Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan. 
Community investment 
Charitable donations are an integral part of the Group’s involvement in the 
community. In 2004, the Group’s total charitable donations amounted to £969,000. 
The Group c ommunity investment committee was established in 2003 to oversee 
the implementation and operation of the Group’s policy on charitable donations. 
Following a review of its status in 2005, it was decided that in future it should 
operate as an e xecutive committee reporting to the Board. 
The committee is supported by a series of national committees and 
operates within the following policy: 
‘As a forward­looking, innovative and global company, Rolls­Royce Group plc 
is committed to being a good corporate citizen in its operations throughout the 
world.The Group’s policy on donations is to direct its support primarily to causes 
with educational, engineering and scientiﬁc objectives, as well as to social 
objectives connected with the Group’s business and place in the wider 
community.’ 
During 2004, charitable donations in the UK amounted to £501,000.They 
included continuing support for Greater Bristol Community Foundation, Open 
Industry and the Institute of Physics. In response to the tsunami disaster in South 
East Asia, the Group provided £250,000 to the disaster appeal and committed a 
further £250,000 in additional funding to match employee donations. 
Elsewhere, the Group has made charitable donations amounting to £468,000 
in those countries in which it has a signiﬁcant presence. In North America, this 
included support for the work of United Way, Habitat for Humanity and The 
Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. In Germany, the Group supported a 
range of charities including World Children’s Day in Berlin. In the Nordic countries 
it supported a number of local sports and arts­based projects. 
A list of the principal donations made in 2004 is available on written request 
to the Company Secretary. 
In addition to our charitable donations, contributions of £1,317,000 were 
made t o projects through the Group’s corporate sponsorship committee, 
individual business groups and through educ ational pr ogrammes. 
The Group has a long and successful history of community involvement. 
As part of its commitment to being a good corporate citizen, it assists the 
communities in which its businesses operate and its employees live and work. 
Employees are also encouraged to play their own role in the community.This 
community involvement is designed to support the Group’s values of reliability, 
integrity and innovation and is directed towards supporting education, the 
environment, the arts and economic and social regeneration. 
The Group published its ﬁrst Community Report in 2004, which illustrated 
the range of support given to community based organisations and projects. 
Examples of activities in 2004 include: 
–	 sponsoring ViVA, an orchestra resident in Derby, through which the Group 
supports concert giving and music education programmes in schools; 
–	 continuing a UK­wide partnership with The Prince’s Trust to support its team 
and business start­up programmes; 
–	 developing an environmental education project with The National Forest 
Company; and 
–	 Indianapolis­based employees supporting Habitat for Humanity by helping 
to construct a home for a local family. 
The Group also ﬁnances the administration of the Payroll Giving Scheme for UK 
employees. In 2004, the scheme helped employees to make donations of over 
£388,000 t o over 200 charities of their choice.The scheme, which was relaunched 
in 2004, has achie ved a level of UK employee participation of 16 per cent, one of 
the highest in the country. 
As part of c ommunity investment activities, employees are encouraged to 
take up opportunities for development within local community based projects 
around our sites. Examples include: 
–	 education business partnerships r unning succ essful men toring and literacy 
programmes for school pupils; 
–	 participating in the UK’s Science and Engineering Ambassadors Scheme; 
–	 trainees undertaking community projects as part of their training 
programmes; 
–	 providing support to employees who are school governors; and 
–	 working with organisations such as The Prince’s Trust and Young Enterprise 
to provide business mentors and advisers. 
The Group is able to offer support in­kind to local initiatives.This may include the 
provision of places on in­house training programmes; the donation of surplus 
computer equipment and furniture; and offering the free use of meeting rooms 
and premises. 
The Group is a member of Business in the Community and actively supports 
Common Purpose programmes across the UK.These two organisations aim to 
promote greater business awareness and involvement in wider community issues 
and encourage greater employee participation.

This report provides the information required by the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). It also describes how the principles of 
the Combined Code in relation to executive directors’ remuneration are applied 
by the Company.The Company conﬁrms that it complies with the requirements 
of the Combined Code. 
The Group operates in a highly competitive, international market. Its business 
is complex, technologically advanced and has long time horizons.The Group is 
committed to achieving sustained improvements in performance and this 
depends crucially on the individual contributions made by the executive team 
and by employees at all levels.The Board therefore believes that an effective 
remuneration strategy plays an essential part in the future success of the Group 
by providing incentives which create a close identity of interest with shareholders. 
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) on May 4, 2005 inviting them to approve this report. 
The remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee has responsibility for making recommendations to 
the Board on the Group’s policy towards executive remuneration.The committee 
determines, on the Board’s behalf, the speciﬁc remuneration packages of the 
executive directors and a number of senior executives. A copy of the committee’s 
terms of reference is available in the Investors section on the Group’s website at 
www.rolls­royce.com. 
The c ommittee c onsists exclusively of independent, non­executive directors. 
It was chaired by Mr C G Symon throughout the year and its other members 
were Mr P J Byrom and Mr C­P Forster. Sir John Weston served as a member of 
the committ ee un til his r etirement from the B oard on December 1, 2004. With 
effect from February 9, 2005 the membership of the committee was changed 
and it currently comprises the Hon A L Bondurant, Mr P J Byrom, Mr C­P Forster 
and Sir John Taylor, with Mr C G Symon continuing to serve as chairman of 
the committee. 
In 2004 Lord Moore of Lower Marsh and Sir John Rose attended meetings by 
invitation but were not present during any discussion of their own emoluments. 
The committee met on four occasions in 2004 and details of members’ 
attendance are set out on page 34. 
Advice to the remuneration committee 
The committee appoints its own consultant to provide it with independent 
advice. During 2004 the committee’s consultant was Mercer Human Resource 
Consulting (Mercer). Mercer also provided advice to the Group on insurance and 
pension ma tters. 
The committee may also call for information and advice from other advisers 
inside and outside the Group. In 2004, Lord Moore and Sir John Rose made 
recommendations to the committee relating to the performance of their direct 
reports and on the appropriateness of particular remuneration proposals to the 
Group’s needs. Internal support was provided primarily by the Director – Human 
Resources, Mr J R Rivers, advised by Deloitte & Touche LLP .The Company Secretary, 
Mr C E Blundell, also provided support to the committee. Ad hoc advice has been 
provided by employees from Human Resources, Finance and Business 
Development when required. 
The c ommittee also r eceived ad vice on remuneration matters from 
Deloitte & Touche LLP and the Company’s lawyers, Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer. 
During 2004, Deloitte & Touche LLP also advised the Group on corporate tax, 
transfer pricing and customs duties. 
Remuneration policy 
The policy framework 
The Board has adopted, on the recommendation of the committee, a 
remuneration policy reﬂecting the following broad principles which it will 
continue to apply in 2005: 
i) the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives should 
reﬂect their responsibilities and contain incentives to deliver the Group’s 
performance objectives; it must also be capable of attracting and retaining 
the individuals necessary for business success; 
ii) a signiﬁcant proportion of total remuneration should be based on Group 
and individual performance, both in the short and long term; and 
iii) the system of remuneration should establish a close identity of interest 
between senior executives and shareholders through measures such as 
encouraging the acquisition of a signiﬁcant shareholding in the Company. 
The policy takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group. 
The committee regularly reviews both the competitiveness of the Group’s 
remuneration structure and its effectiveness in incentivising executives to 
enhance value for shareholders over the longer term.It considers that a successful 
remuneration policy needs to be sufﬁciently ﬂexible to take account of future 
changes in the Group’s business environment and in remuneration practice. 
The main components of remuneration 
The main components of remuneration comprise: base salary, annual incentive 
arrangements, long­t erm share based incentives and pension and life assurance 
beneﬁts. Executive directors and senior executives are also entitled to a company 
car or car allowance, private medical insurance, ﬁnancial counselling and, in the 
case of Mr J M Guyette, a housing allowance. 
The committee considers that there should be a continuing emphasis on 
those elements of remuneration, such as annual and long­term incentives, which 
directly inﬂuence the performance of senior execut ives. 
Base salaries 
In determining the relative importance of these elements of remuneration, the 
committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels required to recruit 
and retain high quality senior executives. 
The committee believes that base salaries should be set with reference to 
the median­level of the relevant marketplace. All salary increases must be justiﬁed 
on the basis of p erformance and are not automatic. 
Other beneﬁts are generally at the median of market practice. 
Annual incentives 
Performance­related incentive plans should provide the opportunity of increasing 
total earnings to the upper quartile of the marketplace if performance justiﬁes it. 
Executive directors and senior executives participate in the Annual Performance 
Related Award plan (APRA). Under APRA as operated in 2004, they were eligible 
for awards of up to 80 per cent of base salary on the achievement of 
predetermined targets. In the case of the Chief Executive the maximum was 
100 per c ent. It is possible for these maximum awards to be increased by 20 per 
cent to reﬂect exceptional personal performance. APRA awards do not form part 
of pensionable earnings.The APRA performance targets set by the committee are 
based on the G roup’s annual operating plans. For 2004, the measures for 
executive directors included underlying proﬁt, average cash balance, cash ﬂow 
and personal p erformance through speciﬁc personal objectives. Forty per cent of 
any APRA bonus depends on personal performance against these speciﬁc

information not subject to audit 
The committee believes that these CPS targets are no less challenging than those 
applied in 2004 and that the performance necessary to achieve the awards 
towards the upper end of the range is particularly stretching.They should not, 
therefore, be interpreted as providing guidance on the Group’s expected 
performance over the relevant period. 
Intermediate levels of performance will attract pro rata releases.The shares 
released will be determined by the total CPS generated over the three­year 
period. 
The Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over the performance period 
will be compared with the TSR of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 index 
on the date of grant.This comparison will be carried out by an external 
independent agency. If the Company’s TSR exceeds the median of that group of 
companies, the number of shares due to be released to an executive following 
achievement of the EPS and CPS targets will be increased by 25 per cent. 
EPS and TSR performance measures are calculated from a base year which is 
the year before grant. 
It is intended that the Chief Executive will receive annual grants of shares 
with a market value at the time of grant of 100 per cent of his annual salary. In 
accordance with the principles above, exceptional performance could result in 
shares b eing released which are equivalent to 125 per cent of his salary at the 
time of gr ant. In the case of other executives it is intended that the annual grant 
will be 66.6 per cent for executive directors and 50 per cent for other members of 
the G roup E xecutive.The PSP permits grants up to 200 per cent of annual salary. 
The PSP is designed to provide awards which are at the median of the 
marketplace for UK companies of similar size and complexity to the Company. 
It will also b e applied t o other e xecutives b elow Board level with awards being 
made on a pro rata basis. 
In line with the committee’s established policy, it is envisaged that existing 
issued shares will be used to satisfy awards, but in order to provide ﬂexibility, the 
PSP rules permit the issue of new issue shares, within standard limits. 
Executive share option plan 
Following the introduction of the PSP it is not intended to continue the practice 
of granting executive share options. 
The exercise of options granted prior to the introduction of the PSP is 
subject to a performance condition that the Company’s growth in EPS, as deﬁned 
by FRS 14, must exceed the UK retail price index by an average of three per cent 
per annum over a rolling three­year period.These performance conditions apply 
to all the executive directors. Achievement of the EPS target is reviewed annually 
by the c ommittee. 
In 2001, in order to help meet a series of demanding challenges, key 
members of the executive team, including the executive directors, received a 
larger than normal level of grant. As described in the Company’s 2001 Annual 
Report, this award had more demanding performance criteria and personal share 
ownership requirements (see pages 49 and 50). 
Long­term incentive plan 
The Company has in place a long­term incentive plan, the Rolls­Royce Restricted 
Share Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 1997.There are no grants 
outstanding under this plan. It is not in tended tha t further gr ants be made. 
Share retention policy 
The committee requires participants in the PSP to retain at least one half of any 
shares released from the PSP until their retirement, except that shares may be sold 
within one year before the normal or agreed retirement date or on leaving for any 
other reason once a committed date has been agreed.This exception is intended 
to ensure that participants are not disadvantaged under Capital Gains Tax rules on 
leaving employment. 
All employee share plans 
The committee believes that share­based plans make a signiﬁcant contribution to 
the close involvement and interest of all employees in the Group’s performance. 
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s all­employee share 
schemes on the same terms as other employees.There are three main elements 
to these arrangements: 
i) the Sharesave Scheme – a savings­related share option scheme available to 
all employees.This scheme operates within speciﬁc tax legislation (including 
a requirement to ﬁnance the exercise of the option using the proceeds of a 
monthly savings contract).The exercise of the option is not subject to the 
achievement of a performance target; 
ii) the  ‘Free Share’ element of the Share Incentive Plan, under which UK 
employees receive shares of up to the equivalent of one week’s pay as part 
of the Company component of any bonus paid for 2004; and 
iii) the  ‘Partnership Share’ element of the Share Incentive Plan under which UK 
employees may make regular purchases of shares from pre­tax income. 
International Financial Repor ting Standards 
The committee intends to work closely with the audit committee to monitor and 
react appropriately to any impact which the introduction of International 
Financial Reporting Standards may have on the performance measures under 
annual and long­term incentive plans. 
Service contracts 
The committee’s policy is that executive directors appointed to the Board are 
offered notice periods of 12 months.The committee recognises that in the case of 
appointments to the Board from outside the Group, it may be necessary to offer a 
longer initial notic e period, which would subsequently reduce to 12 months after 
that initial period. 
The committee has a deﬁned policy on compensation and mitigation to be 
applied in the event of a UK director’s contract being prematurely terminated. In 
these cir cumstances, steps are taken to ensure that poor performance is not 
rewarded.When calculating termination payments, the committee takes into 
account a range of factors such as age, length of service contract and the 
director’s obligation to mitigate his or her own loss. 
Sir John Rose and Mr C H Green have service agreements with 
Rolls­Royce plc dated December 4, 1992 and March 1, 1991 respectively. 
Rolls­Royce plc has the discretion to terminate the service agreement by paying 
salary and the value of all other contractual beneﬁts in lieu of notice or pro rata in 
lieu of any unexpired period of notice. As a result of the voluntary agreement of 
Sir John Rose and Mr C H Green, with effect from January 1, 2004, the notice 
required t o be given b y Rolls­R oyce plc reduced from 24 months to 12 months. 
The written notice required to be given by Sir John Rose and Mr C H Green 
remains six months. In the event of the executives’ contracts being terminated by 
Rolls­R oyce plc other than in accordance with the contracts’ terms, they are 
entitled to receive a liquidated sum calculated as 12 months’ salary and beneﬁts. 
Performance related payments are not covered under this arrangement, although 
an annual bonus may be paid if the executive is in post at the end of the year.

Non­executive directors’fees 
The fees paid to non­executive directors (see page 46) are determined by the 
Board informed by independent market surveys. In January 2005 a review was 
undertaken of the non­executive directors’ fees, based on a specially 
commissioned, independent market survey (see page 46).The non­executive 
Chairman and the non­executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of 
the Group’s share schemes, performance pay arrangements or pension schemes. 
A facility is in place which enables non­executive directors to use some or all 
of their fees, after the appropriate statutory deductions, to make private purchases 
of shares in the Company on the open market, on a monthly basis.

Non­executive directors’fees 
In 2004 each non­e xecutive director received an annual fee of £30,000. In addition, fees of £6,000 per annum were paid to members of the audit, remuneration and 
nominations committees, with the chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees receiving a further £6,000 per annum. 
In February 2005, the Board reviewed the fees payable to the non­executive directors. In carrying out this review, the Board took account of the results of a 
specially commissioned, independent market survey. 
Having taken in to account this external advice, the Board concluded that there was a strong case for increasing the non­executive directors’ fees to more 
competitive levels in order to reﬂect the increased responsibilities and time commitments which recent changes in corporate governance are imposing on all 
non­executive directors. 
The Board is therefore proposing that with effect from May 2005, the fees should be restructured so that in future a non­executive director would receive a fee of 
£50,000 reﬂecting his or her membership of the Board and of Board committees.The chairman of the audit committee would receive an additional fee of £15,000 and 
the r emuneration committee chairman would receive an additional fee of £12,000.The senior independent director would also receive an additional fee of £5,000 for 
carrying out this role. 
The Board will be inviting shareholders at the 2005 AGM to approve a resolution to increase the maximum total amount payable to all the non­executive 
directors and the non­executive Chairman from £600,000 to £850,000.This increase will enable the fees payable to the non­executive directors to be increased to the 
levels descr ibed above, as well as providing some limited headroom for further increases in fees that may be required in the future in response to movements in 
the mar ket.

The annual fee payable in 2004 to Mr D E Baird, the former Chairman, was £325,000 (comprising a fee of £257,400 and £67,600 to cover the annualised cost of an 
apartment made available by the Group for his use). Mr Baird resigned as a director and as Chairman with effect from June 21, 2004. Payment of the cash element of 
this fee was waived by Mr Baird with effect from March 10, 2004. He therefore received a total cash fee for 2004 of £49,000. 
Mr Baird no longer had the use of the apartment following his resignation and the cost of the apartment up to the date of his resignation was £32,000, with

with effect from June 21, 2004. He was paid an annual fee of £250,000 in 2004, inclusive of any Board committee commitments or work undertaken in connection with 
his Chairmanship of the Rolls­Royce Pension Fund. He retired both as a director and as Chairman with effect from December 31, 2004. 
Mr S M Robertson was appointed to the Board as a non­executive director on November 5, 2004 and as Chairman with effect from January 1, 2005. As Chairman

organisation of the Group’s centenary celebrations and for the centennial of powered ﬂight. For these services he was paid a fee of £25,000 in 2004.

The ﬁgure in brackets is the increase in pension/retirement lump sum during the year ended December 31, 2004 but in this case excluding the effect of inﬂation. 
2 
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year. 
3 
The transfer values stated represent liabilities of the Rolls­Royce sponsored pension schemes and not sums paid to the individuals. The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in 
accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 (GN11). GN11 covers individual transfer calculations and the above ﬁgures have been calculated using assumptions certiﬁed by the Actuary as being consistent 
with GN11. Transfer values calculated on this basis will vary up or down from one year to the next due to changes in ﬁnancial conditions, principally long­term interest rates, from which the Actuary derives the 
assumptions used t o place a capital value on the pension entitlement.Whilst ﬂuctuating up or down in individual years, transfer values generally trend upwards over time as individuals complete more service 
and become older. Age is an important factor because shortening the period to retirement signiﬁcantly increases the capital value of any given amount of pension. Part of the increase in transfer values over 2004 
is attributable to falls in the market interest rates on which the transfer value calculations are based. It is also important to view the increase in transfer values quoted above in the context of transfer values having 
fallen during 2003. Transfer values as a t December 31, 2002 can be compared to transfer values as at December 31, 2004 for Mr J P Chefﬁns, Mr C H Green and Sir John Rose as follows: 
Dec 31, 2002  Dec 31, 2004 % increase

Mr J P Chefﬁns 4,483 5,091 13.6 
Mr C H Green 4,233 4,505 6.5 
Sir John Rose 5,268 5,683 7.8 
Dr M G J W Howse commenced drawing his pension from July 1, 2004 (see note 5 below). In calculating transfer values in line with GN11, there is a change in methodology in the approach to valuing beneﬁts 
before and after they come into payment.This change in actuarial method explains why the increase in transfer value during 2004 is larger for Dr M G J W Howse than for other directors. 
4 
The ﬁgure in brackets is the transfer value of the increase in pension/retirement lump sum during the year ended December 31, 2004 excluding the effect of inﬂation, and net of the member’s own contributions. 
5 
Dr M G J W Howse attained normal retirement age on July 1, 2004 and began receiving his pension beneﬁts although he remains an executive director.The increase in accrued pension shown for

Dr M G J W Howse therefore relates to the pension accrued over the ﬁrst six months of the year only.

6 
The Group operates the Rolls­Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS).The purpose of the scheme is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved 
pension schemes under the 1989 Finance Act. Membership of the scheme is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.The members of the scheme include Mr A B Shilston. He 
joined the G roup af ter the in troduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining the Group included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary, in line with other 
directors and senior executives. Employer contributions to this plan during 2004 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2004 for the approved deﬁned beneﬁt plans, and are therefore included in 
the ﬁgures shown in the right hand column of the ﬁrst table. In addition, the employer has paid £41,000 to Mr A B Shilston directly in order to meet the income tax liability that he will incur on these employer 
contributions to the unapproved plan. 
7 
Members of the schemes have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting beneﬁts are included in the above table. 
8 
Beneﬁts are translated at US$1.83=£1. 
9 
The lump sum entitlement shown is that which would be paid on immediate retirement based on service to the end of the year. 
10 
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice. 
11 
Mr J M Guyette is a member of two deﬁned beneﬁt plans in the USA, one qualiﬁed and one non­qualiﬁed. He accrues a retirement lump sum beneﬁt in both of these plans which, as cash balance arrangements, 
operate on the same basis as deﬁned c ontribution except a guaranteed minimum rate of interest of four per cent is applied to investments.The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these 
two plans, and the transfer values of these beneﬁts, are shown in the second table. In addition, Mr J M Guyette is a member of two 401(k) deﬁned beneﬁt savings plans in the USA, one qualiﬁed and one non­
qualiﬁed, to which both he and his employer, Rolls­Royce North America Inc., contribute.The aggregate employer contribution invested in the cash balance and 401(k) plans each year is calculated with reference 
to taxable basic and annual inc entive compensation to reﬂect market practice in the USA. However, this is capped at no more than 26 per cent of basic salary. Mr J M Guyette is also a member of an unfunded 
non­qualiﬁed deferred compensation plan in the USA, to which his employer makes notional contributions calculated with reference to his basic salary. Employer contributions to the 401(k) and deferred 
compensation plans during 2004 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2004 for the deﬁned beneﬁt plans, and are therefore included in the ﬁgures shown in the right hand column of the 
second table.

Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 56  Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 
1 Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards on the historical cost basis, modiﬁed to include the 
revaluation of land and buildings. 
The Group has adopted UITF 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ , under which 
own shares have been reclassiﬁed as a deduction from shareholders funds. The 
effect has been to reduce ﬁxed asset investments by £2m (2003 £1m). 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the Company 
and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to December 31, together with the 
Group’s share of the results up to December 31 of: 
i) Joint ventures 
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest 
and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other 
venturers under a contractual arrangement. The results of joint ventures are 
accounted for using the gross equity method of accounting. 
ii) Joint arrangements that are not entities 
The Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to 
engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or 
business of its own.The Group includes its share of assets, liabilities and cash 
ﬂows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of 
each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to the Group’s risk interest in the 
joint arrangement. 
Any subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and joint arrangements that are not 
entities, sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the dates of 
change of control. 
Some small adjustments have been made to comparative ﬁgures to put 
them on a consistent basis with the current year. 
Purchased goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for 
shares in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures over the fair value to the 
Group of the net assets acquired. 
i) To December 31, 1997: Goodwill was written off to reserves in the year of 
acquisition.The proﬁt or loss on the disposal of a business acquired before 
December 31, 1997 takes into account the attributable value of purchased 
goodwill relating to that business. 
ii) From January 1, 1998: Goodwill has been recognised within ﬁxed assets in 
the year in which it arises and amortised on a straight line basis over its 
useful economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts, and excluding 
value added tax. 
Sales of products are recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods are transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed 
and the receipt of payment can be assured. 
Sales of services and long-term contracts are recognised when the outcome 
of the transaction can be reliably estimated. Revenue is recognised by reference 
to the stage of completion based on services performed to date as a percentage 
of the total contractual obligation. 
Linked sales of product and services are treated as a single long-term 
contract where these components have been negotiated as a single commercial 
package and are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently 
of each other and form a single project with an overall proﬁt margin. Revenue 
is recognised on the same basis as for other long-term contracts as 
described above. 
Provided that the outcome of long-term contracts can be assessed with 
reasonable certainty, the attributable proﬁt recognised on such contracts is based 
on stage of completion and the overall contract proﬁtability, after including an 
appropriate risk factor, which is progressively reduced over the life of the contract. 
Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion of contracts 
having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements including, if 
appropriate, related commitments and undertakings given by customers. 
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded turnover, are 
deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent that payments 
on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the 
excess is included in creditors. The amount by which recorded turnover of 
long-term contracts is in excess of payments on account is classiﬁed as ‘amounts 
recoverable on contracts’ and is separately disclosed within debtors. 
Stock 
Stock and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. 
Risk and revenue sharing partnerships 
From time to time, the Group enters into arrangements with partners who, in 
return for a share in future programme revenues or proﬁts, make cash payments 
which are not refundable (except under certain remote circumstances). Cash 
sums received, which reimburse the Group for past expenditure, are credited to 
other operating income. The arrangements may also require partners to 
undertake development work and/or supply components at their own expense 
for use in the programme. No accounting entries are recorded where partners 
undertake such development work or where programme components are 
supplied by partners because no obligation arises unless and until programme 
sales are made; instead, payments to partners for their share in the programme 
are charged to cost of sales as programme revenues arise. 
Research and development 
The charge to the proﬁt and loss account consists of research and development 
expenditure incurred in the year, excluding known recoverable costs on contracts, 
contributions to shared engineering programmes and application engineering. 
Application engineering expenditure, incurred in the adaptation of existing 
technology to new products, is capitalised and amortised over the programme 
life, up to a maximum of ten years, where both the technical and commercial risks 
are considered to be sufﬁciently low. 
Foreign currencies 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the rate ruling at the year end or, where applicable, at the estimated sterling 
equivalent, taking account of future foreign exchange and similar contracts. The 
trading results of overseas undertakings are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the year or, where applicable, at the estimated sterling equivalent, taking 
account of future foreign exchange and similar contracts. Exchange adjustments 
arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments, and from the 
translation of the proﬁts or losses at average rates, are taken to reserves. Other 
exchange differences, including those arising from currency conversions in the 
usual course of trading, are taken into account in determining proﬁt on ordinary 
activities before taxation. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 57  Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued 
1 Accounting policies continued 
Treasury instruments

The accounting treatment of the key instruments used by the Group is as follows:

i) Gains or losses arising on forward exchange contracts are taken to the proﬁt

and loss account in the same period as the underlying transaction. 
ii) Net interest arising on interest rate agreements is taken to the proﬁt and 
loss account. 
iii) Premiums paid or received on currency options are taken to the proﬁt and 
loss account when the option expires or matures. 
iv) Gains or losses arising on jet fuel swaps are taken to the proﬁt and loss 
account in the same period as the underlying transaction. 
If the underlying transaction to a hedge ceases to exist, the hedge is terminated 
and the proﬁts and losses on termination are recognised in the proﬁt and loss 
account immediately. If the hedge transaction is terminated, the proﬁts and losses 
on termination are held in the balance sheet and amortised over the life of the 
original underlying transactions. 
Post-retirement beneﬁts 
Contributions to Group deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes are charged to the 
proﬁt and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions at a substantially level 
percentage of payroll costs over employees’ service lives. 
The cost of providing post-retirement beneﬁts other than pensions is 
charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the service lives of the relevant 
employees. 
Accounting for leases 
i)	 As Lessee 
Assets ﬁnanced by leasing agreements which give rights approximating to 
ownership (ﬁnance leases) have been capitalised at amounts equal to the 
original cost of the assets to the lessors and depreciation provided on the 
basis of the Group depreciation policy. The capital elements of future 
obligations under ﬁnance leases are included as liabilities in the balance 
sheet and the current year’s interest element, having been allocated to 
accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the 
outstanding balance, is charged to the proﬁt and loss account. 
The annual payments under all other lease arrangements, known 
as operating leases, are charged to the proﬁt and loss account on an 
accruals basis. 
ii)	 As Lessor 
Amounts receivable under ﬁnance leases are included under debtors and 
represent the total amount outstanding under lease agreements less 
unearned income. Finance lease income, having been allocated to 
accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net cash 
investment, is included in turnover. 
Rentals receivable under operating leases are included in turnover on 
an accruals basis. 
Tangible ﬁxed assets and depreciation 
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairments in value. 
Certiﬁcation costs and participation fees Depreciation is provided on the following basis: 
Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certiﬁcation requirements for new i) Land and buildings 
civil engine/aircraft combinations and payments made to airframe manufacturers Depreciation is provided on the original cost of purchases since 1996 and 
for this, and participation fees, are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent on the valuation of properties adopted at December 31, 1996 and is 
that they can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the proﬁt and calculated on a straight line basis at rates sufﬁcient to reduce them to their 
loss account over the programme life, up to a maximum of ten years. estimated residual value. Estimated lives, as advised by the Group’s 
professional valuers, are: 
Interest a) Freehold buildings – ﬁve to 45 years (average 23 years). 
Interest payable is charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred, except b) Leasehold land and buildings – lower of valuers’ estimates or period 
where the borrowing ﬁnances tangible ﬁxed assets in the course of construction of lease. 
relating to power development projects. Such interest is capitalised until the asset No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land. 
is complete and is then written off by way of depreciation of the relevant asset. ii) Plant and equipment 
Interest receivable is credited to the proﬁt and loss account as earned. Depreciation is provided on the original cost of plant and equipment and is 
calculated on a straight line basis at rates sufﬁcient to reduce them to their

dividend scheme have been added back to reserves. The nominal value of shares iv) In course of construction 
issued under the scheme has been funded out of the share premium account. No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction. 
B Shares 
The Company issues B Shares to shareholders in place of a dividend. These can be 
redeemed for cash or converted into ordinary shares in the Company. As this is 
not classed as a dividend, no accrual is made for this in the ﬁnancial statements.

There are other deferred tax assets totalling £126m (2003 £119m) that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic beneﬁt is uncertain.

The undistributed proﬁts of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures may be liable to overseas taxes and/or United Kingdom tax (after allowing for double

tax relief ) if remitted as dividends to the UK. No deferred tax has been provided as there are currently no commitments to pay such dividends.

Where available, market values have been used to determine current values. Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting 
expected future cash ﬂows at prevailing interest and exchange rates. 
Cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term borrowings: 
The book value approximates to fair value either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of investments is reset after periods 
not greater than six months. 
Derivatives: 
The fair value of derivatives is the estimated amount, based on current market rates, which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the 
derivatives at the balance sheet date. 
Hedges of future transactions 
As described in the Finance Director’s review on pages 26 to 31 the Group’s policy is to hedge the following exposures: 
Interest rate risk – using interest swaps 
Currency exposures on future forecast sales – using forward foreign currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options 
Commodity price risk – using jet fuel swaps 
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are dealt with as outlined in the accounting policies on pages 57 and 58.

Certain special rights, set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, attach to the special rights redeemable preference share (special share) issued to 
HM Government. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, the special share may be redeemed by the Treasury Solicitor at par at any time. 
The special share confers no rights to dividends or to vote at general meetings but in the event of a winding-up it shall be repaid at its nominal value in priority to any 
other shares. 
During the year, the Group’s B Share scheme for the purpose of making payments to shareholders, received approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), and in 
June 83,922,435,550 non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference (B) shares of 0.1p were issued. Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their B Shares 
for cash or convert them into ordinary shares. B Shares retained, attract a dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a semi-annual 
basis, and have limited voting rights. In certain circumstances the Company will have the option to redeem the B Shares. This option can be exercised at any time if the 
aggregate number of B Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of B Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company. 
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of B Shares shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares, to the repayment of the 
nominal capital paid up or credited as paid-up on the B Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have 
accrued but not been paid until the date of return of capital. 
The redemption and conversion of B Shares shown in the above table took place on or as soon as possible after July 5, 2004, for shareholders who made an election 
on or before June 18, 2004. Future redemption and conversion opportunities are expected to be made available for holders of B Shares.

The cumulative amount of goodwill, arising on the acquisition of undertakings still in the Group at December 31, 2004, written off against other reserves amounts 
to £370m (2003 £372m). The continuance of this basis, in respect of pre-1998 acquisitions, is permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS 10. 
The Group has adopted UITF 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ which requires own shares to be reclassiﬁed within shareholders funds.Amounts relating to own shares have been included in the proﬁt and loss

account reserve.

Ordinary shares in the Company are held in two trusts:

i) In respect of employee share schemes. The shares held by this independently managed trust were purchased on the open market:

£m 
May 5, 2004 37,130 at £1.95 per share 
October 22, 2004 400,000 at £1.98 per share 
At December 31, 2004, the shares held had a market value of £1.1m. In accordance with UITF 17 ‘Employee share schemes’ , the Group is required to amortise the cost of likely awards over each separate

performance measurement period and to include this charge as part of the cost of ‘wages and salaries’ . The UITF is a committee of the Accounting Standards Board.

ii) In respect of a Qualifying Employee Share Trust (QUEST ), which provides employees with shares under Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn (SAYE) share schemes.

As permitted by UITF 17, no amortisation charge has been made. At December 31, 2004, a total of 410,747 of these shares had still not been allocated to option holders, their market value being £1.0m. 
These outstanding allocations are expected to occur in 2005. 
Both trusts have waived their voting rights, and their costs of administration have been charged to the Group’s proﬁt and loss account. 
A dividend of £601m was received on December 21, 2004 from a subsidiary company, Rolls-Royce plc. Of this amount, £550m is separately identiﬁed in the Company’s accounting records.

28 Contingent liabilities 
In connection with the sale of its products, on some occasions the Group enters into individually and collectively signiﬁcant long-term contingent obligations. These 
can involve, inter alia, guaranteeing ﬁnancing for customers, guaranteeing a proportion of the values of both engine and airframe, entering into leasing transactions, 
commitments to purchase aircraft and in certain circumstances could involve the Group assuming certain of its customers’ entitlements and related borrowing or cash 
ﬂow obligations until the value of the security can be realised. 
At the date these accounts are approved, the directors regard the possibility that there will be any signiﬁcant loss arising from these contingencies, which cover a 
number of customers over a long period of time, as remote. In determining this, and the values below, the directors have taken account of advice, principally from 
Airclaims Limited, professional aircraft appraisers, who base their calculations on a current and future fair market value basis assuming an arms-length transaction 
between a willing seller and a willing buyer. 
At December 31, 2004, the total gross contingent liabilities relating to ﬁnancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft less insurance arrangements and relevant 
provisions amounted to £999m (2003 £1,090m), of which £12m (2003 £39m) related to sales ﬁnance support to joint ventures. Taking into account the net realisable 
value of the relevant security, the net contingent liabilities in respect of ﬁnancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft amounted to £189m (2003 £184m). Sensitivity 
calculations are complex, but, for example, if the value of the relevant security was reduced by 20%, a net contingent liability of approximately £277m (2003 £262m) 
would result.There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many 
years in the future and the related ﬁnancing will only be put in place at the appropriate time. 
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery,performance and reliability. The 
Company and some of its subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export ﬁnance, performance bonds, 
countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of 
business, some of which are for substantial amounts. As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured 
against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Group’s UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those 
businesses by the Group. While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal 
actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in signiﬁcant loss to the Group or Company. 
In addition to the above, the Company has provided guarantees in respect of borrowings of subsidiary undertakings as shown in notes 18 and 20. 
29 Related party transactions

30 Post-retirement beneﬁts 
Pensions 
The Group’s pension schemes are mainly of the deﬁned beneﬁt type and the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds. 
The pension cost relating to the UK schemes is assessed in accordance with SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ , based on the advice of independent qualiﬁed 
actuaries using the projected unit method. The latest actuarial valuations of the principal schemes were as at March 31, 2004 (for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme), 
April 5, 2004 (for the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme), and March 31, 2003 (for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund). The principal assumptions used for the purpose of 
SSAP 24, were that in the long term the average returns on investments would be 2% per annum higher than the average increase in pay and 3.6% per annum higher 
than the average increase in pensions. Assets were valued on a market related basis for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme and the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme 
and on an actuarial basis for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund. 
The pension cost relating to overseas schemes is calculated in accordance with local best practice and regulations. 
The total pension cost for the Group was £123m (2003 £95m) of which £25m (2003 £23m) relates to overseas schemes. 
The aggregate of the market values of the UK schemes at the dates of the latest actuarial valuations was £3,804m. The actuarial value of the assets of the principal 
schemes represented respectively 92% (for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund), 79% (for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme) and 89% (for the Rolls-Royce Group Pension 
Scheme) of the value of the projected accrued liabilities. 
The difference between the value of the assets and the value of the projected accrued liabilities of the three principal schemes (after allowing for expected future 
increases in earnings and pension increases) is being amortised over periods of between 8.5 and 12 years, being the average expected remaining service lives of the 
pensionable employees. 
Prepayments of £263m (2003 £239m) are included in debtors and accruals of £22m (2003 £29m) are included in provisions for liabilities and charges, being the 
differences between the accumulated amounts paid into the pension funds and the accumulated pension costs. 
Post-retirement beneﬁts other than pensions 
In the USA, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Group’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance beneﬁts for retired 
employees. In the USA, 540 retired employees currently beneﬁt from these provisions and it is estimated that 4,385 current employees will be eligible on retirement. 
The cost of post-retirement beneﬁts other than pensions for the Group was £15m (2003 £17m). Provisions for the beneﬁt obligations at December 31, 2004 
amounted to £124m (2003 £119m) and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges. There were no plan assets at either December 31, 2004 or December 31, 
2003. The future costs of beneﬁts are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualiﬁed actuaries and are based on a weighted average discount rate of 
5.8% and a weighted average assumed healthcare costs trend rate of 8% grading down to 5% over seven years.

FRS 17 disclosures 
The full implementation of FRS 17 ‘Retirement Beneﬁts’ has been deferred, however certain disclosures are required which are included below. 
The valuations with respect to UK schemes have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation (as noted above) and updated by the scheme actuary to 
December 31, 2004 taking account of the requirements of FRS 17. For the material overseas deﬁned beneﬁt schemes the last formal actuarial valuations have been 
updated to December 31, 2004 by a qualiﬁed actuary taking account of the requirements of FRS 17.

85 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004  Directors’responsibilities 
for the ﬁnancial statements 
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each

ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company

and of the Group and of the proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing those

ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:

i) select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

ii) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

iii) state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject

to any material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial 
statements; and 
Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Rolls-Royce Group plc 
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements on pages 52 to 85. We have also 
audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as 
having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in 
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the directors’ 
remuneration report. As described on this page, this includes responsibility for 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibilities, as independent 
auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices 
Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession’s 
ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a 
true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, 
the directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed 
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is 
not disclosed. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement on pages 33 to 36 
reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC 
Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual report, including the 
corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the directors’ 
iv)	 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue 
in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
Company and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
ﬁnancial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of 
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in 
the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group's circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and the Group as at December 31, 2004 and of the proﬁt 
of the Group for the year then ended; and the ﬁnancial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

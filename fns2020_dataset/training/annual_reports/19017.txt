We are proud to be one of the 
UK’ s leading neighbourhood 
retailers with a growing network 
of 1,352 managed convenience 
stores and newsagents. 
Reflecting our strategic 
focus on the neighbourhood, 
we continue to add to our 
convenience store estate, which 
at 893 stores, represents two 
thirds of our total network. Continuing  
to grow
Operational and financial highlights
• In 2015, we delivered growth across a range 
of financial measures – increasing sales, profit 
before tax and EBITDA, whilst controlling 
costs and reducing debt.
• Our focus on neighbourhood convenience 
gained momentum as we moved ever closer 
to reaching our target of 1,000 convenience 
stores in 2016.  To this end, we acquired an 
additional 60 convenience stores and 
converted a further 45 of our newsagents to 
food and wine stores – bringing the period-end 
number of convenience stores to 893. In the 
multiples convenience store segment, we are 
the second biggest player in the UK. 
• As well as increasing our number of 
convenience stores, we also expanded the 
range of products and services our stores 
offer. In particular in 2015, we focussed on 
strengthening our food-to-go offer – notably 
by rolling out 148 new food-to-go modules 
across our stores and opening our first 
Subway franchise.
• We continued to build on our position as the 
UK’ s No.1 post office operator. We acquired 
72 new post offices, taking our total to 520. 
We also continued our programme of 
modernising our post offices – around  
90% are now in the new format.

Strategic report Chairman’ s statement
Leading in neighbourhood 
convenience
Sharon Brown
Interim chairman and 
non-executive director
• 
I am pleased to report another 
strong year, driven by our desire 
to bring ever-greater convenience 
to the UK’ s neighbourhoods.
Performing well
In 2015, our first full year as a public company, we continued 
to grow. Total sales increased by 3.1% and adjusted EBITDA
1
 
also grew by 3.1% (both adjusted for the 53rd week in 2014).
Further details of our trading performance are included 
in the financial review on page 23.  
Making the most of our listing
We have continued to capitalise on our listing on 
the London Stock Exchange’s main market in 2014. 
As planned, we have used funds to fuel and accelerate 
our performance in neighbourhood convenience, 
raising our profile and strengthening our brand by 
opening 60 new convenience stores in the year.
Development of our board and governance
In October 2015 John Coleman stepped down as non-
executive chairman in order to focus on new opportunities 
and I was appointed interim chairman. We would like to 
thank John for his hard work and everything he has done 
for McColl’s during a time of great change and progress 
for the business.
In November 2015 we announced that, as stated at the 
time of the IPO, James Lancaster would step down as chief 
executive. We are currently looking to find his replacement. 
Once the new chief executive is identified, James will be 
appointed as non-executive chairman, until the annual 
general meeting (AGM) in 201 7 .
With a new chief executive and James as non-executive 
chairman we will have a strong succession. Building on 
the great growth and transformation achieved under the 
leadership of James and his experienced team, we will 
continue to take the business forward for future success.
1. Excluding exceptional items and property gains and losses.
04 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 05
As a listed company committed to delivering long-term 
shareholder value, we operate to high standards of 
corporate governance. This is implemented through our 
audit, remuneration and nomination committees and 
supported by our non-executive directors, myself included. 
Full details of the committees and their duties are contained 
in the governance section of this annual report and the 
reports from the nomination, audit and remuneration 
committees on pages 48, 49 and 52 respectively.
To support the ongoing growth of the business and in line 
with best practice, we are also seeking to appoint a further 
independent non-executive director, who will also serve on 
all three committees.
Making a great difference
I’d like to thank each and every one of our 18,956 
colleagues for their outstanding contribution to the 
sustained success of our business. As a customer-focussed 
retail business, we are dedicated to providing a great, 
friendly service in local neighbourhood stores and our 
colleagues are the ones who make this happen.
Delivering dividend growth
The business continues to generate strong cash returns 
which we use to fund capital investment and a stated 
aim of progressive dividend payments to shareholders. 
The board is recommending a final dividend of 6.8 pence 
per share, making a total dividend for the period of 10.2 
pence. This dividend will be paid on 31 May 2016, to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
29 April 2016, subject to approval at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting.
Looking forward
I believe we are on an exciting path at McColl’s; 
a path that is seeing us strengthen our position as a 
leading UK neighbourhood convenience store business. 
The market remains competitive and fast-changing but 
we are confident that our position and chosen direction 
will continue to stand us in good stead. Looking forward, 
we will press on with our growth plans as we make the 
most of bringing convenience to the UK’s neighbourhoods.

Strategic report Great neighbourhood  
stores across the UK
Through our network of 1,352 neighbourhood stores, our 18,956 dedicated 
colleagues serve 4.6m customers every week.  We aim to continue to 
strengthen and grow our business by building on the key part our 
neighbourhood stores play in many people’ s daily lives.
Our group at a glance
McColl’ s Retail Group is the holding 
company for a portfolio of convenience 
store and newsagent brands.
Convenience
Our 893 convenience stores provide 
a great range of everyday products 
and services to local people living in 
neighbourhoods across the UK.
From a pint of milk in the morning to 
an evening meal, from an open-all-hours 
post office to a great selection of fresh fruit 
and vegetables and food-to-go, from 
the newspapers delivered to your door to 
internet collection and returns around the 
corner – our convenience stores are at the 
heart of the UK’ s neighbourhoods.
Newsagents 
With 459 newsagents across 
the country, we are the UK’ s 
No. 1 specialist confectioner, 
tobacconist and newsagent. 
Our newsagents are not 
only a strong and established 
part of the business, but also 
provide a valuable foundation 
for our continued growth 
in convenience through 
our ongoing programme 
of conversions to 
convenience stores.
06 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 07
Serving our 
customers
We’re deeply committed to 
serving our customers across 
the UK. Our long-standing 
link with the Basildon Triangle 
community is a great 
example – where a disaster 
proved to be the catalyst for 
a brand new store.
Being there for 
neighbourhoods
We believe what’s good for 
the neighbourhood is good 
for our business. At our 
recently acquired Malton 
store for example, offering 
more for the neighbourhood 
has led to a boost in sales.
Making the most  
of food-to-go
We’re putting a big 
emphasis on making the 
most of food-to-go, for our 
customers and our business. 
A key highlight here is the 
success of our first Subway 
franchise, in Tamworth.

Strategic report Chief executive’ s review
Forging ahead with 
neighbourhood convenience
James Lancaster
Chief executive
• 
For us, 2015 was a year of continuing 
to focus on executing our strategy to 
maintain and enhance our position 
as a leading UK neighbourhood 
convenience business. 
Meeting expectations
In terms of the numbers, we delivered in line with 
expectations, continuing to grow and improve on 
2014. Total revenue, adjusted for the 53rd week in 2014, 
increased by 3.1%. Like-for-like sales decreased by 
1.9% overall. Like-for-like sales in premium convenience 
(with a wider range of products) and food and wine 
decreased by just 0.6% – a strong performance in a 
challenging market and another confirmation of our 
strategic focus on neighbourhood convenience.  
Like-for-like sales in standard convenience and 
newsagents decreased by 4.0%. 
We increased adjusted earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and property 
gains and losses to £37.7m, up by 3.1% adjusted for the 53rd 
week in 2014. Operating profit before exceptional items 
decreased by £1.2m to £24.3m (2014: £25.5m); however, 
adjusting for the 53rd week and property gains and losses, 
underlying performance remained broadly flat.
Through continued cash generation, we reduced net 
debt by £5.8m. At the same time, we increased net capital 
expenditure to £22.7m compared to £19.3m in 2014.
We also took the opportunity in August 2015 to refinance 
our £85m revolving credit facility and £15m accordion 
facility on improved terms. We reduced interest costs and 
extended the period to August 2020 to give us even better 
medium-term funding security, which will help us execute 
our strategy with confidence. The results are covered in 
more detail in the financial review on pages 23 to 25.
Expanding the number and nature of our stores
We are well on our way to achieving our target of 1,000 
convenience stores by the end of 2016. We acquired 60 
new convenience stores and converted 45 newsagents 
to our food and wine format, bringing our total number 
of convenience stores to 893. With this 1,000 convenience 
stores target well within our reach, it’s natural for our 
business to look to the next stage in our evolution. This will 
see us shifting our attention increasingly towards not only 
growing the number of convenience stores we have, but 
also expanding the range of products and services we 
offer in our stores. In 2015, for example, we put a targeted 
range of alcohol into 100 of our newsagents – a revenue-
enhancing step with a high return on a small investment.
08 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 09
Evolving our stores
The way we are evolving our network of stores – to give 
our customers every kind of convenience they need 
on their doorstep – fits in well with the broader changes 
going on in the market. The buzz phrase is omni-channel 
shopping, where people are increasingly shopping in 
many different places and topping up more frequently, 
in person and online, rather than the old way of doing 
one bulk shop from one big store once a fortnight or so. 
This trend, as well as demographic changes, favours our 
focus on neighbourhood convenience. We want to be 
the store for everyone living within half a mile or so of our 
shopfront – the one our customers can come to for the 
things they need, and have the opportunity to work in 
too, if they like. 
Bringing convenience and food-to-go together
In particular, we are moving on from a typical convenience 
store to one where the lines are blurred between 
convenience and food-to-go. We want to bring the two 
together in a new way for the UK’s neighbourhoods. So of 
course we will continue to offer our customers milk, baked 
beans, newspapers and other everyday items, but we will 
also provide a great range of take-away food and drinks 
throughout the day – from morning coffees to late-night 
hot snacks.
Increasing our food-to-go offer
Coffee and sausage rolls in the morning, sandwiches 
and fruit pots at lunchtime, hot snacks and ready meals 
in the evening, fresh bread throughout the day are all 
available in our convenience stores – if you want food-to-go 
in your neighbourhood, we’re there for you. This was a big 
focus for us in 2015. We now have a dedicated head 
of our food-to-go business, supported by trained teams 
and individuals across our stores. So we are putting a lot 
of effort behind the all-important people side of driving 
food-to-go sales. We are also investing in the necessary 
equipment. Through 2015, we rolled out 33 large format 
food-to-go modules across our stores and 1 15 smaller 
modules, which represents a big step forward for the group.
We are getting good growth from our food-to-go business 
– sales have significantly increased throughout the year 
– and we will continue to make this a key focus of our 
business into the future.
We are 
proud to be 
a leader in 
neighbourhood 
convenience
Strategic report Chief executive’ s review continued
Partnering with Subway
We also opened a Subway franchise in one of our stores 
and as part of our strategy, we are running the franchise 
ourselves, enabling us to integrate it fully in the store 
and make the most of the enhanced food-to-go offer 
this popular brand brings. One particularly welcome 
advantage of partnering with Subway is that it helps to 
bring into our stores a younger group of customers. The 
launch of this addition to our food-to-go offer has been 
a great success and we plan to introduce more Subway 
franchises across our network.
Providing much-loved post office services
We acquired 72 new post offices in 2015 and now have 520 
in our stores. We are the UK’s No.1 post office operator – 
running more than the Post Office itself. Our modernisation 
programme continued, with a further 23 existing post 
offices being converted to the new format. Around 90% 
of our post offices have now been modernised. We always 
like to have a strong reason to be in a neighbourhood – 
to be more than just a great local shop. Often that means 
being the post office too; moreover, one which stays open 
as long as our stores do – so you can pop in late at night 
to post a package while topping up your shopping. 
Offering a great range of neighbourhood  
services and opportunities
Post offices are just one example of our commitment 
to offering our customers an ever-greater range of 
neighbourhood services. We deliver newspapers to around 
130,000 homes, for example. No other business makes as 
many paper deliveries, or creates as many opportunities 
for young people to earn some well-deserved pocket 
money. Moreover, with our commitment to offering local 
people great career opportunities, that first job delivering 
papers can turn into a part-time or permanent position 
in-store and onwards and upwards to management.
Alongside paper deliveries, we provide many other 
neighbourhood services such as lottery tickets, bill 
payment, cash machines and internet collection and 
return points – all just a short walk from where our 
customers live.
Continuing our loyalty scheme
Our dedicated Plus card loyalty scheme is proving to be 
a very successful way to thank our customers for shopping 
with us and strengthening our bond with them. To date 
we have nearly 450,000 loyalty card customers who now 
regularly use their card in store to access the great offers 
available to them.
Anticipating and responding
The market continues to be very competitive, with pressures 
for all players – from food price deflation to rising costs such 
as the increase in the National Minimum Wage and 
introduction of the Living Wage. But as a long established 
retail business with a very experienced leadership team 
we are used to anticipating and actively managing the 
challenges as well as seeing and capitalising on the 
opportunities – this is part of what makes retail so 
interesting and inspiring.

• We have a highly experienced 
management team
• Our 18,956 colleagues 
deliver high levels of friendly 
customer service
• We have national scale and brand 
awareness across the UK
• We offer a wide range of products 
and services to local customers
• We directly manage and develop 
our network of stores
• We invest in customer-facing 
information systems and ongoing

Generating additional value from selling 100 newsagents
Although convenience is our focus, we have carried 
on continuously reviewing our portfolio of newsagents. 
As well as converting a further 45 newsagents to 
convenience stores, we also announced in October 2015 
that after reviewing our portfolio we had decided to sell 
100 newsagents (subsequently 3 have been withdrawn 
from sale). This sale will generate additional funds 
to reinvest in acquiring and enhancing convenience 
stores. This is an ongoing part of our neighbourhood 
convenience strategy. 
Controlling costs
We kept a sharp eye on costs across the business and 
took a number of steps to control costs and improve 
efficiency. This included reducing headcount at our 
head office. We have industry-leading levels of stock loss. 
We also continually monitor all our running costs, achieving 
ongoing improvements in energy efficiency across our 
stores for example.
Streamlining our regional management
In 2015 we streamlined our regional management, so that 
we now have regional managers responsible for both the 
convenience stores and newsagents in their region. This 
was a natural change as the number of our convenience 
stores grows and the number of newsagents decreases 
progressively. It has helped us increase both efficiency 
and control.
Managing our trading times
As part of our ongoing efficiency drive, we have been 
managing our store trading times to make sure we stay 
open the optimum number of hours in each individual 
location. This store-by-store management is an example 
of our commitment to actively manage the business to 
achieve best results.
Looking ahead
As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, for us it’s essentially 
about continuing to execute our strategy with ever-greater 
intensity and success. More focus on neighbourhood 
convenience. More growth in our stores as we close in on 
our 1,000 convenience stores target. More expansion and 
enhancement of the products and services we offer to our 
local and loyal customers. More chilled, fresh and food-to-
go options. More close cost control. More great jobs for 
our current and future colleagues. More positive impact 
on the neighbourhoods we live and work in. In short, more 
McColl’s, as we continue to strive and excel at bringing the 
very best convenience stores to the UK’s neighbourhoods.
Having led the business for over 40 years, I have seen it 
change and develop a long way from its earliest days to 
the strong and successful company it is today. As I prepare 
to step down as chief executive and take up the role as 
non-executive chairman, I am proud to say McColl’s is in 
great shape and has an exciting future. I look forward to 
the company I know and love forging ahead in bringing 
ever-greater convenience to the UK’s neighbourhoods.

Strategic report There for the Triangle
We’ve been serving the Basildon 
Triangle community for many years  
– our original store was part of the 
parade of shops that opened there 
back in 1976. Over time, we’ve built 
up a lot of loyalty with local residents 
and we’re proud to be a popular part 
of the neighbourhood. 
But on 3 January 2013 disaster struck 
when a fire completely burned out 
the parade, forcing all the shops to 
close. We were very keen to open up 
for our customers as quickly as 
possible. Working closely with local 
residents and the council, we opened 
a temporary unit in September 2013 
offering the majority of the products 
and services our neighbours had 
relied on us for. 
Through 2015 we built the new 
permanent store, complete with a 
modernised post office and a great 
new range of chilled food and 
groceries. The Mayor of Basildon 
officially opened the new store on 
20 November 2015 – a great start 
for the latest chapter in our Basildon 
Triangle story.
The development 
looks fantastic 
and is a vast 
improvement

Strategic report Market overview
Making the most  
of our strength in 
convenience
We continue to focus ever more 
intently on the UK’ s growing 
convenience sector – providing 
access to great products and 
services to a growing number of 
neighbourhoods while capitalising 
on our position as the country’ s 
leading newsagent.
Convenience continues to grow
The convenience sector continues to grow. It accounts 
for an increasingly significant proportion of the UK grocery 
market, with sales of £37.7bn in 2015 comprising 21.2% 
of market share, compared to £26.2bn in 2008 (a 18.9% 
market share). This represents a compound annualised 
growth rate of 5.3%, compared to a 3.5% increase for 
the grocery market as a whole. In 2015 the convenience 
channel was over four times the size of online in the 
grocery market.
We are 
leading the 
way in bringing 
ever-greater 
convenience 
to the UK’ s 
neighbourhoods

The convenience channel has seen another year of 
growth, up 5.1% year-on-year. This growth is in line with that 
of the previous year. Against a backdrop of a total grocery 
market which is growing at around +2%, the convenience 
channel continues to outperform.

The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) forecasts that the 
UK convenience sector will grow at an average of 3.2% per 
annum over the next five years, generating sales of £44bn 
and accounting for 22% of the grocery market by 2020. 
Changing lifestyles favour convenience
The growth in convenience is driven by changing 
lifestyles, notably:
• 
people opting for less frequent big shops and more 
frequent small shops such as top-ups, meals-for-tonight, 
food-to-go and fresh food for the next few days;
• 
households as a whole wanting to shop for value 
and waste less food;
• 
the increasing number of single households in the UK;
• 
the ageing population;
• 
the growth in the female working population;
• 
increasing working hours resulting in less time 
to shop; and
• 
an improvement in convenience stores in terms 
of quality and new products and services such 
as internet collections and returns.
The convenience players
There are a number of different players in the convenience 
sector: multiples (owned and managed networks of 
convenience stores such as ours and those of the 
supermarket groups), symbols (networks of self-employed 
operators that share the same name above the door, 
such as Nisa or Spar), independents, petrol forecourts 
and co-operatives. 
We are the second largest multiple convenience store 
operator in the UK, owning and managing a network 
of 893 convenience stores.

Strategic report Market overview continued
Greater competition and consolidation
As the popularity of convenience stores increases so does 
the competition. As a result, the market is consolidating, 
with the number of symbols, multiples and co-operative 
stores increasing by 12.6% since 2009. In 2015 these groups 
accounted for 71.7% of convenience sector sales. 
Multiples account for 21.8% of sector sales. According 
to the Institute for Grocery Distribution, the number of 
multiples increased from 2,812 to 4,173 between 2009 and 
2015, the largest percentage increase of all the players 
over this period.
Market pressures
The market remains challenging for all players, with 
the broad trends of continued pressure on customers’ 
disposable income, price-driven competition, decreasing 
food prices and rising costs, for example through increases 
in the National Minimum Wage. However, our focus on 
growing our premium convenience business – and the 
range of products and services we offer – provides the 
right response to these challenges.

 Co-ops
Multiples have experienced the fastest growth in store numbers over the last 12 months, 
increasing by 10.6% (+401 stores). Although representing the largest increase in store 
numbers, multiples still account for fewer than 1 in 10 stores. Co-operatives and symbol 
groups have grown store numbers by 3.2% and 1.6% respectively.

Top-up shopping and food for now and later  
are big value generators
Shoppers topping up and people looking to buy food for 
now and later tend to spend more. They are also key in 
driving the value growth in our sector. That’s good for our 
neighbourhood convenience-focussed business. 
A valuable platform for growth
Our network of newsagents has provided us with a 
valuable platform for growth. The newsagent sector 
is highly fragmented, with a few large players such as 
ourselves and many smaller, independent operators. 
We capitalise on our strength in newsagents to generate 
revenue and cash for the group, meet the needs of 
neighbourhoods across the UK and provide a great 
foundation for our focus on growth in convenience. 
Since 2011, we have been converting a number of 
our newsagents to food and wine convenience stores, 
enabling us to offer a wider range of products and services 
to neighbourhoods and, in turn, boosting our revenue 
and profit. In 2015, we converted a further 45 newsagents 
in this way, bringing the total number of conversions to 
date to 180. 
Building on our distinctive neighbourhood  
convenience offer
With our long-held focus on convenience and our 
experience in running and developing a strong network 
of neighbourhood stores, we are well placed to make the 
most of the growth opportunities in UK convenience. 
Our network of managed convenience stores is unlike any 
other. We have neighbourhood stores at the heart of where 
people live, rather than on the high streets near where 
people work or with purely passing trade. Moreover, our 
stores offer local people excellent everyday products and 
services at great value provided by friendly staff who are 
always happy to help, and often live nearby themselves. 
So in terms of both where they are, what they offer and the 
part they play locally – our neighbourhood convenience 
stores stand out.
Building on this distinctive offer, we aim to continue 
increasing our convenience stores from 893 at the financial 
year end to 1,000 by the end of 2016 through acquisitions 
of new stores, mainly independents and symbols, and 
ongoing conversions of our newsagents. At the same time 
we will progressively expand the range and quality of 
products and services we offer neighbourhoods across 
the UK through our network of stores on their doorstep.
Food for now and food for later  
will continue to drive the value  
growth in our market

Financial review
A strong track  
record of sales 
and profit growth
Jonathan Miller FCA
Chief financial officer
• 
In 2015 we delivered our fifth 
consecutive year of sales and 
adjusted EBITDA growth, capitalising 
on our convenience focussed 
strategy to generate returns for 
our shareholders.
Revenue
I am pleased to report that our full year revenue grew 
to £932.2m (2014: £922.4m), an increase of 3.1% having 
adjusted for the impact of the 53rd week in the prior period. 
This performance, supported by our acquisition and 
conversion programme, was achieved in spite of continuing 
strong headwinds in the retail sector in particular within 
food. Full year like-for-like (LFL) sales were down by 1.9%, 
however, in the final quarters of the year we delivered an 
improving LFL trend. Additionally, our premium convenience 
and food and wine stores, the prioritised focus of our recent 
investment, were only slightly down by 0.6% LFL. 
Gross profit
Gross profit margins improved year on year by 20 basis 
points, from 24.2% in 2014 to 24.4% in 2015. This increase 
reflects the more profitable mix of sales in convenience, 
as these stores become an increasing proportion of our 
portfolio. This improvement is set against a backdrop of 
competition in the sector and price deflation across a 
number of staple categories. Total gross profit grew to 
£227 .5m (2014: £222.8m), an increase of 4.1%, adjusting 
for the 53rd week.
Operating profit
Operating profit increased by £1.6m, from £22.0m in 2014 
to £23.6m in 2015. Operating profit before exceptional 
items decreased by £1.2m to £24.3m (2014: £25.5m); 
however, adjusting for the 53rd week and property gains 
and losses, underlying performance remained broadly 
flat. Although profit improvement was achieved through 
growing total revenues and improving gross margin, 
administrative expenses, before exceptional costs, 
increased as a percentage of revenue to 24.3% (2014: 
24.2%). Whilst costs continue to be tightly managed 
across all business areas, the increase reflects the 
higher cost structure in convenience stores. 
Other operating income before exceptional income 
reduced from £25.7m in 2014 to £23.6m in 2015, reflecting 
the additional week’s trading in 2014 and £0.7m lower profit 
on asset disposals.
Gross profit 
margins 
improved 
year on year 
by 20 basis 
points
Strategic report Financial review continued
Exceptional costs in the period were £0.6m, which related 
to a first half programme of restructuring, undertaken in 
order to reduce future administrative overheads.
Net finance costs
As previously reported, we were able to substantially 
reduce our finance costs following our IPO in February 
2014. In 2015 we saw a full year of these benefits, with net 
finance costs reducing to £2.5m (2014: £6.2m). During the 
course of 2015 we also entered into an improved working 
capital facility, improving the margin paid by at least 50 
basis points.
Profit before tax
Profit on ordinary activities before taxation increased to 
£21.1m (2014: £12.6m), reflecting the significant exceptional 
costs incurred in 2014 and reduced finance costs. 
Excluding exceptional items, profit before tax increased 
by £2.5m or 12.9% year on year.
Taxation
The tax charge for the period increased to £5.0m  
(2014: £2.7m), representing an effective tax rate of 23.7% 
(2014: 21.6%) compared to the statutory rate for the period 
of 20.3%. This included a £0.7m deferred tax adjustment 
in respect of prior periods, without which the effective 
tax rate is 20.4%.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased to 15.4 pence  
(2014: 10.2 pence). Adjusted earnings per share, stated 
before exceptional items and the prior year deferred tax 
adjustment, increased to 16.5 pence (2014: 15.6 pence).
Dividends
I am pleased to confirm that the board has 
recommended a final dividend of 6.8 pence per 
share (2014: 6.8 pence), in line with our dividend 
policy. The total dividend for the period will therefore 
be 10.2 pence per share (2014: 8.5 pence).
Balance sheet
Following another year of profitable growth, total 
shareholders’ funds at the end of the period increased 
by £8.8m to £126.0m (2014: £117.2m). 
The book value of goodwill and other intangibles, property, 
plant and equipment increased by £8.1m to £210.3m (2014: 
£202.2m), driven by our programme of capital investment.
Current assets at the end of the period increased to 
£99.9m (2014: £87 .3m). This was principally due to increased 
stockholding as sales grew and mix changed, alongside 
increased cash balances and the reclassification of 97 
newsagents as assets held for sale. The cash generated 
from the disposal of these newsagents will be used to further 
invest in new stores to support our growth in convenience. 
Our current liabilities increased to £135.8m (2014: £116.9m), 
reflecting higher trade and other payables, due to the 
impact of the 53rd week in 2014 reducing the prior  
year-end position. 
Non-current liabilities reduced to £58.3m (2014: £61.9m), 
as we continued to reduce our borrowings and improve 
our gearing post IPO.

Pensions
We continue to operate two defined benefit pension 
schemes, both of which are closed to future accrual. 
The combined surplus in the two schemes improved 
by £4.8m to £6.1m (2014: £1.3m combined surplus). 
Following the latest actuarial valuation of the schemes in 
2013, agreement was reached with the trustees as to the 
future contribution level, which was set at £1.5m per 
annum, increasing annually by inflation. The next actuarial 
review is due in 2016.
Cash flow and net debt
We continued to generate strong operational cash flows. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the period 
increased by over 25% to £43.5m (2014: £34.6m). This 
improvement was driven by increased pre-tax profits and 
a net cash inflow from working capital.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by £0.4m to £37.7m (2014: 
£37.3m). There was a working capital inflow in the period 
of £10.5m (2014: £2.3m outflow), as we reversed the 
impacts of the 53rd week in the prior year. This meant 
that the prior period included additional cash outflows, 
for example, 13 monthly payroll payments. The combined 
impact of these effects on working capital in the prior year 
was an outflow of £11.7m.
Combined pension surplus 
£6.1m
£1.3m 2014
Net debt 
£31.6m
£37 .4m 2014
Net capital expenditure increased by £3.4m to £22.7m 
(2014: £19.3m). This reflects our continued programme 
of investment, predominantly relating to acquisitions 
and store developments. In the period we added 60 
premium convenience stores, completed 45 food and 
wine conversions and delivered approximately 150 store  
food-to-go upgrades.
Net finance expense of £2.5m was £1.7m lower than the 
prior year, due to the lower cost capital structure post IPO.
The interim and final dividends paid in the period 
totalled £10.7m.
Net debt at the end of the period improved to £31.6m 
(2014: £37.4m), representing 0.8 times adjusted EBITDA.
Debt refinancing
During the period, the group entered into an improved 
£85.0m working capital facility. This improved facility not only 
extended the term, which now runs through until August 
2020, but it also saw a reduction in the cost of borrowing by 
at least 50 basis points. At the end of the period drawings 
against this facility were £44.5m (2014: £46.0m).
Overall, I remain confident that we are in a 
strong financial position and have sufficient 
funding in place to deliver our strategy to 
profitably grow our convenience business. 
We have a great track record of growing 
sales and profits and will continue to work 
hard to maintain this progression.

Corporate responsibility
Being a good  
neighbour
We are at the heart of many different 
neighbourhoods across the UK 
and are committed to playing our 
part responsibly. 
From providing everyday access to great products and 
services to offering flexible job opportunities, from doing 
the right thing for the environment to donating to local 
charities – we actively seek to make a real long-term 
difference to the people and communities we live and 
work with. 
This is essentially about being a good neighbour – 
a neighbour you like having close by and can rely 
on to be there for you.
Communities
Raising money at Halloween
It’s a tradition now at McColl’s – every Halloween for the 
past three years the whole group gets into the spirit of raising 
money for a great cause: research into sudden death in 
young adults. Every week in the UK, 12 apparently fit and 
healthy young people die suddenly from undiagnosed 
heart conditions. In 80% of cases, there are no signs or 
symptoms. Colleagues and customers across the group 
took part in a range of fundraising events and made in-store 
donations over Halloween. This year we raised over £195,000 
for St George’s, University of London, to help fund research.
Making A Difference Locally
We continue to take part in the Making A Difference 
Locally (MADL) campaign. The money raised goes to local 
good causes chosen by each store’s manager and their 
customers – so it stays in the neighbourhood.
Turning plastic bags into charity funds
We continue to raise charity funds through the mandatory 
5p charge on plastic bags. Since the extension of this rule 
in October 2015 to include the whole of the UK, we have 
been able to raise even more money for good causes. 
We are currently set to raise around £600,000 a year in 
this way. So far, we have donated over £66,000 to St 
George’s, University of London, and over £68,000 to 
various local causes.

Environment
As part of our commitment to being a responsible 
neighbourhood business, we aim to act in a sustainable 
way, through efficiency, recycling and compliance.
Improving energy efficiency
We have an ongoing commitment to improving our 
energy efficiency. Take fridges, our biggest energy user. 
By fitting glass doors to our new refrigeration, we save 
about 30% of the energy costs – which is good both for 
our bottom line and the environment. In addition, all new 
stores have energy saving LED lighting. Other initiatives 
include removing surplus or particularly inefficient 
equipment from our stores; undertaking measures such 
as last man out switches; and photocells that switch 
lighting on and off when areas aren’t used. Many of our 
stores have live energy monitors, so we can see how much 
energy each stores uses in real time and actively manage 
them accordingly.
In 2015 we reduced our like-for-like energy consumption by 
a further 1.1%, building on reductions of 1.6% in 2014 and 
5.6% in 2013. This is all the more impressive given that we’ve 
increased our chilled space – all of which requires energy.
Recycling packaging
Through our arrangements with our two key distributors 
we recycle plastic and cardboard used in our business. 
The same lorries that arrive with products leave with plastic 
and cardboard, so no additional miles are involved – it’s a 
neat energy-efficient way to recycle packaging. So far, we 
have recycled well over 1,500 tonnes of waste.
Colleagues
Making all the difference
Just as we are at the heart of the UK’s neighbourhoods, 
so our colleagues are at the heart of our business. 
Their commitment, friendliness and professionalism 
make all the difference. We invest in recruiting, retaining 
and developing great people, many of them from the 
local communities we serve. For example, we delivered 
approximately 6,000 hours of new starter induction 
training in this year alone. Also, the vast majority of our 
colleagues live a short distance from the stores they 
work in, so we are all bound together in the same 
shared neighbourhood enterprise.

Strategic report Corporate responsibility continued
Our responsible 
approach has  
five pillars
Developing people
We are committed to equal opportunities for colleagues 
at all levels. 
To help embed and build on our friendly professional 
way of working, we have an induction programme for 
our store-based colleagues. It includes modules on, for 
example, fresh foods in response to the ongoing growth 
and developments in our convenience business. 
We also run an academy for area managers and a 
vibrant apprenticeship programme. Currently we have 
175 apprentices across the group and offer a range of 
retail-based qualifications to other colleagues.
We also run a very successful onwards and upwards 
development programme for our colleagues, focusing on 
some of the key roles within the business. Many of today’s 
store managers started out with us on a paper round or as 
sales assistants, underlining the career opportunities we 
provide and the role we play for local people. 
Rewarding people
We offer a range of benefits for colleagues as well as 
flexible working opportunities. Through our employee 
handbook for example, we ensure everyone across the 
group understands what’s available to them as well as 
what is expected of them. It’s all part of our desire to foster 
a strong and enjoyable high-performing retail business.

Recognising people
We like to recognise the outstanding contributions of our 
people. One of the ways we do this is through rewarding 
long service each year. Many of our colleagues have been 
with us for many years – we’re proud to have such a high 
level of loyalty. In 2015 we gave our Lifetime Achievement 
Award to John Walter, who has worked for us for over 40 
years, starting out as a paperboy back in 1975 and working 
his way up to senior management.
We also hold annual Store Of The Year Awards to recognise 
exceptional contributions from across our network. 2015’s 
Overall Store of the Year Winner went to Michael Elliott’s 
store in Birch Hill, Bracknell. The judges were impressed 
by how Michael led his store to a year of profitable, 
sustainable growth.
Reflecting our ever-more intensive focus on food-to-go 
across McColl’s, in 2015 we introduced a 10-week incentive 
across 7 food-to-go categories, awarding prizes to the 
winning store managers.
Human rights
We treat people in line with internationally proclaimed 
human rights principles. The group does not have a 
specific human rights policy; however, a number of policies 
are in place that demonstrate effective management of 
human rights issues in the business. 
Health and safety
We continue to demonstrate our commitment to health 
and safety across the group. 
Through our health and safety committee, strategy and 
forums, we take a consistent and collaborative approach 
to creating a safe place for our employees and customers.
In 2015, staff safety was a key focus. We invested in staff 
safety technology across key locations. We also worked 
closely with insurers, brokers and local authorities to 
advance our risk management, for example by increasing 
proactive risk management in stores. By improving the level 
of compliance across our business we saw a downturn in 
employee liability claims. In addition, we began to use 
technology to record risk assessments and incidents, to 
improve due diligence and enable us to react to incidents 
quickly. All these initiatives are managed and monitored 
through a health and safety governance group of 
executives and senior management.

Good for Malton
On 26 May 2015 we acquired a 
store in Malton. It had been running 
for a number of years and was 
situated in what is, for us, a classic 
neighbourhood location – serving 
a mix of around 900 households 
and passing trade. We quickly set 
about improving the store for the 
local community. We extended 
trading by 30 hours a week. 
We made the cash machine free 
for withdrawals. We began offering 
a broad range of fresh and chilled 
food. We modernised the store layout. 
In short, we transformed it into a 
great example of a McColl’s 
neighbourhood convenience 
store. The response from the local 
community has been fantastic, and 
the increase in store sales has been 
great too. It’s a fine example of 
a McColl’s truth: what’s good for 
the neighbourhood is good for 
our business.
It’ s important as 
a retailer to be at 
the heart of the 
neighbourhood, 
providing a great 
service to the 
community

36 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 37
• 
On 2 October 2015, John Coleman resigned as an 
independent non-executive director and chairman 
of the board and Sharon Brown was appointed as

and was replaced by Sharon Brown on 6 October 2015. 
He also ceased being a member of the audit and 
remuneration committees.
Directors’ interests
Although the directors are not required to hold shares 
in the company under the articles or under their letters 
of appointment or service agreements, all of the directors 
do hold shares in the company and details of their 
shareholdings can be found in the directors’ 
remuneration report on page 67.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
As is standard practice for listed companies, the company 
has granted third party indemnity to each of its directors

proceedings brought against them to the fullest extent 
permitted under English law. In addition the company 
has in place directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance 
and specific public offering and securities insurance, 
which commenced on 28 February 2014 with a 6 year 
run-off period.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The rules regarding the appointment and replacement 
of directors are contained in the company’s articles. 
These state that any person willing to act as a director 
may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the company’s 
shareholders. In addition, the board may appoint any 
person willing to act as a director, but they may hold office 
only until the next annual general meeting (AGM) and 
then shall be eligible for election. The company must have 
not less than two directors.

Under the articles each director is required to retire from 
office at the third AGM after the AGM at which he or she 
was last elected or re-elected although he or she may 
be re-elected by ordinary resolution if eligible and willing. 
As the company is outside of the FTSE 350 the company 
is not obliged to comply with provision B.7 relating to the 
annual re-election of directors. However, the directors 
wish to be transparent in all their dealings and accordingly, 
all of the directors will submit themselves for annual  
re-election by the shareholders at the AGM. The company 
is therefore in complying with this provision of the code.
The company may by special resolution remove any 
director before the expiration of his or her period of office 
or may, by ordinary resolution, remove a director where 
special notice has been given and the necessary statutory 
procedures are complied with. 
Details of the independent non-executive directors’ letters 
of appointment are given on page 45 under Role of the 
independent non-executive directors. The executive 
directors have service contracts under which 12 months’ 
notice is required from either party.

Governance Directors’ report continued
The group also works in partnership with Skillnet, a national 
provider of vocational qualifications, offering opportunities 
to all eligible colleagues to gain retail based qualifications 
whilst working in their current role.
The directors recognise the importance of ensuring the 
highest standards of health and safety are maintained for 
employees, customers and others who may be affected 
by the activities of the business.
The group is committed to being an equal opportunities 
employer and aims to treat individuals fairly and not to 
discriminate on the basis of sex, race, ethnic origin, 
disability or on any other basis. The company’s policy 
and procedures are designed to provide for full and 
fair consideration and selection, including disabled 
applicants, to ensure they are properly trained to perform 
safely and effectively and to provide career opportunities 
that allow them to fulfil their potential. Where an employee 
becomes disabled in the course of their employment the 
group will actively seek to retain them wherever possible by 
making adjustments to their work content and environment 
or by retraining them to undertake new roles.
Directors’ statement of disclosure 
of information to auditors
Having made the requisite enquiries, the directors in office 
at the date of this annual report and accounts have 
each confirmed that, so far as they are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the group’s auditors are 
unaware, and each of the directors has taken all the steps 
he/she ought to have taken as a director to make himself/
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the group’s auditors are aware of that 
information. This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 
418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
External auditors
Deloitte LLP have given their independent report on the 
financial statements to the shareholders of the company 
on pages 72 – 77.
Annual general meeting (AGM)
The board welcome the opportunity to meet with 
shareholders at the AGM which will be held on 19 April 
2016 at 2.00pm at the registered office: McColl’s House, 
Ashwells Road, Brentwood, Essex CM15 9ST.
Powers of directors
The general powers of the directors are set out in article 
94 of the company’s articles (the “articles”). This provides 
that the business of the company shall be managed by the 
board which may exercise all the powers of the company, 
subject to any limitations imposed by applicable legislation 
or the articles. The general powers of the directors are also 
limited by any directions given by special resolution of the 
shareholders of the company which are applicable on the 
date that any power is exercised. 
Compensation for loss of office
The company does not have arrangements with any 
director that would provide compensation for loss of 
office or employment resulting from a takeover, except 
that provisions of the company’s share plans may cause 
options and awards granted under such plans to vest on 
a takeover. Further information is provided in the directors’ 
remuneration report on page 65.
Employee engagement
The group employs 18,956 employees and had 6,356 
full time equivalents at the period end.
The group actively involves its employees in the business 
and ensures that they are engaged in matters impacting 
them. This includes consulting with employees or their 
representatives on a regular basis so that the views of 
employees are understood by the management and can 
be taken into account in making decisions which are likely 
to affect their interests. This is primarily achieved via senior 
management meetings and briefings. 
Employees are also made aware of the financial and 
economic factors affecting the performance of the group 
via newsletters and briefings by management. The group 
encourages the involvement of employees in the group’s 
performance through operation of a bonus scheme which 
applies to 133 employees and provides an incentive to 
the employees.
The group provides its employees with a variety of 
opportunities to learn new skills that will help them to 
develop and be successful in their careers. This includes 
using a combination of video learning, distance learning 
modules, on-the-job coaching and some classroom based 
workshops where applicable. In addition all employees 
receive induction training when they commence 
employment with the group.
For those employees wishing to progress, we operate 
the “Onward and Upward” development programme 
focussing on some of the key roles within the business. 
Each individual is provided with a tailored training plan 
based on their current job knowledge and skills set to 
help them achieve their career goals.

Dividend
The board targets a progressive dividend policy to reflect 
the cash flow generation and earnings potential of the 
group. Assuming that there are sufficient distributable 
reserves available at the time, the board will normally 
distribute a dividend of approximately 60% of the group’s 
annual reported profits before exceptional gains and after 
tax. The board intends that the company will pay an 
interim and a final dividend in the approximate proportions 
one-third and two-thirds respectively of the total expected 
annual dividend. 
The directors have proposed a final dividend of 6.8 
pence per share, amounting to £7.1m, which is subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM. Provided shareholder 
approval is received the final dividend will be paid on 
31 May 2016 to those shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 29 April 2016.
Reappointment of auditors
The board confirms that Deloitte LLP was originally 
appointed to the group in 2006 (when it was a private 
limited group), and last rotated the audit partner during 
the year ended 30 November 2014. The board also 
recognises that under the terms of the Code, a FTSE 350 
company should tender the external audit contract at 
least every 10 years. 
As the company is outside of the FTSE 350 the company 
is not obliged to comply with provision C3.7 of the code, 
relating to the tendering of the external auditor every 
10 years. The board also recognises the commercial 
advantages of tendering the audit regularly. However, 
the relevant audit period only commenced upon listing 
on the London Stock Exchange, which was in February 
2014. Accordingly, the company has until 2024 to tender 
the external audit. The auditors Deloitte LLP have indicated 
their willingness to continue as the company’s auditors 
and accordingly, a resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP 
as auditors of the company and the group will be 
proposed at the 2016 AGM. 
Authority to allot shares
The company was granted a general authority by its 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM to allot shares up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £34,904. The company 
also received authority to allot shares for cash on a non 
pre-emptive basis up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£34,904. As at the date of this report, no shares have been 
issued under these authorities. These authorities will expire 
at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM unless revoked, varied 
or renewed prior to that meeting. Resolutions will be 
proposed at the 2016 AGM to renew these authorities. 
Authority for the company to purchase its own shares
The company was granted authority by its shareholders 
at the 2015 AGM to purchase up to 10,471,204 of its 
ordinary shares. As at the date of this report, no ordinary 
shares have been purchased under this authority and, 
therefore, the company may purchase up to 10,471,204 
ordinary shares under its existing authority. This authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM unless 
revoked, varied or renewed prior to that meeting. 
A resolution will be proposed at the 2016 AGM that 
the company be authorised to purchase up to 
approximately 10% of its ordinary shares at the directors’ 
discretion. If the resolution is passed, the new authority 
will replace the existing authority and will lapse at the 
conclusion of the 2017 AGM.
Financial risk management
The group manages its risks to ensure that the group’s 
performance is not adversely affected by its exposure 
to financial risks resulting from its operation and sources 
of finance. Financial risk management objectives and 
policies, including information on financial risks that 
materially impact the group can be found in note 25 
of the group financial statements. 
Going concern 
In making their going concern assessment the directors 
have considered the group’s business activities, its financial 
position, the market in which it operates and the factors 
likely to affect its future development. The financial position 
of the group, its cash flows and liquidity position are set out 
in the financial statements section on pages 78 to 113. 
Furthermore, note 25, page 102 to the consolidated 
financial statements includes the group’s objectives 
and policies for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments 
and its exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
Governance The directors have reviewed the group’s forecasts, 
taking into account a range of sensitivities, and how they 
impact headroom against its bank facilities, and its ability 
to meet its capital investment and operational needs.
In August 2015, the company announced it had signed 
an amended £85.0m revolving credit facility plus a £15.0m 
accordion option expiring in August 2020. The group has 
net current liabilities of £35.8m at the period end. The 
directors have additionally considered this position to 
determine if it presents any going concern issues. The 
group is profitable and cash generative and is supported 
by the revolving credit facility. As at 29 November 2015 
£44.5m was drawn against the facility, and therefore there 
is sufficient headroom to meet the group’s debts as they 
fall due. 
The directors believe the group is in a strong financial 
position due to its profitable operations and strong cash 
generation and that the group has adequate resources 
to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For 
this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The directors 
have made this assessment after consideration of the 
company’s budgeted cash flows and related assumptions 
and in accordance with the Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting published by the UK Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2014.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors 
have assessed the prospects of the group over a longer 
period than the 12 months required by the ‘going concern’ 
provision. The directors have assessed the viability of the 
group over a three year period through to 2018 which 
coincides with the group’s strategic review period.
This assessment has considered the potential impact 
of the principal risks on the business model, future 
performance and liquidity over the period. In making 
this statement the directors have considered the resilience 
of the group under varying market conditions together 
with the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. As already 
described in the statement of going concern, as part of 
this assessment the directors have taken account of the 
group’s revolving credit facility with accordion option 
which runs through to August 2020, strong track record 
of operational cash inflow and forward dividend cover. 
Additionally, the directors have reviewed the expected 
impact of government and legislative changes in 
particular the National Minimum and Living Wage, 
alongside the key financial ratios over the period e.g. 
EBITDA, operating profit, fixed charge cover and 
indebtedness. Finally it is noted that even in the event 
of a very severe impact on the business through continued 
food deflation and cost inflation, the business could 
reduce or suspend acquisitions activity, re-assess the 
dividend pay-outs and accelerate the newsagent 
disposal programme.
Based on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will have sufficient resources to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period to November 2018.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The group is required to measure and report direct and 
indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pursuant to the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. This is the second GHG 
emissions report in line with UK mandatory reporting 
requirements set out by the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and we have therefore 
expressed the report alongside the ‘base year’ of 2014 
for comparison. The mandatory requirement is for the 
disclosure of the scope 1 and 2 emissions only. These are 
direct emissions such as heating, vehicle fuel and indirect 
emissions such as purchased electricity. The group’s total 
GHG footprint in line with Section 7 at the Companies Act 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 
is shown in the table below.

Corporate  
governance report
Chairman’ s letter
Dear shareholder
Since the beginning of the 
company’ s financial year on 
1 December 2014, the board has 
adopted compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
2014 (the “code”) published by 
the Financial Reporting Council 
for reporting periods after 
October 2014.*
It is the opinion of the board that the company has been 
compliant with the provisions of the code throughout the 
year with the following exceptions:
• 
The code recommends that a chairman should be 
independent upon appointment and a chief executive 
should not go on to be chairman of the same company 
(code A.3.1). In the statement made on 26 November 
2015, the board announced that once James Lancaster 
steps down as chief executive he will be appointed to 
the position of non-executive chairman of the company. 
Upon this appointment, the company will be in breach 
of this provision; however, in line with the code, major 
shareholders have been consulted and they are 
supportive of James’ appointment as chairman 
until April 2017, given his extensive retail experience.
• 
The code recommends that the board should appoint 
one of the independent non-executive directors to the 
position of senior independent director (the “SID”) (code 
A.4.1). During the 2014/15 period, the company did not 
appoint a SID. The board considered the role of the SID 
in light of the composition and requirements of the 
board and the needs of shareholders and decided that 
at this time such a position was unnecessary. The board 
will continue to consider whether the position of SID 
would benefit the board and shareholders and keep 
under review.
Following John Coleman’s resignation on 2 October 2015 
and the board’s announcement on 26 November 2015 
of James Lancaster’s intention to step down as chief 
executive officer and to be appointed chairman until the 
AGM in 2017, the company is not currently in compliance 
with the following provisions:
• 
Code A.4.2 – The code recommends that the chairman 
should hold meetings with the non-executive directors 
without the executives present and the non-executive 
directors should meet without the chairman present at 
least annually to appraise the chairman’s performance.
• 
Code B.1.2 – The code recommends that at least half 
the board, excluding the chairman, should comprise 
independent non-executive directors and that a smaller 
company should have at least two independent 
non-executive directors. 
• 
Code B.2.1 – The code recommends that there 
should be a nomination committee which should 
lead the process for board appointments and make 
recommendations to the board regarding appointments 
and which comprises of a majority of independent 
non-executive directors. 
* www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Publications/Corporate-Governance/ 
UK-Corporate-Governance-Code-2014.pdf
42 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 43
• 
Code B.6.3 – The code recommends that the non-
executive directors should evaluate the performance 
of the chairman taking into account the views of the 
executive directors.
• 
Code C.3.1 – The code recommends that the board 
should form an audit committee of at least three, or 
in the case of smaller companies, two independent 
non-executive directors and that at least one member 
has recent relevant experience. In smaller companies 
the company chairman may be a member of, but not 
chair, the committee if he or she was considered 
independent on appointment as chairman.
• 
Code D.2.1 – The code also recommends that the 
board establish a remuneration committee of at least 
three, or in the case of smaller companies, two 
independent non-executive directors.
Accordingly, the company has commenced the 
recruitment of a new chief executive officer and 
independent non-executive director. It is the company’s 
intention that during the current financial year this 
recruitment will be completed upon which the company 
will then comply with the above code provisions.
The board is committed to excellent corporate 
governance. The changes we are making to the board 
will enhance our compliance and, I believe, will help the 
company grow.
Yours sincerely

Role of the board
The board is responsible for the effective oversight of the 
company. It also agrees the strategic direction that will 
achieve the long term success of the company and deliver 
shareholder value. The board takes the lead in areas such 
as strategy, financial policy and making sure we maintain 
a robust system of internal controls. 
Each year, the board meets to set annual objectives 
for the business in line with the current group strategy. 
The board monitors the achievement of the company’s 
objectives through board reports which include updates 
from the group chief executive, chief financial officer, chief 
operating officer and other key personnel. The board has 
a rolling annual agenda of items that are to be considered 
by the board and this agenda is continually updated to 
include any topical matters that arise.
Matters reserved for the board
The board has approved matters reserved for its own 
consideration which details the board’s role and purpose 
to ensure that it fully discharges its responsibilities. At least 
annually, the board undertakes a review of its matters 
reserved for the board to ensure it is in line with best 
practice, the code and other regulatory requirements. 
The board is responsible for a number of matters including: 
strategy; financial items; internal control; third party 
contracts; material legal and pension matters; shareholder 
communication; and senior group appointments. 
Board committees 
The board delegates specific responsibilities to committees 
so that the board can operate effectively and efficiently 
and give the right level of attention and consideration to 
relevant matters. The board has established the following 
committees: audit, nomination and remuneration. A report 
from each committee is set out on pages 48 to 69. The role 
and responsibilities of each board committee are set out 
in formal terms of reference which are determined by the 
board. The chair of each committee reports to the board 
after each committee meeting on the matters discussed 
and minutes of each meeting are provided to the board 
for information. The terms of reference of the committees 
are available at www.mccolls.co.uk/investor.aspx. Capita 
Company Secretarial Services Limited serves as secretary 
to these committees. 
The board has also delegated to the chief executive officer 
the responsibility for implementing the group’s business 
model and for the day-to-day operational management 
of the group. The chief executive officer is supported in 
carrying out his responsibilities by the chief financial officer, 
chief operating officer and the operations board.
The board meets at regular intervals and has met 5 
times during the period since 1 December 2014. The 
directors’ attendance at board and committee meetings 
during the period is given below. The board chairman 
and committee chairman are supported by the company

encouraged to challenge and constructively comment 
on matters presented to the board. In addition the directors 
have ongoing dialogue on a variety of issues between 
board meetings.
The executive directors are invited to attend the relevant 
audit, nomination and remuneration committees although 
they do not have a vote with the exception of James 
Lancaster who is a member and can vote at the

Division of responsibilities
Role of the chairman and chief executive
Within McColl’s there is a clear division between the 
respective responsibilities of the interim chairman of  
the board and the chief executive officer. The interim 
chairman is Sharon Brown who is responsible for setting  
the board agenda and leading the board’s discussions 
and decision-making. The interim chairman promotes a  
culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective 
contribution of the independent non-executive director 
in particular and ensuring constructive relations between 
executive directors and the independent non-executive 
director. The chief executive officer is James Lancaster 
who, through delegation from the board, is responsible 
for leading the group’s operating performance and 
day-to-day management. This separation of responsibilities 
between the chairman and the chief executive officer, 
coupled with the schedule of reserved matters described 
above, ensures that no individual has unfettered powers 
of decision-making.
Role of the non-executive directors
The interim chairman and independent non-executive 
director have a broad range of skills and experience 
which assists both in formulating the company’s strategy 
and in providing constructive challenge and support to 
the executive directors. Both the interim chairman and 
independent non-executive director are regarded by 
the company as independent within the meaning 
defined in the code and are free from any business or 
other relationship which could materially interfere with 
the exercise of their independent judgement. The interim 
chairman and the independent non-executive director 
have letters of appointment setting out their duties and the 
level of commitment expected. The interim chairman and 
independent non-executive director were appointed for an 
initial 3 year term with typical tenure expected to be 2 x 3 
year terms but they may be invited by the board to serve 
an additional term, subject to re-election by shareholders. 
They are expected to commit approximately 15-20 days 
per annum to their role.
Directors’ induction and professional development 
The company has in place an induction programme for 
new directors to provide them with a full, formal and tailored 
introduction on joining the board, which ensures that they 
attain sufficient knowledge of the company to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively. The programme includes 
meeting with senior management and advisers. The board 
calendar is planned to ensure that directors are briefed 
on a wide range of topics, including updates on financial 
and corporate governance and regulatory matters.
All directors are also given the opportunity to visit the 
group’s stores and discuss aspects of the business with 
employees as well as internal briefings. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of 
the company secretary who is responsible to the board for 
ensuring the board procedures are complied with and that 
directors have access to independent and professional 
advice at the company’s expense, where they judge this to 
be necessary to discharge their responsibilities as directors.
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which 
they have or may have interests that conflict with those of 
the company, unless that conflict is first authorised by the 
directors. This includes potential conflicts that may arise 
when a director takes up a position with another company. 
The company’s articles allow the board to authorise such 
potential conflicts, and there is in place a procedure to 
deal with any actual or potential conflict of interest. Should 
a director become aware that they, or their connected 
parties, have an interest in an existing or proposed 
transaction with the company, they should notify the 
board. The board deals with each appointment on its 
individual merit and takes into consideration all the 
relevant circumstances.
Board evaluation
The effectiveness and performance of the board is 
vital to the company’s continuing success. An internal 
evaluation of the performance of the board and its 
committees was carried out during the year. An evaluation 
of the interim chairman’s performance was considered 
unnecessary as Sharon Brown only took up the position 
of interim chairman in October 2015. The process of 
evaluating the performance was led by the interim 
chairman. A tailored, high-level questionnaire was 
distributed for the directors and feedback was given 
to the interim chairman. This was structured to provide 
directors with an opportunity to consider and express 
their views about: 
• 
The performance of the board and its committees, 
including how the directors work together as a 
whole; and
• 
The balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the directors. 
Governance Corporate governance report continued
The responses to the evaluation of the board and its 
committees were assessed by the interim chairman and 
then considered by the board. The results of the evaluation 
indicated that the board is working coherently and that 
there are no significant concerns among the present 
directors about its effectiveness. 
Some actions were agreed as a result of the exercise 
and these will be progressed over the coming year. 
These included: 
• 
Focus on strategic issues;
• 
Providing independent non-executive directors with the 
opportunity to have more direct contact with the senior 
management team through, for example, organised site 
visits in order to deepen their knowledge of the group’s 
business and culture; and 
• 
Having further industry presentations to the board from 
external sources in order to enable directors to gain a 
broader perspective on the market. 
The performance of individual directors was evaluated by 
the interim chairman, with input from the other directors 
and no material issues were identified.
Effectiveness of internal controls and risk management
The board has responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining the group’s system of risk management and 
internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and the group’s assets and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of this system. Such a system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
An ongoing process has been established for identifying, 
evaluating and managing risks faced by the group, which 
enable the board to make a robust assessment of the 
principal risk facing the business. This process, which 
complies with the requirements of the code, has been 
in place for the full financial year and up to the date the 
financial statements were approved and accords with 
the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2014 on “Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting”. The board 
acknowledges that it is responsible for the company’s 
systems of internal control and risk management and 
for reviewing their effectiveness. Internal controls are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The board confirms that, 
through the activities of the audit committee, it has 
monitored the effectiveness of the company’s systems 
of internal control and risk management to ensure 
corrective action is taken when appropriate. During the 
year, the board considered the nature and extent of the 
risks it was willing to take to achieve its strategic goals and 
reviewed the existing internal statement of risk appetite.
The board recognises that effective risk management 
is essential to the long term success of the business 
and it requires an appropriate risk governance structure, 
together with the appropriate culture to facilitate the 
desired values and behaviours being embedded at 
all levels within the business.
The operations board has established a risk register 
which is reviewed regularly by the audit committee. 
The risk register enables the operations board to identify, 
evaluate and manage risks faced by the group on an 
ongoing basis, both at an operational and strategic level. 
The risk identification and mitigation processes have been 
designed to be responsive to likelihood of occurrence. 
Appropriate action is taken to manage and mitigate 
risks identified and is reported to the board via the audit 
committee and the chief financial officer. 
The directors have identified the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the group, many of which are 
considered key to the successful implementation of 
strategy and long term growth. The key risks, and how 
they are mitigated, are described on pages 30 and 31.
Financial and business reporting process
The board recognises its duty to ensure that the annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the performance, strategy and 
business model of the company. In addition to the annual 
report the company also ensures that other price-sensitive 
reports and other information is published externally. 
The group has a thorough assurance process in place 
in respect of the preparation, verification and approval 
of periodic financial reports.
46 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 47
This process includes:
• 
the involvement of qualified, professional employees 
with an appropriate level of experience (both in group 
finance and throughout the business);
• 
formal sign-offs from appropriate business segment 
senior executives;
• 
comprehensive review and, where appropriate, 
challenge from appropriate group senior executives 
and executive directors;
• 
a transparent process to ensure full disclosure of 
information to the external auditors;
• 
oversight by the group’s audit committee, involving 
(amongst other duties):
 –
a detailed review of key financial reporting 
judgements which have been discussed by 
management;
 –
review and, where appropriate, challenge 
on matters including:
 –
the consistency of, and any changes to, 
significant accounting policies and practices 
during the year;
 –
significant adjustments resulting from 
an external audit; 
 –
the viability statement assumptions; and
 –
the going concern assumption.
• 
The above process, and the review by the audit 
committee of a comprehensive note that sets out 
the details of the preparation, internal verification 
and approval process for the annual report and 
accounts, provides comfort to the board that the annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Anti-fraud, bribery and corruption
The group aims to promote honest and ethical conduct. 
To support this, it has in place an anti-bribery policy, 
which applies to all employees and prohibits: 
• 
the offering, promising or giving of an advantage, and 
• 
the requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting of 
an advantage in any form to any person or company 
by anyone acting on its behalf. 
Whistleblowing
Details of the company’s whistleblowing policy can 
be found on page 51 of the audit committee report.
Relations with shareholders
Responsibility for shareholder relations rests with the interim 
chairman and chief executive officer. They ensure that 
there is effective communication with shareholders on 
matters such as governance and strategy, and are 
responsible for ensuring that the board understands 
the views of major shareholders.
The board aims to present a balanced and clear view 
of the group’s performance in its communications with 
shareholders and believes that being transparent in 
describing how we see the market and the prospects for 
the business to be extremely important. We communicate 
with shareholders in a number of different ways. The formal 
reporting of our full and half year results together with the 
related presentations, is accompanied by group calls  
and one-to-one meetings with institutional investors.  
The full and half-year reporting are followed by investor 
meetings in a variety of locations where we have 
institutional shareholders. We also regularly meet with 
existing and prospective shareholders to update them  
on our latest performance or to introduce them to the 
company and where appropriate arrange a visit to the 
business to give analysts and major shareholders a better 
understanding of how we manage our business. These 
visits and meetings are principally undertaken by the chief 
executive officer, chief financial officer and chief operating 
officer with any relevant material being uploaded to the 
corporate website, so being available to all shareholders. 
The board receives regular updates on the views of 
its shareholders through regular reporting based on 
information from the registrar and its brokers, which is 
an agenda item for all board meetings. In addition, 
the independent non-executives are available to meet 
shareholders if they wish to raise issues separately from 
the arrangements as described above.
The group’s website (www.mccolls.co.uk/investor.aspx) 
contains all the latest announcements, press releases 
and published financial information including the 
annual report. The notice of the AGM will be distributed 
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting and is also available from the website. 
The company will propose all resolutions on a poll, as 
this allows for the vote of shareholders not present in 
person or by proxy to be counted and therefore provide 
more accurate representation of shareholders’ votes.

Composition of the committee
The members of the committee during the financial 
year were:
John Coleman as chairman until 2 October 2015; Sharon 
Brown who succeeded John Coleman as nomination 
committee chairman from 2 October 2015; James 
Lancaster; and Georgina Harvey. 
There have been no further changes in the membership 
of the committee since the year end.
Under the committee’s terms of reference the committee 
will normally meet not less than twice a year when 
appropriate. After each committee meeting, the chairman 
reports to the board on the main items discussed.
The role and duties of the nomination committee
The nomination committee’s main responsibilities are 
to evaluate the structure, size and composition (including 
the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) required of 
the board and the committees; to give full consideration to 
succession planning of directors and other senior executives 
and to assist with the selection process of new executive 
and non-executive directors including the chairman. 
The committee’s terms of reference explains the committee’s 
role and responsibilities and can be found on the 
company’s website at www.mccolls.co.uk/investor.aspx
Main activities during 2015
At the nomination committee in February the committee 
principally considered the draft nomination committee 
report within the company’s first annual report and 
accounts, and the nomination of the directors for election 
at the company’s first AGM. Consideration was given 
to the skills, experience and added value each director 
contributed to the business. Accordingly, all directors 
were recommended to the board for election by 
the shareholders.
In October the board considered the role of chairman 
following the resignation of John Coleman, and agreed 
to appoint Sharon Brown as interim chairman.
In November the committee met to discuss and consider 
the following vacancies: 
• 
Chairman – following John Coleman’s resignation, 
Sharon Brown having been appointed interim chairman; 
• 
CEO – the recruitment of a new CEO given James 
Lancaster’s intention to step down as CEO as disclosed 
at Initial Public Offering; and
• 
Non-executive director – the desire to recruit an 
additional independent non-executive director. 
The committee debated the skills and experience required 
to fulfil these roles and the additional areas of knowledge 
or experience which would be advantageous to the 
business going forward.
As indicated at IPO and given James’ extensive retail 
knowledge, the committee, following consultation with 
key shareholders, recommended to the board that James 
be appointed non-executive chairman once his CEO 
successor is appointed. It was agreed that James would 
not stand for re-election at the AGM in 2017. The committee 
approved the appointment of executive search consultant  
the Miles Partnership to identify candidates to fill the 
CEO vacancy and the Inzito Partnership (which has no 
connection to the company) to identify candidates for 
the independent non-executive director vacancy.
The committee also reviewed the time spent of the 
independent directors and the committee’s terms 
of reference.
The committee concluded that the independent non-
executive directors were expected to spend around 20 
days on company business and that the updated terms of 
reference accurately reflect the processes of the committee.
Committee evaluation
The committee members undertook a committee 
evaluation led by the chairman and concluded that the 
committee had performed its role effectively.
Board diversity
The committee supports diversity, accepting the 
advantages that come from having diverse viewpoints 
and the influence in decision-making. It is the aim of the 
committee to always consider the benefits that arise from 
a diverse board when making board appointments. 
The committee does not judge it appropriate to introduce 
a quota system to enhance diversity in all of its forms to 
the board; the company’s recruitment and appointment 
strategy is based on the merits of the candidates. Currently 
40% of the board is comprised of female directors.
Diversity, including gender diversity, is practised throughout 
the business and the committee continues to follow a 
policy of appointing talented people at every level to 
enhance the business’ performance. This will enable the 
business to achieve the group’s own strategic objectives.

Committee composition and meetings
The members of the committee during the period were: 
Sharon Brown, as chairman, and Georgina Harvey. 
John Coleman was a member of the committee until 
2 October 2015.
All members of the committee are considered 
independent by the board. The committee considers 
that collectively the members have appropriate recent 
and relevant financial experience to fully discharge their 
responsibilities, with Sharon Brown being a member of 
the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. 
There have been no changes in the membership of the 
committee since the period end.
In accordance with the committee’s terms of reference, 
the committee has met 3 times during the year, at the 
appropriate times in the financial reporting and audit 
cycle. After each committee meeting, the chairman 
reports to the board on the main items discussed. 
The committee chairman has also met privately with 
the external auditor to provide them with an opportunity 
to discuss any issues without management present. 
The executive directors, other senior managers and the 
audit partner from the external auditor attend committee 
meetings by invitation. 
The performance of the committee was evaluated as 
part of the board evaluation process.
Role and responsibilities of the audit committee
The committee’s terms of reference explains the 
committee’s role and responsibilities and can be found on 
the company website at www.mccolls.co.uk/investor.aspx.
The principal activities carried out during the year were:
• 
Financial reporting – the committee reviewed and 
assessed the company’s financial reports to ensure they 
were fair, balanced and understandable. The committee 
also considered the implications of new accounting 
standards, regulatory changes, significant accounting 
issues and the appropriateness of the accounting 
policies adopted.
Chairman’ s introduction
I am pleased to present the formal report 
of the audit committee to shareholders.
The primary responsibilities of the committee are to ensure 
the integrity of the company’s financial reporting and the 
appropriateness of the risk management processes and 
internal controls. This report details how we carry out this 
role and the key areas of focus since my last report to you.
The work of the committee is supported by information 
provided by senior management, the external auditors and 
advisors and, on behalf of the committee, I would like to 
thank them for their ongoing support and commitment.

Governance Corporate governance report continued
• 
Internal and external audits – the committee 
evaluated the scope of the external audit plan and 
the subsequent outcome of this work.  The committee 
also assessed whether an internal audit function 
was necessary.  The internal control framework to be 
followed by employees is communicated by line 
management, training and manuals, and the routine 
internal control activities are performed by the finance 
team. The retail support centre includes a team of stock 
compliance auditors, who conduct visits at least once 
a year to each store to analyse the stock and review 
the compliance with company policies and practices.  
The committee concluded that an internal audit 
function was not currently appropriate but this 
would be kept under review.
• 
Risk and internal control – the committee evaluated the 
key risks facing the company and the adequacy and 
effectiveness of mitigating internal controls and risk 
management processes.  A number of policies and 
procedures were reviewed and strengthened during 
the year.
• 
External auditor – The committee considered the 
performance, independence (in particular when 
considering provision of additional services by the auditor), 
fees and suitability of re-election of Deloitte LLP as auditor.
Management have confirmed that they were not aware 
of any material misstatements within the annual report and 
the external auditors have reported that they found no 
material misstatements in the course of their work.

Significant accounting judgements and uncertainties considered by the committee during the year
Summarised below are the most significant issues considered by the committee in respect of these financial statements 
and how these issues were addressed.
Significant audit risk Action taken by committee
Supplier income The committee received a report from the company on the process of calculating supplier 
income, the controls in place in this area and the level of income which required some 
estimation. The external auditors reported on their testing of the income and the 
appropriateness of the assumptions made. The committee concurred with management’s 
assessment and judgements in establishing the level of income for the year.
Goodwill impairment The committee received a report from the company which detailed the key judgements 
in the process for assessing goodwill impairment across the 3 cash-generating units. 
This included forecasts of future cash flows. The committee also received a report from 
the external auditors of their testing of the calculations. The committee considered the 
calculation process and the reasonableness of the assumptions made, and concluded 
that the cash flows supported the level of goodwill reflected in the financial statements.
 Property provisions The committee assessed the reasonableness of the property provisions in respect of closed 
branches, onerous leases and future dilapidations expenses. Property provisions were also 
tested and reported on by the external auditors. The committee agreed with the judgements 
made in establishing the level of property provisions required.
Revenue recognition The committee reviewed the methodology and controls relating to revenue recognition, 
including an external report from the auditors.  They were satisfied that the correct accounting 
treatment has been adopted and consistently applied in the financial statements.
Relationship with the independent auditor
Deloitte LLP has been the group’s auditor since 2006 and 
Sukie Kooner has been the audit partner since 2014. In line 
with professional guidelines, each partner can serve for up 
to 5 years. Under new UK Competition and Market Authority 
regulations, companies within the FTSE 350 for accounting 
periods beginning on 1 January 2015, must after 5 years 
of appointing the auditors advise (a) when they intend to 
undertake a competitive tender process and (b) why this 
period is the best interests of the shareholders. Furthermore 
the external audit must be tendered at least every ten years 
and it is anticipated that the auditor will change every 20 
years. The rules mean that the company, having been listed 
on the London Stock Exchange from 28 February 2014, will 
need to retender the external audit before 2024. Although 
the company is outside the FTSE 350, it will comply with the 
Competition Market Authority regulations for the accounting 
period commencing on or after 30 November 2015.
The continued appointment of Deloitte LLP is considered 
by the audit committee each year, taking into account 
relevant guidance and best practice and considering 
the independence and effectiveness of the external 
audit process.
As part of the review of auditor independence and 
effectiveness, Deloitte LLP have confirmed to the committee 
that they are independent of the company and have 
complied with relevant auditing standards.
The company has a policy relating to the Supply of Non-Audit 
Services by the external auditor to ensure that the auditor’s 
independence is not impaired. The policy prohibits certain 
services and limits the level of non-audit services payable to 
the auditors. Any services in excess of this limit require prior 
approval from the audit committee. For the current year 
the other non-audit services amounted to £1 78,000 which 
included £150,000 relating to the debt refinancing. The 
debt refinancing work was put out to tender and the audit 
committee is satisfied that it was appropriate for Deloitte 
LLP to be appointed and that, given it was performed 
by a functionally separate team, it did not impair their 
independence or objectivity. 
In assessing Deloitte’s performance and the effectiveness 
of the audit process, the committee took into account:
• 
The fulfilment by the auditor of the agreed audit plan;
• 
The report issued by the auditor on the audit of the 
annual report and financial statements;
• 
The robustness of the audit process; and
• 
The quality of people and service provided by Deloitte.
The committee is therefore satisfied with the independence 
and performance of Deloitte LLP and has recommended 
their reappointment for a further year.
Whistleblowing
In compliance with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, 
the group has a policy and formal procedures to ensure 
that colleagues can confidentially raise concerns about 
possible improprieties by others. The purpose of the 
whistleblowing policy is to protect employees who make 
disclosures about certain matters of concern, provided 
these disclosures are made in accordance with the 
provisions of the act. The committee is responsible for 
ensuring that employees are able to raise any concerns, 
in confidence, regarding any possible improprieties in 
financial reporting or other matters. The committee reviewed 
the company’s formal whistleblowing policy (which was 
revised during the year) and how this operated in practice. 
During the year under review the company received 
10 notifications from the whistleblowing telephone line. 
All issues were investigated and resolved by senior 
management and reported to the committee.

Governance Remuneration report
Remuneration report
The information provided in this part of the 
directors’ remuneration report is not subject 
to audit. 
Dear shareholder 
I am pleased to present the second directors’ 
remuneration report since the company’s incorporation 
and listing on the London Stock Exchange, for the financial 
period ended 29 November 2015. This report has been 
prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Group (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2013, as amended and the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In 2015 we continued to grow and perform well with 
revenue growing by 3.1% to £932.2m. Our focus on 
neighbourhood convenience gained momentum as we 
moved closer to reaching our target of 1,000 convenience 
stores by the end of 2016. To this end, we acquired an 
additional 60 convenience stores and converted a further 
45 of our newsagents to food and wine stores – bringing 
the period-end number of convenience stores to 893. 
As well as increasing our number of convenience stores, 
we also expanded the range of products and services 
our stores offer. In particular, we focussed on strengthening 
our food-to-go offer – notably by rolling out 148 new 
food-to-go modules across our stores and opening 
our first Subway franchise.
However, despite good performance in 2015, operating 
profit did not meet the stretching targets set by the 
committee for the annual bonus. Therefore no 
annual bonus awards have been earned for the 
period under review.
During the year, John Coleman stepped down from 
his position as chairman, in order to focus on new 
opportunities. Sharon Brown, independent non-executive 
director, was appointed interim chairman. The fee for the 
interim chairman was set at £115,000 from October 2015, 
in line with the previous chairman’s fee.
In November 2015 the company announced that, as 
planned, James Lancaster would step down from his 
position as chief executive once a successor has been 
identified. James will take over as non-executive chairman 
until the AGM in April 2017 . The search for a chief executive is 
in progress, as is a search to appoint a further independent 
non-executive director, to support the growth of the business 
and in line with best practice.
During 2015, the committee implemented the 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders at our 
AGM on 17 April 2015. Executive directors will receive 
no salary increase for 2016, whilst increases will be made 
across the wider employee population to reflect statutory 
increases to the National Minimum Wage, and the 
introduction of the National Living Wage. The committee 
continues to set stretching annual operating profit targets 
and strategic objectives linked to the priorities of the 
business which include growing basket spend in 
52 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 53
convenience and increasing the number of convenience 
stores to 1,000 in operation by 31 December 2016. No 
element of the bonus will be awarded unless at least 
threshold operating profit is achieved.
During 2016 we will make a second grant under the LTIP, 
which was introduced and approved by shareholders 
at the 2015 AGM. The LTIP will continue to vest based 70% 
on EPS and 30% on TSR, measured on a relative basis 
against the combined constituents of the FTSE All Share 
General Retailers Index and the FTSE All Share Food & Drug 
Retailers Index. The committee continues to believe that 
this combination of measures will help reinforce delivery 
of the company’s growth plans. For the EPS element of the 
2016 LTIP awards, 25% will vest for 3-year cumulative EPS 
of 52.5p and will vest in full for EPS of 60.1p. The committee 
considers that this will provide executives with an 
appropriately challenging and meaningful incentive 
to drive performance which, at the same time, delivers 
a level of financial performance which supports internal 
and external expectations. The LTIP has a 3-year 
performance period; and an additional 2-year holding 
period for executive directors only will then apply to 
any shares that vest.
The committee has presented the remuneration report 
in line with 2013 regulations governing the disclosure and 
approval of directors’ remuneration. At our annual general 
meeting, which will be held on 19 April 2016, the second 
section of this report, the annual report on remuneration, 
which details the implementation of our policy, will be 
subject to an advisory vote. The first section, the policy 
report, is unchanged (other than minor changes to 
improve clarity), is not due to be submitted for a vote, 
having already been approved by shareholders at the 
17 April 2015 AGM.
Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on the 
committee for their support during 2015 and to all 
employees for their hard work. I would also like to thank 
shareholders for their support at the AGM in 2015 on the 
resolution to approve the remuneration policy and 
annual report on remuneration.
Yours sincerely

Directors’ remuneration policy
This section describes the group’s remuneration policy for 
directors which was approved at the AGM on 17 April 2015 
and applies for up to 3 years from that date.
The policy for executive director remuneration is to provide 
a competitive package of fixed and variable pay that will 
enable the group to attract, motivate and retain executives 
with the right skills and experience, and will link executive 
pay to shareholder interests and the company’s long 
term success.
The fixed component of each executive’s remuneration 
package comprises salary, pension and benefits. The 
variable component may comprise an annual bonus and 
eligibility to participate in a long term incentive plan (LTIP). 
The majority of the bonus is linked to annual profit 
performance, although an element may be linked 
to strategic performance measures that will help drive 
the group’s growth. The group adopted an LTIP when 
the company listed on 28 February 2014 that provides 
the opportunity to earn shares based on 3-year 
performance. Each element of remuneration is 
designed to target a specific aim of the remuneration 
policy and to help further align the interests of 
executives with those of shareholders.
Policy table
The key components of executive directors’ remuneration 
are as follows:
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Fixed pay
Base salary
To attract and retain 
talent of the right calibre 
and with the ability to 
contribute to strategy, by 
ensuring base salaries are 
competitive in the relevant 
talent market.
Base salaries are reviewed 
annually, with reference 
to individual performance, 
experience, market 
competitiveness, salary 
increases across the 
group and the position 
holder’s experience, 
competence and criticality 
to the performance of 
the business.
Any increases are generally 
effective from 1 December.
Executive directors’ salary 
increases will normally be 
in line with those for the 
wider employee population. 
However, larger changes to 
salary may be made where 
there is a change in role or 
responsibilities or a 
significant market 
misalignment.
Individual and group 
performance is taken into 
account when determining 
appropriate salaries.
Fixed pay
Pension
Provide post-retirement 
benefits for participants in 
a cost-efficient manner.
The current chief executive 
and chief financial officer 
receive a salary supplement 
in lieu of pension. The chief 
operating officer is, and any 
new appointee would be, 
eligible to participate in the 
group’s defined contribution 
scheme (or any 
replacement scheme) or to 
receive a salary supplement 
in lieu of pension provision.
Pension contributions 
vary based on individual 
circumstances. Pension 
benefits will be capped at 
20% of salary, excluding 
legacy arrangements for 
the current chief executive 
and chief financial officer.
Further details are set out 
on page 65.
None.

Benefits
To provide competitive 
benefits for each role.
Benefits currently 
include the provision of 
car or car allowance, fuel, 
private medical insurance 
and life assurance.
Reasonable relocation, 
travel and subsistence 
allowances and other 
benefits may be provided 
based on individual 
circumstances.
There is no overall 
maximum value set on 
benefits. They are set at 
a level that is comparable 
to market practice.
The committee retains 
the discretion to amend 
benefits in exceptional 
circumstances or in 
circumstances where 
factors outside of the 
group’s control have 
materially changed 
(e.g. increases in 
insurance premiums).
None.
Variable pay
Annual bonus 
Aims to focus executives 
on achieving stretching 
profit targets and 
delivering the strategic 
business priorities 
for the financial period.
Performance measures 
and targets are set prior 
to or shortly after the start 
of the financial period.
At the end of the 
financial period, the 
remuneration committee 
will determine the extent 
to which the targets 
have been achieved.
Awards are delivered 
in cash.
The committee 
has discretion to 
reduce the bonus in 
the event of serious 
financial misstatement 
or gross misconduct. 
In extreme cases of 
gross misconduct, the 
committee may claw 
back annual bonus 
payments previously made.
The maximum bonus 
opportunity for executive 
directors will be up to 
100% of salary.
For the 2016 financial 
period the maximum bonus 
opportunity will be set at 
75% of salary.
Up to 40% of maximum 
will vest for target 
performance. The 
committee may award 
up to 10% of maximum 
for threshold performance.
80% of the award for  
2016 will be based on 
achievement of group 
operating profit, of  
which none will vest  
below threshold.
20% of the award for  
2016 will be based on 
achievement of strategic 
performance measures, 
of which none will vest  
until the operating profit 
threshold is achieved.
The majority of the annual 
bonus will be based on 
achievement of a stretching 
profit target. The remainder 
will be based on strategic 
performance measures, 
selected annually by the 
remuneration committee to 
reflect other key performance 
indicators for the year ahead.
Details on the measures used 
during the period under review 
are set out on page 64.
The committee has discretion 
to adjust the formulaic bonus 
outcome downwards (or 
upwards with shareholder 
consultation) within the limits 
of the plan, to ensure 
alignment of pay with the 
underlying performance 
of  the business.

Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Long-term incentive  
plan (LTIP)
Aligns the interests 
of executives with 
shareholders in growing 
the value of the business 
over the long term.
The plan provides 
for annual awards of 
performance shares 
to eligible participants. 
Vesting is based on 3-year 
performance. Executive 
directors’ vested shares will 
be subject to an additional 
2-year holding period 
before being released 
to participants.
The committee has 
discretion to reduce 
any unvested long-term 
incentive awards (including 
those in a holding period), 
or to vary the opportunities 
for future awards, in 
case of serious financial 
misstatement or gross 
misconduct. In extreme 
cases of gross misconduct, 
the committee may claw 
back vested long-term 
incentive awards.
Participants are eligible 
to receive cash or shares 
equal to the value of 
dividends that would have 
been paid over the vesting 
period on shares that vest.
Awards may be made 
up to a maximum of 
150% of salary in normal 
circumstances and up 
to 250% in exceptional 
circumstances.
For the 2016 financial period 
executive directors’ awards 
will be up to 50% of salary. 
The award size is reviewed 
in advance of grant.
Awards will vest on achievement 
of financial performance 
measures, measured over 
a 3-year performance period, 
to include both EPS and TSR.
EPS will receive a weighting 
in the LTIP of at least 50%.
For the 2016 financial period the 
weightings on EPS and TSR will 
be 70% and 30% respectively.
TSR will be measured on 
a relative basis against 
a relevant peer group.
Other measures may be 
considered in future years 
to help capture the strategic 
goals of the business and may 
be used in conjunction with 
these metrics.
Nothing will vest below 
threshold. 25% of each element 
will vest for achievement of 
threshold performance under 
each metric, then increase 
on a straight-line basis to full 
vesting for achieving 
stretch performance.
The committee has discretion 
to adjust the formulaic LTIP 
award downwards (or upwards 
with shareholder consultation), 
within the limits of the plan, to 
ensure alignment of pay with 
the underlying performance 
of the business.
Further details of awards 
to be made during the 
upcoming financial period 
are set out on pages 64  
and 65.
Other arrangements
Shareholding guidelines
To align directors’ interests 
with the long-term interests 
of shareholders.
Executive directors are 
required to build up 
and retain a minimum 
shareholding in the 
company at least equal 
to base salary, and are 
required to retain at least 
50% of shares vesting (after 
tax) under the LTIP until the 
shareholding guideline has 
been met.

Non-executive  
directors’ fees
To reflect the time 
commitment in 
preparing for and 
attending meetings, 
the duties and 
responsibilities of the 
role and the contribution 
expected from the non-
executive directors.
All-inclusive annual fee 
for chairman.
Annual base fee for  
non-executive directors.
Additional fees paid to 
the chairmen of board 
committees.
Non-executive directors 
do not participate in any 
incentive schemes, nor  
do they receive any pension 
or benefits (other than 
nominal travel expenses).
Any increases to non-
executive director fees will 
be considered as a result  
of the outcome of a review 
process and taking into 
account wider market 
factors, e.g. inflation. There 
is no prescribed individual 
maximum fee.
Further details are set  
out on page 65.
None.
This policy is unchanged in substance since approval 
at the AGM on 17 April 2015. Other than minor text 
changes to ensure this policy remains clear for the reader, 
a few other minor changes have been made to provide 
additional clarity. These include:
• 
an updated statement on page 62 regarding the 
committee’s approach to shareholder consultation;
• 
updated scenario charts on page 59; and
• 
additional clarity on the treatment of incentives 
on a change of control on page 61.
Performance measure selection and approach  
to target setting
Profit is considered to be the best measure of the group’s 
annual performance and will continue to determine the 
majority of the annual bonus. This will be supplemented 
by an element based on strategic performance measures, 
selected annually to reflect the group’s key strategic 
priorities for the financial period ahead.
EPS is considered to be the best measure of the group’s 
bottom line financial performance over the longer term 
and will determine the vesting for at least 50% of the overall 
LTIP award. TSR will also be captured to further align the 
interests of LTIP participants with those of shareholders.
Annual bonus targets will be selected prior to or shortly 
after the start of the financial period. Profit targets will 
be calibrated with reference to the group’s budget for 
the upcoming financial period and the group’s profit for 
the prior financial period. No element of the strategic 
performance measures will begin to pay out until the 
profit element starts to vest. Strategic performance 
measures will be selected to reflect the most important 
strategic goals for the upcoming financial period.
Threshold and stretch performance levels under the 
EPS element of the LTIP will be set prior to the start of 
the 3-year performance period. The remuneration 
committee aims to set stretching but achievable 
targets, taking account of a range of reference points, 
including broker forecasts and the group’s strategic plan. 
Performance targets for 2016 awards are detailed 
on page 64. The element linked to TSR will vest based 
on 3-year TSR compared to a peer group comprising 
the constituents of the FTSE All Share General Retailers 
Index and the FTSE All Share Food & Drug Retailers Index. 
Threshold vesting for the TSR element will be set at median 
ranking and stretch will be set at upper quartile. This range 
is in line with market practice for other listed companies 
and is expected to capture the range of good to excellent 
performance for the group.
Differences in remuneration policy operated 
for other employees
Senior management’s remuneration has the same 
components as set out in the policy, being base salary, 
annual bonus, pension, life assurance and benefit 
provision. They may also be invited to participate in the 
LTIP or alternatively the company’s share option plan. 
Annual bonus arrangements have the same structure 
and pay-out arrangements but are based on specific 
key performance indicators relevant to each job function. 
The maximum award varies according to seniority.
All employees receive a basic salary and all eligible 
employees are automatically enrolled into a pension 
scheme. Store managers participate in a bonus scheme 
that targets specific key performance indicators for 
their store.

In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the 
approval and implementation of the policy detailed in this report will be honoured.

As announced in November 2015, James Lancaster will step down from his position as chief executive in 2016, and take 
over as non-executive chairman until the AGM in April 2017, after which his remuneration will be set to be appropriate for 
this position. The illustration for James Lancaster is provided on the basis of a full year as CEO, and does not reflect the 
actual remuneration he will receive in 2016. The potential reward opportunities illustrated are based on the policy 
approved at the annual general meeting on 17 April 2015, applied to the base salaries in force at 1 December 2015. 
The projected value of LTIP amounts excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual. The assumptions

Approach to remuneration for new director appointments
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director, the remuneration committee may make use of all the 
existing components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach Maximum opportunity
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined 
based on the experience and skills of the individual, 
relevant market data and their current basic salary.
Pension New appointees will be entitled to participate in the group’s 
defined contribution scheme (or any replacement scheme) 
or to receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension 
contributions.
20% of base salary.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line 
with the policy which may include (but are not limited to) 
the provision of a company car or car allowance, fuel, 
private medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new 
appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to 
reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
100% of base salary.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP 
on similar terms as other executives, as described in the 
policy table.
150% of base salary (250% in 
exceptional circumstances).
In determining appropriate remuneration for a new 
director, the committee will take into consideration all 
relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the 
best interests of the group and its shareholders. The 
committee may make an award in respect of a new 
appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer, using Listing Rule 9.4.2 R if 
necessary. In doing so, the committee will take account 
of relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those 
conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting 
period remaining. The fair value of any buyout will not 
exceed that of the award being forgone.
In cases of appointing a new executive director by way 
of internal promotion, the approach will be consistent with 
the policy for external appointees detailed above. Where 
an individual has contractual commitments made prior to 
their promotion to executive director level, the group will 
continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive 
opportunities for below board employees are no higher 
than for executive directors, but measures may vary.
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the 
remuneration committee will use the policy as set 
out in the table on page 58.
Service contracts and exit payment policy
Non-executive directors
The current chairman and non-executive directors were 
appointed as directors on 7 February 2014. Their letters of 
appointment set out the terms of their appointment and 
are available for inspection at the company’s registered 
office and at the annual general meeting. They are not 
eligible to participate in the annual bonus or any equity 
schemes, nor do they receive any additional pension or 
benefits (other than travel expenses directly incurred in the 
performance of their role) on top of the fees disclosed on 
page 65. Non-executive directors have a notice period of 
one month and receive no compensation on termination.
Executive directors
On 24 February 2014, each of the executive directors, 
James Lancaster, Jonathan Miller and David Thomas 
entered into a service agreement with the company. 
Each of the agreements are terminable by the relevant 
executive directors or the company on not less than 12 
months’ prior written notice. The executive directors may 
be put on garden leave during their notice period, and 
the company can elect to terminate their employment by 
making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to up to 12 
months’ basic salary and benefits (although it should be 
noted that each of the executive directors can terminate 
their respective service agreements by giving 12 months’ 
prior written notice to the company). Executive director 
service contracts are available for inspection at the 
registered office and at the annual general meeting.
60 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 61
James Lancaster and Jonathan Miller’s pension 
arrangements were reviewed in 2008 upon closure of 
the group’s defined benefit pension schemes to future 
accrual. They now receive a salary supplement in lieu of 
their previous defined benefit arrangements representing  
the actuarial valuation of the defined benefit forgone.  
This is kept under review by the committee. Pension 
arrangements for other executives are in line with the 
remuneration policy set out on page 55. 
The committee acknowledges that executive directors 
may be invited to become independent non-executive 
directors of other quoted companies which have no 
business relationship with the company and that these 
duties can broaden their experience and knowledge 
to the benefit of the company.
Executive directors are permitted to accept such 
appointments with the prior approval of the chairman. 
Approval will only be given where the appointment does 
not present a conflict of interest with the group’s activities 
and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the 
development of the individual. Where fees are payable 
in respect of such appointments, these would be retained 
by the executive director.
The employment of each executive director is terminable 
with immediate effect without notice in certain 
circumstances, including where such executive director 
commits any act of serious misconduct, commits any 
material or persistent breach of any of the terms or 
conditions of his service agreement, has a bankruptcy 
order made against him, is convicted of any criminal 
offence, commits any act which constitutes an offence 
under the Bribery Act 2010, is disqualified from acting as a 
director, acts in any way which may bring the company or 
any member of the group into disrepute or discredit, fails to 
comply with any policy of the company or any member of 
the group which has been communicated to him, enters 
into any transaction which constitutes an offence for the 
purposes of Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 or which 
constitutes market abuse for the purposes of Part VIII of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act, or commits any 
material breach of his duties as a director.
The company’s policy on termination payments is to 
consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, 
taking into account the executive’s contractual terms, 
the circumstances of termination and any duty to mitigate. 
The table below summarises how incentives are typically 
treated in different circumstances: 
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Calculation of vesting/payment
Bonus
Summary dismissal, resignation Awards lapse. Not applicable.

Normally at year end. The annual bonus plan for the period under review 
would normally have performance measured to the end 
of the financial period. In exceptional circumstances, the 
committee may bring forward the date of award to the 
termination date and base it on performance over the 
period to termination. Awards will normally be pro-rated 
for time unless the committee determines otherwise.
Change of control On change of control, 
or shortly thereafter.
The annual bonus plan for the period under review 
would normally be paid immediately and be based on 
pro-rata performance to date, with committee discretion

In line with the vesting 
schedule at grant.
Unvested LTIP shares are normally prorated for 
performance to the end of the performance period. In 
exceptional circumstances, the committee may bring 
forward the vesting date to the termination date and vest 
on performance over the period to termination. Awards 
will normally be pro-rated for time unless the committee 
determines otherwise.
Change of control On change of control. Unvested LTIP shares are normally prorated for 
performance to the date of change of control and paid 
immediately. Awards will normally be pro-rated for time 
unless the committee determines otherwise.
1. Under the current chief executive and chief financial officer contracts, they are eligible to receive a pro-rata bonus payment upon termination of employment for any reason 
excluding summary dismissal. The current chief operating officer’s contract and any future executive director contracts will be operated in line with the above policy.
2. Under the 2014 LTIP, ‘good leaver’ is defined as a participant ceasing to be employed by the group by reason of death, injury, ill health, redundancy, retirement with the consent of the 
group, the company of employment ceasing to be a member of the group or any other reason that the committee determines in its absolute discretion (excluding summary dismissal 
or resignation to join a competitor).
Governance Remuneration report continued
Consideration of employment conditions  
elsewhere in group
The committee takes into account the general basic 
salary increase being offered to employees elsewhere 
in the group when annually reviewing the salary increases 
and remuneration for the executive directors. Employees 
have not been consulted in respect of the design of the 
group’s senior executive remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views
The committee considers shareholder feedback 
carefully when reviewing remuneration and regularly 
reviews the remuneration policy in the context of key 
institutional shareholder guidelines and best practice. 
It is the committee’s policy to consult with significant major 
shareholders prior to making any major changes to its 
executive remuneration structure. Details of shareholder 
consultations carried out during the year are included 
on page 67. 
Annual report on remuneration
Remuneration committee membership and advisers
The remuneration committee was established as part 
of the governance processes adopted by the company, 
following admission to the London Stock Exchange on 
28 February 2014. The remuneration committee consists 
of two independent non-executive directors, Georgina 
Harvey (committee chair) and Sharon Brown (interim 
company chairman from 2 October 2015). John Coleman 
was also a member of the committee until he stepped 
down from the board on 2 October 2015. The remuneration 
committee meets not less than twice a year and at such 
other times as required. During the 2015 financial year, 
the remuneration committee held 5 scheduled meetings. 
The chief executive and chief financial officer, and the 
committee’s independent advisers, Kepler, a brand of 
Mercer (Kepler), attend committee meetings by invitation. 
After committee meetings, the chairman reports to 
the board.
The remuneration committee has responsibility for the 
determination of the terms and conditions of employment, 
remuneration and benefits of the chairman and members 
of the board, including pension rights and any 
compensation payments, and recommending and 
monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for 
senior managers and the implementation of share 
option or other performance-related schemes.
The committee’s principal external advisers are Kepler, 
who were appointed by the committee and attend 
committee meetings from time to time, and who also 
provide remuneration advice to the group. Kepler were 
appointed independent advisers to the remuneration 
committee through a competitive tender process in 2014 
and fees for advice provided to the remuneration 
committee were £36,229 for the financial period under 
review. Fees covered support in drafting the directors’ 
remuneration report, benchmarking of senior 
management team remuneration and of chairman 
fees, attendance at remuneration committee meetings 
including advice on remuneration policy, shareholder 
consultation, long term incentive target-setting and trends 
in executive remuneration, and TSR performance reporting. 
Kepler do not provide any other services to the group and 
the committee is satisfied that they provide independent 
and objective remuneration advice to the company. 
Kepler is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for 
Remuneration Consultants in the UK, details of which 
can be found on the Remuneration Consultants Group’s 
website at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.

remuneration matters:
• 
Latest developments in corporate governance 
of relevance to the committee;
• 
Review and approval of the remuneration report;
• 
Shareholder consultation on remuneration proposals 
in advance of the annual general meeting;

2. Annual bonus paid for performance over the relevant financial period. Annual bonus payable in cash.
3. The LTIP was introduced in 2015 under which awards will begin to vest, subject to achievement of stretching performance conditions, in 2018. No long term incentives were due to vest 
during 2015. As disclosed in last year’s report, a share-based payment arose in 2014 relating to shares allocated prior to the IPO for nil consideration, in which unallocated employee 
shares held in an employee benefit trust were allocated to employee shareholders pro rata to their existing holdings. Awards of 1,132,299, 1,132,299, and 117,584 shares were made to 
James Lancaster, Jonathan Miller, and David Thomas respectively at the share price of £1.91 upon IPO. A further 104,050 and 5,339 shares were allocated to James Lancaster and 
Jonathan Miller prior to the IPO at nil cost in connection with the conversion of preference shares held by them into ordinary shares. The company met employer’s national insurance 
contributions on the value of such shares at the IPO offer price.
4. David Thomas changed role on 22 July 2014.

Basic annual salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually, with any changes normally effective from 1 December, with reference to individual 
performance, experience, market competitiveness and salary increases across the group.
Salaries paid to the executive directors and senior executives were reviewed by the committee, taking into account the 
competitiveness of total remuneration in comparison to comparable roles at listed retail companies of a broadly similar 
size and other listed organisations of a similar size.
Following the review for 2016, the committee determined that the executives’ salaries would be unchanged at £594,224, 
£331,207 and £276,000 for the chief executive, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, respectively. The 
average salary increase awarded across the wider employee population was c.3.5% for the 2015 financial period.

Annual bonus
The group operates an annual performance related bonus scheme for a number of senior executives including 
executive directors.
For the 2015 financial period, annual bonuses for the executive directors were based 80% on operating profit and 
20% on 3 key strategic performance measures being: like-for-like sales, the number of convenience stores, and 
expanding the range of products and services. For the operating profit element of the 2015 annual bonus no vesting 
will occur below target. At target 40% of the profit element of the bonus will be awarded. Annual bonus payments will 
then increase on a straight-line basis between 40% of maximum and full vesting for achievement of 110% of target. 
For the strategic performance element of the bonus, no awards will vest prior to the attainment of target operating 
profit. The targets, and achievement against them, were as follows:
Measure Weighting Target Stretch Achievement
Vesting
(% of maximum)
Operating profit before bonus, profit on 
asset disposals and exceptional items
80% £25.0m £27.4m £24.0m 0%
Like-for-like sales Positive -1.9% 0%
Number of convenience stores 20% 900 by 31 December 2015 893 0%
Expanding range of products  
and services
‘Food-to-go’ roll-out Achieved 100%
Total 0%
(profit target
not met)
As a result of the operating profit target not being 
achieved, the whole of the annual bonus lapsed in 
2015. The 2016 annual bonus will be based on the 
same structure as in 2015, with 80% based on operating 
profit and 20% on strategic performance measures 
including 1,000 convenience stores by 31 December 2016 
and growing basket spend in convenience. The targets for 
the other performance metrics are not being disclosed at 
present for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but will be 
disclosed retrospectively in the next annual report on 
remuneration, subject to the information no longer 
being commercially sensitive.
For the operating profit element of the 2016 annual 
bonus, no vesting will occur below threshold being 95% 
of target. Annual bonus payments will then increase 
on a straight-line basis to target when 40% of the profit 
element of the bonus will be awarded. Annual bonus 
payments will then increase on a straight-line basis 
between 40% of maximum and full vesting for achievement 
of 1 10% of target. For the strategic performance element 
of the bonus, no awards will vest prior to the attainment 
of threshold operating profit.
The committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic 
bonus outcome downwards, or upwards with shareholder 
consultation, within the plan limits, to ensure alignment 
of pay with the underlying performance of the business. 
The committee may also reduce future annual bonus 
opportunities in light of material misstatement or gross 
misconduct. In extreme cases of gross misconduct, the 
committee may claw back annual bonus payments 
previously made.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
Prior to approval of the LTIP outlined in the director’s 
remuneration policy above, no long-term incentive 
plan had been in operation. In 2016, it is expected that 
executive directors will be granted shares equivalent to 
50% of salary under the LTIP. These shares will vest on EPS 
and TSR performance over a 3-year period, as follows:
70% based on cumulative earnings per share, measured 
over 3 financial years:
Cumulative earnings per share for 
financial years 2016/2017/2018
% of the EPS element 
of the award which 
can be exercised
60.1p or above 100%
Between 52.5p  
and 60.1p 
Straight-line vesting 
between 25% and 100%
Below 52.5p 0%
30% based on relative total shareholder return relative 
to the constituents of the FTSE All Share General Retailers 
Index and the FTSE All Share Food & Drugs Retailers Index, 
measured over 3 financial years.
Relative TSR ranking 
% of the TSR element 
of the award which 
can be exercised

Between median 
and upper quartile 
Straight-line vesting 
between 25% and 100%
Below median 0%
64 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 65
In addition, for LTIP awards to become exercisable the committee must be satisfied that the formulaic LTIP outcome is a 
genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the business. The committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic 
LTIP outcome downwards, or upwards with shareholder consultation, within the plan limits.
An additional holding period of 2 years will apply to vested shares from the end of the performance period.
The committee has discretion to claw back any unvested long term incentive awards, or to vary the opportunities 
for future awards, in case of serious financial misstatement or gross misconduct. In extreme cases of gross misconduct, 
the committee may claw back vested long term incentive awards. The group has undertaken a fair valuation of its 
share-based payment transactions, specifically the LTIP and CSOP, using IFRS 2. The results of the valuation were deemed 
to be immaterial and therefore the IFRS 2 disclosures have been omitted.
Awards made under the LTIP and any other share-based schemes (the CSOP) will not exceed the Investment 
Association’s guideline on dilution of 10% in aggregate over a 10-year rolling period.

Executive directors’ pension arrangements
The current chief executive and the chief financial officer 
receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension. For the 
period ending 29 November 2015, this salary supplement 
was equal to 31.6% of salary for James Lancaster, and 31% 
for Jonathan Miller. The current chief operating officer 
participates in the group’s defined contribution scheme for 
which the company contributes 15% of salary. For the 
period ending 27 November 2016, executive directors’ 
pensions will be unchanged.
Non-executive director fees
For the 2016 financial period, the base fee for non-
executive directors will remain at £45,000 p.a., with an 
additional fee of £5,000 p.a. paid to the chairmen of 
the remuneration and audit committees. Following the 
appointment of Sharon Brown as interim chairman on 
2 October 2015, the committee agreed a temporary 
additional fee of £65,000 p.a. from 2 October 2015 for the 
period she serves as interim chairman (actual amount to 
be pro-rated).
Payments for loss of office
Martyn Aguss resigned from the company on 22 July 2014 
and ceased to be an executive director effective 30 July 
2014. In light of this, he was contractually entitled to receive 
salary and benefits for the period of 12 months’ notice, for 
which he has been on garden leave, as disclosed in last 
year’s remuneration report. This totalled £259,263 in 2015, 
including £198,975 in lieu of salary, £33,568 pension and 
£26,721 benefits (comprising car allowance of £11,612, 
fuel allowance of £5,425 and healthcare of £9,684).

Shareholder consultation
Given the strong support at the 2015 annual general meeting, and as no significant changes to the executive director 
remuneration structure were considered for 2016, there was no formal consultation with shareholders. Whilst we received 
strong support at the 2015 annual general meeting and no significant changes to the remuneration structure were 
considered for 2016, we wrote to our top shareholders in early 2016 advising them how we intend to implement our 
remuneration policy for the year ahead. As disclosed in last year’s report the committee also consulted with shareholders 
in advance of the 2015 annual general meeting regarding the proposed remuneration policy for executive directors, and 
the majority of shareholders consulted were broadly supportive of the proposals, as reflected in the voting outcome above.
Directors’ shareholdings and interest in shares
The executive directors each own significant shareholdings in the company. The committee sets shareholding guidelines 
which require executive directors to maintain, over time, a personal shareholding in the company of at least equivalent 
to one times salary.

Statement  
of directors’  
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the 
company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• 
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and
• 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
• 
properly select and apply accounting policies;
• 
present information including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
• 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and
• 
make an assessment of the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
68 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 69
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• 
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
• 
the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• 
the annual report and financial statements, taken as 
a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.

Governance Success with Subway
On 28 October 2015 our increasing 
focus on food-to-go took a new turn 
with the opening of our first Subway 
franchise in our Tamworth petrol 
forecourt store. We integrated it 
neatly into our existing store and are 
running it directly ourselves, like every 
aspect of all our stores. It proved to 
be an instant hit, generating strong 
sales in its first week of operation.
Good news for our partner Subway, 
and good news for us – so much so, 
we are planning to introduce more 
Subways into our stores over the 
next few years. A great brand that 
appeals to our neighbourhood 
customers, particularly the 18-25 year 
olds we are keen to encourage into 
our stores – Subway is an exciting 
addition to our fast-growing  
food-to-go offer.
It’ s a complementary 
offer to what we 
have in store.   
Food-to-go is 
the right way 
for the future

and of the parent company’s affairs as at 29 November 2015 and of the 
group’s profit for the 52 week period then ended;
• 
the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the

The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated

the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related notes  
1 to 31 for the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 1c 
to 9c in the parent company financial statements. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial 
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Separate opinion in relation  
to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the group financial statements, in addition  
to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, the group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued  
by the IASB.
72 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Going concern and the directors’ 
assessment of the principal risks 
that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting 
contained within note 1 to the financial statements and the directors’ 
statement on the longer term viability of the group contained within the 
directors’ report on page 40. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• 
the directors’ confirmation on page 68 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• 
the disclosures on pages 30 – 31 that describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
• 
the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis  
of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at 
least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• 
the directors’ explanation on page 40 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent 
of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided 
any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks  
of material misstatement  
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that

statements. There are a large number 
of individual arrangements which can 
be complex in nature. Contracts span 
the end of the reporting period 
meaning that estimates and 
judgements are necessary to 
calculate the amounts receivable 
under the terms of the contracts.
See cost of sales accounting policy 
in note 2 to the financial statements.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to:
• 
Evaluating the design and implementation of controls in place over 
supplier income and understanding of the commercial process via 
meetings with the finance and trading teams and reviewing for new 
or unusual agreements.
• 
For a statistical sample of supplier income agreements we understood 
the contract terms and recalculated the expected supplier income 
by comparing the amounts used in the calculations to actual purchases 
in the year taken from system-generated reports for which we gained 
assurance over their validity and completeness through IT controls testing.
• 
Performing analytical work on supplier income trends across suppliers and 
product categories investigating any unexpected variances.
• 
Assessing the recoverability of a sample of accrued supplier income which 
was evaluated by agreement to subsequent invoicing and cash receipts, 
or in the cases where these have yet to be settled, performing alternative 
procedures such as tracing to third party documentation.
• 
Inspecting a sample of post year-end credit notes for evidence of refunds 
or of invoiced amounts not being valid.
Property provisions
The group has an extensive and 
diverse property portfolio, including 
both leasehold and freehold 
property across the UK. As a result, 
there are several technically complex 
areas and judgemental aspects to 
consider when accounting for 
property and leases across the 
group, including:
• 
provisions for closed branches 
and onerous leases on vacant 
or part vacant properties. These 
represent future expenditure 
comprising of the rental payable 
under the lease agreement which 
is not recoverable from sub-letting 
the property and an estimate of 
ongoing service costs; and
• 
provisions for dilapidations 
expenses.
These provisions are £2.9m and 
£1.5m respectively and they include 
judgements around future cash 
flows related to the properties and 
the completeness of the related 
provisions. See provisions 
accounting policy in note 2 
to the financial statements.
For each of the property provisions:
• 
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls in place over 
the provision calculations.
• 
We obtained management’s calculations and selected statistical samples 
of individual properties where we recalculated the provision by testing 
and challenging the inputs, assumptions and discount rate used and 
corroborated to supporting external evidence including, but not limited 
to, lease contracts and dilapidation schedules issued by landlords.
• 
We performed sensitivity analysis on the key inputs applied to assess 
whether a reasonable fluctuation in these would change the provision 
by a material level. 
• 
We reviewed the list of branches that had been closed during the period 
to assess the completeness of the provision.
Independent auditor’ s report to the members  
of McColl’ s Retail Group plc continued
74 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Goodwill impairment
The goodwill value of £144m is 
supported by forecasts of future cash 
flows of the businesses. There are 
inherent risks within these cash flow 
forecasts due to the uncertainties as 
a result of changing industry and 
economic conditions and the 
resulting judgements required. The 
group holds a significant value of 
goodwill which has been generated 
through acquisitions of businesses, 
individual and groups of stores.
See goodwill impairment accounting 
policy in note 2 and note 12 to the 
financial statements.
We evaluated management’s goodwill impairment calculations and have 
challenged their calculations by:
• 
Recalculating the discount rates applied to future cash flows, working 
with our internal valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of 
the underlying calculations and assumptions; we have benchmarked 
the resulting discount rates against other companies operating in the 
retail sector.
• 
Comparing the assumed growth rates and forecasted cash flows against 
recent trading activity, historic trends and our understanding of the future 
prospects of the business to identify whether these scenarios could give rise 
to further impairment, including challenging the completeness of costs in 
forecasted cash flows.
• 
Performing sensitivity analysis on the inputs applied (including discount 
rates and growth rates) to assess whether a reasonably possible change 
in assumptions could result in an impairment.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is generated through 
transactions via the EPoS system 
which are settled in cash or by credit 
card. Results for each store are 
reported weekly through branch 
weekly returns. There are significant 
manual adjustments between these 
branch weekly returns and the 
financial statements which could be 
vulnerable to manipulation.
See revenue accounting policy in 
note 2 to the financial statements.
For revenue recognition we:
• 
Have evaluated the design and implementation of controls around the 
revenue cycle including using our IT specialist team to test the automated 
controls over the EPoS system.
• 
Understood the nature of the adjustments between the branch weekly 
returns and the financial statements and investigated and challenged a 
sample of these, agreeing these back to appropriate supporting evidence. 
Last year our report included stock provisioning which is not included in our report this year on the basis that we 
no longer assess this as having a significant risk of material misstatement.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the audit 
committee discussed on pages 49 to 51.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Financial statements
75 Financial statements
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality 
both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £1,100,000 (2014: £994,870), 
which is approximately 5.1% (2014: 5.2%) of adjusted profit before tax, and 0.9% 
(2014: 0.9%) of equity. Profit before tax has been normalised by adjusting for 
exceptional items (relating to restructuring costs of £625,000 as described in 
note 5 to the financial statements). We believe this is an appropriate basis for 
materiality as it reflects recurring performance.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all 
audit differences in excess of £50,000 as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope 
of our audit
The group’s business consists of a collection of retail stores and operates as a 
single operating segment, entirely within the UK, as defined in note 4 to the 
financial statements. The financial results of the group are aggregated at a 
consolidated level without the need for consolidation adjustments to account 
for eliminations between group statutory companies. Therefore we identify only 
one reporting component being the group itself, which includes the parent 
company audit (which we audit to a lower materiality level), on which we 
perform our audit using a single audit team.
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• 
the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations  
received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
• 
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters.
Corporate governance statement Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the corporate 
governance statement relating to the company’s compliance with certain 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Independent auditor’ s report to the members  
of McColl’ s Retail Group plc continued
76 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Matters on which we are required to report by exception (continued)
Our duty to read other information 
in the annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• 
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• 
otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities  
of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). 
Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and 
systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Scope of the audit of the  
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

80 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the financial statements
52 week period ended 29 November 2015 
1. Basis of preparation
The group financial statements for 2015 consolidate the financial statements of McColl’s Retail Group plc 
(the “company”) and all its subsidiary undertakings (together, “the group”) drawn up to 29 November 2015. 
The group’s accounting period covers the 52 weeks ended 29 November 2015. The comparative period covered 
the 53 weeks ended 30 November 2014. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
The group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS and 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reported under IFRS. The group’s going concern position is set 
out in the directors’ report section on page 39.
The consolidated financial information is presented in sterling, the group’s functional currency, and has been 
rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000).
The preparation of financial information in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It also 
requires group management to exercise judgement in applying the group’s accounting policies.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial information are disclosed in note 3.
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following items 
(refer to individual accounting policies for details):
• 
Derivative financial instruments – fair value through profit or loss; and
• 
Net defined benefit pension asset or liability – actuarial basis.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by 
the company (its subsidiaries) made up to 29 November 2015. Control is achieved where the company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated Income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those used by the group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the 
date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired, including separately 
identifiable intangible assets, is recognised as goodwill. Any discount on acquisition, i.e., where the cost of acquisition 
is below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired, is credited to the income statement in the period 
of acquisition.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current financial period, the group has applied for the first time:
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ 
IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. (See note 13 on pages 96 and 97 for full details.)
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’,
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’
IAS 27 (2011) ‘Separate Financial Statements’
IAS 28 (2011) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’; and
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 ‘Investment Entities’
Financial statements
81 Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
52 week period ended 29 November 2015
1. Basis of preparation (continued)
New standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not 
been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU).
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue’
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
Amendments to IAS 36 ‘Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets’ 
Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting’
IFRIC Interpretation 21 ‘Levies’
With the exception of IFRS 16, which is under review, the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and 
interpretations in future periods will have no significant impact of the group’s financial statements when the relevant 
standards come into effect.
In addition to the above new standards or amendments, there are additional new standards and amendments which 
will not be applicable to the group and as such have not been listed. 
2. Significant accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts receivable for goods and services sold through retail outlets in the period which 
fall within the group’s principal activities, stated net of value added tax. Revenue is shown net of returns. Revenue 
is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and services have been passed to the buyer and can 
be measured reliably.
Commission from the sale of lottery tickets and electronic phone top-ups is recognised net within turnover, when 
transactions deriving commissions are completed, as the group acts as an agent.
In the opinion of the directors, the group engages in one principal area of activity, that of operators of convenience 
and newsagent stores. Turnover is derived entirely from the United Kingdom.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of all direct costs to the point of sale including warehouse and transportation costs. Supplier 
incentives, rebates and discounts are recognised as a credit to cost of sales in the period in which the stock to which 
the discounts apply is sold. The accrued value at the reporting date is included in prepayments and accrued income.
Other operating income
Post Office, rental income and ATM commissions are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the 
services to which they relate are earned.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s 
share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an 
asset on the group’s balance sheet in the year in which it arises. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment 
at least annually and is stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Any impairment is recognised in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated are 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in a subsequent period.
82 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
See note 12 on pages 94 to 95 for further details of cash-generating units and impairment testing.
Computer software within intangible assets
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Externally 
acquired computer software and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their useful economic lives of 5 to 8 years and are included within other intangible assets. Costs relating to 
development of computer software for internal use do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible 
Assets and are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs incurred attributable to bringing the asset 
to its working condition for intended use.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values on 
a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. Principal rates used for this 
purpose are:
Land and buildings
Depreciation of land and buildings is charged as follows:
Freehold (including land where it is not separately identifiable) – 50 years
Long leaseholds improvements – 50 years
Land (if separately identifiable) – nil
Short leaseholds improvements:
– Shops – 10 years or remaining lease term if less
– Other – term of the lease
Leasehold premiums – the unexpired portion of the lease
Motor vehicles, fixtures and equipment
Depreciation of motor vehicles, fixtures and equipment is charged as follows:
– Motor vehicles – 4 years
– Computer equipment – between 5 and 8 years
– Furniture and fittings – between 5 and 10 years
Gains and losses on disposal of any fixed assets are determined by comparing proceeds with the asset’s carrying 
amount and are recognised within operating profit.
Fixed asset impairments
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets, excluding goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to 
sell and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. For property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store. Any resulting impairment is charged to 
administrative expenses.
Assets classified as held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition, a sale 
is highly probable and expected to be completed within one period from the date of classification. Such assets are 
measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortised.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. For property leases, the land and building 
elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Finance leases/hire purchase contracts
Assets funded through finance leases or hire purchase contracts are capitalised as property, plant and equipment 
and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The amount capitalised is the 
lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term at the 
inception of the lease. The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges. Finance costs 
on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest.
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Sale and leaseback
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of that 
asset by entering into a lease with the buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends upon the 
substance of the transaction and whether or not the sale was made at the asset’s fair value. For sale and operating 
leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Following initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those principles described above.
Lease incentives
Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods. Lease incentives are capitalised and 
spread over the period of the lease term.
Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases
Where a lease has predetermined fixed rental increases, these rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Operating lease income
Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements and is recognised as earned.
Inventories
Inventories consist of goods for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated 
using a retail method which for each category of stock reduces the net selling price by the attributable average gross 
margin. Net realisable value is the price at which the stocks can be realised in the normal course of business, net of 
selling and distribution costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for 
which the asset was acquired. The group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
Receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They arise principally from the group’s trading operations (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other 
types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on 
the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all 
of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the 
net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. 
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with 
the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. On confirmation 
that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the 
associated provision.
The group’s receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the group 
balance sheet.
84 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and – for the purpose of the statement of cash flows – bank 
overdrafts. When drawn, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the group balance sheet.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or 
where the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities
The group classifies its financial liabilities into one category:
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include:
• 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts – these are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are 
accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to 
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where 
existing debt is refinanced with the same lender it is treated as an extinguishment of the original debt and a new 
financial liability if the modified terms are substantially different from the previous terms.
• 
Trade payables and other short term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair value estimation
The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are 
disclosed in note 25.
Derivative financial instruments
The only derivative financial instruments that the group enters into are interest rate swaps. The purpose of these 
transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the group’s operations and sources of finance.
The group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are also measured at 
fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps (unless qualifying as cash 
flow hedge accounting) are recognised in the income statement as finance income or costs as they arise.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Share-based payment arrangements
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair 
value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate 
of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting 
period, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision 
of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit and loss account.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Taxation
Current taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when it relates to items charged to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the current tax is also dealt 
with in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base and 
accounting base of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where a deferred tax liability arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. It is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability 
is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it is probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity or other 
comprehensive income respectively.
Provisions
The group recognises provisions for liabilities of uncertain timing or amounts, including those for onerous leases, 
leasehold dilapidations and legal disputes. Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to 
settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at 
the present value of the best estimate of expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The 
increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Onerous contracts/leases
Provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected sub-let rental income, are recognised when the leased 
property becomes vacant and is no longer used in the operations of the business.
Dilapidations
Provisions for dilapidations and similar contractual property costs are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis when the 
need for expenditure has been identified, being the point at which the likely expenditure can be reliably estimated.
Pensions
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in addition to several defined contribution schemes, 
which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
Defined contribution schemes
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the year to which 
they relate.
86 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Defined benefit schemes
Defined benefit scheme surpluses and deficits are measured at:
• 
The fair value of plan assets at the reporting date; less
• 
Scheme liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method discounted to its present value using yields 
available on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the liabilities; plus
• 
Unrecognised past service costs; less 
• 
The effect of minimum funding requirements agreed with scheme trustees.
A surplus is recognised where the group has an unconditional right to the economic benefits in the form of future 
contribution reductions or refunds.
Any difference between the expected return on assets and that actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities 
over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Costs are recognised separately as operating and finance costs in the income statement. Operating costs comprise 
the current service cost, any income or expense on settlements or curtailments and past service costs where the 
benefits have vested.
Past service costs are recognised directly in income unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on 
the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time. In this case, the past service costs are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Finance items comprise the interest on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets.
Further information on pensions is disclosed in note 30.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately 
below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies and that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
Supplier income
Supplier income is generated from commercial agreements with suppliers including incentives, rebates and 
discounts. Agreements are typically for the calendar year so are not concurrent with the financial reporting period.  
Judgement is required as to the level of income which should be accrued for in relation to achieving pre-set trading 
targets in the final month of the calendar year. Changes in the assumptions used would not have a significant effect 
on the group statement of comprehensive income.
Cash-generating units (CGUs)
The group determines CGUs for the purpose of goodwill impairment based on the way it manages the business. 
Judgement is required to ensure this assessment is appropriate and in line with IAS 36. This is expanded on in  
note 12 on pages 94 and 95.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year, are discussed below.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Goodwill impairment
The group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based on the 
recoverable amount of its cash-generating units (CGUs). The recoverable amount is determined based on value in 
use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a pre-tax 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. More information including carrying values is 
included in note 12 on pages 94 to 95.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
Financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and 
circumstances suggest that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value.
Recoverable amount is based on the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is 
calculated from expected future cash flows using suitable discount rates and includes management assumptions and 
estimates of future performance. Fair values for individual trading stores are based on a multiple of its average weekly 
sales performance. 
Details of the accounting policy on the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are provided 
in note 2 on page 83.
Pensions
The costs, assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the group are determined using 
methods relying on actuarial estimates and assumptions, including rates of increase in pensionable salaries and 
pensions, expected returns on scheme assets, life expectancies and discount rates. Details of the key assumptions 
are set out in note 30. The group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the 
assumptions and the recognition of any surplus. Changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect 
on the group statement of comprehensive income and the group balance sheet.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases and dilapidations. These provisions are estimates, in particular the 
assumptions relating to market rents and vacant periods, and the actual costs and timing of future cash flows are 
dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted 
for in the period when such determination is made. Details of provisions are set out in note 23.
4. Segmental analysis and revenue
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ an operating segment is defined as a business activity whose 
operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete information is available. 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker, as required by IFRS 8. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources 
and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors. The principal 
activities of the group are currently managed as one segment. Consequently all activities relate to this segment, 
being the operation of convenience and newsagent stores in the UK.

Changes in tax rates and factors affecting the future tax charge
In July 2015, the UK Government announced its intention to reduce the corporation tax rate to 19% with effect from 
1 April 2017 and 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. These changes were substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date and therefore have been reflected in the deferred tax provisions.
10. Dividends
The board has recommended a final dividend of 6.8 pence per share (2014: 6.8 pence), totalling £7,120,000 (2014: 
£7,120,000), subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting to be held on 19 April 2016. The final 
dividend will be paid on 31 May 2016 to those shareholders on the register at the close of business on 29 April 2016. 
The payment of this dividend will not have any tax consequences for the group. The interim dividend, declared and 
paid, was 3.4 pence per share (2014: 1.7 pence), totalling £3,560,000 (2014: £1,780,000).

94 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that 
are expected to benefit from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount 
of goodwill had been allocated as follows:
29 November

£’000
30 November
2014
£’000
24 November
2013
£’000
CGU1 95,628 95,476 94,725

CGU3 42,392 35,111 29,259
Transferred to assets held for sale (507) – –
144,013 137,112 130,353
The three groups are as follows:
CGU1 – Goodwill which arose from a management buy-out in 2005, including all goodwill held at that time;
CGU2 – Goodwill generated on a significant acquisition in 2008;
CGU3 – Goodwill acquired on all other acquisitions after the management buy-out in 2005.
The recoverable amounts of all three CGUs are determined from value in use calculations with a discounted cash 
flow model used to calculate this amount. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation include the discount 
rate and long-term growth rates. The value in use calculations use cash flows based on the detailed financial budget 
for 2016 covering a 12 month period. The budget has regard to historical performance and knowledge of the current 
market, together with management’s view on the future achievable growth. Cash flows beyond this period are 
extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of nil and discounted with a WACC of 11.9% (2014: 10.0%).
Management consider a long-term growth rate of zero to be a prudent basis to extrapolate cash flows. The pre-tax 
discount rate is based on the group’s weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and 
borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made.
The group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment testing for goodwill. With reasonable possible 
changes in key assumptions, management have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes 
in any key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the value in use.

The net book value of tangible fixed assets includes an amount of £3,421,000 (2014: £3,947,000) in respect of assets 
held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts. The related depreciation charge on these assets for the 
period was £1,668,000 (2014: £1,726,000). They all relate to plant and machinery. See note 2 on page 83 for details 
of impairment review and assumptions.
Assets held for sale
Following a review of its portfolio of stores, the group has decided to sell 100 of its newsagents (subsequently 3 have 
been withdrawn from sale). We continue to focus on the strategy of developing and expanding the convenience 
business and have identified these stores as not being part of our long term planning.
There are now 97 stores involved which are being marketed individually to purchasers with the fair value of the stores 
ranging between £10,000 and £80,000. It is expected that in total these stores will be sold for no less than their net 
asset value and their closure is expected to be earnings neutral in 2016.
The group have treated this disposal under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. 
IFRS 5 requires that the group must not offset the gains and losses compared to fair value of the individual stores. 
However, on the basis that it is not practical to disclose 97 individual assets held for sale, these have been disclosed 
in aggregate.

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.  
For most suppliers no interest is charged on the trade payables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. 
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balances at various interest rates. The group has financial risk 
management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

accordion facility for the group. This facility amends the group’s existing £85m plus £15m accordion facilities which 
were due to expire in July 2018. The new facility will be in place until August 2020 at margins of 1.5% above LIBOR.

Dilapidations
The provision includes estimates for certain properties for which the extent of the dilapidation has not been 
established. It is expected that most of these costs will be incurred in the next 5 years.
Onerous contracts
A provision is recognised for the rent due less estimated rent receivable until the anticipated disposal of a vacant 
property. The periods of vacant property commitments range from 1 to 10 years. In addition, provision has been made 
for excess rent over market rent on one leasehold property as part of fair value assessments made on acquisition. 
Judgement is used for certain properties in respect of how long the property will remain vacant. The level of uncertainty 
associated with the use of estimates is not considered to be significant.

Deferred tax has arisen owing to accelerated capital allowances, business combinations, pension deficit/surplus and 
other temporary differences and also in respect of the taxable gains arising on the disposal of intangible fixed assets 
where the gains have been rolled into replacement assets.
Deferred tax at 29 November 2015 has been measured at 18% (2014: 20%) being the tax rate substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date expected to be effective for future periods.
25. Financial instruments and risk management
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The group’s principal financial instruments comprise loans, cash and short term deposits together with interest rate 
derivatives. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the group’s operations. The group 
has various other financial instruments such as trade and other receivables and trade and other payables that arise 
directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. There have been no substantive 
changes in the group’s exposure to financial instrument risks or its objectives, policies and processes for managing and 
measuring those risks during the periods in this report unless otherwise stated.
On 15 August 2015 the group completed and signed an amended £85m revolving credit facility and a £15m 
accordion facility for the group. This facility amends the group’s existing £85m plus £15m accordion facilities which 
were due to expire in July 2018. The new facility will be in place until August 2020 at margins of 1.5% above LIBOR. 
The current facility drawn as at 29 November 2015 is £44,500,000.
Interest rate risk
The group is exposed to interest rate risk from its use of interest bearing financial instruments. This is a market risk that the 
fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates. There are no 
financial instruments held at level 1, 2 or 3 fair value.
Floating rate financial liabilities on which interest is paid bear interest at rates based on 1 month LIBOR. It is the 
group’s policy to consider the need for interest rate hedging on an ongoing basis. No interest rate hedging is 
currently in place.

Financial assets –  35,970  35,970 
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher during the period ended 29 November 2015, with all other variables held 
constant, the post tax profit for the period would have been approximately £237,000 lower (2014: £282,000 lower) 
as a result of higher interest expense.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the group’s management of working capital and the finance charges on its debt instruments 
and repayments of principal. It is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as 
they fall due.
The group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of 
overdrafts and credit facilities to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they 
become due.

The group had certain borrowing facilities available to it for general working capital requirements of which 
£44,500,000 had been drawn at 29 November 2015 (30 November 2014: £46,000,000).
Credit risk
Given the nature of the group’s operations, credit risk is not considered significant and arises mainly from cash 
deposits held with banks and financial institutions which have a good credit rating. Credit risk also arises from trade 
and other receivables which comprise amounts due from credit card institutions and rebates due from suppliers.

share ranks equally in the right to receive a relative proportion of shares in the event of a capitalisation of reserves.
27. Leases and commitments
Operating leases
The group leases various properties and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. The terms of the property 
leases vary, although they tend to be with rent reviews every 3 to 5 years and many have break clauses.
The total future value of minimum lease rentals payable is as follows:

As set out in note 6 property rental income earned during the year was £2,693,000 (2014: £3,253,000). All operating 
lease contracts contain market review clauses in the event that the lessee exercises its option to renew. The lessee 
does not have an option to purchase the property at the expiry of the lease period.

29. Contingent liabilities 
The group did not have any material contingent liabilities at 29 November 2015 or 30 November 2014.
Certain subsidiaries of the company have assigned UK property leases in the normal course of business. Should the 
assignees fail to fulfil any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the group may be liable for those defaults. 
The group cannot reliably quantify the amount of such contingent liabilities due to their uncertain nature. The number 
of such claims arising to date has been small and the liability, which is charged to the profit and loss account as it 
arises, has not been material.
30. Retirement benefit schemes 
The group accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 revised.
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, the TM Group pension scheme and the 
TM pension plan, in addition to several defined contribution schemes which require contributions to be made 
to separately administered funds. Pension costs for defined contribution schemes were £1,356,000 in 2015 
(2014: £1,042,000).
The two defined benefit pension schemes are subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the 
Scheme Specific Funding requirements. The schemes are operated under trust and, as such, the trustees of the 
schemes are responsible for operating the schemes and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance 
with the trust deed and rules, in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the schemes, and UK legislation (including 
Trust law).
The nature of the schemes exposes the group to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the 
schemes in times of adverse experience. The most financially significant risks are likely to be:
• 
Members living for longer than expected;
• 
Higher than expected actual inflation; 
• 
Lower than expected investment returns; and
• 
The risk that movements in the value of the schemes’ liabilities are not met by corresponding movements in the value 
of the schemes’ assets.
The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication on the impact on the value of the schemes’ 
liabilities of the risks highlighted.
Full actuarial valuations of the 2 defined benefit pension schemes are carried out in accordance with legislative 
requirements. The last full valuations of the schemes were carried out at 31 March 2013.
Contributions to the schemes are made in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the 
basis of valuations. The figures for this financial information have been based, in accordance with IAS 19 revised, 
on valuations using the projected unit method.
The contributions made in respect of the accounting period were £1,515,000 in 2015 (2014: £1,376,000). As at 29 
November 2015 contributions of £nil (2014: £126,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been 
paid over to the schemes.

Notes to the financial statements continued
52 week period ended 29 November 2015
30. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
The agreed contribution level for future years following the latest actuarial valuation of the schemes, is £1,533,000 per 
annum increased annually by price inflation. This will be subject to annual review and at the next actuarial valuation 
the contribution level will be reassessed.
Both defined benefits schemes ceased accrual on 1 July 2008 and now have no active members. Both schemes are 
closed to new entrants. 
The disclosures are based upon the valuation of the schemes which were carried out as at 31 March 2013, updated to 
29 November 2015 by qualified independent actuaries. The main assumptions when valuing the assets and liabilities 
of the schemes under IAS 19 revised are as follows:
Group pension schemes

 2.5% LPI 2.10  2.10 
Discount rate 3.55  3.50 
The long term expected return on assets has been set with reference to current market yields on government and 
corporate bonds, and expected outperformance of equities and property. The overall expected return on assets 
reflects the relative weighting of different asset classes held by the scheme.
None of the group’s own financial instruments or property, either held or occupied by the group, are held as assets 
within either schemes.

114 McColl’ s Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 1c. Basis of preparation
The company’s financial period is the period from 1 December 2014 to 29 November 2015. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The directors have considered the company forecasts 
and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the current economic 
uncertainty, and are satisfied that the company should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities. 
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006 from 
presenting its own profit and loss account. The company made a profit after tax of £18,236,000 (2014: £4,600,000).
The company has taken advantage of the exemptions in FRS 1 – ‘Cash flow statements’ and has not prepared a cash 
flow statement. 
Accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the periods. 
The company has not disclosed transactions with related parties that are part of the Martin McColl Retail Limited 
(formerly McColl’s Retail Group Limited) group of companies, which are wholly owned, as permitted by FRS 8 
‘Related Parties’. 
2c. Significant accounting policies 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. 
Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less 
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Following the publication of FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements by the Financial Reporting 
Council, McColl’s Retail Group plc is required to change its accounting framework for its entity financial statements 
(currently prepared under UK GAAP) for its financial year commencing 1 January 2015. The board considers that it 
is in the best interests of the group for McColl’s Retail Group plc to adopt FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
It is emphasised that this will involve no reduction in disclosures from those in the current UK GAAP financial statements 
for the parent company entity. 
A shareholder or shareholders holding in aggregate 5% or more of the total allotted shares in McColl’s Retail Group plc 
may serve objections to the use of the disclosure exemptions, in writing, to the company’s registered office (McColl’s 
House, Ashwells Road, Brentwood, Essex CM15 9ST) not later than 19 April 2016.
The group’s consolidated financial statements will continue to be prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

Open pit mining operation
The open pit delivered total material movement of 44,820kt 
for the year, an increase of 7% on the prior year. 
Sukari Hill exploration
Surface drilling from January to April 2014 continued 
in the northern portions of the Sukari Hill deposit 
(through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into the northern 
Pharaoh Zone).
Regional exploration
Seven other prospects besides Sukari Hill have been 
identified on the 160km

 Sukari tenement area and 
exploration is being conducted under the principle that 
ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing 
processing plant.
Underground mining operation
Ore production from the underground mine was a record 
968kt, a 65% increase on 2013.
Amun and Ptah declines
A total of 6,625m of development was completed, including 
5,701m which was mineralised (4,737m in Amun, and 961m 
in Ptah) and associated with stoping blocks planned for 
mining in 2015‑17. 
Sukari underground exploration
Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari 
exploration programme and was progressively stepped 
up during the year. Continued underground development 
provided improved access to test potential high‑grade 
extensions of the deposit, which remains open to the north 
and at depth.  Strategic report

Advanced exploration: Burkino Faso
In March, Centamin acquired ASX‑listed Ampella Mining 
Limited, thus gaining exploration rights over a highly 
prospective circa 2,200km
2
 region of Burkina Faso (“Batie 
West”) containing a 1.9Moz Indicated and 1.3Moz Inferred 
resource at the Konkera Prospect. Fieldwork is aimed at 
expanding the near‑surface resource through a systematic 
drilling, sampling and surveying programme over the 
numerous highly prospective target areas within this district.
Early stage exploration
Centamin’s portfolio also includes early stage exploration in 
highly prospective areas of Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia.
Côte d’Ivoire
As part of the Ampella transaction, Centamin acquired three 
licences in Côte d’Ivoire covering a circa 1,200km
2
 area 
across the border from Batie West in Burkina Faso. A further 
four licences are under application.
An ongoing programme of mapping, rock chip sampling 
auger drilling and geochemistry is aimed at processing a 
rapid and efficient assessment of the exploration permits 
potential and then either move prospects into advanced 
exploration or move to new permit areas.
Ethiopia
Centamin continued exploration on its tenement in Una 
Deriem in northern Ethiopia, and in total, 2,547.9m were 
drilled in 2014 bringing total drilling for the region to 
13,783m. A new licence known as the ‘Ondonok Dabus’ 
Licence was awarded and regional works are under way. 
A limited exploration programme was carried out on two 
licence areas under joint venture with AIM‑listed Alect o 
Minerals. Initial results were not as anticipated and as such 
led to the cancellation of this agreement in early 2015. 
Centamin’s portfolio includes advanced exploration 
in Burkina Faso and early exploration in Ethiopia and 
Côte d’Ivoire.

Chairman’s statement
Centamin’s corporate strategy seeks to deliver peer‑leading 
shareholder returns by taking gold projects from 
exploration, through development and into production. 
In this respect, 2014 was a pivotal year for the Company. 
Our flagship Sukari Gold Mine saw the successful 
commissioning of the US$331 million Stage 4 process 
plant expansion, marking the project’s transition out of the 
investment phase and into a sustainable period of free 
cash flow generation over an expected minimum 20‑year 
mine life. In recognition of this and due to the Company’s 
strong financial position, the Board of Directors initiated a 
dividend programme during 2014 with a maiden interim 
dividend of 0.87 US cents per share. The Company is now 
pleased to announce the approval of a final dividend for 
2014 of 1.99 US cents per share (totalling approximately 
US$23 million) which represents for the full year, a pay‑out 
level of approximately 30% of our free cash flow as defined 
by our dividend policy.
The strong ramp‑up in production rates associated with the 
expansion presented a number of operational challenges 
during 2014. Although our strong track record of delivery 
against annual gold production guidance was affected by 
lower‑than‑expected processing rates and underground 
grades, resulting in revised guidance, the fourth quarter saw 
annualised rates in excess of our long term 450‑500,000 
ounce target. Full year production of 377,261 ounces was 
a 6% increase on 356,943 ounces in 2013. This strong end 
to the year was achieved as plant throughput exceeded the 
expanded 10Mtpa nameplate capacity and open pit grades 
increased in line with the mine plan.
Cost control remains an absolute focus of the Company 
and it is pleasing to note that, despite full year production 
of around 10% lower than forecast at the start of the year, 
the cash operating cost of US$729/oz was only marginally 
above our original US$700/oz guidance. In line with 
the strong production rate, Q4 cash operating costs of 
US$655/oz point towards the long‑term potential of the 
operation to deliver highly‑competitive cash margins. 
Our growth strategy seeks 
to optimise exposure 
through the mining 
value chain: exploration, 
development and 
operations.

Chairman Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
 
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 11
The impact of a weaker gold price environment contributed 
towards a 29% year‑on‑year reduction of EBITDA to 
US$165.4 million. Profit after tax of US$81.6 million was 
down 56% on 2013 and earnings per share of 7.21 cents 
compare with 16.87 cents in 2013. Gold production 
guidance for 2015 is 420,000 ounces at a cash operating 
cost of US$700/oz and all‑in‑sustaining cost (“AISC”) of 
US$950/oz. The northern and eastern walls of the open pit 
are a focus for 2015 and, as mining progresses through the 
upper portions of the next stage of pit development, grades 
are scheduled to progressively increase to the reserve 
average in the second half of the year, when production 
is expected to increase to the 450‑500,000 ounce per 
annum rate. 
Over the medium term, continued optimisation and higher 
productivity rates, in particular within the processing and 
underground mining operations, offer good potential for 
further production growth and reductions in AISC for no 
additional capital expenditure for expansion. We therefore 
remain confident that Sukari will continue to deliver further 
incremental growth over the coming years.
Centamin remains committed to its policy of being 100% 
exposed to the gold price through its unhedged position 
and our balance sheet remains strong, with US$162.8 million 
in cash, bullion on hand, gold sales receivables and 
available‑for‑sale financial assets as at 31 December 2014.
During 2014 Centamin made good progress in securing 
its longer‑term growth objectives. The completion of the 
Ampella Mining acquisition in March gave us a substantial 
footprint in the highly prospective regions of Burkina 
Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. Subsequent to completion of 
the acquisition, a systematic exploration programme was 
initiated aimed at developing the potential for further 
significant growth of the 1.9Moz Indicated and 1.3Moz 
Inferred resource. 
Processing plant at Sukari Strategic report
| Centamin plc Annual report 2014 12
Chairman’s statement continued
Whilst disciplined and sustainable growth on our existing 
projects remains a key focus, we continue to evaluate 
opportunities to grow through the acquisition of projects 
which offer the potential for the Company to deliver on its 
strategic objectives.
The two litigation actions, Diesel Fuel Oil and Concession 
Agreement, progressed in line with our expectations during 
the year and are described in further detail in Note 20 to the 
financial statements. In respect of the latter, the Company 
continues to believe that it has a strong legal position and, 
in addition, that it will ultimately benefit from the new law 
no. 32 of 2014, which came into force in April 2014 and 
which restricts the capacity for third parties to challenge any 
contractual agreement between the Egyptian government 
and an investor. This new law is currently under review by 
the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt. We are aware of 
the potential for the legal process in Egypt to be slow and 
for cases to be subject to delays and adjournments but we 
remain confident of the merits of the two cases.
The Group continues to benefit from the full support of the 
Ministry of Petroleum and EMRA, both in the Concession 
Agreement appeal and at the operational level. As part 
of our long‑term strategy, we look forward to continuing 
to share the benefits of this substantial investment as the 
operation, having transitioned from its initial period of 
construction, sets the stage for a new era of gold mining 
in Egypt.
Subsequent to the year end, Andrew Pardey was appointed 
as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and joined the Board 
as an executive director from 1 February 2015. Andrew has 
been a driving force behind Sukari’s growth into one of the 
world’s leading gold mines and of Centamin’s development 
from a junior exploration company into one of the largest 
gold producers in North Africa. His experience and 
stewardship will be of invaluable benefit to the business 
as it continues to develop and realise its next stages of 
growth. In my role as Chairman I look forward to continuing 
to work with the Company towards delivering substantial 
shareholder value through further development of our 
portfolio of assets.
Trevor Schultz resigned as an executive director and was 
appointed as a non‑executive director from 1 May 2014, 
coinciding with the successful completion of construction 
of the Stage 4 expansion and hand over to operations for 
commissioning. Trevor has made an invaluable contribution 
to the establishment of Sukari as a globally‑significant 
gold mining operation, in particular with his recent role in 
overseeing the construction of the Stage 4 process plant. 
Such a major construction project that was completed 
with minimal cost and time overruns is testament to his 
strong leadership and experience. I am delighted that the 
Company and its shareholders continue to benefit from 
Trevor’s counsel in his role as a non‑executive director.
Subsequent to the year‑end, Professor G Robert 
Bowker (aged 65) retired as a non‑executive director, 
effective from 26 January 2015. Bob has been involved with 
the Company since 2008 and during this time the Centamin 
team have benefited greatly from his insightful view of the 
political landscape in Egypt and the wider region. Bob has 
provided valued counsel to those that he has worked with 
over the years and has been a part of the evolution of the 
Company from explorer to Egypt’s first modern gold miner. 
All of us at Centamin wish him well in the future.
This year, the Chairman of the Corporate Governance 
Committee has presented the corporate governance 
report. As Chairman of the Board I agree and endorse 
both this report and the values of good governance 
reflected in it. In my view Board effectiveness has been 
achieved, in no small part, by ensuring that communication 
channels are open between all Board members and 
regular information is presented to the Board allowing 
all members to contribute knowledgeably at Board 
meetings and in discussions between the executives 
and non‑executive directors.
We take every action to ensure Sukari has the minimum 
impact on the social environment, as well as to deliver 
positive benefits to Egypt and the community as a result 
of our investment. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

I would like to close by thanking all those at Sukari, in 
Alexandria, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Jersey 
and Perth for their efforts in 2014 as Centamin continued 
on its journey to becoming an established cash‑generative 
gold producer.
Your Company remains well positioned to deliver 
outstanding shareholder returns in the coming years as 
we adhere to our philosophy of focusing on free cash flow 
generation, returns to shareholders and growth through 
exploration. I look forward to updating you further over 
the course of 2015, and would welcome you to join us

Blast hole drilling in Sukari pit Strategic report
| Centamin plc Annual report 2014 14
Dear shareholders
2014 was another year of production growth for Sukari 
and overall performance bodes well for the potential of the 
operation to generate significant free cash flow over the 
coming years. The Stage 4 project to double nameplate 
capacity at the process plant to 10 million tonnes per annum 
(Mtpa) was completed during the first half of the year for a 
total capital expenditure of US$331.2 million. The project 
was completed on budget and with limited timeline 
over‑runs, representing a solid achievement in itself, but is 
all the more notable when set against the various external 
challenges that were faced, particularly during the early 
stages of the construction period. 
Whilst affected by periods of below‑expected productivity, 
progressive increases in plant throughput continued as 
commissioning activities took effect and the nameplate 
10Mtpa capacity was reached, and exceeded, from 
September onwards.
The fourth quarter was another record for both open pit 
and underground mining rates and productivity in both of 
these areas remains strong. Following government approval 
in the fourth quarter for the increase in Ammonium Nitrate 
(“AN”) usage, the open pit is now on a secure footing to 
deliver the scheduled material movements as required for 
the expanded operation. The underground mine continued 
to deliver strong increases in volumes through 2014, 
achieving above‑target levels by year end, although with 
lower grades than originally forecast. With the operation 
now appropriately scaled for the higher processing 
rate, the focus for 2015 is on reducing grade volatility 
and thereafter leveraging the potential for additional 
productivity increases. 
The efficiency gains delivered with the production 
ramp‑up are indicated by a material year‑on‑year decrease 
in operating costs per tonne, in both the mining and 
processing areas. This is a trend we expect to continue in 
the coming quarters as the expanded operation continues 
to be optimised.

Centamin’s track record of safety is an aspect of our 
performance of which I am both pleased and eager to 
improve. Developing a strong culture of health and safety 
awareness onsite has resulted in improved reporting of 
incidents compared to previous years and our LTI frequency 
rate of 0.39 per 200,000 man‑hours in 2014 (0.36 in 2013) 
is a solid achievement, especially when considering Sukari 
is the first modern gold mine in Egypt. Nevertheless, there 
remains room for improvement and our target is for zero 
injuries and having every person go home safely every day. 
Subsequent to the year end, an unfortunate incident 
occurred in Burkina Faso on a public road near the Konkera 
village which resulted in one of our local employees being 
fatally wounded and another sustaining injuries. The 
wellbeing of our employees is a priority for Centamin and a 
thorough investigation into this bandit attack, on two of our 
vehicles, has been carried out. Further additional security 
measures have been proposed following the incident and 
these are being implemented. There was no impact on

Chief Executive Officer’s report continued
The focus for 2015 is to continue production growth  
at Sukari whilst maintaining a strong control on costs,  
with the objective of generating substantial free cash flow 
even under challenging gold price assumptions. 
The greenhouse gas emissions reporting required by 
Schedule 7 of The Large and Medium‑Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as 
amended by The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, is a requirement 
only on UK incorporated quoted companies. Centamin has, 
however, provided information relating to this legislation in 
the CSR report. 
 See pages 46 to 57
Maintaining good community relations is a core part of our 
operational strategy and corporate governance standards. 
As the first mining company in Egypt in modern times, we 
strive to set an example of a socially responsible industry 
through adopting a good neighbour policy. We take every 
action to ensure Sukari has the minimum impact on the 
social environment, as well as to deliver positive benefits to 
Egypt and the community as a result of our investment, and 
further details of our various initiatives can be found in the 
CSR report.
Our work force is remunerated well above the average for 
Egypt and our career development programmes are highly 
valued. In general we enjoy a very positive and constructive 
relationship with our employees.
Outlook
The focus for 2015 is to continue production growth at 
Sukari whilst maintaining a strong control on costs, with 
the objective of generating substantial free cash flow even 
under challenging gold price assumptions. We intend to 
return 15‑30% of this cash flow to our shareholders, in line 
with our dividend policy, and to allocate the remainder 
towards our medium and long‑term objective of organic 
growth aimed at realising incremental shareholder value 
and returns.
Safety remains a priority and our target is a lost time injury 
rate of zero during 2015.
Guidance for 2015 is for 420,000 ounces at US$700/oz 
cash operating cost and US$950/oz all‑in‑sustaining cost. 
Production is expected to achieve the 450‑500,000 ounce 
per annum target rate from second half of 2015 onwards. 
In the open pit, the focus will continue on the northern 
and eastern cutback to expose higher grade ore from the 
second half of the year. This will ensure that the operation 
is on a secure footing to sustain, on an annual basis, the 
required tonnages at reserve‑average grades. 
We aim to build on the significant productivity increases 
from the underground mine by targeting a reduction in 
grade volatility.
As we achieve these targets, and during the next two 
to three year period, we intend to continue optimising 
the various areas of the expanded Sukari operation 
with the ultimate aim of delivering further production 
increases. The productivity levels achieved during 2013 
in the pre‑expansion process plant, together with the 
various design improvements implemented during the 
Stage 4 project build, provide us with confidence that the 
expanded plant will achieve, in time, production levels 
materially above nameplate capacity. At the underground 
mine, as stable grade delivery is achieved at the current 
mined volumes, we see potential for further incremental 
productivity increases. 
The additional shareholder value that can be gained from 
the continued drive for efficiency has the potential to be 
significant and requires no significant capital expenditure. 
No capital expenditure for expansion or project 
development is planned for 2015. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
 
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 17
Exploration at Sukari continues to prioritise extensions of 
the high‑grade underground resource and reserve and we 
expect to continue to deliver positive news in line with the 
strong results to date. A resource and reserve update is 
planned during 2015.
Outside of Sukari, we expect a total exploration expenditure 
of circa US$20 million in 2015, with the largest proportion 
on the advanced exploration programme in Burkina Faso. 
Our exploration tenements in Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia 
are no less prospective, requiring a lower exploration spend 
due to their earlier stage. In line with our overall exploration 
strategy, the actual expenditure on these projects is results 
driven and the current estimated expenditures are therefore 
subject to ongoing revisions.
We will continue to evaluate potential opportunities to 
grow the business through the acquisition of projects 
offering the potential for the Company to deliver on its 
strategic objectives. 
Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their 
hard work over the years including the employees onsite 
at Sukari, those on the exploration sites in Burkina Faso, 
Ethiopia and Côte d’Ivoire as well as those in the corporate 
and administration offices in Jersey and Australia. I would 
also like to thank your Board of Directors for their support 
over the years and I am very much looking forward to 2015 
and beyond.

With the completion of the Stage 4 expansion project in 2014, the Sukari 
operation has transitioned out of its investment phase, where cash flows were 
used to fund the staged construction, and into a sustainable period of free 
cash flow generation over the remaining life of mine. As production continues 
to rise towards the 450‑500,000 ounce per annum level, all‑in‑sustaining costs 
are expected to be in the range of US$900‑950 per ounce. Centamin has no 
debt or hedging and is therefore financially robust, is well positioned to benefit 
from a recovery in the gold price, and has the financial flexibility to grow both 
organically and through strategic acquisitions.
With a robust balance sheet and strong cash flow generation 
from Sukari, we have financial flexibility to grow our business 
both organically as well as through strategic acquisitions.

Open pit at Sukari
Drill rig in place at the open pit Sukari – production growth
Forecast production from the Sukari Gold Mine for 2015 
is 420,000 ounces at a cash operating cost of US$700 per 
ounce. This would represent an 11% increase on 2014 
production of 377,261 ounces and would become the sixth 
successive year of growth at Sukari.
From the second half of 2015, we expect sustained 
production from Sukari at an annualised rate of between 
450,000‑500,000 ounces. This is based on the following 
target operational parameters:
   Target rate per annum
Tonnes milled (total)  ‘000t 10,000‑11,000
Open pit tonnes milled  ‘000t 9,000‑10,000
Underground tonnes milled ‘000t 1,000
Open pit head grade  g/t 1.0‑1.1
Underground head grade  g/t 6.5
Recovery  % 88%
Gold production  ‘000oz 450‑500
Over the coming quarters, continued optimisation and 
higher productivity rates throughout the operation offer 
good potential for further production growth and reductions 
in AISC for no additional capital expenditure.
Over time we will be seeking to obtain performance 
from the enlarged plant at a throughput rate in line 
with the performance of the pre‑expansion plant, which 
operated at 15‑20% above nameplate capacity (5Mtpa) 
throughout 2013. 
Results from the underground resource drilling programme 
continue to provide support that the operation can sustain 
production and grade levels in excess of the above 
assumptions. It is our objective to demonstrate this potential 
over the coming quarters.

Sukari – resource and reserve expansion 
Centamin has a large resource and reserve base and, 
through the continued exploration of Sukari Hill and the 
160km
2
 Sukari tenement area, there is significant potential 
to further extend the already significant life of mine. 
Drilling from underground remains a focus and was 
progressively stepped up through 2014. New development 
provided improved access to test potential high‑grade 
extensions of the deposit, which remains open to the north 
and at depth. Results to date are highly encouraging and 
provide support to our expectation for a significant life of 
the underground operation.
Surface exploration has identified seven other prospects 
besides Sukari Hill on the 160km
2
 Sukari tenement area and 
exploration is being conducted under the principle that 
ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing 
processing plant.
The current resource and reserve statements were published 
in December 2013 and an updated reserve and resource 
statement is expected to be announced in 2015.
Advanced exploration – Burkina Faso
The Company progressed its long‑term growth strategy 
during 2014 by acquiring ASX listed Ampella Mining 
Limited, which held exploration rights over a highly 
prospective circa 2,200km
2
 region of Burkina Faso (“Batie 
West”) containing a 1.9Moz Indicated and 1.3Moz Inferred 
resource at the Konkera Prospect. 
Fieldwork subsequent to the acquisition continues to be 
aimed at expanding the near‑surface resource through a 
systematic drilling, sampling and surveying programme over 
the numerous highly prospective target areas within this 
district. Our current expectation is to commit, in due course, 
to an economically viable and low‑cost project, and we will 
continue to test the results of the exploration programme 
on an on‑going basis with this objective in mind.
Early stage exploration – Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia
Centamin’s exploration strategy on its early‑stage projects is 
to process a rapid and efficient assessment of each permit’s 
potential and then either develop selected prospects or 
move to new areas.
As part of the Ampella transaction, Centamin acquired 
three licences in Côte d’Ivoire covering a circa 1,200km
2
 
area across the border from Batie West in Burkina Faso. 
The objective for 2015 is to be in a position where the three 
current permits are geologically covered with prospects 
identified and first pass RC drilling completed, with a path 
towards resource development in 2016. A further four 
licences are under application and are expected to be 
granted in early 2015. These will be covered by regional 
surface geochemistry and anomalies identified for the first 
pass aircore drilling in 2016.
Our exploration programme in Ethiopia is focused on 
the Una Deriem tenement in the north, where drill results 
indicate the presence of high‑grade mineralisation 
warranting further exploration, and the recently acquired 
‘Ondonok Dabus’ licence in the west where regional works 
are under way.

Operational review
Health and safety – Sukari
The LTIFR for 2014 was 0.39 per 200,000 man‑hours 
(2013: 0.36 per 200,000 man‑hours), with a total 
of 5,620,444 man‑hours worked during 2014 
(2013: 6,702,908). Developing the health and safety culture 
onsite has resulted in improved reporting of incidents 
compared to previous years and, although there remains 
further room for improvement, Centamin views its LTI 
frequency rate as a solid achievement considering Sukari is 
the first modern gold mine in Egypt.
Open pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 44,820kt 
for the year, an increase of 7% on the prior year and related 
to an increase in mining fleet capacity. Whilst mining rates 
for the year were below the original forecast, as a result of 
delays in receipt of government approval for an increase 
in daily usage of AN (received in October 2014), this did 
not impact production and rates have increased to the 
required level to feed the expanded plant. The additional 
AN has allowed us to review our cut back strategies to 
ensure a continuous supply of ore from the open pit to 
feed the plant.
Ore production from the open pit was 10.94Mt at 0.80g/t 
with an average head grade fed to the plant of 0.97g/t. 
The ROM ore stockpile balance increased by 0.42kt to 
2.17kt by the end of the year. Mining was primarily from 
the Stage 3A area, which provided access to higher‑grade 
sulphide portions of the ore‑body during the second half of 
the year.
Underground mine 
Ore production from the underground mine was a 
record 968kt, a 65% increase on 2013. The ratio of 
stoping‑to‑development ore mined increased, with 52% of 
stoping ore (504kt) and 48% of development ore (464kt). 
Ore tonnages from stopes increased by 78% on the 
previous year.
An average head grade of 6.1g/t was mined in 2014, with 
stope production grade of 6.6g/t and development grade 
of 5.5g/t during the year. Grade from development ore 
was below original expectations and was a decline from 
2013, impacted by mining dilution with locally complex 
geological structures offsetting some areas of high‑grade 
mineralisation. Drill results support continuity of the higher 
grades into areas planned for further development.

Development in mineralised areas took place between the 
875 and 755 levels. A total of 5,701 metres of mineralised 
development (4,737 metres in Amun, and 961 metres in 
Ptah) were completed during the year, associated with 
stoping blocks planned for mining during 2015 to 2017. 
Total development for the mine was 6,625 metres including 
Amun and Ptah decline development.
The exhaust ventilation circuit for the Ptah decline was 
progressed, ensuring sufficient ventilation as the decline 
extends deeper into the orebody. Ore drive development 
continued on the Ptah 860 and 875 levels and exploration 
drill cuddies were also completed on the 875 and 
860 levels.
A total of 10,925 metres of grade control diamond drilling 
were completed during 2014, aimed at short‑term stope 
definition, drive direction optimisation and underground 
resource development. A further 36,971 metres of HQ and 
NQ drilling continued to test the depth extensions below 
the current Amun and Ptah zones.
Processing
The annual throughput of the Sukari plant was 8.4Mt 
in 2014, a 48% increase on 2013 and reflecting the 
commencement of ore treatment through the new Stage 4 
plant circuit. Whilst slightly behind the start‑of‑year 
schedule, commissioning activities proceeded well and 
supported a ramp‑up to the expanded 10Mt per annum 
nameplate capacity in the third quarter of 2014. The trend 
towards higher levels of throughput continued in the 
fourth quarter, with plant productivity of 1,330 tonnes per 
hour (tph) representing an 87% increase on 2013 annual 
productivity rates. 
Productivity levels have now increased for eight successive 
quarters. Our objective is for the process plant in due 
course to run at a throughput rate comparable with 
the performance of the pre‑expansion plant, which 
operated at 15‑20% above nameplate capacity (5Mtpa) 
throughout 2013.
Metallurgical recoveries were 87.8%, which is a 0.8% 
decrease on 2013. Work is continuing to optimise the 
operational controls and improve circuit stability to ensure 
recoveries return to previous levels above 88% at the 
increased rate of throughput. The commissioning of the new 
carbon regeneration kiln was completed in mid 2014 and 
has seen a positive impact.
The dump leach operation produced 15,411oz in 2014, 
a 26% increase on 2013.

Exploration
Sukari
Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari exploration programme and drilling rates were progressively 
increased as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high‑grade extensions of 
the deposit. The ore body has not yet been closed off to the north, south or at depth and further underground drilling of 
the Sukari deposit will take place during 2015, predominantly from both the Amun and Ptah declines.
Select results received during the fourth quarter from the underground drilling programme which have not yet been 
included in the resource base and which are in addition to results previously‑reported during 2014, include the following:

Burkina Faso
Centamin’s tenements in Burkina Faso, collectively known 
as the Batie West permits, are Danhal, Donko, Dounkou, 
Gbingbina, Mabera, Tiopolo, Niorka, Bottara, Kaldera, 
Kpere Batie, Timboura and Kpere. 
Subsequent to the Ampella acquisition, Centamin 
has recommenced field activities at Batie West, with a 
systematic programme including RC, diamond and auger 
drilling, geophysical surveys, geochemical sampling and 
geological mapping. Drilling has been completed at the 
Pampouna (2,685m), Konkera South (230m), Tonsu (491m) 
and Tonior (3,303m) prospects for a total of 9,302m, 
including 362.8m of diamond drilling. 
A geophysical survey at the Wadaradoo prospect has 
identified continuous chargeability and resistivity anomalies 
which are proving to be useful for defining drill targets. 
Further work is being undertaken at the Napelepera 
East prospect. 
Ampella’s mining licence application in relation to the 
Tiopolo Permit was passed to the Council of Ministers 
during 2014. The signed ministerial decree was issued in 
the post‑reporting period, on the 5 March 2015 and an 
application is being made to postpone development and 
continue exploration, as provided for in the Burkina Faso 
Mining Code.
Essential components of our health and safety management 
systems are being integrated into our exploration 
programme at Batie West. This process includes an 
orientation and induction for employees and contractors 
to ensure adherence to our strict policies and procedures. 
The Batie West camp site has a well‑equipped clinic which 
includes a full‑time paramedic.
The strategy for 2015 is to continue to systematically 
explore the entire 160km strike length of the belt and 
drill‑test the prospectivity of the prospects. It is expected 
this will lead into further resource development work in late 
2015 progressing into 2016.

Côte d’Ivoire
Centamin has three licences in Côte d’Ivoire covering a 
circa 1,200km
2
 area across the border from Batie West 
in Burkina Faso. A further four licences are currently 
under application.
Field work commenced with the technical team completing 
mapping, rock chip sampling and auger drilling 
geochemistry. Permits and authorisations for an airborne 
magnetic and radiometric survey were being prepared.
The objective for 2015 is to geologically assess the three 
current permits, identify prospects and undertake first pass 
RC drilling on priority targets, aimed at a path towards 
resource development in 2016. 
The four permits that are under application are expected to 
be granted in early 2015, and are planned to be covered 
by regional surface geochemistry aimed at identifying 
anomalies for first‑pass aircore drilling in 2016.
Ethiopia
Centamin continued exploration on its tenement in Una 
Deriem in northern Ethiopia, and in total, 2,548m were 
drilled in 2014 totalling 13,783m for the region.
Trench intercepts including 20m at 1.08g/t and 22m 
at 1.48g/t indicate the presence of significant surface 
mineralisation. Drilling continued to test continuity of 
mineralisation and positive drill results along strike. 
Results received for four holes (UDM44‑47) indicated patchy 
mineralisation. 
A new permit known as the ‘Ondonok Dabus’ Licence, 
located in the west of Ethiopia close to the regional capital 
of Asosa, has been awarded. Early‑stage regional works are 
underway, including access tracking and introductions to the 
local authorities. 
In September 2013 Centamin entered into joint venture 
with AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc to pursue existing 
and new opportunities identified by Alecto in Ethiopia. 
The initial joint venture projects related to two exploration 
licences Wayu Boda and Aysid Meketel. The Company 
gave formal notice to Alecto in February 2015 terminating 
the joint venture. Centamin’s rights in the Wayu Boda and 
Aysid Metekel licences have reverted back to Alecto, such 
that Alecto will hold 100% of the licences and will assume 
responsibility for the ongoing commitments in respect of 
the licences.

Revenue
Revenue from gold and silver sales has decreased by 6% to 
US$473 million, as a result of a 3% increase in gold sold to 
375,300 ounces offset by a 9% decrease in the average gold 
price to US$1,257 per ounce.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents the cost of mining, processing, 
refinery, transport, site administration and depreciation and 
amortisation, as well as pre‑ production costs incurred prior 
to commercial production and movement in production 
inventory. Cost of sales is inclusive of exceptional items of 
US$62.5 million (refer to Note 6 to the financial statements 
for further information) and has increased by 29% to 
US$358.3 million, as a result of:
(a) a 16% increase in mine production costs to 
US$275.9 million, primarily due to an increase in 
activity year on year with tonnes moved increasing  
by 7% and tonnes treated by 48%;
(b) a 66% increase in depreciation and amortisation from 
US$50.8 million to US$84.2 million, a result of an increase 
in the underlying and mine development properties 
due to the commissioning of Stage 4 in addition to the 
change in accounting estimate of the useful economic 
life of the Sukari plant and equipment capitalised within 
plant and equipment; offset by
(c) a US$1.9 million credit for movement in production 
inventory a result of an increased addition to the ROM 
ore stockpile.
Other operating costs
Other operating costs reported comprises expenditure 
incurred for communications, consultants, directors’ fees, 
stock exchange listing fees, share registry fees, employee 
entitlements, general office administration expenses, the 
unwinding of the restoration and rehabilitation provision, 
foreign exchange movements, the share of profit/loss in 
associates and the 3% production royalty payable to the 
Egyptian government. Other operating costs increased by 
40% to US$30.4 million, as a result of:
(a) a US$12.5 million increase in net foreign exchange 
movements from a US$9.5 million gain to a 
US$2.9 million loss; and
(b) a US$1.1 million donation (loss on disposal of assets) of 
two generators to Marsa Alam; offset by
(c) a US$1.6 million decrease in the share of loss of 
associate, as a result of having written off the costs 
associated with the interest held in Sahar during 2013;
(d) a US$0.9 million decrease in royalty paid to the 
government of the ARE in line with the decrease in 
gold sales revenue; and
(e) a US$2.3 million decrease in corporate costs.
Other charges
Impairment charges have been recorded as follows:
(a) a US$2.3 million write off of capitalised exploration costs 
in relation to the joint venture with Alecto Minerals plc; 
and
(b) a US$0.4 million impairment loss recognised in relation 
to the investment in Nyota Minerals Limited.

Finance income
Finance income reported comprises interest revenue 
applicable on the Company’s available cash and term 
deposit amounts. The movements in finance income are in 
line with the movements in the Company’s available cash 
and term deposit amounts.
Net profit
As a result of the factors outlined above, the 
Group recorded a net profit before tax for the

(2013: US$184.0 million). 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share of 7.21 cents compare with 16.87 cents 
in 2013. The decrease was driven by the lower net profit, as 
outlined above, as well as an increase of 4.4% in share count 
as a result of the Ampella acquisition.
Comprehensive income
Other comprehensive income has decreased by 
US$6.8 million to US$0.1 million as a result of the 
revaluation of available‑for‑sale financial assets. The prior 
increase was a result of the cumulative loss that had 
been recognised in other comprehensive income being 
reclassified from equity to profit.
Financial position
At 31 December 2014, the Group had cash and 
cash equivalents of US$125.7 million compared to 
US$106.0 million at 31 December 2013. The majority of 
funds have been invested in international rolling short‑term 
higher interest money market deposits.
Current assets have increased by US$24.0 million or 9% to 
US$293.4 million, as a result of:
(a) stores inventory has increased by US$3.6 million to 
US$104.9 million as a result of the commissioning of 
Stage 4. Mining stockpiles and ore in circuit inventory has 
increased by US$1.9 million to US$35.8 million as a result 
of the increase in gold in circuit at period end;
(b) the completion of the Stage 4 expansion resulting in 
an increase in the cash inflows and a US$19.0 million 
increase in the cash reserves; offset by
(c) a US$0.6 million decrease in gold sale receivables. 
Non‑current assets have increased by US$48.0 million or 5% 
to US$1,077.4 million, as a result of:
(a) exploration and evaluation assets have increased by 
US$64.2 million to US$124.0 million as a result of the 
drilling programmes in Sukari Hill, the Sukari tenement 
area, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire, this 
increase is inclusive of a US$2.3 million write off of 
expenditure in relation to the joint venture with Alecto 
Minerals plc;
(b) a US$4.8 million increase in prepayments to EMRA in 
relation to advance payments against future profit share; 
(c) a US$65.0 million increase in property, plant of 
equipment, mainly relating to net capitalised 
work‑in‑progress costs of US$68.3 million (comprising 
US$3.4 million for the Stage 4 processing plant, 
US$4.5 million for the open pit mining fleet expansion, 
US$20.7 million for open pit development, US$31.1 
million for underground development and US$8.6 
million for other sustaining capital expenditure) and 
US$4.3 million in relation to the acquisition of Ampella 
Mining Limited, offset by a US$5.2 million reduction in 
the rehabilitation asset and disposals of US$2.3 million. 
This is offset further by a depreciation and amortisation 
charge of US$84.2 million; and
(d) a US$0.6 million decrease in the available‑for‑sale 
financial assets to US$0.4 million as a result of:
i) a US$1.0 million devaluation (including foreign 
exchange loss) in the shares held in Nyota 
together with the sale of eleven million shares for 
US$0.1 million; offset by
ii) a US$0.4 million increase as a result of the receipt of 
the KEFI shares.
Current liabilities have decreased by US$43.9 million 
to US$34.4 million as a result of the management of 
creditor days.
Non‑current liabilities reported during the period have 
decreased by US$4.6 million as a result of:
(a) a change in estimate of the future rehabilitation costs as 
a result of a detailed review having being undertaken as 
at year end as a result of the commission of Stage 4; and
(b) the unwinding of the discount on the provision 
for rehabilitation.
Issued capital has increased by US$49.1 million due to the 
issue of shares in relation to the acquisition of Ampella 
and vesting of awards offset by US$1.7 million of own 
shares acquired. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
 
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 41
Share option reserves reported have decreased by 
US$1.6 million to US$4.1 million as result of the forfeiture 
and vesting of awards and the resultant transfer to 
accumulated profits and issue capital respectively, offset by 
the recognition of the share‑based payments expense.
Accumulated profits increased by US$73.1 million as a result 
of the increase in the profit for the year attributable to the 
shareholders of the Company of US$81.6 million together 
with a US$0.1 million loss on available‑for‑sale financial 
assets in relation to the KEFI shares and a US$1.5 million 
transfer from the share options reserve as a result of the 
forfeiture of awards, offset by the US$9.9 million interim 
dividend payment.
Cash flows
Net cash flows generated by operating activities comprise 
receipts from gold and silver sales and interest revenue, 
offset by operating and corporate administration costs. 
Cash flows have decreased by US$133.5 million to 
US$111.6 million, primarily attributable to:
(a) a decrease in revenue, due to a lower average realised 
price offset by higher gold sales; 
(b) an increase in cash outflows flows in relation to 
receivables and payables;
(c) a decrease in gross margins as a result of the decrease in 
the average realised gold price; offset by
(d) a decrease in cash outflows in relation to inventories 
and prepayments, as a result of the commissioning of 
Stage 4.
Net cash flows used in investing activities comprise 
exploration expenditure and capital development 
expenditures at Sukari including the acquisition of financial 
and mineral assets. Cash outflows have decreased by 
US$204.1 million to US$78.8 million. The primary use of 
the funds during the year was for investment in capital 
work‑in‑progress in relation to the Stage 4 development, 
the open pit and underground development, additional 
mining assets and exploration expenditures incurred, which 
was offset by US$9.3 million cash acquired through the 
assets acquired in Ampella Mining Limited.
Net cash flows generated by financing activities comprise 
the exercising of shares issued under the Company’s 
Loan Funded Share Plans (“LFSPs”) and options under 
the Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) respectively in 
addition to dividends paid. During the year:
(a) 1.7 million of the Company’s own shares valued at 
US$1.7 million were acquired and awarded as part 
of the Deferred Bonus Share Plan; and
(b) a US$9.9 million interim dividend was paid during 
the year.
Effects of exchange rate changes have decreased by 
US$2.0 million as a result of the strong performance of the 
US$ to the Euro and A$.

Principal risks
Principal risks affecting the Centamin Group
The exploration for and development of metals and mineral 
resources, together with the construction and development 
of mining operations is a speculative activity that involves a 
high degree of risk.
Centamin conducts a variety of risk assessments throughout 
the year, which are reviewed by the Audit and Risk 
Committee and the Board in accordance with best practice 
guidelines and in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and relevant Canadian requirements.
Centamin takes a number of measures to mitigate risks 
associated with its underlying operational and exploration 
activity which are monitored and evaluated regularly. 
Due to the nature of these inherent risks, it is not possible 
to give absolute assurance that mitigating actions will be 
wholly effective.
The descriptions below describe the current status of 
the key risks affecting Centamin and its operational and 
exploration activities together with the measures to mitigate 
risk and the preserved risk by management.
Risks identified are rated in two distinct categories, 
‘probability of occurrence’ and ‘overall impact on 
the Company’. 
Both categories are rated as high (H), medium (M) or low 
(L). The first category concerns how likely the risk is to 
occur and the second is based on the relative impact on 
the Company if the risk did occur. This is balanced by the 
mitigation steps in place.

Risk category Description of potential risks Mitigation/commentary
Loss of 
revenues due to 
single project 
dependency for 
near‑term revenues
Likelihood: medium 
Impact: high
The Sukari project currently constitutes Centamin’s main mineral 
resource and sole mineral reserve and near‑term production and 
revenue. The Project itself has two distinct ore sources (open pit and 
underground), the processing plant has two separate flotation circuits 
and two separate power stations. Whilst one project the nature of 
the design of the plant provides adequate mitigation and reduces 
the relative likelihood of dependence compared to a single layer 
plant design.
However, there is still a risk of any adverse development affecting the 
progress of the Sukari Project such as, but not limited to, restrictions 
on operating, import and export permissions, unusual and unexpected 
geologic formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave‑ins, flooding 
and other conditions involved in the drilling and removal of material, 
any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, mines and 
other producing facilities, or any other event leading to a reduction in 
production or closure of mines or other producing facilities, damage 
to life or property, environmental damage, hiring suitable personnel 
and engineering contractors, or securing supply agreements on 
commercially suitable terms. 
Mitigating factors include continued longer 
term growth and expansion through 
exploration and acquisition targets both 
inside and outside of Egypt. The regional 
exploration of the licence portfolio in Burkina 
Faso and Côte d’Ivoire continues on the 
existing 1.92Moz Indicated and 1.33Moz 
Inferred resource.
Until further production growth beyond 
Sukari is identified the potential impact 
remains high, however, safeguarding the 
project is paramount to the Company and 
the required systems, policies and practices 
are in place to identify, assess and reduce 
these threats.
Sukari Project 
joint venture risk 
and relationship 
with EMRA 
Likelihood: medium 
Impact:  medium
SGM is owned jointly by PGM and EMRA, with equal board 
representation, whilst responsibility for the day‑to‑day management of 
SGM rests with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM. The 
board of SGM operates by way of simple majority. As such, should the 
board of SGM be unable to reach consensus on a matter requiring 
board‑level approval or in the event of any dispute arising between 
PGM and EMRA, which PGM is unable to amicably resolve, it may have 
to participate in arbitration or other proceedings to resolve the dispute, 
which could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, 
results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
Any dispute with EMRA may adversely affect Centamin’s ability to 
manage the Sukari Project in the most effective way. Such a dispute 
could arise under the cost recovery and profit share provisions of the 
Sukari Concession Agreement.
The successful management of the Sukari Gold Mine is in part 
dependent on maintaining a good working relationship with EMRA. The 
Group has regular meetings with officials from EMRA and invests time in 
liaising with relevant ministry and other governmental representatives. 
Management and the Board of Directors believe the Group has a 
positive and constructive working relationship with EMRA. The Group 
complies with all terms and conditions of the Concession Agreement 
covering the Sukari Gold Mine. EMRA has equal representation on 
the Board of Sukari Gold Mines and is involved to that extent in 
approving and auditing all work programmes and expenditures. EMRA 
inspectors are closely involved in monitoring all aspects of the Sukari 
operations. Current discussions with EMRA are focused on determining 
the exact timing and quantum of the first payment of profit sharing for 
Sukari and the interpretation of certain provisions of the Concession 
Agreement. Centamin has shown its willingness to assist EMRA 
through prepayments in relation to future profit share made in 2013 
and 2014. Whilst the impact of any dispute could have the potential to 
be problematic, management believes there is a low probability of a 
material deterioration in relationships with EMRA.
Mitigating factors also include ensuring 
co‑operative and timely correspondence and 
maintaining good relations with EMRA. Strategic report

Risk category Description of potential risks Mitigation/commentary
Failure to achieve 
production 
estimates
Likelihood: low 
Impact:  medium
Centamin currently prepares estimates of future gold production for 
its ongoing development of the Sukari Gold Mine. There can be no 
assurance that Centamin will achieve its production estimates and such 
failure could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s future 
cash flows, profitability, results of operations and financial condition. 
The realisation of production estimates are dependent on, amongst 
other things: the accuracy of mineral reserve and resource estimates; 
the accuracy of assumptions regarding ore grades and recovery rates; 
ground conditions (including hydrology); physical characteristics of 
ores; the presence or absence of particular metallurgical characteristics; 
the accuracy of estimated rates and costs of mining ore haulage, the 
availability of suitable machinery and equipment and consumables 
(including access to and permitting for sufficient quantities of 
ammonium nitrate and related blasting products), skilled labour and 
processing capacity and all logistics for consumables and parts. During 
2014 due to various factors previously disclosed it was necessary to 
reduce the guidance for 2014 and this also had an impact on the 
guidance for 2015.
Whilst there can be no certainties, 
production to date has provided confidence 
in management’s estimation and mine 
planning methods and with the expanded 
processing plant becoming fully operational 
in 2014, the prospect of improvements in 
reliable forecasting is increased the risk of 
failure to meet production estimates has 
been reduced from high to moderate likely 
occurrence.
The impact on the Company (and investors) 
remains moderate, as failure to achieve 
production estimates can adversely affect 
the profitability of the Company and its 
share price.
Reserve and 
resource estimates 
Likelihood: medium 
Impact:  low
Mineral resource and reserve figures are prepared by Centamin Group 
personnel, with the assistance of independent geologists. By their 
nature, mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on a range 
of assumptions, including geological, metallurgical technical and 
economic factors. There can be no guarantee that the anticipated 
tonnages or grades expected by Centamin will be achieved.
Management has implemented processes 
to continuously monitor and evaluate the 
current life of the Sukari Gold Mine, mine 
plans and production targets. The most 
recent technical update was completed in 
the Form 43‑101F1 dated 30 January 2014 
and is available at www.sedar.com. This took 
into account the latest drill results, higher 
cost environment and the timing of the 
Stage 4 commissioning. Whilst there are no 
certainties, production to date has provided 
confidence in management’s estimation and 
mine planning methods.
Currency and gold 
price risk 
Likelihood: medium 
Impact:  high
A significant portion of Centamin’s operating expenses are incurred 
in US dollars, Australian dollars, Egyptian pounds and Great British 
pounds, whilst its revenues from gold sales are in US dollars. 
Furthermore, Centamin does not currently maintain any facilities for 
hedging its exposure to currencies or the price of gold.
Any appreciation in currencies other than US dollars in which the Group 
incurs material expenses or adverse fluctuations in the gold spot price, 
could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results 
of operations, financial performance and prospects.
Centamin manages its exposure to gold 
price fluctuations by retaining a focus on 
keeping operating costs as low as possible. 
However, the risks relating to gold price 
reductions remain high, as it is the Group’s 
policy not to hedge its gold price exposure. 
The Group has not entered into forward 
foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges 
are utilised wherever possible to offset 
foreign currency liabilities.
Litigation risks
 
Likelihood: medium 
Impact:  high
Centamin’s finances, and its ability to operate in Egypt, may be severely 
adversely affected by current and any future litigation proceedings and 
it is possible that further litigation could be initiated against Centamin 
at any time. Centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both 
to (a) the validity of its exploitation lease at Sukari and (b) the price at 
which it can purchase Diesel Fuel Oil.
In order to mitigate this risk Centamin has:
a)  engaged appropriate legal advice and 
continues to actively pursue its legal rights 
with respect to the existing litigation and 
its legal advisers believe that Centamin 
will ultimately be successful in both of 
these cases; and
b)  management and the Company’s legal 
advisers monitor both activity in court and 
local media for signs of any litigation that 
may threaten its operations, finances or 
prospects.
The potential for serious impact should be 
balanced against Centamin’s adherence 
to local laws and agreements, as well as 
the Egyptian government’s support of 
Centamin’s investment and the new law 32 
of 2014 that should protect Centamin 
against litigation of this nature as well the 
fact that Egypt and Australia have in place a 
bilateral investment treaty. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
 
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 45
Risk category Description of potential risks Mitigation/commentary
Political risk 
Likelihood: medium  
Impact:  high
Centamin’s exposure to production and exploration activities are 
primarily in Egypt, a country which has been subject to civil and 
military disturbance in the last two years. There is no assurance that 
future political and economic conditions in Egypt will not result in the 
government of Egypt adopting different policies respecting foreign 
development and ownership of mineral resources. Any such change in 
policy may result in changes in laws affecting ownership of assets, use 
of explosives, tenure and mineral concessions, taxation, royalties, rates 
of exchange, environmental protection, labour relations, repatriation of 
income and return of capital, which may affect both Centamin’s ability 
to undertake exploration, development and operational activities in 
respect of future properties as well as its ability to continue to explore, 
develop and operate those properties in respect of which it has 
obtained mineral exploration and exploitation rights to date. Egypt also 
has limited experience of large scale mining operations and current laws 
do not necessarily reflect current international practices (for example in 
relation to 24 hour blasting techniques).
The Concession Agreement with EMRA and the Egyptian government, 
was declared into Egyptian Law No. 222 of 1994 which further protects 
the Company’s licence rights. The Law received full parliamentary 
approval as required by Egyptian law.
In 2014, Centamin acquired ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Limited and 
now operates on exploration licences in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. 
Centamin continues to operate on its existing exploration licences in 
the North of Ethiopia and also on licences held in the south and west 
of Ethiopia through the tenements held through the joint venture with 
Alecto Minerals plc. 
There is no assurance that future political and economic conditions 
in these countries will not result in the governments adopting 
different policies in respect to foreign development and ownership 
of exploration and exploitation licences.
Centamin actively monitors legal and 
political developments in Egypt, West 
Africa and Ethiopia and actively engages in 
dialogue with relevant government and legal 
policy makers to discuss all key legal and 
regulatory developments. 
In respect to the Company’s operations 
in Egypt, the potential for serious impact 
should be balanced against the Egyptian 
government’s support of Centamin’s 
investment and contribution to both revenue 
and development of the mining industry.
In respect to West Africa and Ethiopia, 
policy has developed over many years to 
encourage foreign investment and the 
development of mining operations, which 
continues to be the focus of governments 
in these regions. Strategic report

Key issues were raised by the Committee during the year, 
such as the need to remove or reduce the scrap yard at 
Sukari and understanding the improvements (quarter on 
quarter) in HSES records. The Committee was encouraged 
by the following during the year:
•	 improvements in LTIFR during Q3 2014 which remained 
at low levels over the course of the year (although slightly 
above 2013 and higher than target rates);
•	 hygiene standards improved progressively during 
the year;
•	 regular and progressive training programmes at Sukari; 
and
•	 management of the scrap area at Sukari.
The Committee visit Sukari at least annually and take 
the opportunity to meet with senior personnel onsite as 
well as members of the HSES department. This helps the 
Committee have a clear understanding of the controls, 
procedures and HSE practices in place onsite.
In addition, the Committee considered the sustainability 
and environmental issues in relation to the newly acquired 
resource in Burkina Faso. The Committee were encouraged 
by the proposals set out in the EIA for Burkina Faso which 
allowed the Committee to consider the likely resource 
needs for future operational activity.
The report below covers the key HSES issues for Sukari and 
concludes with information relating to the newly acquired 
resource in Burkina Faso.

Health, Safety, Environmental and 
Sustainability Committee
The Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability 
Committee members at the date of this report 
are Trevor Schultz (Chairman), Mark Bankes and 
Kevin Tomlinson, all of whom are independent directors 
of the Company. Bob Bowker, who retired in January 2015, 
served as Chairman of the Committee during 2014.
Health and safety
The Company strives for a harm free, healthy and 
productive work place. We have invested in robust systems, 
procedures and controls to manage occupational health and 
safety risks to an acceptable level. These working practices 
allow us to comply with local legislation, licence and permit 
conditions, as well as international best practice standards.
In 2014, we maintained low levels of lost time injury 
frequency rate (“LTIFR”) whereby we aim to operate in an 
injury free environment, however 2014 was above our target 
and slightly above our 2013 rate.
Safety conscious culture
Safety is the responsibility of each and every employee 
(including members of staff, senior management and heads 
of department) and the level of safety is a function of the 
collective behaviour of all individuals. Accordingly we invest 
in maintaining a safety conscious culture in our work place, 
encouraging individual accountability for working safely. 
This is done via ongoing training and safety initiatives as set 
out further below.
We continuously work on developing the safety culture of 
our employees through strengthening their accountability 
for the safe conduct of work place and imbedding the 
concepts of doing work the right safe way. Safety is 
discussed at pre‑shift meetings, daily planning meetings 
and weekly safety meetings. Safety alerts are also 
periodically issued and sent to all employees.
Environmental policy
An environmental policy has been established with the 
aim of ensuring environmental protection and sustainable 
development. The policy is based on pollution prevention 
and abatement approaches to protect the environment, 
community and indigenous people.
The environmental management scheme for the Sukari 
Project includes a monitoring programme designed to 
evaluate compliance with local environmental laws and 
regulations, company policies and international best 
practices. It provides information for periodic review 
and adjustment of the environmental management 
plan ensuring that environmental protection is achieved 
through early detection and mitigation of negative 
environmental impacts.
Training
A training plan is set and safety‑specific training is rolled 
to employees based on business and employee needs. 
All training is undertaken by the onsite HSE department.
Mandatory training is rolled out for all departments, 
area‑specific training, field training and coaching.
The following areas highlight the Company’s commitment 
to a comprehensive training programme which we believe 
provide the best means of reducing work place incidents:
•	 a tailored safety induction programme for new 
employees, contractors and visitors;
•	 incident investigation;
•	 training modules addressing job hazard analysis, risk 
assessments, incident investigations, work permits, first 
aid, fire extinguishing, and hazard identification; and
•	 technical competence tuition, such as isolation training, 
lifting procedures, confined space entry, hot work and 
working at height.
Training is repeated regularly through refresher courses 
and employees are all tested to ensure a high level of 
understand and application.
Proactive approach and emergency response planning
Centamin implements a rigorous approach to emergency 
preparedness and response. Such programmes represent an 
important element of our safety management system. Being 
alert and fully prepared for any emergency should minimise 
the magnitude and consequences for any unprecedented 
event. We have developed a detailed emergency plan with 
full emergency response procedures for different scenarios.
Case study – tool box talk 
The tool box talks are an effective and easy tool for 
safety communication. Full time trainers are available in 
almost all operational departments to provide in‑field 
training and coaching for the work force. Tool box talks 
before shifts are used to address safety issues, tips and 
lessons learnt.
The talk provides an environment for interactive 
discussion and promotes a safety conscious culture. 
This timely safety communication addresses numerous 
safety aspects and supplements formal training. 
Our safety professionals are continuously developing 
material for the talks in a simple form using brief text, 
photos and drawings. The tool has proved to be a very 
successful method of continuous safety learning.

Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 49
Risk assessment is integrated into all operational activities 
onsite and we continuously evaluate potential and actual 
hazards, their probability and likely outcomes to determine 
the level of risk and appropriate risk mitigation and 
safeguards. A variety of different procedures and systems 
have been developed and implemented including the 
Work Permit System and Job Hazard Analysis for new and 
non‑recurrent activities.
Our approach towards emergency preparedness and 
response planning is detailed, rigorous and well‑rehearsed, 
ensuring the mine is fully prepared for any conceivable 
emergency. In 2014, we rehearsed 102 emergency drills 
of different types at Sukari.
An inspection programme operates to ensure all emergency 
response equipment is maintained and is fit for purpose at 
all times.
Contractor management 
Contractors are integrated into the Company’s health and 
safety onsite programme whether for long periods of time 
or for short assignments and contractor safety is a key 
element of our safety management system. Currently there 
are nearly 500 permanent contractors at Sukari.
We require all contractors operating onsite to adhere to 
the Company’s health and safety policies and procedures. 
We ensure they have the same health and safety induction 
training and also have full access to the health services 
available to our employees onsite.

•	 workplace and occupational health parameters;
•	 fitness to work; and
•	 adherence to procedures and standards.
The performance evaluation is undertaken by an in‑house 
team and reviewed by a third party. Monitoring includes the 
collation of data, medical surveillance, auditing and visual 
inspection, as well as systematic observation of the work 
and behaviour of staff.
Reactive or responsive evaluation is also undertaken to 
investigate and analyse incidents and identify root causes 
to help implement corrective measures.
Employees and contractors are encouraged and expected 
to report all hazards and near‑misses for investigation and 
analysis. This embodies the principles adopted by the 
HSES policies and procedures that everyone shares and 
contributes in a responsible manner to creating a safe 
working environment.
A core element of our management system is to assess our 
safety performance and identify needs for improvement. 
Case study – establishing a capable 
emergency team 
Creating and maintaining a qualified emergency team 
is an essential element of emergency preparedness. 
At Sukari, we have structured a very competent 
response and rescue team to be immediately and 
efficiently mobilised in case of emergency situations. 
The team has received ample training and was coached 
for a year by a resident emergency response expert. 
The capacity building programme includes theoretical 
and practical training as well as drills to simulate 
different emergency situations. The team is equipped 
with the required response equipment, supplies and 
rescue facilities. A training plan is implemented to 
ensure full competence of the team.
Our emergency arrangements include fire response 
drills, fire control panel testing (with manual call 
points) and smoke detectors, foam and water fire 
suppression systems as well as a fire truck for intense 
fires. A medical evacuation scheme (MEDIVAC) is in 
place supported by first aid facilities, a fully equipped 
clinic with doctors and qualified nurses as well as an 
ambulance for transportation to the nearest medical 
centres or hospitals. In addition, we coordinate with 
external entities and authorities for support during a 
fire. These include the local fire station, air transport 
companies, police and hospitals.

Corporate social responsibility statement continued
Our safety performance in 2014 saw a considerable 
improvement in the medical treated injury (“MTI”) frequency 
rate, with a small increase in our lost time injury (“LTI”) 
frequency rate. We have had no fatal incidents at Sukari.
The monitoring plan at Sukari covers the following 
key areas:
•	 workplace environment to detect areas that might need 
further controls;
•	 stability of structures to detect any potential movement, 
cracks or other instabilities; 
•	 occupational health parameters to detect health impacts 
due to work‑related matters;
•	 fitness to work to detect cases under the influence of 
alcohol or illegal drugs; and
•	 implementation of safety procedures and standards to 
ensure they are adhered to and well assimilated. 
Monitoring methodology includes measurements, 
medical surveillance, auditing, visual inspection, as well as 
systematic observation of the work and behaviour of staff. 
Measurements are performed through in‑house capabilities 
as well as third‑party entities. 
The information collated from these processes is reported 
to the Committee on a monthly and quarterly basis.
The evaluation of our safety performance is essential to 
indicate the effectiveness of our systems and controls and 
identify opportunities for continuous improvement.

We are now focusing on our exploration project in Batie to 
ensure the full integration of health and safety procedures 
and systems. Data is being reported periodically to feed into 
Centamin’s performance monitoring system performance. 
Case study – traffic safety on site 
Traffic safety at Sukari is a key aspect of our safety 
management system. We have a well‑developed 
system of standards for traffic management and ensure 
the safe interaction of surface mobile equipment 
on roads, within and adjoining the site property 
and facilities. 
A permit system at Sukari is adopted for site driving 
with more stringent requirements for in‑pit driving. 
Different areas of site have set speed limits and are 
equipped with traffic signage showing instructions to 
follow. Vehicle pre‑start checking is a fixed practice 
each shift. 
All vehicles are equipped with specialised safety 
features, flashlights and whip aerials and flags for 
improved visibility. Road maintenance, grading 
and sheeting are routinely carried out to maintain a 
consistent gradient and smooth surface. Inspection is 
periodically undertaken to make sure procedures and 
standards are adhered to. 
A defensive driving practical training course 
is rolled out to operators and evaluations are 
periodically undertaken.

Health and wellbeing
Sukari has a well‑equipped clinic providing health and 
emergency related services on a 24/7 basis. A doctor and 
qualified nurse manage the clinic and provide professional 
services in normal conditions. It is also equipped to respond 
to emergency situations. An equipped ambulance is 
continuously on call to transfer any cases that need higher 
medical treatment to the Marsa Alam hospital, about 40km 
away from Sukari. 
Medical tests, including blood analysis, are conducted 
particularly for laboratory personnel and those working with 
chemicals and metals. Health tests are also mandatory for 
people working in the kitchen.
Our health programme has a special focus on food safety 
and hygiene, given we have a large mess that provides meals 
to about 1,500 employees and contractors per day. In 2014, 
a wellbeing programme focused on hygiene and food 
safety management was undertaken, with in‑house hygiene 
professionals supervising, inspecting and auditing standards 
at Sukari as well as periodic external audits. In 2014, the 
programme yielded very satisfactory results and a higher 
level of hygiene was achieved and maintained. Detected 
discrepancies were addressed by corrective actions. 
In 2014, the following audits were also carried out and the 
outcomes were as follows:
•	 internal environmental audits confirmed the results were 
within acceptable limits;
•	 water quality testing carried out by an external laboratory 
confirmed no major anomalies;
•	 air quality audits conducted by Cairo University recorded 
no anomalies and confirmed that Sukari was compliant 
with required standards; and
•	 emissions were reported to be at safe levels, as required 
by Egyptian law and international standards set by the 
World Bank.
Our employees and contractors
Our people are core to the success of our business. 
Accordingly, we actively invest in securing the full spectrum 
of skills and competencies needed for effective operations.
The Company’s activities provide direct and indirect 
employment, training and work experience to many 
Egyptian nationals, as well as creating an immediate 
revenue stream for the local economy and the Egyptian 
government.
Our workforce has witnessed considerable growth since we 
started production in 2010, both in terms of the number 
of employees and the range of skills and expertise now 
required by our workforce.
In Egypt, we employ 1,296 people of whom 95% are 
Egyptian nationals and 5% are experienced mining 
professionals, which is well below the legal percentage of 
10% as per the Egyptian laws. Approximately 50% of our 
Egyptian nationals are from upper Egypt, the area where 
Sukari is situated, which typically has less economic activity 
than the more prosperous areas around the Nile Delta.
Only 1% of our Egyptian workforce are women, mainly 
because social conditions in Egypt and in the Middle East in 
general do not encourage the work of female employees in 
remote sites away from their children. A greater percentage 
of women are employed throughout the Centamin 
administrative offices. 
The table below sets out the number of people employed 
by the Group (excluding contractors) by country, during the

Human resources principles
Our policies set out the Company’s approach and principles 
in regard to human resource management, recruitment and 
retention. Our policies aim to ensure that:
•	 new or current employees are not discriminated against 
by the Company due to their religion, nationality or 
political views or background;
•	 all employees have the opportunity for promotion based 
on their ability to perform the relevant job, without 
regard to personal characteristics that are unrelated 
to job requirements;
•	 harassment of employees by anyone and in any way is 
not tolerated;
•	 forced and compulsory labour are not allowed in any 
work related to our activities;
•	 all employees are entitled to a safe, healthy work 
environment, and each employee is accountable for his 
or her HSE performance in the Company;
•	 we are committed to the highest ethical standards and 
behaviour and our Code of Conduct requires adherence 
to our principles and promotes confidence in the 
integrity of the Company; and
•	 child labour is prohibited, whether in our permanent 
employment or in contractors’ workforces.
Contractors are required by their agreements to abide by 
these requirements, and follow‑up checks are undertaken 
seeking to establish that our conditions are met.
We expect every one of our employees to uphold our 
core values of honesty and integrity. All employees are 
encouraged to treat their fellow colleagues with respect, 
dignity and common courtesy. We believe this will foster 
a safe working environment.
Annual performance appraisals are undertaken for all 
employees. The appraisal covers several areas including the 
employee’s job knowledge, skills attained during the year, 
quality of work and initiative and innovation.
The review is undertaken by the immediate supervisor and 
the appraisal performance is agreed with the section head.
The appraisal process also identifies the need for training 
or coaching, modified responsibilities or opportunities to 
undertake more challenging roles and responsibilities.
Corporate social responsibility statement continued
Capacity building and development 
We strongly encourage and support our employees to be 
self‑motivated and to realise their career potential. We work 
with all our employees closely and encourage those who 
show keenness and desire to develop new personal skills 
and experience.
We value regular communication and feedback with 
employees which helps enhance the efficiency, effectiveness 
and safety of everyday activities and overall operational 
performance.
Non‑Egyptian foreign experts are required onsite for 
their expertise and experience in the mining industry, 
and to enable their skills and experiences to be shared 
under programmes to further train and develop Egyptian 
nationals. Around 5% of the Sukari workforce are 
experienced expatriate mining personnel and 95% of 
the workforce at Sukari are Egyptian nationals which is 
increasing further as new and existing employees gain more 
skills and experience. Moreover, more Egyptians are being 
promoted to higher managerial levels.
In addition to creating a positive work environment, the 
Company believes it is important that employees enjoy 
their time before and after work. The majority of our 
people live in the Sukari camp, and thus we have invested 
in a variety of leisure facilities such as playing fields, a 
gymnasium, a library, internet access, satellite television and 
a swimming pool. Special barbecue dinners are also held 
at the beach or around Sukari and sports tournaments are 
regularly organised.

The environment
Our policies outline our commitment to environmental 
responsibility. Safeguarding the environment, and coaching 
and training our employees to reduce the impact of our 
activities are essential parts of our operations.
We remain committed to maintaining, and whenever 
possible exceeding, the high level of environmental 
performance that we have achieved during 2014.
Maintaining an environmentally responsible culture
We run a well‑established programme for training and 
awareness of environmental impacts. The programme 
addresses different environmental fields including 
chemical management, waste management, emissions 
and water conservation, as well as general environmental 
management practices.
An environmental and social impact assessment 
(“ESIA”) was prepared as part of the project feasibility 
study at Sukari. We strive to maintain high standards 
of environmental performance and meet, and when 
practical exceed relevant legal requirements. The system is 
supported by a robust documentation system that ensures 
the maintenance of required registers, documents and 
renewal of required permits.
Resource management
Systems and procedures are in place to ensure correct 
and safe handling of chemicals and hazardous materials.
Risk assessments are carried out for handling and usage 
of all chemicals and hazardous materials. Controls include 
containment, automatic alarms and shut‑off systems. 
Preventative maintenance programmes for tanks and 
equipment are also in place. Emergency response plans 
and facilities ranging from spill kits and eye wash stations 
to chemical suits address potential requirements for 
responding to chemical or hazardous waste spillages 
or incidents.
We fully acknowledge the importance of managing 
chemicals in a sound manner so as to minimise harm 
to the environment or the health of employees. Hazard 
communication and chemical management handling is 
a core component of our training programme and our 
continuous education system. The systems in place set 
safe conditions for the transportation, storage, labelling 
and handling of chemicals.
Water management and groundwater protection
We recognise responsible water use is a key component for 
our sustainability programme and our policies commit us to 
conserve natural resources.
As a result, we closely monitor our water use, strive to 
reduce our water footprint and take steps to safeguard 
water quality.
Water is a critical component to our processes and thus it 
is essential to secure a sustainable source of water for our 
operations. In an area with limited fresh water resources or 
municipal water, we rely on a sea water intake and pipeline 
from the Red Sea to provide a sustainable water supply to 
the mine.
As a secondary source of water, we have beach wells where 
sea water infiltrates into groundwater. We have desalination 
plants for generating fresh water for the process plant and 
for domestic use.
The sea water pumped to site is used, and reused 
throughout the process plant ensuring maximum usage of 
this resource without needlessly taking more water from the 
intake pipeline.
Groundwater protection measures have been incorporated 
in the design of the tailing storage facility and other 
components where a layer of gypsum and a HPDE liner 
are used to prevent seepage. Workshops have concrete 
working areas to prevent seepage. Five monitoring bores 
are downstream from the tailing storage facility to detect 
any potential contamination. In 2014, the monitoring of 
these bores showed no contamination.
Desalinated water used in camps and offices is tested to 
ensure its quality accords with chemical and bacteriologic 
parameters. Bottled water used for drinking is also 
periodically tested as a double check on suppliers and 
storage procedures. All samples are compliant with 
Egyptian legal requirements.
In 2014, we used a total of 8,298,474m
3
 per year with an 
increase of 82% on 2013 4,210,886m
3
 due to the expansion 
in operations in 2014. About 99% of the water consumed at 
Sukari is sea water and therefore there is no impact on fresh 
water resources. Strategic report

Corporate social responsibility statement continued
Case study – creating value from garbage 
Our solid waste management system acknowledges 
the value of garbage and sees it as a benefit for others. 
We adopt a system for waste segregation at source. 
We segregate our food waste from other inorganic 
waste in the kitchen. Employees dispose of waste in 
the different designated bins. The food waste bins are 
stored in the waste refrigerator overnight to preserve 
the food until HEPCA, our solid waste contractor 
collects both types of wastes.
HEPCA, the Hurghada Environmental Protection 
and Conservation Association is our partner in 
the solid waste management system. As per our 
mutual agreement, our organic waste is delivered to 
neighbouring Bedouins to be used as animal fodder. 
The inorganic waste is mechanically processed 
by HEPCA in preparation for further processing in 
specialised recycling facilities. The material recovery 
unit is totally operated by Bedouin employees who 
were trained and are now working in different positions 
in the unit. We are very proud that we are part of this 
community development project.
Energy
Marsa Alam, the region in which the Sukari mine is located, 
is a remote area with no direct connection to any power 
grid. The city has its own power plant whose capacity is 
only sufficient for residential use not industrial needs.
Consequently, the project at Sukari powers the 
entire processing plant through its own onsite diesel 
power station.
In 2014, Sukari consumed a total of 109,422,636 litres of 
diesel, an increase of 36% from 2013’s 80,228,770 litres. 
This was due to the construction phase and the consequent 
expanded plant. About 66% of this quantity is used in 
power generation and the rest is used in operating mobile 
equipment and vehicles and in operation. 
Calculation of the direct greenhouse gases (GHG) 
emissions is based on the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (“IPCC”) Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories. In 2014, the Sukari mine 
generated 308,146.6
(1) 
tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent against 
production of 377,261 oz/yr. The emissions intensity for 
2014 was 0.82 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent per ounce of gold 
produced for 2014. This is compared to the consumption of 
80,228,770 litres of diesel in 2013 to produce 356,943 oz/yr. 
The GHG generated in 2013 was 229,181.4 tonnes of CO
2
 
equivalent, with 0.64 emissions intensity. 
(1) Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions occurring from sources 
that are controlled directly through the operating company, Sukari 
Gold Mines. There are no material external purchases of power. 
Exploration beyond Sukari and overheads occurring at the corporate 
offices in other locations are not considered material for the 
purposes of these calculations.

A review of alternative fuel sources to supply the processing 
plant is ongoing, but to date there have been no 
viable alternatives.

Emissions, effluents and wastes
Programmes are in place to manage emissions, effluents, 
non‑process waste, waste rock and tailings. All our industrial 
water streams are re‑circulated within our operations. 
Sewage is treated in a tertiary wastewater treatment plant 
and the treated water is used in landscaping. To ensure 
effective performance periodic checks and inspections 
are conducted on the treated wastewater.
Our monitoring activities in 2014 confirmed that we 
remained within legal requirements and international best 
practice standards in respect of the following areas:
•	 ambient air quality in the camp area (in terms of dust 
and emissions);
•	 dust concentration in different work areas;
•	 noise and illumination;
•	 work environment emissions, including carbon 
monoxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia;
•	 stack emissions due to fuel combustion;
•	 quality of treated wastewater; and
•	 quality of groundwater.
We maintain a salvage area where valuable wastes are 
temporarily stored until transferred offsite or recycled in 
different areas onsite.
The waste management system in place at Sukari, Egypt 
sets out the correct handling of storage and disposal of 
waste material. The system is focused on:
•	 waste minimisation through adequate storage 
management to avoid stockpiling;
•	 maximising onsite recycling and reuse of different types 
of wastes;
•	 recovery of valuable material;
•	 reuse of treated wastewater streams; and
•	 disposal of material in an environmentally 
acceptable manner. 
A key focus for the Committee has been improving the rate 
in which waste material is transferred offsite or recycled.
Biodiversity
Centamin is committed to protecting the wildlife unique 
to the eastern desert by minimising the impact of our 
operations on the environment. We are conscious that 
the sea near Sukari is renowned for its crystal‑clear water, 
and includes a variety of coral reefs and marine biota. 
The desert environment is characterised by its scarce 
terrestrial biodiversity resources, and the area of Marsa 
Alam also includes the Wadi El‑Gemal Protectorate, 
one of Egypt’s largest environmental protectorates, 
with about 100km of pure beach and desert landscapes.
Biodiversity conservation principles were integrated into the 
project design for Sukari from the outset and are applied to 
all of our activities.
While we maintained careful monitoring of areas of potential 
concern, such as migratory bird movement across the area, 
there were no incidents reported of adverse impact on 
wildlife as a result of operations at Sukari during 2014.
Land management and rehabilitation
Mining is a business that deals directly with natural 
resources and it is inevitable that land will be disturbed. 
For our part, we are committed to leaving a positive legacy 
for coming generations and development initiatives.
Accordingly, upon closure, the goal is to transfer Sukari 
to a stable and self‑sustaining condition, after taking into 
account the beneficial uses of the site and surrounding land. 
Due consideration will be given to environmental and social 
impacts to avoid long‑term challenges for parties that live 
close by or depend on the area.
The planning for the closure of the mine aims to ensure 
that mining activities are soundly phased out, the mine is 
closed in an environmentally proper manner, a physically 
and chemically stable landform is maintained, with minimal 
erosion and minimal potential for dust generation and that 
the hazards are reduced to levels equal to or below those 
naturally existing within the surrounding environment.
A draft restoration and rehabilitation plan is updated 
each year. A provision for restoration and rehabilitation 
is included in the annual budget. The provision for future 
restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of 
the expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation 
at the reporting date.
In addition to the long‑term rehabilitation plan, we 
undertake short‑term rehabilitation and restoration activities 
especially for construction sites and for spills. As mentioned, 
we have a wide range of spill kits and personnel are trained 
for clean‑up operations.

Community and society
Centamin recognises that it has a responsibility to support 
and enhance the community in which it operates, and 
to minimise its impact on the environment and local 
people at every stage of its activities. We consider good 
community relations as a key component of continued 
operational success as well as a corporate requirement. 
We are committed to acting at all times in a socially 
responsible manner.
Stakeholder engagement
We attach considerable importance to maintaining dialogue 
with the local community in areas in which we operate.
A public consultation system has been in place at Sukari 
since the project design phase, and during the construction 
phase. With mining in operation we have maintained open 
channels of communication with all our stakeholders for the 
purpose of information disclosure.
In providing opportunities for raising concerns 
and grievances we have been pleased to find that 
throughout 2014, as in previous years, the Sukari mine 
continues to be welcomed by the local community and 
government authorities.
Community development initiatives
We have supported infrastructure and services in Marsa 
Alam for a number of years. The initiatives include:
Infrastructure:
•	 provision of generators of capacity 3.2Mw to upgrade 
Marsa Alam power station; 
•	 continuing to supply electricity to a neighbouring 
Bedouin settlement of 200 people; 
•	 supporting the youth centre at Marsa Alam;
•	 financing the maintenance activities undertaken in 
Marsa Alam institutes and schools; and 
•	 maintenance of Sukari statues in Marsa Alam.
Social involvement:
•	 sponsoring local events and celebrations including the 
orphans’ day, police day and the environment day; and
•	 donation of equipment and furniture to local authorities 
in Marsa Alam. Such as the civil defence authority and 
groundwater department.
Social welfare:
•	 financing the surgery for Bedouins in Marsa 
Alam hospital;
•	 financing daily Iftars during Ramadan for unprivileged 
individuals in Marsa Alam; and
•	 distributing food at feasts.
Enhancing education:
•	 training of 60 geology and engineering students at 
Sukari in the summer vacation; and
•	 organising field visits to Sukari for students and officials. Raw seawater pond at Sukari Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

Health and safety
Following the acquisition of Ampella Mining Limited in 
2014, essential components of our health and safety 
management system have been implemented in Burkina 
Faso. These include employee and contractor orientation 
and induction training. The Batie camp site has a 
well‑equipped clinic operated by ISOS and the clinic has 
a full‑time paramedic. Vehicle safety and travel is also an 
important aspect of the system.
As reported in the operational review, subsequent to the 
year end, an unfortunate incident occurred on a public 
road near the Konkera village which resulted in one of 
our local employees being fatally wounded and another 
sustaining injuries. The wellbeing of our employees is a 
priority for Centamin and a thorough investigation into this 
bandit attack, on two of our vehicles, has been carried out. 
Further additional security measures have been proposed 
following the incident and these are being implemented. 
There was no impact on operational activity as a result of 
the incident.
Environmental assessment and community projects
Centamin has contributed to a number of projects 
for the local community of Batie in Burkina Faso. 
An environmental impact assessment study (“EIA”) 
has been carried out in accordance with Burkina Faso 
legislation and regulations. 
Of particular note in connection with the EIA were the 
specific issues relating to the human environment and 
these were identified, as follows:
•	 relocation of communities directly impacted;
•	 relocation of cashew tree plantations;
•	 identification of sacred and religious sites;
•	 social acceptability and job creation;
•	 economic impact assessment; and
•	 community projects. 
The process in developing the EIA included a 
comprehensive stakeholder consultation for the project 
and the relocation requirements associated with the 
project. In comparison to Sukari, Batie project extends in 
villages and occupied areas and thus a relocation for some 
farms, houses and public areas will be carried out. 
A comprehensive relocation plan has been prepared while 
calculating all financial aspects. This process engaged all 
concerned stakeholders including farmers, land owners, 
local chiefs and local committees have been formed 
to follow‑up the process. With the further optimisation 
and design of the project, the relocation plan will be 
refined accordingly. 
To date, the following projects have been taken forward by 
Centamin since the acquisition of Ampella:
•	 provision of essential anti‑venoms to Batie; 
•	 establishment of a water bore in Wadarado village;
•	 repair of a school in Djikando Village; and
•	 sponsorship of local events and school sports activities.
Stakeholder engagement remains a key element 
throughout the exploration and advanced exploration 
phase. This will become increasingly important as the 
Company proves the resource and is able to develop 
an operating mine in the region. Centamin, through 
the Ampella local subsidiaries, will continue to engage 
with the local community for our projects in Batie in 
Burkina Faso. Directors’ report

Corporate governance
Dear shareholders
I am presenting this corporate governance report in 
my capacity as Chairman of the Compliance/Corporate 
Governance Committee, a committee established by 
the Board of the Company whose function is to make 
recommendations to the Board on matters such as:
(a)  the implementation, maintenance and monitoring of 
the Company’s corporate compliance programme 
and its Code of Conduct, taking account of applicable 
government and industry standards, legal and business 
trends and public policy issues; and
(b)  the Company’s activities in the area of corporate 
compliance that might impact upon its business 
operations or public image.
The Company is incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands. 
The Company is by virtue of the Listing Rules, subject to 
the Corporate Governance Code (“Code”) issued by the 
UK Financial Reporting Council and therefore the Company 
must confirm that it has complied with all relevant provisions 
of the Code or to explain areas of non‑compliance. The 
Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website www.frc.org.uk.
In addition, the Company is required to follow the principles 
of corporate governance set out in the best practice 
recommendations of the Toronto Stock Exchange, in 
particular those recommendations in National Policy 58‑201 
– Corporate Governance Guidelines (“NP 58‑201”).
This report sets out the key areas the Board has focused on 
during the year, from a corporate governance perspective, 
together with details of the roles of the key Board members 
and an assessment of the effectiveness of the Board.
The communication 
channels between senior 
management and the 
Board have enabled 
open discussion on the 
requirement and content 
of public disclosures, to 
meet regulatory obligations 
as well as ensuring the 
shareholders are properly 
informed about key events.

Corporate Governance Committee

The key areas of activity for the development of the 
Company’s approach to corporate governance are 
listed below:
•	 external audit tender process resulting in the 
appointment of PWC. 
  See Audit and Risk Committee report
•	 appointment of the new CEO and separate role 
of Chairman. 
  See nomination report
•	 development of the executive remuneration and 
further disclosure. 
  See remuneration report
•	 evaluation of Board and Committee 
composition changes. 
  See nomination report
I am able to advise that, following the recent appointment 
of our new Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Pardey, 
the previously combined roles of Chairman/CEO are 
now separate.
The communication channels between senior management 
and the Board have enabled open discussion on the 
requirement and content of public disclosures, to meet 
regulatory obligations as well as ensuring the shareholders 
are properly informed about key events.
Having consulted with the non‑executive directors we 
believe that the format of the Board, in conjunction with 
the activities of the various Board Committees allows 
open debate with the directors able to engage on matters 
of executive management policy, performance and risk 
management. This framework allows them to effectively 
monitor the performance of management and develop 
proposals on strategy.
Mark Bankes
Chairman of the Compliance/ 
Corporate Governance Committee

Fundamental to the Group’s corporate governance policy 
and practice is that all directors and employees reflect the 
Company’s key values of accountability, fairness, integrity 
and openness. Directors’ report
| Centamin plc Annual report 2014 64
Compliance statement
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2014, the 
Company has been in compliance with the provisions set 
out in the Code with the exception of the following matters:
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) 
were both exercised by Josef El‑Raghy during 2014. This 
matter has now been addressed, following the appointment 
of Andrew Pardey as the Company’s CEO effective from 
1 February 2015. Josef El‑Raghy, the Company’s interim 
CEO, will continue in his role as Chairman. 
Some of the additional responsibilities undertaken by the 
senior independent non‑executive director will, over the 
course of 2015, revert to the Chairman. The enhanced 
role undertaken by the senior independent non‑executive 
director was put in place to ensure that control of certain 
key areas of Board responsibility was devolved away from 
the Chairman while the roles were combined.
It should be noted that both the Code and best practice 
recommendations favour that the Chairman be an 
independent director on appointment. Josef El‑Raghy is 
not an independent non‑executive Chairman within the 
meaning of the Code. As such, the senior independent 
non‑executive director will continue to take an active role to 
ensure the Board’s ongoing effectiveness in all respects.
It is noted that in the case of the directors’ remuneration 
report, the disclosures have exceeded the obligations on 
the Company given its incorporation in Jersey. However, 
the Company considers such enhanced disclosure is 
appropriate to allow shareholders to compare the Company 
with UK incorporated FTSE 350 listed companies. It has also 
incorporated many additional and voluntary disclosures in 
its strategic report.
How the Board of Directors operates
The Board sets and implements the strategic aims and 
values of the Company, providing strategic direction to 
management. The specific matters reserved to the Board 
are set out in the Board Charter which is available on the 
Company’s website at www.centamin.com. The matters 
reserved for the Board include any significant matters

Leadership
The Chairman, Josef El‑Raghy, is responsible for ensuring 
the business is run in accordance with the Board’s strategy. 
Following the appointment of the new CEO, Josef’s 
previous responsibilities for implementing strategy and 
overseeing the day‑to‑day running of the business will be 
handed over to Andrew Pardey during the course of 2015. 
The management team and Board are relatively few in 
number and are, therefore, actively involved in, and made 
aware of, all the major activities of the Group. They can 
therefore ensure the Company’s actions are aligned with 
the strategic aims of the Group.
Areas of focus for the Board in 2015
Strategic planning – the Board regularly reviews and 
approves strategic plans and initiatives put forward by 
management and the executive, including geographical 
diversification. Details of the strategic objectives for cash 
generation, shareholder return and the growth of the 
Company can be found in the strategic report.
Communications – the Board oversees the Company’s 
public communications with shareholders and other 
stakeholders and plans further developments to aid the flow 
of information between the Company’s operations, senior 
management and the Board.
Risk assessment – the Board has primary responsibility for 
identifying the principal risks in the Company’s business 
and to ensure the implementation of appropriate systems 
to manage these risks. The Board will be reviewing the 
updates to the 2014 Code and further evaluating the 
processes for identifying and mitigating both operational 
and corporate risks.
Internal control – the Board, with assistance from the Audit 
and Risk Committee oversees the Group’s internal control 
and management information systems. The Board will be 
reviewing the conclusions of the committee with regard to 
the appointment of an externally appointed internal auditor.
Reporting and audit – the Board, through the Audit and 
Risk Committee are reviewing proposals to enhance and 
streamline the accounting function. The Board will also be 
working closely with the newly appointed auditor to assess 
whether there are areas where reporting could be improved 
further to enhance the business.
Relationship with stakeholders – maintaining, developing 
and monitoring relationships with key stakeholders including 
EMRA in relation to Sukari and other governments in 
Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia.
The responsibilities of the Board and key roles within the 
organisation are set out below:
The Chairman:
•	 lead the Board and ensure it operates effectively;
•	 ensure all matters on the agenda are given due 
consideration and that directors have the opportunity 
to contribute to the Board discussion;
•	 communicate with shareholders in relation to the 
Company’s strategic aims and policies; and
•	 represent the Group before key stakeholders including 
government officials (including EMRA).
Non‑executive directors:
•	 challenge and help develop the Group’s strategy;
•	 participate as members of the Board and on 
certain committees;
•	 monitor the performance of management;
•	 be satisfied as to the adequacy and integrity of financial 
and other reporting;
•	 determine appropriate levels of remuneration for 
executive directors; and
•	 raise any concerns with the Board.
Chief Executive Officer:
•	 develop and implement, short, medium and long term 
corporate strategies;
•	 responsible for day‑to‑day management of the business 
and the implementation of the Board’s strategic aims; 
and
•	 promote the highest standards of safety, corporate 
compliance and adherence to codes of conduct.
For senior management roles and responsibilities  
 See strategic report
Detailed knowledge of the Group’s activities is essential and, 
each year, the Board visit Sukari where they are shown the 
underground operation, open pit site and the operations 
plant, accompanied by the heads of department based at 
Sukari. In addition to regular site visits to Sukari, the senior 
members of the management team and executive visit the 
exploration sites in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia 
to ensure the activities in these regions are aligned with the 
corporate objectives of the Group. Directors’ report
| Centamin plc Annual report 2014 66
Board appointments and independence
There were no Board appointments during the course of 
2014, however, in 2015 the vacancy for the position of CEO, 
who has also been appointed as an executive director, was 
filled. The Nomination Committee, through the process of 
succession planning, had ensured that adequate support 
and development were given to Andrew Pardey to prepare 
him for the role of CEO. After a thorough assessment 
of the experience and expertise of Andrew Pardey and 
his performance as COO, the Nomination Committee 
recommended, and the Board unanimously agreed, to 
appoint Andrew Pardey as the Company’s new CEO 
effective from 1 February 2015.
The Nomination Committee and the Board also considered 
and approved that Josef El‑Raghy, interim CEO, continue in 
his role as Chairman of the Board.
As disclosed in the 2013 annual report, following the 
completion and commissioning of Stage 4, Trevor Schultz 
resigned as an executive director and was appointed a 
non‑executive director. Trevor Schultz was subsequently 
appointed Chairman of the HSES Committee following the 
retirement of Bob Bowker. The Nomination Committee and 
the Board were in agreement with the recommendation to 
retain the skills, knowledge and experience of Trevor Schultz 
on the Board of the Company.
The Company remains compliant with the provisions of 
the Code that the Board should have a greater number 
of non‑executive directors than executive directors. 
The Company continues to be compliant following the 
resignation of Bob Bowker in January 2015.
When determining whether a director is independent, the 
Board has established a Directors’ Test of Independence 
Policy, which is based predominantly on the definition 
of independence in Canadian Securities Administrators’ 
National Instrument 52‑110 – Audit Committees 
(“NI 52‑110”), and is available on the Company’s website 
or to shareholders upon request. The criteria in NI 
52‑110 are mandatory and are more stringent in certain 
respects than the independence criteria suggested by the 
Code. Based on this policy, the majority of the Board are 
considered by the Board to be independent non‑executive 
directors.

Managing risks and internal controls
The Board is responsible for satisfying itself that 
management has developed and implemented a sound 
system of risk management and internal control. Assisted 
by the Audit and Risk Committee, management reports to 
the Board on the Group’s key risks and the extent to which 
it believes these risks are being appropriately managed 
and mitigated.
During the year, the Company conducted an assessment of 
the control environment of the Group, summarised by the 
following key headings:
•	 corporate governance framework;
•	 management reporting framework;
•	 procedures for forecasting and budgeting;
•	 external reporting obligations and procedures;
•	 information technology environment; and
•	 corporate and operational principal risk assessment. 
The Board made the following key recommendations 
following the review:
•	 development of segregation of duties and signatory 
controls for new exploration assets;
•	 data capture, information and file sharing procedures for 
newly acquired assets;
•	 enhanced treasury procedures for the diversification of 
cash deposits;
•	 enhanced reporting to the Board for contractor 
management and key deliverables;
•	 the appointment of an outsourced internal auditor; and
•	 further development of the risk register to include levels 
of probability and likely impact of principal risks.
It was noted that the above recommendations were not 
seen as significant failings or weaknesses, but reflect the 
breadth and scope of the review.

The Board recognises the importance of keeping the 
market fully informed of the Group’s activities and of 
communicating openly and clearly with all stakeholders. 
The Company has established a formal Continuous 
Disclosure Policy to ensure this occurs. Details of the 
Company’s policies can be found on the Company’s 
website. A sub‑committee of the Board monitors 
and advises on the Company’s continuous disclosure 
obligations. All actions and decisions of the sub‑committee 
are presented to the CGC Committee at the next 
available meeting.
Details of the Company’s policies and procedures can be 
found on the Company’s website.
Shareholder resolutions
In 2014 additional share securities were issued for the 
purpose of acquiring Ampella Mining Ltd, which was made 
possible by the resolution approved at the 2013 AGM 
authorising the issue of further securities, for purposes 
such as this recommended take‑over offer. The continued 
support of the Company’s shareholders in this way is 
recognised and valued by the Board and allows the 
Company to further expand and meet the Company’s 
long term objectives.
Political donations
Centamin does not make donations to any organisations 
with stated political associations.
Supplier and payment policy
It is the Company’s policy that, subject to compliance 
with trading terms by the supplier, payments are made in 
accordance with terms and conditions agreed in advance 
with the supplier. Further details on trade creditors are 
provided in Note 15 to the financial statements. Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 69

Nomination report
Dear shareholders
I am presenting this report as Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee, a committee established by the Board of the 
Company whose primary functions and responsibilities (as 
set out in the committee charter) are to:
•	 make recommendations for the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and Board Committees;
•	 assist with the alignment of directorships held within the 
Group’s subsidiary companies;
•	 review the necessary and desirable competencies, skills, 
knowledge and experience of directors;
•	 review the Board succession plans; and
•	 make recommendations for the appointment, re‑election 
and removal of directors to/from the Board.
The activities undertaken by the committee during the year 
include the following:
•	 reviewing the structure, size and composition of 
the Board and Board Committees which resulted in 
recommendations to the Board to:
•	 appoint Mark Arnesen to the CGC Committee;
•	 appoint Trevor Schultz as a non‑executive director 
and appoint him to the HSES Committee in place of 
Mark Arnesen;
•	 appoint Andrew Pardey as CEO and recommend that 
Josef El‑Raghy continue as Chairman; and
•	 appoint Trevor Schultz as Chairman of the HSES 
Committee following the retirement of Bob Bowker.
•	 appointing Heidi Brown to be director of the Group’s 
Australian subsidiary companies, to remain compliant 
with the Corporations Act;
•	 considering the requirements for Board diversity 
(including gender diversity);
•	 reviewing the Board succession plans which resulted in 
the recommendation and appointment of Andrew Pardey 
as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer; and
•	 making recommendations for the appointment and 
re‑election of directors to the Board at the AGM.
Within the remit of the Nomination Committee, there is 
a requirement to ensure adequate succession planning is 
routinely discussed. Reviews of management capabilities and 
potential are performed on a routine basis and resources 
allocated to assist with this continued development.
The report provides more detail on the activities, decisions 
and policies of the Nomination Committee and Board.

Nomination report continued
Nomination Committee
As at the date of this report, the Nomination Committee 
comprises Edward Haslam (Chairman), Mark Arnesen 
and Kevin Tomlinson, all of whom are independent 
non‑executive directors of the Company. All appointed 
members attended all four committee meetings held during 
the year.
Board diversity
The Board considered the recommendations of the 
Nomination Committee in connection with Board diversity 
and in particular gender diversity and the Board has agreed 
that whilst all appointments should be continued to be 
made on merit, female candidates will be considered 
routinely as part of the recruitment process. It is our 
intention to identify a suitable female candidate during the 
course of the next twelve months. In addition, and as part 
of our succession planning, we will continue to appoint and 
encourage female professionals to ensure a progressive 
pipeline of talent within the Company’s management and 
senior management team.
In this last context the committee noted that a number of 
females already hold senior positions within the Company, 
in the areas of legal, accountancy, HSES and subsidiary 
directorships. However, as set out in the CSR report, mining 
is traditionally a male dominated industry and of our 
Egyptian workforce only 1% are female. This is mainly due 
to social conditions in Egypt and in the Middle East where 
in general female employees are not encouraged to work at 
remote sites. A greater percentage of females are employed 
throughout the Group in the administrative offices and at 
the Company’s headquarters.
In developing the Company’s policy on diversity, the Board 
has considered the requirements of the Code and the 
National Instrument 58‑101.
The Board, through the recommendations of the 
Nomination Committee, will provide an update on the 
recruitment process in future reporting disclosures.
Details of the current composition of the Board and the 
wider management team are set out in the directors’ report.

Performance evaluation
The senior independent non‑executive director held 
meetings with the non‑executive directors without the 
executive directors present, providing feedback to the 
full Board. These meetings focused primarily on the 
evaluation of the Board’s performance, a performance 
evaluation of the Chairman, discussing the quality 
of reporting and information flows to the Board and 
discussions on the strategic aims and objectives for the 
Group. The non‑executives also discussed openly with the 
executive directors, the areas they could assist further in 
relation to business development.
An evaluation of the Board and its committees was 
undertaken during the year and was concluded in March 
2015. The Board, in conducting their evaluation, reviewed 
the activity, composition and expertise of the committees 
and considered their effectiveness taking account of 
the following:
•	 the responsibilities set out in their respective charters;
•	 activities carried out during the year, taking account of 
their mandated duties and responsibilities; 
•	 progress made in respect of their duties and 
responsibilities;
•	 attendance and contribution to the committees; and
•	 reporting and updates provided to the Board.
The Board noted in particular that the relevant committees 
had adapted well to the changes to their composition 
during the year and in 2015. The Board also noted the 
efforts of the committees to streamline their arrangements, 
ensuring that the members of the management team who 
were invited to attend and present at the meetings did so in 
a concise and orderly fashion.
The Board reviewed its own membership and performance 
and this review was concluded in March 2015. The Board 
focused primarily on the recent retirement of Bob Bowker 
and the skills, knowledge and experience that Bob provided 
to the Board. The Board noted that Bob had been with the 
Company since 2008, serving as Chairman of the HSES 
Committee during that time. The Nomination Committee 
had recommended that Trevor Schultz be appointed to 
replace Bob as HSES Committee chair. The Board, whose 
views were supported by the Nomination Committee, 
were agreed that the Board continued to have the required 
breadth of expertise and there was no immediate need to 
seek a replacement for Bob Bowker.
In addition, the Board discussed in detail the scope and 
remit of the new CEO, Andrew Pardey, and specifically 
the KPIs and areas of focus for Andrew Pardey and 
the handover of certain of Josef El‑Raghy’s assumed 
responsibilities as acting CEO.
The Board recognises the requirements of the Code 
in appointing an external facilitator to evaluate the 
performance of the Board. In June 2013, the Institute of 
Directors carried out an evaluation of the Board and the 
findings were reviewed and accepted by the non‑executive 
directors. During 2015/16 a further evaluation will 
be conducted.
The performance of all directors is constantly reviewed 
by the Chairman and, periodically, by the Nomination 
Committee. The Company deployed a formal process for 
evaluation of the Board, the Board members, the Board 
Committees and the Chairman during the relevant period 
led by the senior independent non‑executive director.
The Board has also had training sessions on various topics 
during the year, carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
– topics included contractor management, identifying 
principal risks and accounting judgments and estimates. 
Further training sessions on listing rule requirements given 
by London law firms were attended by the Board and 
senior management. Directors’ report

Remuneration report
1. Introduction and annual statement
Background to remuneration decisions
With a fifth successive year of growth at Sukari and 
completion of its capital investment, the Company is 
positioned to deliver further cash generation, shareholder 
returns and future growth:
Cash generation:
•	 year gold production 377,261 ounces (6% increase 
on 2013);
•	 ‘Stage 4’ expansion project was completed during the 
year with throughput exceeding nameplate capacity 
from September 2014;
•	 cash operating costs of US$729 per ounce in line with 
budget of US$700 per ounce); and
•	 safety record of 0.39 LTIFR in 2014 (maintaining a good 
track record).
Shareholder returns:
•	 maiden interim dividend of 0.87 US cents per share paid 
in October 2014;
•	 final dividend of 1.99 US cents per share announced on 
23 March 2015; and

•	 successful completion of the recommended takeover 
offer of Ampella Mining Limited and the implementation 
of the work programmes to establish the extent of the 
resource; and
•	 systematic exploration continued in Ethiopia on the 
Company’s tenements and the licences.
There are still challenges in respect of the litigation, details 
of which are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements. 
However, from an operational and financial perspective this 
has been another successful year and it is within this context 
that the key remuneration decisions for 2014 described 
below have been taken by the Remuneration Committee.
With a fifth successive year 
of growth at Sukari and 
completion of its capital 
investment, the Company 
is positioned to deliver 
further cash generation, 
shareholder returns and 
future growth.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 73
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
I have taken the views of shareholders and proxy advisory 
services and further developed our remuneration policy 
and practice. We would like to thank shareholders for their 
constructive feedback on the remuneration report. I will 
continue to engage with shareholders, proxy advisory firms 
and other stakeholders throughout 2015. The Company 
has taken steps following the AGM in 2014, to address 
the concerns of shareholders which resulted in 25% of 
the shareholders voting against the remuneration report. 
The steps taken include the following:
•	 separate resolutions in the AGM in 2015 for the approval 
of the remuneration policy and application of the policy 
(on an advisory basis);
•	 additional disclosure on executive bonus and the 
percentage awarded against the targets; and
•	 other improvements to the governance structure as set 
out in the corporate governance report.
Simple approach to remuneration
The simple approach to remuneration adopted over the 
last few years will be continued through to 2015, with the 
three elements of base pay, contribution to a pension and 
annual bonus.
This year, following the recent appointment of our new 
CEO, Andrew Pardey, we are proposing the introduction of 
a new long term incentive scheme, for approval at the AGM 
on 18 May 2015.
It is intended that Andrew Pardey (CEO) will participate in 
the new LTIP in 2015, although Josef El‑Raghy (Chairman) 
is not due to participate in the scheme in 2015 because 
as a shareholder with a 6.2% interest in the Company, 
he remains aligned with the interests of shareholders. Josef 
El‑Raghy’s participation in the new scheme will be reviewed 
in 2016. The remuneration policy described below includes 
details of the proposed new LTIP . 
This year we have also introduced a shareholding 
requirement for the executive directors.
We believe this simple approach to remuneration allows 
a cleaner line of sight for the delivery of performance in 
the short term while ensuring that the executives have a 
meaningful actual shareholding to directly link their interests 
with those of the shareholders. There is no better union 
of interest between shareholder and executives than for 
executives to be substantial shareholders in their own right.
The Deferred Bonus Share Plan (“DBPS”), now in its third 
year, provides a simple yet effective incentive to senior 
management and senior employees below board level, 
motivating and retaining individuals over the longer term. 
40 employees participate in the DBSP , including heads of 
department and senior personnel based onsite, as well as 
members of the senior management team located at the 
head office.
Changes in the Board
Andrew Pardey was appointed Chief Executive Officer on 
1 February 2015 with Josef El‑Raghy, interim CEO, standing 
down as CEO but continuing in his role as executive 
Chairman. On 26 January 2015, Bob Bowker retired from 
office. Trevor Schultz stood down as an executive director in 
May 2014 and was appointed non‑executive director. 
Key remuneration decisions for 2014
Base salary for Josef El‑Raghy, which is paid in sterling, 
remains unchanged for the third consecutive year at 
GBP500,000 (US$821,582) for 2014 and will remain at this 
level for 2015.
The bonus outcome for Josef El‑Raghy for 2014 was 80% 
of the maximum opportunity which equates to GBP700,000 
(US$1,087,294) and represents 140% of base salary. As Josef 
El‑Raghy does not participate in any long term incentive 
plan no awards were either granted or vested and hence 
the annual bonus plan is the sole incentive arrangement for 
Josef El‑Raghy. The bonus calculation is made by reference 
to a balanced scorecard which comprises of a combination 
of financial, operational and individual performance criteria. 
 Full details are on page 81 
We would like to thank shareholders for their constructive 
feedback on the remuneration report. I will continue to 
engage with shareholders, proxy advisory firms and other 
stakeholders throughout 2015. Directors’ report
| Centamin plc Annual report 2014 74
1. Introduction and annual statement continued
Key remuneration decisions for 2014 continued
The executive bonus opportunity and structure for 2014 will 
remain the same in 2015. For the executives the maximum 
bonus opportunity is 175%. This bonus opportunity 
for executives will be reduced to a maximum bonus 
opportunity of 125% in any year where an award under 
the new LTIP is made. 
Josef El‑Raghy does not currently participate in a share 
scheme and whilst permitted to participate in the new 
LTIP , there are no current plans to award grants to 
Josef El‑Raghy. This will be reviewed annually by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Following the successful completion of the Stage 4 
construction, commissioning and hand over of the 
processing plant to operations, Trevor Schultz stood down 
as an executive director and was appointed a non‑executive 
on 1 May 2014. Trevor Schultz was paid the bonus award 
of A$500,000 (US$443,616) in May 2014, as disclosed and 
accrued in the 2013 annual report. 
Trevor Schultz’s fees as a non‑executive director, effective 
from 1 May 2015, are detailed in Section 4 ‘Annual 
remuneration report’. 
It has been agreed by the Remuneration Committee that 
Josef El‑Raghy’s (Chairman) base pay for 2015 will remain 
at the same rate for 2014.
The Remuneration Committee will review Andrew Pardey’s 
(CEO) base salary (which is currently £390,000 (US$640,834) 
and ensure the overall remuneration is in line with the 
market. Any such increase will be phased in two stages 
over a two‑year period. Andrew Pardey will likely be offered 
the following:
•	 phase one increase in base salary of between 10% 
and 15%;
•	 a pension, provided as a cash supplement, of between 
10% and 20% of base salary;
•	 annual participation in the LTIP , with awards to be made 
in line with the LTIP policy;
•	 bonus opportunity of 125% of base salary (on the basis 
awards are made under the LTIP).
The following report has been made available to the 
auditors; PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , and section 4 (where 
indicated), ‘Annual remuneration report’ has been audited 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .

2. The Committee
The Committee membership
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the 
Company and following the retirement of Bob Bowker, is 
now represented by three non‑executive directors, namely, 
Edward Haslam (Chairman of the committee), Mark Arnesen 
and Kevin Tomlinson, all of whom are regarded as wholly 
independent.
No member of the Committee has any financial interest, 
other than as shareholder, in the matters decided by the 
Committee. None of the members of the Committee 
participates in any bonus scheme, long term incentive, 
pension or other form of remuneration other than the fees 
disclosed below and the statutory superannuation for the 
Australian resident directors. There is no actual or potential 
conflict of interest arising from the other directorships held 
by members of the Committee.
The members of the Committee, position and attendance 
details are shown in the table below. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.

Advisers to the Committee
During the year the Committee was supported by the 
Company Secretary. MEIS Executive Compensation Data 
was appointed as adviser to the Committee in respect of 
its work on executive remuneration. MEIS does not provide 
any other service to the Company and is regarded as 
independent by the Committee. MEIS is engaged on an 
annual retainer for GBP7,000 for a twelve month period. 
MEIS were originally appointed on the recommendation 
of the Remuneration Committee and are regarded by 
the Committee as providing independent advice as they 
have no connections with the directors and officers of the 
Company other than this engagement.
Josef El‑Raghy may attend meetings of the Committee to 
make recommendations relating to the performance and 
remuneration of his direct reports but neither he nor the 
Company Secretary are in attendance at meetings when 
their own remunerations are under consideration.
3. Our remuneration policy 
Introduction
The remuneration report (including the policy and 
application of the policy) was put to shareholders on an 
advisory basis at the AGM in 2014 and the resolution 
was passed by a 74% majority. The remuneration policy 
and application of the policy will be subject to separate 
non‑binding advisory vote at the AGM on 18 May 2015. 
The remuneration policy will be effective following 
the AGM.
In developing its remuneration policy the Committee has 
had regard to the fact that the business of the Company 
is operated outside the UK and in a market which requires 
the engagement; motivation and retention of very 
particular operational and managerial personnel and skills. 
The remuneration policy therefore seeks to:
•	 position remuneration packages to ensure that they 
remain competitive, taking account of all elements of 
remuneration and be reflective of the performance of 
the Company;
•	 use external benchmark data on a transparent and open 
basis using comparator groups that reflect the industry 
and size of the Company;
•	 provide incentive arrangements for relevant employees 
that are based upon pre‑agreed performance criteria 
against which individuals will then be tested. Such 
incentives should be relevant and stretching;
•	 provide long term incentives that encourage the 
involvement, in the long term, of the performance 
of the Company; and
•	 encourage executives, and in particular executive 
directors, to build and then maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company. 
Activities of the Committee
The Committee met four times in the year and undertook

operations of the business, it may be necessary 
to provide additional benefits such as private

Remuneration policy for executive directors
Element Objective Details For 2014 For 2015
Annual bonus To provide a driver 
and reward for the 
delivery of short 
term performance 
goals, normally over 
the course of the 
financial year.
Performance criteria, which are set at the 
beginning of each year, are based upon a 
balanced scorecard approach. The balanced 
scorecard shall be based 70% on financial, 
operational and strategic targets and 30% on 
individual key tasks.
The performance measures are selected to 
provide an appropriate balance between 
incentivising executive directors to meet 
financial/operational targets for the year and 
incentivising them to achieve specific strategic 
objectives. In selecting the performance 
conditions for each year, consideration will 
be given to market expectations and the 
performance measures that are generally 
regarded as reflective of the performance of 
the industry. These will normally be selected 
from financial performance measures 
(profitability, cost against budget and 
operational efficiency), strategic measures 
(M&A opportunities, exploration and project 
delivery), corporate measures (health and 
safety and corporate governance) and 
individual tasks.
For executive directors, the maximum annual 
bonus opportunity is 175% of base salary, 
however a lower amount will be set for 
executive directors who participate in the 
proposed LTIP . On target bonus is just above 
half of the maximum opportunity at 57% of the 
maximum.

A new long term incentive scheme in proposed 
for approval at the 2015 AGM.
Details of the new LTIP are set out in section 6 
on page 85.
For management, but not directors, the 
Company has a deferred bonus scheme as 
part of the annual bonus. The Company can 
require up to 100% of a bonus to be deferred 
into shares. Such shares will then be released 
typically as to a third at the end of each 12, 24 
and 36 month period.
No LTIs awarded to 
executive directors.
Awards to Andrew 
Pardey are proposed 
following approval of 
the L TIP at the AGM 
in May 2015.
The L TIP is available 
to all executives 
(and senior 
management), 
however there are 
no current plans 
to make awards to 
Josef El‑Raghy .
Share 
ownership 
requirement
To encourage 
ownership of 
shares and thereby 
create a link of 
interest between 
shareholder and 
the executives.
While there was no formal shareholding 
requirement for executive directors in 2014, 
it is proposed in the remuneration policy that 
a formal policy be adopted in 2015. 
No formal policy. 
Josef El‑Raghy has a 
shareholding equivalent 
to 9,288% of base pay 
which represents 6.2% 
as a direct shareholding 
in the Company (this 
includes certain shares 
held by the El‑Raghy 
family).
Executive directors 
are required to 
build a holding 
of shares in 
the Company 
equivalent to 150% 
of base salary over 
a five year period 
from appointment. 
Vested shares are 
to be included in 
the calculation. Directors’ report

3. Our remuneration policy continued
Policy if a new director is appointed
The Company has a track record of succession planning and 
growing and promoting talent internally as demonstrated by 
the appointment of the new CEO.
When hiring a new executive director, or promoting an 
individual to the Board, the Committee will offer a package 
that is sufficient to attract and motivate while aiming to pay 
no more than is necessary taking account of market data, 
the impact on other existing remuneration arrangements, 
the candidate’s location and experience, external market 
influences and internal pay relativities.
The structure of the remuneration package of a new 
executive director will follow the policy above, however 
in certain circumstances, the Committee may use other 
elements of remuneration if it considers appropriate with 
due regard to the best interests of the shareholders. 
In particular, a service contract that contains a longer initial 
notice period, tapering down to twelve months over a 
set period of time, the buyout of short and or long term 
incentive arrangements (taking account of the performance 
measures on such incentives) as close as possible on a 
comparable basis, the provision of long term incentives 
and the provision of benefits such as housing allowance 
or similar particularly where it is an expatriate appointment.
The Committee may, where necessary and in the interest 
of shareholders, also offer recruitment incentives to facilitate 
the recruitment of an appropriate individual subject to the 
following limits:
•	 annual bonus plus buy out short term incentives as 
described above will not exceed 175% of base pay; and
•	 long term incentives will be limited to an aggregate of 
250% in the first year or where there is a buy‑out of long 
term incentives as described above to 150%.
To facilitate the buy‑out awards outlined above the 
Committee may grant awards to a new executive director 
under the Listing Rule 9.4.2. The total package offered to a 
new recruit will not exceed the overall limits set out in the 
Company’s remuneration policy.
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s approach to payment on loss of office 
will take account of the circumstances of the termination 
of employment. In the case of a good leaver then the 
individual will be expected to work through the notice 
period and will be entitled to all the benefits under the 
service agreement during that period.
In the case of a termination as a result of poor performance 
or a breach of any of the material terms of the agreement 
then the Company may terminate with immediate effect 
without notice and with no liability to make any further 
payment to the individual other than in respect of amounts 
accrued due at the date of termination.
In the case that the Company wishes to terminate the 
agreement and make a payment in lieu of notice, this 
payment shall be phased in monthly or quarterly instalments 
over a period of no longer than twelve months (or the notice 
period if less) and that any payment should be reduced 
in accordance with the duty on the executive to mitigate 
his loss. The Company will consider if any bonus amount 
is to be included in the calculation when determining 
the payment in lieu of notice. Any bonus (if included at 
all) would be restricted to the director’s actual period of 
service only.
In the case of notice given in connection with and 
shortly following a change of control then in the case 
of Josef El‑Raghy he is entitled to payment in lieu of an 
amount equal to twelve month’s basic salary plus bonus. 
Any bonus that may be due to him at the completion 
of the change of control, shall be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and such bonus (if any) would 
be based on the period only up to the completion of the 
change of control, taking account of all the relevant key 
performance indicators.
Claw back provisions for executive directors relate to bonus 
and holiday taken in advance.
In relation to the LTIP , the Company’s approach to payment 
on loss of office will take account of the circumstances of 
the termination of employment. In the case of a good leaver 
then the individual will be expected to work through the 
notice period and will be entitled to all the benefits under 
the service agreement during that period.
In the case of a termination as a result of poor performance 
or a breach of any of the material terms of the agreement 
then all unvested awards and all vested but unreleased 
awards will lapse.
In the case of death, annual bonus will be determined 
by the Remuneration Committee, which shall determine 
the bonus to be paid taking account of the duration in 
employment and performance of the Company and long 
term incentives shall be treated in the same way as a 
good leaver.
Policy on external board appointments
The Company encourages the executive directors to 
have non‑executive external appointments provided that 
such appointments do not adversely impact on the duties 
required to be performed to the Company. Where there are 
external appointments the director will retain any fees for 
such appointments and will not be liable to account to the 
Company for such fees.
Of the executives, Trevor Schultz received remuneration 
during 2014 from another external appointment with 
Base Resources Limited amounting to US$70,000.

Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Remuneration policy for non‑executive directors
Element Objective Details For 2014 For 2015
Non‑executive 
director fees
To attract and 
retain high calibre 
non‑executive 
directors by 
the provision of 
competitive fees.
Non‑executive directors receive annual 
fees within an aggregate directors’ fee pool 
limited to an amount which is approved 
by shareholders.
Fees are reviewed every two years against 
the same comparator groups as used for the 
executive directors.
Non‑executive directors do not participate in 
any incentive arrangements.
Special arrangements exist regarding the fees 
for the senior independent non‑executive 
director while the roles of CEO and Chairman 
were combined. This arrangement is under 
review while the orderly hand over of Chairman 
duties is returned to the Chairman.
The fees were reviewed 
in 2013 and the following 
applied from 1 April 2013:
•	 basic fee GBP65,000 
(US$106,806);
•	 chair of a Committee 
GBP10,000 
(US$16,432); and
•	 member of a 
Committee GBP5,000 
(US$8,216).
The fees payable 
to the senior 
non‑executive 
director will be 
reviewed during 
the year.
The fees for 
the other 
non‑executives will 
next be reviewed 
for 2016. Otherwise 
the fees will remain 
as for 2013.
Incentives No incentives. The non‑executive directors do not participate 
in any short or long term incentive plans.
There is no 
intended change in 
the policy for 2014.
Remuneration arrangement across the Company
Our remuneration policy for executive directors is consistent 
with that across the Company and aims to attract and 
retain high‑performing individuals and to reward success. 
Base pay and benefits are set competitively taking account 
of the individual’ s performance and market data. Annual 
incentives are typically linked to local business performance 
with a focus on performance against key strategic business 
objectives. Key management team members may also 
receive some of their annual bonus in shares which are 
deferred. At this time there are no all employee share 
arrangements but this is kept under review on a regular basis 
taking account of the locations the Company operates in and 
the appropriateness of share base rewards in such locations.
All employees of Sukari Gold Mine Company (the majority 
of whom are based at the Sukari mine site) are subject to a 
performance related bonus which is linked to the underlying 
operation performance, and cost control measures at the 
mine. Further details on employee relations can be found in 
the CSR report.
For Josef El‑Raghy the graphs assumes a base salary 
as disclosed in this report of GBP500,000, pension 
contributions of 20% of base being GBP100,000 and bonus 
from zero at the minimum, to 50% of 175% at target, and 
175% of base for the maximum. There are no benefits or 
long term incentive elements. 
For Andrew Pardey, the graphs assume a base salary of 
GBP390,000, pension contributions of up to 20% of base 
and bonus from zero, to 50% of 125% at target and 125% 
of base for the maximum. The graph assumes that Andrew 
Pardey will be awarded shares under the terms of the new 
LTIP of 150% of his base salary with an initial award of up to 
150% of his base salary. For the LTI the assumed values are 
zero for minimum, to 50% of the face value of the award at 
target and the face value of the award for the maximum.

policy for 2015 as detailed in this report on remuneration.

Non‑executive director fees
Non‑executive directors receive annual fees within an aggregate directors’ fee pool limited to an amount which is approved 
by shareholders. The Committee reviews and recommends, for Board approval, remuneration levels and policies for 
directors within this overall directors’ fee pool. The fees which are paid are also periodically reviewed. The current annual 
fee rate for non‑executive directors is as follows:

continue with an enhanced role with fees commensurate with that role. In keeping with the Company’s policy, Mr Haslam did not 
and will not participate in any meeting discussing his fees.

Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Base pay
Remuneration of the executive directors and the senior 
management team is considered against three criteria 
– general pay levels and pay increases throughout the 
Company, the performance and skills of the individual 
and market data.
In respect of market data for the executive directors and 
the senior management team, a selection of five different 
comparator groups are used in order to gain a balanced 
view of the market data. These comparator groups consist 
of a bespoke list of UK and international mining companies, 
companies with a similar market capitalisation, companies 
with a similar turnover, the Mining Sector and the FTSE 250. 
Any increase which exceeds that of the general work force 
may only normally be awarded in cases as a result of change 
in responsibility, or the complexity and nature of the role or 
size of the organisation or the pay level becoming out of 
line with the market data. 
Pay is reviewed annually and any changes ordinarily take 
effect from the 1 January. However, with the appointment 
of a new CEO in February 2015, the annual review of pay  
for 2015 has been deferred to May 2015.
Taking account of market data has however been 
determined that there will be no increases in base pay for 
2015 for Josef El‑Raghy. Therefore the base pay for Josef 
El‑Raghy of GBP500,000 (US$821,582) will remain at this 
level during 2015. 
The appointment of the new CEO, Andrew Pardey will likely 
see a change in his remuneration package over the next 
24 months which may include an increase of base salary in 
line with the market, a cash payment in lieu of a pension 
equivalent of between 10% and 20% of his base salary and 
annual awards under the new LTIP equivalent to 150% of 
base salary with an initial annual award of 150%.
Annual bonus
The bonus plan for the executive directors is based upon a 
balanced scorecard approach designed to encourage and 
reward the delivery of operational performance. For Josef 
El‑Raghy the bonus is split 70% business and 30% individual 
targets as follows:
•	 70% – the business targets are based on: 
•	 40% – financial (profitability/financial position, cost 
against budget and operational efficiency); 
•	 20% strategic measures (M&A opportunities, 
exploration in Egypt and other locations, 
project delivery); and
•	 10% corporate (corporate governance improvements, 
health and safety, production guidance and CSR 
development).
•	 30% – the individual tasks are based on building 
management team and motivation, formalisation 
and communications of business strategy, in country 
stakeholder management and shareholder relations.

2014 bonus (audited)
In reviewing performance against the criteria and in 
arriving at the decision the committee considered the key 
milestones achieved during the year which Josef El‑Raghy 
was instrumental in delivering, which included the following:
Financial and operational:
•	 profitability/financial position – recommending and 
paying to shareholders the Company’s maiden dividend;
•	 profitability/financial position – strong financial position 
US$125.7 million cash and cash equivalents at year end 
after the payment of an interim (US$106 million cash and 
cash equivalents at 31 December 2013);
•	 cost against budget – cash operating costs of US$729 
per ounce (slightly above budget of US$700 per ounce);
•	 production achievement – annual gold production 
377,261 ounces (5% increase on 2013); and
•	 operational efficiency – processing throughput above 
the expanded 10Mtpa nameplate capacity in the 
fourth quarter. 
Strategic:
•	 M&A opportunities – successfully completing the 
recommended takeover of Ampella;
•	 exploration in Egypt and other locations – systematic 
exploration continued in Ethiopia on the Company’s 
tenements and those licences; and
•	 project delivery – completing the investment phase of 
Sukari (Stage 4 complete).
Corporate:
•	 corporate governance improvements – engagement 
programme with shareholders;
•	 corporate governance improvements – appointment of 
CEO and separation of CEO and Chairman roles; and
•	 health and safety – safety record of 0.39 LTIFR in 2014 
(maintaining a good track record although below the rate 
in 2013).
Individual KPIs:
•	 securing approval for the increase in the daily supply 
of AN; and
•	 M&A activity culminated in a recommended takeover 
offer of Ampella Mining Limited to extend exploration 
into prospective Burkina Faso.
On this basis the Committee determined that 80% of the 
maximum bonus, of 175% of Josef El‑Raghy’s 2014 base 
salary had been achieved. This resulted in a payment of 
GBP700,000 (US$1,087,294).
Further details on performance targets cannot be disclosed 
as these are commercially sensitive.
2015 bonus
The bonus for 2015 will be based upon the balanced 
scorecard approach above:
•	 70% – the business targets: 
•	 40% – financial (an improvement in profitability, cost 
against budget and operational efficiency); 
•	 20% strategic measures (M&A opportunities, 
exploration in Egypt and other locations, 
project delivery); and
•	 10% corporate (corporate governance improvements, 
health and safety, production guidance CSR 
development).
•	 30% – the individual tasks are based on building 
management team and motivation, formalisation 
and communication of business strategy, in country 
stakeholder management and shareholder relations. 
These tasks will include:
•	 orderly handover of CEO responsibilities to 
Andrew Pardey;
•	 direct stakeholder and investor engagement to 
include attending and presenting at roadshows and 
conferences throughout the year; and
•	 maintaining his role as the Company’s Egyptian 
political interface.
For Andrew Pardey the bonus opportunity will be based 
on a balance scorecard approach which will be finalised by 
the Committee in May 2015, but will apply similar business 
targets as identified above.
Further details on performance targets cannot be disclosed 
as these are commercially sensitive.
Pension arrangements and benefits in kind (audited)
Josef El‑Raghy is entitled to a payment in respect of 
pension entitlement equal to 20% of base pay. Andrew 
Pardey is likely to be entitled to a pension entitlement of up 
to 20% of base pay. Other than statutory superannuation for 
Australian resident directors, Bob Bowker and Mark Arnesen 
and the payments in lieu of pension above, no pensions or 
payments in lieu of pensions are made.

6. Long term incentive arrangements
Introduction
Neither executive director currently participates in any long 
term incentive arrangement. There is a deferred share plan 
for senior management detailed below. Andrew Pardey was 
a member of this scheme but is no longer eligible for new 
awards following his appointment as director. 
Centamin is proposing the introduction of a new long term 
incentive scheme, for approval at the AGM on 18 May 2015. 
The aim of the Plan is to introduce a long term incentive 
plan that can provide a suitable recruitment and retention 
tool for any new or promoted executives and in particular 
individuals at executive director level. The Plan, which 
complies with best practice guidelines, is to provide a 
platform, as part of the remuneration policy, to be used to 
provide a long term reward tool for participants. Full details 
can be found in the appendix to this report below.
New long term incentive plan 
Restricted share plan (“Plan”)
The Plan provides the right for the Company to grant 
awards to employees of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries (the “Group”). Awards may take the form of: 
(a) conditional share awards, where shares are transferred 
conditionally upon the satisfaction of performance 
conditions; or (b) share options which may take the form 
of nil cost options or have a nominal exercise price, 
the exercise of which is again subject to satisfaction of 
applicable performance conditions. 
Conditional share awards and options together constitute 
“awards” under the Plan and those in receipt of awards are 
“award holders”.
(A) Eligibility
Awards may be granted under the Plan to all persons who 
at the date at which the award is granted under the Plan are 
employees of the Group, though at present it is envisaged that 
Awards will be reserved for senior management in the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee decides to whom awards 
are granted, the number of ordinary shares falling under an 
award and the precise nature of the performance conditions. 
No awards may be granted more than ten years after the date 
on which the Plan was adopted by the Company.
(B) Granting of awards
Awards may be granted under the Plan at any point during 
the 28 day period following adoption of the Plan, the 42 day 
period following the announcement of the annual results of 
the Company or at any other period in which the directors 
of the Company deem that awards should be granted 
due to exceptional circumstances. In no circumstances 
shall awards be made at a time when their grant would be 
prohibited by or in breach of any law, regulation with force 
of law, or rule of an investment exchange on which shares 
are listed or traded, part of the Model Code or any other 
non‑statutory rule with a purpose similar to any part of the 
Model Code that binds the Company. Awards may not be 
made following the expiry of ten years from the date of 
adoption of the Plan. 
The shares to be transferred pursuant to vested awards 
may either be newly issued shares, treasury shares, or 
existing shares to be transferred pursuant to the Company’s 
employee benefits trust, the trustees of which are 
Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited.
(C) Anti‑dilution and scheme limits
The overall number of shares transferred or transferable 
pursuant to awards, when aggregated with all employee 
share plans operated by the Company (dilutive shares) 
cannot exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the 
Company in any ten year rolling period when added 
to the dilutive shares.
The overall number of shares transferred or transferable 
pursuant to awards for the benefit of executives, when 
aggregated with all executive share plans operated by the 
Company (executive dilutive shares) cannot exceed 5% of 
the issued share capital of the Company in any ten year 
rolling period when added to the executive dilutive shares.
For the purposes of these limits, treasury shares will count as 
newly issued shares where required by institutional investor 
guidelines. Awards or other rights to acquire shares which 
have lapsed or have been renounced do not count towards 
this limit.
The aggregate market value of any award received by an 
award holder may not (assessed on the value of the shares 
at the date of granting the award), exceed 150% of the 
award holder’s total remuneration as at the date of the 
grant of the award. In circumstances the Remuneration 
Committee determine as being exceptional, that 
limit may be increased to 250% by the Remuneration 
Committee for a particular award.
(D) Award price
Award holders are not required to make any payment to 
participate in the Plan and no price is payable by the award 
holders to enable shares to be transferred in satisfaction 
of conditional share awards. Options will either have no 
exercise price or a nominal exercise price. Directors’ report

6. Long term incentive arrangements continued
New long term incentive plan continued
(E) Vesting of awards 
Awards will vest following the passing of three years 
from the date of the award. Vesting will be subject to 
satisfaction of Performance Conditions. For the purpose 
of the performance conditions, the award will be divided 
into up to three tranches to be assessed against separate 
performance conditions measured over a three year period. 
Although the precise performance conditions may vary 
between awards, at the date of adoption of the Plan, the 
intention is that the performance conditions will be assessed 
as follows:
•	 20% of the award shall be assessed by reference to a 
target total shareholder return (“TSR”). If the top end of 
the TSR target is met (currently anticipated to be if the 
Company is ranked equal to or better than the upper 
quarter total shareholder return of selected comparator 
companies, see below) all 20% of the award tranche 
shall vest. If the Company is ranked at the median level 
in a table of comparator companies by reference to 
TSR, 25% of the award tranche shall vest (i.e. 5% of the 
award). Proportionate amounts of the award tranche will 
vest for results in between. The comparator group is as 
follows: Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd, AngloGold Ashanti, 
Centerra Gold, Eldorado Gold, Gold Fields Ltd, Kinross 
Gold Corporation, IMGold Resources Inc, Petropavlovsk, 
Polyus Gold, Randgold Resources, Yamana Gold, Inc, 
Acacia Mining plc/African Barrick, Alacer Gold, B2 Gold 
Corp and Endeavour Mining;
•	 50% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to 
absolute growth in earnings per share (“EPS”). If a 
compound annual growth rate in EPS of the Company 
of 12% is achieved, all 50% of the award tranche shall 
vest. If a compound annual growth rate in EPS of the 
Company of 8% is achieved 25% of the award tranche 
shall vest (i.e. 12.5% of the Award). Proportionate 
amounts of the award tranche will vest for results in 
between. With the onset of profit share (expected 
from 2017) likely to impact the growth of EPS, the 
Remuneration Committee will have the discretion to 
make a fair and equitable adjustment, if necessary, to 
reflect the impact of profit share when assessing the 
growth over the period of the grant. Any such adjustment 
will be discussed with key shareholders at the time; and
•	 30% of the award shall be assessed by reference to 
compound growth in gold production. If a compound 
annual growth rate of 10% of gold production is 
achieved, all 30% of the award tranche shall vest. 
If a compound annual growth rate of 6% of gold 
production is achieved 25% of the award tranche shall 
vest (i.e. 7.5% of the award). Proportionate amounts of 
the award tranche will vest for results in between.
The above measures are assessed by reference to current 
market practice and the Remuneration Committee will have 
regard to current market practice when establishing the 
precise performance conditions for awards.
Where the performance conditions have been met, in the 
case of conditional awards, 50% of the total shares under the 
award will be issued or transferred to the award holders on 
or as soon as possible following the specified vesting date, 
with the remaining 50% being issued or transferred on the 
second anniversary of the vesting date. In the case of options, 
following the vesting date the options will then be exercisable 
with the resulting shares being issued or transferred to 
the award holders on or as soon as possible following the 
exercise, with the remaining 50% being issued or transferred 
on the second anniversary of the vesting date.
(F) Exit events
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, 
winding up or compulsory acquisition of the Company, the 
vesting of an award may be accelerated. A proportion of 
the shares subject to an award equivalent to proportion 
of the vesting period which has passed at the date of 
the exit event (rounded down to the nearest month) shall 
vest, subject to the extent the performance conditions 
have been met, to be determined at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
In the event of an internal reorganisation of the Group 
which results in a new holding company and where the 
shareholders of the new holding company, immediately 
after it has obtained control, are substantially the same as 
the shareholders of the Company, awards may not vest or 
lapse but will be replaced by new awards over shares in the 
new holding company. 
(G) Leavers
Where an award holder leaves employment with the Group, 
their award will immediately suspend and will lapse upon 
the expiry of 30 days from the date of leaving, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines that the award 
holder should be entitled to retain their award. Where the 
Remuneration Committee permits the leaver to retain their 
award, a proportion of the award will vest over a proportion 
of the award shares which is equivalent to the proportion 
of the vesting period which has passed at the date of 
leaving (rounded down to the nearest month) subject to 
the extent the performance conditions have been met, 
to be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee. The resulting shares will be issued or transferred 
to the award holder on the date they would have received 
them, had they not left (subject to the same transfer in two 
equal tranches). 
An award granted under the Plan is not transferable. Awards 
will also lapse if an award holder is declared bankrupt or 
attempts to assign their award.  
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 87
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
On 4 June 2013, the Company offered to participants of 
existing plans the opportunity to replace awards with an 
initial one off award under the deferred bonus share plan 
and in June 2014, the participants who met the vesting 
criteria, received their first tranche, representing one third of 
the original award. In addition, a further grant was awarded 
to new and existing participants which will vest over the next 
three years.
The plan is not open to directors of the Company and any 
shares used for the plan are not newly issued shares.
Historic long term incentive plan summary
Employee Loan Funded Share Plan (“ELFSP”)
There are no outstanding awards under this plan and 
there is no intention to make further awards under this 
plan. This was the rollover plan for the Centamin Egypt 
Ltd 2011 ELFSP . Under the plan, employees receive a loan 
to buy shares in the Company. The shares were then held 
in trust for the employee and at the end of three years 
the employees can repay the loan and receive the shares. 
This plan is no longer in use.
Director loan funded share plan 2011
There are no outstanding awards under this plan and as 
the performance criteria were not met, the awards to the 
remaining participants lapsed in 2014. The plan is no longer 
in use.
Employee share option plan
There are no outstanding awards under this plan and the 
plan is no longer in use. Awards under the plan were subject 
to performance criteria for senior management based upon 
share price, financial, production or key tasks. 
Statement of shareholder voting
At the AGM of the Company on the 16 May 2014 the 
following votes for and against the adoption of the 
remuneration report were as follows:
 For Against Withheld
Number  392,308,097 137,672,263 137,834,974 
of votes (74.02%)  (25.98%) 
This report was approved by the Board of Directors and 
signed on its behalf by:
G Edward Haslam
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 23 March 2015
(H) Status of shares
The shares acquired under the Plan will rank pari passu with 
the Company’s issued ordinary shares.
(I) Pensionable benefits
The value of any benefit realised under the Plan by award 
holders shall not be taken into account in determining any 
pension or similar entitlements.
(J) Alteration of awards
If there is a variation of the share capital of the Company, 
including a rights issue, consolidation, sub‑division or 
reduction of share capital that effects the value of awards 
under the Plan, the Remuneration Committee may adjust 
the awards in a manner that they deem to be fair and 
reasonable. In any such circumstances, in the case of awards 
which are options, such an adjustment may not increase the 
exercise price of the options.
(K) Amendments to the Plan and assumption of awards
The Plan may at any time, on the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee be amended or added to in 
any respect, provided that prior approval of the Company 
has been obtained in a general meeting for alterations or 
additions to the rules of the Plan which are to the advantage 
of award holders in respect of the rules governing eligibility, 
entitlement to acquisition of shares under an award, to 
whom awards can be granted, Plan limits and individual 
limits on participation and the adjustment of awards on a 
variation of share capital. Awards granted under previous 
schemes operated by the Company may be assumed into, 
or satisfied under, the Plan.
Minor amendments to benefit the administration of the 
Plan, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain 
or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory 
treatment for award holders or Group companies would not 
require approval in a general meeting.
The right is also reserved up to the date of shareholder 
approval of the Plan to make such amendments to the Plan 
as are considered appropriate, provided they do not conflict 
in any material respect with this summary of the rules of 
the Plan.
Deferred bonus scheme (not for directors)
This plan, introduced in 2012, allows the annual bonus to 
be matched with shares which are then ordinarily released 
in three annual tranches, conditional upon the continued 
employment with the Group. The plan was introduced as a 
review of annual bonus arrangements for management with 
the objectives of:
•	 increasing the variable pay element of remuneration;
•	 introducing a new retention element in the remuneration 
package; and 
•	 linking part of that reward to the medium term share 
performance of the Company. Directors’ report

Audit and Risk Committee report
Dear shareholders
The Audit and Risk Committee is made up of three 
independent non‑executive directors, myself as Chairman, 
Mark Bankes and Edward Haslam. Biographies of the 
members of the committee can be found on page 58.
 Biographies can be found on page 58 
In accordance with the Ontario Securities Commission 
requirements, all members of the committee are considered 
financially literate (pursuant to section 1.5 of the Multilateral 
Instrument 52‑110) and in compliance with the Code, I am 
the member with the required relevant financial experience 
as a professionally qualified accountant.
The committee operates within the terms of reference set 
out in its charter, which were reviewed and updated during 
the year and can be found at www.centamin.com/centamin/
investors/corporate‑governance. 
The committee was satisfied that the controls over the 
accuracy and consistency of the information in the 2014 
annual report were sufficiently robust, having received 
monthly, quarterly and annual reviews on the control 
environment and approach to key accounting policies, 
estimates and judgments.
The committee has, at the request of the Board, also 
considered whether the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable. In arriving at that decision, the committee 
has been involved in reviewing, at an early stage, the 
content of both the financial statements and the strategic, 
performance and governance reporting. The assessment 
of each component by the committee can be summarised 
as follows:
•	 is the annual report fair and balanced? The committee 
concluded that the annual report was ‘fair’ and ‘balanced’ 
having considered the activity of the Company during 
the period and how this activity, KPIs and overall 
performance were presented throughout annual 
report. An example is the reporting of the positive key 
achievements during the year, such as the increase in 
throughput following completion of the expanded plant, 
but which has been balanced fairly against the backdrop 
of a lower gold price and reduced production guidance 
in 2014 and 2015; and
•	 is the annual report clear and understandable? The 
Committee recommended the removal and separate 
filing of the MD&A compliance document (which is a 
Canadian requirement) from the annual report to further 
assist with clear and concise messaging. In addition, the 
three strategic priorities are imbedded throughout the 
report, which aid the user in understanding the strategy 
and how this has impacted upon our KPIs and overall 
operational and financial performance.
The committee were 
satisfied that the controls 
over the accuracy and 
consistency of the 
information in the 2014 
annual report were 
sufficiently robust, 
having received monthly, 
quarterly and annual 
reviews on the control 
environment and approach 
to key accounting policies, 
estimates and judgments.

The activities of the committee, its principal responsibilities 
and its engagement with the external auditor are set 
out below.
External auditor
As set out in the 2013 annual report, the committee 
was satisfied with Deloitte LLP , having assessed their 
independence, ethical standards and objectivity. However, 
following over ten years of external audit provided by 
Deloitte, it was decided that the audit for the Company 
should be put out to tender. Details of the tender process 
are set out in the following section. The tender process 
was conducted in compliance with best practice guidelines 
and there are no matters in connection with Deloitte’s 
resignation as auditor which, in the view of the committee 
and the Board, need to be brought to the attention of 
shareholders. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PWC”), were 
appointed on 23 June 2014 and have since carried out the 
review engagement for the half year ended 30 June 2014 
and the statutory audit for the year end 31 December 2014. 
 The audit opinion can be found on page 95 
There has been no rotation of audit partner since PWC’s 
appointment. The Company’s policy is to tender the 
external audit every ten years.
The committee continues to monitor the auditor’s 
objectivity and independence and I am satisfied that 
PWC and the Group have appropriate policies and 
procedures in place to ensure that these requirements 
are not compromised. I am also satisfied that the audit 
engagement for the financial year ended 2014 was both 
effective and added value to the Group.
PricewaterhouseCoopers carried out the half year review 
and annual statutory audit. The auditor presented to the 
committee its audit planning approach in the run up to 
both audits. The committee, having reviewed the plans, 
assessed the content and scope of the audit, ensuring 
that the key audit areas were identified and that the audit 
approach was appropriate for the Company, given the 
committee has a detailed understanding of the controls 
in place. The committee then met following each audit 
and assessed the efficiency and timeliness in which the 
audit was carried out. The committee also reviewed the 
recommendations of the auditor and the implementation 
by management of those proposals.
There was no material non‑audit work carried out by PWC 
during the year, with the majority of the tax advisory services 
continuing to be provided by the Deloitte LLP tax teams 
in the UK and Australia. The Group’ s policy for non‑audit 
services sets out the categories which the external auditor 
will and will not be allowed to provide to the Group and 
those engagements that need pre‑approval of the Group. 
Fees for audit services incurred during the year amounted to 
US$500,000 including the interim review fee of US$100,000. 
Non‑audit fees for PWC were US$125,000. Full details are 
set out in Note 22 to the financial statements.
A summary of our policy on non‑audit services and auditor 
independence can be found on our website.
PWC have open access to the Board of Directors at all times 
and the audit partner and certain of the audit management 
team attend and present at relevant committee meetings 
throughout the year.
External audit tender process
The committee noted in the 2013 annual report and proxy 
materials that having reviewed the Company’s governance 
arrangements, taking account of recommendations in the 
Code, the committee envisaged commencing an audit 
tender process for the Company’s external auditor.
In 2014, the committee carried out a tender for the annual 
statutory audit, approaching a number of firms including 
mid‑tier and the big four audit firms. The firms were 
selected based on their experience, industry knowledge 
and matters which, may otherwise, compromise their 
independence and objectivity. Deloitte LLP was also 
invited to tender for the audit.
Aided by management, the committee assessed each of the 
selected firms and shortlisted four firms. These shortlisted 
firms were given access to information, materials and 
personnel to allow them to prepare for their presentations 
to the Committee and senior members of the finance team.
Those involved in the final selection process included 
all three members of the committee, Pierre Louw (CFO), 
Lynne Gregory (General Counsel) and Liesel Sobey 
(Group Accountant). Directors’ report
| Centamin plc Annual report 2014 90
External audit tender process continued
The members of this selection panel were impressed 
by the quality of the tenders which made the decision 
difficult, however, the committee ultimately recommended 
the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the 
Company’s external auditor. The Board agreed with the 
committee’s recommendation and PWC were then formally 
appointed as the Company’s auditor on 23 June 2014. 
Deloitte resigned as auditor effective the same date.
PWC will continue to fill the casual vacancy created and the 
Board will be recommending the appointment of PWC to 
shareholders at the AGM on 18 May 2015.
Internal controls
Activity over the coming year will include progressing a 
scoping document in relation to the provision of internal 
audit services which will assist the Group and enhance the 
control and reporting environment for the financial reporting 
team. Whilst this was initially an objective for 2014, an 
internal auditor has not been appointed to date, as the 
relative size and simplicity of the Group did not warrant 
such an appointment. However, following the ramp up of 
the processing plant and the growth of our exploration 
programmes, it is proposed that the committee identifies a 
suitable firm to carry out the internal audit. The committees 
will utilise the external statutory audit to assist in identifying 
key areas of focus for the provision of internal audit services.
Controls over financial reports and 
financial statements
The consolidated financial statements and annual report are 
prepared at the Company’s head office in Jersey, where the 
Group Accountant and Chief Financial Officer are based. 
The accounting information from the Group’s operations 
is provided to the head office where the ledgers are 
consolidated. Appropriate reconciliations and reviews are 
performed at the level of the operation and at the Group’s 
head office by way of the performance of monthly, quarterly 
and annual reconciliations.

Risk evaluation 
and mitigation
Assessment of the 
principal risks facing 
the Group and 
effectiveness of the 
risk management 
systems.
The committee reviews the corporate risk registers and operational risk assessments throughout 
the year, giving due consideration to the adequacy of controls and safeguards as well as the 
approach to risk mitigation. The committee aims to ensure that the Company’s risk appetite 
is aligned with the long‑term objectives of the Group. The committee made the following 
recommendations to enhance risk reporting and disclosures:
•	 quarterly reports to the committee summarising the conclusions and discussions of senior 
management about actual or perceived risks;
•	 granularity of the risk weighting, to include both the probability and likelihood of the 
principal risks; and
•	 enhanced reporting to capture the data, allowing the committee to comply with the revised 
2014 Code.
The exploration for and development of metals and mineral resources, together with the 
construction and development of mining operations is an activity that involves a high degree 
of risk. Due to the nature of these inherent risks, it is not possible to give absolute assurance 
that mitigating actions will be wholly effective. The table set out in the strategic report 
describes the key risks affecting the Company and its underlying operational and exploration 
activities together with the measures to mitigate risk. A full list of the principal risks affecting the 
Centamin Group can be found in the strategic report.

Significant issues highlighted during the year by the committee
The following significant issues were highlighted during the year by the committee (full details and analysis are set out in 
Note 4 to the financial statements).
Topic Significant issue How the committee addressed these issues
External audit Completion of tender 
for external auditor.
Details of how the committee carried out the tender process resulting in the appointment of 
PWC are set out in the table above.
Accounting for 
transactions
Impairment of 
assets (other than 
exploration and 
evaluation and 
financial assets).
Management have concluded that there is no indication that an impairment exists, nor have 
any indicators arisen after the reporting period and are therefore not required to perform a full 
impairment review under IAS 36.
In making its assessment as to the possibility of whether impairments losses having arisen, 
Management considered the following indications:
•	 internal sources of information;
•	 external sources of information; 
•	 litigation;
•	 the key assumptions applied in the 31 December 2013 impairment review;
•	 forecast gold prices;
•	 discount rate;
•	 production volumes;
•	 reserves and resources report; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
The committee reviewed the papers presented by management in respect to IAS 39 and are in 
agreement with the conclusions set out above.
Accounting for 
transactions  
Litigation. The Group exercises judgment in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures 
to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see 
Note 20 to the financial statements). Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood that 
a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the 
financial settlement.
The details of this litigation, which relate to the loss of the Egyptian national subsidy for diesel 
fuel oil and the ability of the Group to operate outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the 
Administrative Court of first instance to be the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, are given 
in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed Annual Information Form 
(“AIF”) which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 
The Committee have reviewed the external legal opinions, the opinions of the Company’s 
General Counsel and the facts associated with the litigation and are in agreement with 
management on the accounting judgments and agree that in the unlikely event that the 
Group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are 
restricted to a reduced area, it is management’s belief that the Group will be able to continue 
as going concern.

Going concern. Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) the directors of UK 
listed companies are required to consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate 
basis of preparation of financial statements.
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by management, in which any reasonably 
possible change in the key assumptions on which cash flow forecast is based, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Key assumptions under‑pinning this 
forecast include:
•	 litigation as discussed in Note 20 to the financial statements;
•	 forecast gold price;
•	 production volumes; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have therefore been 
prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation 
of liabilities during the normal course of operations, in preparing the financial statements.

Accounting 
treatment of Sukari 
Gold Mines (“SGM”).
SGM is consolidated within the Centamin Group of companies, reflecting the substance and 
economic reality of the Concession Agreement (see Note 21 to the financial statements). 
The Group, in considering the relevant activities of SGM, its power over these activities and 
exposure to the variable returns has concluded that the Group consolidate this interest. 
A non‑controlling interest is recorded in relation to the equity in the subsidiaries that are not 
attributable to the Group. Note 21 to the financial statements sets out in detail the accounting 
treatment for all the assets, liabilities, income and expense of SGM. The committee reviewed 
papers from management and agree with the accounting treatment as set out above.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern statement is 
detailed in full in Note 3 to the financial statements.
External auditor
So far as each current director of the Company is aware, the 
auditor has had full access to all relevant information and 
the committee has answered any questions raised by the 
auditor allowing the auditor to carry out its duties.
The committee recommends to the Board the appointment 
of PWC as auditor at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. PWC has expressed its willingness to continue 
in office as auditor.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the committee 
has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its 
terms of reference and has ensured the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor. A member of the 
committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting 
along with the CFO to answer any questions in relation to 
this report.
During the year, the committee carried out an evaluation 
of its own performance, taking into consideration the 
contribution to the quarterly and annual accounts and the 
risk review and risk assessment process. The committee also 
considered its composition, the competency, availability and 
contribution of its members and did not recommend any 
further changes to the Board.

Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and financial statements in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991 (the “Law”) and applicable 
laws and regulations. The Law requires the Company to 
prepare financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and Company has chosen 
to prepare the accounts in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable law.
Under the Law, the directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, accounting standards require that directors:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Law. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Due to the Company’s place of 
incorporation and its dual listing, it is subject to legislation 
in the United Kingdom, Canada and Jersey governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors are also responsible for the preparation of the 
strategic report, directors’ report, directors’ remuneration 
report, nomination report and corporate governance 
statement. These reports are contained within the annual 
report and financial statements.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2014 have been prepared on a going concern basis, 
which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation 
of liabilities during the normal course of operations, in 
preparing the financial statements.
The directors consider that the annual report and financial 
statements, when taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Board receives written assurances from the CEO and 
CFO that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the 
Group’s financial position presents a true and fair view and 
that the financial statements are founded on a sound system 
of risk management, internal compliance and control. 
Further, they confirm that the Group’s risk management and 
internal compliance is operating efficiently and effectively. 
The Board recognises that internal control assurances 
from the CEO and CFO can only be reasonable rather 
than absolute, and therefore they are not and cannot be 
designed to detect all weaknesses in control procedures.
The financial statements have been audited by 
the independent audit and accounting firm, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , who were given unrestricted 
access to all financial records and related information, 
including minutes of all shareholder, Board and 
committee meetings.

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Centamin plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRS”); and
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
What we have audited
Centamin plc’s financial statements comprise:

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
The appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court in Egypt 
concerning the validity of the Sukari Concession Agreement
Refer to pages 115 and 127 (Notes 4 and 20 to the financial 
statements) and page 42 (principal risks and uncertainties).
Centamin is in the process of appealing a ruling passed by the 
Egyptian Administrative Court in October 2012.
If the ruling is upheld, the Group’s operations at the Sukari site will 
be significantly reduced and there is, therefore, a risk of material 
impairment in property, plant and equipment at Sukari, which had a 
carrying value of US$999.7 million at 31 December 2014.
The outcome of this case is subject to significant uncertainty due to 
ongoing political, social and economic volatility in Egypt. 
We read legal advice from the Group’s external legal counsel 
regarding the risk that the Group may not succeed in its appeal 
against the Administrative Court and met with the Group’s internal 
and external legal counsel to evaluate the directors’ assessment of the 
outcome of the court case.
We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of internal 
and external legal counsel by considering professional qualifications, 
fee arrangements and other relevant factors.
We also obtained a copy of the Concession Agreement, as signed by 
the relevant parties.
The directors have assessed that the Group’s case has strong legal 
merit and will ultimately be successful. Based on our work, we 
determined that the directors had reflected all available information in 
their assessment. 
We tested the disclosures in Note 20 to the financial statements and 
determined that they were consistent with the requirements of IFRS 
and the results of our audit work.
Accounting for the Group’s interest in Sukari Gold Mine
Refer to pages 107 and 128 (Notes 3 and 21 to the financial 
statements) and page 42 (principal risks and uncertainties).
The Group, through its interest in Pharoah Gold Mines NL (“PGM”), 
is a 50% shareholder in Sukari Gold Mining Company (“SGM”), the 
holder of the Sukari Concession Agreement and operator of Sukari 
Gold Mine. The remaining 50% is owned by the Egyptian Mineral 
Resources Authority (“EMRA”). 
There is an accounting judgment as to whether, for the purposes of 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ (“IFRS 10”), the Group 
controls SGM, or whether joint control exists as defined by IFRS 11 
‘Joint arrangements’ (“IFRS 11”).
The directors determined that the Group controls SGM and 
should therefore consolidate 100% of its assets, liabilities and results 
in the financial statements. This determination included consideration 
of whether the Group had power over SGM, exposure or rights to 
variable returns from its involvement in SGM and its ability to use its 
power over SGM to affect the amount of those returns.
Were SGM to be treated as jointly controlled, this would result in SGM 
being accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, 
as a result, different recognition, presentation and disclosure in the 
financial statements. 
Through the procedures set out below, we considered and challenged 
the directors’ assessment of control, based on the recognition 
principles set out in IFRS 10.
We read the signed Concession Agreement between the Group 
and the Arab Republic of Egypt and determined that the facts 
of the arrangement, including commercial terms, were reflected 
appropriately in the directors’ assessment. 
We read the by‑laws of SGM and assessed the impact of these on the 
arrangement. We examined Board meeting minutes to understand the 
practical application of these by‑laws and the Concession Agreement. 
We then completed a thorough analysis of the requirements of 
IFRS 10, including the directors’ assessment of power and, therefore, 
the balance of substantive and protective rights present in the 
arrangement. The evidence we obtained supported the directors’ 
assessment that the Group has power over SGM. 
We confirmed, by reading the Concession Agreement, that the 
Group is, and will continue to be, exposed and have the right to 
variable returns. 
Based on the procedures above, we also confirmed that the Group 
has the ability to use its power over SGM to affect the amount of 
its returns.
The evidence we obtained supported the directors’ assessment that 
the Group controls SGM. 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in 
all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and 
effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these 
specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 97

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment of the Sukari Gold Mine
Refer to pages 107, 115 and 123 (Notes 3, 4 and 12 to the financial 
statements) and page 42 (principal risks and uncertainties).
The Sukari mine is the only “producing” asset within the Group. 
Following an impairment assessment in the prior year, prompted by a 
decrease in the gold price, the directors have considered whether any 
of the following further indicators have occurred in the year: 
•	 significant adverse movements in world gold prices;
•	 a material change in the factors affecting the discount rate, such as 
country risk premium; or 
•	 significant under‑performance against budget.
The directors have concluded that none of these or any other 
indicators of impairment has occurred in the year and therefore that 
no impairment review is necessary. 
In the absence of a formal impairment assessment, there is a risk that 
any unidentified material impairment of the asset’s carrying value of 
US$999.7 million is not reflected in the financial statements.
Consequently, we focused our work on the directors’ conclusions 
regarding the occurrence of any impairment indicators, including 
those described above.
We assessed whether any potential impairment indicators, including 
those identified by the directors, had occurred. To this end, we 
performed the following procedures:
•	 we obtained consensus gold pricing data and compared this to 
the pricing included in the directors’ assessment, finding that 
changes in gold prices during 2014 were not sufficient to indicate 
that an impairment review was needed;
•	 we used our valuation expertise to assess whether the reduction 
in the discount rate considered in the indicator assessment was 
within a reasonable range, taking into account a country risk 
premium for Egypt and found that it was;
•	 we determined that, despite a shortfall in gold production 
against stated market guidance, there had been no significant 
underperformance against budget; 
•	 we determined that there had been no material reduction in 
reserves and resources; and
•	 we used our knowledge of the Group and of the mining industry 
to question whether any other events had occurred during the 
year that would give rise to an impairment indicator without 
identifying any.
Having tested the directors’ impairment indicator assessment, we 
concurred that, in spite of the ongoing low price of gold and lower 
than expected production, no impairment indicator had occurred in 
the year ended 31 December 2014.
The claim before the Administrative Court concerning diesel 
fuel disputes
Refer to page 127 (Note 20 to the financial statements) and page 42 
(principal risks and uncertainties).
Centamin is involved in an ongoing legal case relating to historical 
and current fuel subsidies. The potential amount that could be 
recouped by the Group relating to the current subsidy case is 
US$165.7 million and the potential amount that the Group could have 
to pay if they lose the historical case is US$60.5 million.
To date, the Group has not provided for the historical case, based on 
internal and external assessments of the merits of the case, but has 
made disclosure of a contingent liability. 
In 2014, the Group has disclosed the impact of the current subsidy 
case, being the difference between international and subsidised 
diesel price that has impacted the Group’s results for the year, as an 
exceptional item in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. No contingent asset has been recognised.
We read the legal advice obtained by the directors from their external 
legal counsel in connection with the legal case and held meetings 
with the Group’s internal and external legal counsel. We used this 
information to evaluate the directors’ assessment of the outcome 
of the case.
We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of internal 
and external counsel, by considering professional qualifications, fee 
arrangements and other relevant factors.
The results of the procedures we performed, as described above, 
supported the directors’ accounting treatment, under which no liability 
was recognised in respect of the historical case and no asset was 
recognised in respect of the current subsidy case. 
We challenged the presentation of the impact of the difference 
between international and subsidised diesel prices as an exceptional 
item and concluded that it was still appropriate because of the 
strength of the Group’s case. 
We also considered the sufficiency of the disclosure regarding the case and concluded that it was consistent with the 
requirements of IFRS and gave a balanced description of the cases.  Financial statements

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the Group operates. 
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group‑wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at group level. The Group is headquartered in Jersey and has 
production operations in Egypt, with exploration activity in Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. 
Based on that assessment, our group audit scope focused primarily on the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt, the Group’s principal 
operation, which was subject to a full‑scope audit, as was Pharoah Gold Mines, which holds the Group’s interest in Sukari. 
We made site visits to Sukari and conducted audit fieldwork in Alexandria. During these visits, we observed and discussed 
mining operations, including how the Concession Agreement is managed, with local management and met with the 
Group’s external in‑country legal counsel in Cairo. 
We also performed specific audit procedures on material balances in other Group companies in order to address identified 
risks and other matters. 
Furthermore, we performed work over the consolidation of the Group’s components and significant head office and 
consolidation adjustments. All audit work was performed by the group audit team. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality US$7.7 million.
How we determined it  Three‑year average of 5% of profit before tax  
after exceptional items.
Rationale for benchmark applied  We used the profit before tax after exceptional items benchmark, a 
generally accepted auditing practice and took a three‑year average to 
eliminate the effects of gold price volatility.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our 
audit above US$385,000 as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons. Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 99

Going concern
The directors have voluntarily complied with Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)(3) of the Financial Conduct Authority and provided a 
statement in relation to going concern, set out on page 94, required for UK companies with a premium listing on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
The directors have requested that we review the statement on going concern as if the Company were a premium listed UK 
company. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements 
using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date 
the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgments against available evidence, forming our 
own judgments, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary 
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non‑financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1. General information
Centamin plc (the “Company”) is a listed public company, 
incorporated in Jersey and operating through subsidiaries 
and jointly controlled entities operating in Egypt, Ethiopia, 
United Kingdom and Australia. It is the parent company of the 
Group, comprising the Company and its subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entities.
Registered office and principal place of business:
Centamin plc 
2 Mulcaster Street 
St Helier, Jersey JE2 3NJ
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities 
are set out in the directors’ report and the strategic report of the 
annual report.
2. Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In the current year, no new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations have been adopted that have affected the amounts 
reported in these financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the 
financial position
The following Standards have been adopted by the Group for the 
first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2014:
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing 
principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be included within the 
consolidated financial statements of the parent company. 
The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the 
determination of control where this is difficult to assess. See Note 3 
for the impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ focuses on the rights and obligations 
of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. 
There are two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and 
joint ventures. Joint operations arise where the investors have rights 
to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of an arrangement. 
A joint operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the investors 
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement; joint ventures are 
accounted for under the equity method. Proportional consolidation 
of joint arrangements is no longer permitted. See Note 3 for the 
impact of adoption on the financial statements.
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the 
disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, 
including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and 
other off balance sheet vehicles. This amendment did not have a 
significant effect on the Group financial statements.
Had the Group adopted IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 effective 
1 January 2013 as required by the IFRS as issued by the IASB, there 
would have been no material impact on the financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: presentation’ on 
offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. This amendment 
clarifies that the right of set‑off must not be contingent on a future 
event. It must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties 
in the normal course of business, as well as in the event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy. The amendment also considers 
settlement mechanisms. The amendment did not have a significant 
effect on the Group financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, on the recoverable 
amount disclosures for non‑financial assets. This amendment 
removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs 
which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. 
This amendment did not have a significant effect on the Group 
financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’ on the novation of derivatives and the continuation 
of hedge accounting. This amendment considers legislative 
changes to ‘over‑the‑counter’ derivatives and the establishment 
of central counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives 
to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of 
hedge accounting.
The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge 
accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified 
criteria. This amendment did not have a significant effect on the 
Group financial statements.
IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to 
pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37 ‘Provisions’. 
The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that 
gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised. 
The Group is subject to royalty payments to the Egyptian Mineral 
Resource Authority (“EMRA”) which meets the definition of a levy, 
however, the impact on the Group of adopting this interpretation 
is not material. 
Other standards, amendments and interpretations which are 
effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2014 are not 
material to the Group.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and 
interpretations are for annual periods beginning after 1 January 
2014, and have not been effective applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statement. None of these is expected to 
have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 
of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. 
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification 
and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but 
simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three 
primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised 
cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through profit and loss. 
The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model 
and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. 
Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 107
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at 
inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. 
There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the 
incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. 
For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and 
measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit 
risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at 
fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements 
for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge 
effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between 
the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged 
ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk 
management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still 
required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. 
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet 
to assess IFRS 9’s full impact.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with 
revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised 
when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has 
the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good 
or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 
and earlier application is permitted. The Group is assessing the 
impact of IFRS 15.
There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet 
effective that would be expected to have a material impact on 
the Group.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements are denominated in United States 
dollars, which is the functional currency of Centamin plc. 
All companies in the Group use the United States dollar as their 
functional currency except for the UK subsidiaries which are 
denominated in Great British pounds and the Australian subsidiaries 
which are denominated in Australian dollars. All financial 
information presented in United States dollars has been rounded 
to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and 
adopted for use by the European Union, the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991, and IFRS as issued by the IASB, therefore the Group 
financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by available‑for‑sale financial assets, and financial assets 
and financial liabilities (including derivative) instruments at fair value 
through profit and loss.
There are no changes in these accounting policies for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 except as disclosed below ‘Changes in 
accounting policy’.
Changes in accounting policy 
On 1 January 2014, the Group adopted IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated 
financial statements’, IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’, IFRS 12 
‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’, a revised version of IAS 27 
‘Separate financial statements’ and a revised version of IAS 28 
‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ which have been 
amended for conforming changes based on the issuance of IFRS 10 
and IFRS 11. The Group adopted the amendments to the transition 
guidance for IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 as well as IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’. 
IFRS 10 replaces IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and separate financial 
statements’ and SIC‑12 ‘Consolidation – special purpose entities’, 
and establishes a single control model that applies to all entities, 
including those that were previously considered special purpose 
entities under SIC‑12. An investor controls an investee when it has 
power over the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns 
from the investee, and the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. The assessment of control is based on all 
facts and circumstances and the conclusion is reassessed if there is 
an indication that there are changes in facts and circumstances.
On adopting IFRS 10, the Group has assessed its interest in its 
principal asset, Sukari Gold Mine (“SGM”) which is jointly owned 
by the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines 
NL (“PGM”) and EMRA on a 50% equal basis. The Group has 
considered the relevant activities of SGM and who has the power 
over these activities and is exposed to variable returns from its 
involvement with SGM and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the relevant activities of SGM. Accordingly, 
the Group has consolidated this interest.
A Non‑Controlling Interest (“NCI”) is recorded in relation to the 
equity in the subsidiaries that is not attributable to the parent.
There has been no impact upon the comparatives as SGM has 
previously been 100% proportionally consolidated within the 
Group reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement. 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities (including 
amendments to the transition guidance for IFRS 10–12 issued 
in June 2012)’, which requires annual disclosures of the nature, 
associated risks, and financial effects of interests in subsidiaries, 
joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured 
entities became effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Basis of preparation continued
Changes in accounting policy continued 
Changes in accounting estimate
On 1 January 2014, the Group changed its accounting estimate in 
relation to the useful economic life of Sukari plant and equipment 
capitalised within plant and equipment. Plant and equipment 
was previously depreciated on a straight‑line basis over a 45 year 
economic life, however, as a result of the commissioning of Stage 4, 
the current life of mine is 20 years and as such the useful economic 
life of the Sukari plant and equipment has been reduced to 20 years 
from 1 January 2014.
The impact of this change is shown below:
Depreciation expense for the year ended  
31 December 2014 (old basis) 5,843
Depreciation expense for the year ended  
31 December 2014 (new basis) 11,143
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining 
the financial statements of all the entities that comprise the 
consolidated entity, being the Company (the parent entity) and 
its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured 
entities) over which the Group has control, as defined in IFRS 10 
‘Consolidated financial statements’. Consistent accounting 
policies are employed in the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements include the information and 
results of each subsidiary from the date on which the Company 
obtains control and until such time as the Company ceases to 
control such entity. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany 
balances and transactions, and unrealised profits arising within the 
consolidated entity are eliminated in full.
Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”) is jointly owned by PGM and EMRA 
on a 50% equal basis. For accounting purposes, SGM is wholly 
consolidated within the Centamin group of companies reflecting 
the substance and economic reality of the Concession Agreement 
(see Note 21) and will therefore recognise a non‑controlling 
interest (“NCI”) for EMRA’s participation. Furthermore based on 
the requirements of the Concession Agreement, payments to NCI 
meet the definition of a liability and will be recorded in the income 
statement and statement of financial position (below profit after 
tax), as the EMRA profit share, on the date that a net production 
surplus becomes available. Payment made to EMRA pursuant to 
the provisions of the Concession Agreement is based on the net 
production surplus available as at 30 June, being SGM’s financial 
year end. Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, PGM solely 
funds SGM’s activities. PGM is also entitled to recover the following 
costs and expenses payable from sales revenue (excluding the 
royalty payable to the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) (a) all current 
operating expenses incurred and paid after the initial commercial 
production; (b) exploration costs, including those accumulated to 
the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% 
of total accumulated cost per annum); and (c) exploitation capital 
costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of 
commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated 
cost per annum).
EMRA is entitled to a share of 50% (except for, in accordance 
with the terms of the Concession Agreement, in the first four 
years where it shall be 40% for the first two years and 45% for 
the following two years) of SGM’s net production surplus (“EMRA 
Profit Share”) (defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty 
to Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) and recoverable costs). Based 
on the Company’s calculation there was no net profit share due 
to EMRA as at 31 December 2014, nor is any likely to be due as 
at 30 June 2015. Accordingly, no EMRA entitlement has been 
recognised to date. Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these 
provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a 
variable charge in the income statement (below profit after tax) of 
Centamin, which will lead to a reduction in the earnings per share.
Going concern 
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplate 
the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the 
normal course of operations. 
The Group meets its day‑to‑day working capital requirements 
through existing cash resources, as discussed in Note 20, during 
2012 the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions. 
The first of these followed from a decision taken by EGPC to charge 
international, not local (subsidised) prices for the supply of Diesel 
Fuel Oil to Sukari, and the second arose as a result of a judgment 
of the Administrative Court in relation to, amongst other matters, 
the Company’s 160km

 exploitation lease. With regard to the first 
decision, the Company remains confident that in the event that it is 
required to continue to pay international prices, the mine at Sukari 
will remain commercially viable. Similarly, the Company remains 
confident that the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of 
the Administrative Court will ultimately be successful, although final 
resolution of the matter may take some time. 
With respect to the legal action, on 20 March 2013 the Supreme 
Administrative Court upheld the Company’s application to 
suspend the decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are 
considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance that normal 
operations would be able to continue during this process. Sukari 
has operated as usual throughout the period.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful in either or both 
of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are restricted to 
a reduced area, it is the directors’ belief that the Group will be able 
to continue as going concern. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group 
therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements. Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 109

Accounting policies 
Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which 
ensures that the resulting financial statements satisfy the concepts 
of relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance 
of the underlying transactions or other events is reported. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
The following significant policies have been adopted in the 
preparation and presentation of these financial statements:
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash 
equivalents are short‑term, highly‑liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity 
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial 
liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial 
liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. 
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
•	 it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it 
in the near term; or
•	 on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial 
instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short‑term profit taking; or
•	 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a 
hedging instrument. 
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may 
be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
•	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise 
arise; or
•	 the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets 
or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance 
with the Group’s documented risk management or investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided 
internally on that basis; or
•	 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded 
derivatives, and IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’ permits the entire combined contract (asset or 
liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains 
or losses arising on re‑measurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any 
interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘other 
gains and losses’ line item in the income statement.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, 
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date 
where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs except for those 
financial assets classified as at fair value through the profit or loss 
which are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments in subsidiaries are 
measured at cost in the Company financial statements. Other 
financial assets are loans and receivables. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets 
and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Available‑for‑sale financial assets (“AFS”)
Listed shares and listed redeemable notes held by the Group 
that are traded in an active market are classified as being AFS 
and are stated at fair value. The Group also has investments in 
unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but that are 
classified as AFS financial assets and stated at fair value (because 
the directors consider that fair value can be reliably measured). Fair 
value is determined in the manner described in Note 26. Gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated profits with the exception 
of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest 
method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, 
which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve 
is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss 
when the Group’s right to receive the dividends is established. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Financial assets continued
Available‑for‑sale financial assets (“AFS”) continued
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign 
currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at 
the spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange 
gains and losses that are recognised in profit or loss are 
determined based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. 
Other foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method 
less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate except for short‑term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, 
are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. 
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence 
that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset the estimated future cash flows 
of the investment have been impacted. For financial assets carried 
at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the 
impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced 
through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable 
is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying 
amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
With the exception of available‑for‑sale equity instruments, if, in a 
subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the 
carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is 
reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have 
been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of available‑for‑sale equity instruments, any subsequent 
increase in fair value after an impairment loss is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Derecognition of financial assets 
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or 
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the 
Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and 
an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a 
transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received.
Employee benefits 
A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in 
respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and 
sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and 
they are capable of being measured reliably.
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits expected 
to be settled within twelve months, are measured at their nominal 
values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of 
settlement. Liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits 
which are not expected to be settled within twelve months are 
measured as the present value of the estimated future cash flows to 
be made by the consolidated entity in respect of services provided 
by employees up to reporting date.
Superannuation
The Company contributes to, but does not participate in, 
compulsory superannuation funds (defined contribution schemes) 
on behalf of the employees and directors in respect of salaries and 
directors’ fees paid. Contributions are charged against income as 
they are made.
Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each 
separate area of interest are recognised as an exploration and 
evaluation asset in the year in which they are incurred where the 
following conditions are satisfied:
a) the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
b) at least one of the following conditions is also met:
i) the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected 
to be recouped through successful development and 
exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; 
or
ii) exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest 
have not at the reporting date reached a stage which 
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or 
otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active 
and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of 
interest are continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured at cost 
and include acquisition of rights to explore, studies, exploration 
drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities. General 
and administrative costs are only included in the measurement of 
exploration and evaluation costs where they are related directly to 
operational activities in a particular area of interest.  
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 111
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when 
facts and circumstances (as defined in IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and 
evaluation of mineral resources’) suggest that the carrying amount 
of exploration and evaluation assets may exceed its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount of the exploration and evaluation 
assets (or the cash‑generating unit(s) to which it has been allocated, 
being no larger than the relevant area of interest) is estimated to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where an 
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the 
asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years.
Where a decision is made to proceed with development in 
respect of a particular area of interest, the relevant exploration 
and evaluation asset is tested for impairment, reclassified to mine 
development properties, and then amortised over the life of the 
reserves associated with the area of interest once mining operations 
have commenced.
Mine development expenditure is recognised at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. When 
commercial production in an area of interest has commenced, 
the associated costs are amortised over the estimated economic life 
of the mine on a units of production basis.
Changes in factors such as estimates of proved and probable 
reserves that affect unit of production calculations are dealt with 
on a prospective basis.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group entity are 
presented in its functional currency being the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the 
results and financial position of each entity are expressed in 
United States dollars, which is the functional currency of the 
Group and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial 
statements except for the UK subsidiaries which are denominated 
in Great British pounds and the Australian subsidiaries which are 
denominated in Australian dollars. 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions. At each reporting date, monetary items denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at 
the reporting date. Non‑monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non‑monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Costs including an appropriate portion of fixed and variable 
overhead expenses are assigned to inventory on hand by the 
method appropriate to each particular class of inventory, with 
the majority being valued on a weighted average cost basis. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make 
the sale.
Ore stockpiles, gold in circuit and bullion are valued applying 
absorption costing.
Interests in joint ventures 
The Group applies IFRS 11 to joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 
investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint 
operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights 
and obligations each investor. Joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method. In relation to its interests in joint 
operations, the Group recognises its share of assets and liabilities; 
revenue from the sale of its share of the output; and its share 
of expenses.
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin group of 
companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see Note 21).
Leased assets 
Leased assets are classified as finance leases when the terms of 
the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on 
a straight‑line basis over the lease term, except where other 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which 
economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent 
rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) 
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment. Plant and equipment will include capitalised 
development expenditure. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the item as well as the estimated 
cost of abandonment. In the event that settlement of all or part 
of the purchase consideration is deferred, cost is determined by 
discounting the amounts payable in the future to their present 
value as at the date of acquisition. Subsequent costs are included 
in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced 
part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged 
to the income statement during the financial period in which they 
are incurred. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes 
the estimated restoration costs associated with the asset.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment. Depreciation is 
calculated on a straight‑line basis so as to write off the net cost or 
other revalued amount of each asset over its expected useful life to 
its estimated residual value. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) continued
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method 
are reviewed at the end of each annual financial period, with the 
effect of any changes recognised on a prospective basis.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of 
depreciation:
Plant and equipment  2 – 20 years 
Office equipment   3 – 7 years 
Mining equipment   2 – 13 years 
Buildings    4 – 20 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Mine development properties 
Where mining of a mineral resource has commenced, the 
accumulated costs are transferred from exploration and evaluation 
assets to mine development properties.
Amortisation is first charged to new mine development ventures 
from the date of first commercial production. Amortisation of 
mine properties is on a unit of production basis resulting in an 
amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the proved 
and probable ore reserves. The unit of production can be on a 
tonnes or an ounce depleted basis.
Capitalised underground development costs incurred to enable 
access to specific ore blocks or areas of the underground mine, and 
which only provide an economic benefit over the period of mining 
that ore block or area, are depreciated on a units of production 
basis, whereby the denominator is estimated ounces of gold in 
proven and probable reserves within that ore block or area where 
it is considered probable that those resources will be extracted 
economically.
Stripping activity assets 
The Group defers stripping costs incurred (removal of mine waste 
materials which provide improved access to further quantities of 
material that will be mined in future periods). This waste removal 
activity is known as “stripping”. There can be two benefits accruing 
to the entity from the stripping activity:
•	 usable ore that can be used to produce inventory; and
•	 improved access to further quantities of material that will be 
mined in future periods.
The costs of stripping activity to be accounted for in accordance 
with the principles of IAS 2 ‘Inventories’ to the extent that the 
benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory 
produced. The costs of stripping activity which provides a benefit in 
the form of improved access to ore is recognised as a non‑current 
“stripping activity asset” where the following criteria are met:
a) it is probable that the future economic benefit (improved access 
to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to 
the entity;
b) the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which 
access has been improved; and
c) the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that 
component can be measured reliably.
When the costs of the stripping activity asset and the inventory 
produced are not separately identifiable, production stripping costs 
are allocated between the inventory produced and the stripping 
activity asset by using an allocation basis that is based on a relevant 
production measure. A stripping activity asset is accounted for 
as an addition to, or as an enhancement of, an existing asset and 
classified as tangible or intangible according to the nature of the 
existing asset of which it forms part. A stripping activity asset is 
initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost or its 
revalued amount less depreciation or amortisation and impairment 
losses. A stripping activity asset is depreciated or amortised on 
a systematic basis, over the expected useful life of the identified 
component of the ore body that becomes more accessible as 
a result of the stripping activity. The stripping activity asset is 
depreciated using a units of production method based on the 
total ounces to be produced over the life of the component of the 
ore body.
Deferred stripping costs are included in “stripping assets”, within 
tangible assets. These form part of the total investment in the 
relevant cash‑generating unit, which is reviewed for impairment if 
events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is 
included in operating costs.
Impairment of assets (other than exploration  
and evaluation and financial assets) 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely 
independent cash inflows (cash‑generating units).
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value loss costs to sell and 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‑tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of 
future flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of a cash‑generating unit is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
cash‑generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. Where 
an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount 
of the cash‑generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the cash‑generating unit in prior years.  
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 113
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, 
in which case the reversal of an impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for goods and services in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales‑related taxes.
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when 
the Group has passed the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the mineral production to the buyer, it is probable that economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group, 
the sales price can be measured reliably, and the Group has no 
significant continuing involvement and the costs incurred or to be 
incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. 
This is when insurance risk has passed to the buyer and the goods 
have been collected at the agreed location.
Where the terms of the executed sales agreement allow for 
an adjustment to the sales price based on a survey of the 
mineral production by the buyer (for instance an assay for gold 
content), recognition of the revenue from the sale of mineral 
production is based on the most recently determined estimate 
of product specifications.
Pre‑production revenues 
Income derived by the entity prior to the date of commercial 
production is offset against the expenditure capitalised and carried 
in the consolidated statement of financial position. All revenues 
recognised after commencement of commercial production are 
recognised in accordance with the revenue policy stated above. 
The commencement date of commercial production is determined 
when stable and sustained production capacity has been achieved.
Production royalty 
The Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) is entitled to a royalty of 3% 
of net sales revenue (revenue net of freight and refining costs) 
as defined from the sale of gold and associated minerals from 
the Sukari Project. This royalty is calculated and recognised on 
receipt of the final certificate of analysis document received from 
the refinery. Due to its nature, this royalty is not recognised in cost 
of sales but rather in other operating costs.
Other income 
Interest income 
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can 
be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, 
by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of businesses as defined by IFRS 3 are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the 
date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition‑related costs are recognised in profit or 
loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes 
any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition‑date fair value. 
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the 
cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period 
adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability 
are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 either in profit or 
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are 
not re‑measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for 
within equity.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously‑held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to 
fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains 
control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the 
acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
•	 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to 
employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ and IAS 19 ‘Employee 
benefits’ respectively;
•	 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by 
the Group of an acquiree’s share‑based payment awards are 
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share‑based payment’; 
and
•	 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in 
accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non‑current assets held for sale’.
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations are measured 
in accordance with that Standard. If the initial accounting for a 
business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting 
period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities 
are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, 
would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Business combinations continued
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition 
to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts 
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is 
subject to a maximum of one year.
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 
control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in 
these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, 
except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which 
case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non‑current 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations’.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried 
in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for 
post‑acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets 
of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long‑term interests that, in 
substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) 
are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is 
recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of 
that investment.
Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost 
of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, 
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the relevant associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any 
objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. 
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate 
and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share 
of profit/(loss) of associates in the income statement.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are 
recognised in the income statement.
Share‑based payments 
Equity settled share‑based payments with employees and others 
providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instrument at grant date. Fair value is measured by the use 
of the Black Scholes model. Where share‑based payments are 
subject to market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of 
a Monte‑Carlo simulation. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity settled share‑based payments is expensed over 
the vesting period, based on the consolidated entity’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest.
Equity settled share‑based transactions with other parties are 
measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, 
except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which 
case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the 
counterparty renders the service. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is 
recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
•	 including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
•	 excluding the impact of any service and non‑market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability and 
remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time 
period); and
•	 including the impact of any non‑vesting conditions (for example, 
the requirement for employees to save or holding shares for a 
specific period of time).
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new 
shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) 
and share premium.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‑transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Further details 
on how the fair value of equity settled share‑based transactions has 
been determined can be found in Note 27. At each reporting date, 
the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining 
vesting period, with corresponding adjustment to the equity settled 
employee benefits reserve.
Issued capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company or other members of the consolidated Group 
purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration 
paid is deducted from the total shareholders’ equity of the 
Group and/or of the Company as treasury shares until they are 
cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, 
any consideration received is included in shareholders’ equity of the 
Group and/or the Company.

Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. 
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income because of items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which those deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it 
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such investments and 
interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the 
benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled 
or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner 
in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Restoration and rehabilitation
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation is recognised when 
there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
exploration, development and production activities undertaken, 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation, and the amount of the provision can be 
measured reliably. The estimated future obligations include the 
costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and 
monitoring of the affected areas. The provision for future restoration 
costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure 
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date. 
Future restoration costs are reviewed annually and any changes in 
the estimate are reflected in the present value of the restoration 
provision at each reporting date.
The initial estimate of the restoration and rehabilitation provision 
relating to exploration, development and mining production 
activities is capitalised into the cost of the related asset and 
amortised on the same basis as the related asset, unless the present 
obligation arises from the production of the inventory in the period, 
in which case the amount is included in the cost of production for 
the period. Changes in the estimate of the provision of restoration 
and rehabilitation are treated in the same manner, except that 
the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is 
recognised as a finance cost rather than being capitalised into 
the cost of the related asset.
4. Critical accounting judgments 
Critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies 
The following are the critical judgments that management has 
made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies 
and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements:
Management has discussed its critical accounting judgments 
and associated disclosures with the Company’s Audit and 
Risk Committee. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

4. Critical accounting judgments continued
Impairment of assets (other than exploration and evaluation 
and financial assets) 
IFRS requires management to test for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of 
a finite lived asset may not be recoverable. Management have 
concluded that there is no indication that an impairment exists, 
nor have any indicators arisen after the reporting period and are 
therefore not required to perform a full impairment review under 
IAS 36.
In making its assessment as to the possibility of whether 
impairments losses having arisen, Management considered the 
following indications:
•	 internal sources of information;
•	 external sources of information; 
•	 litigation;
•	 the key assumptions applied in the 31 December 2013 
impairment review;
•	 forecast gold prices;
•	 discount rate;
•	 production volumes;
•	 reserves and resources report; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
Litigation
The Group exercises judgment in measuring and recognising 
provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related 
to pending litigation, as well as other contingent liabilities 
(see Note 20 to the financial statements). Judgment is necessary 
in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, 
or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the 
financial settlement.
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which 
could affect its ability to operate the mine at Sukari in the manner 
in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability. 
The details of this litigation, which relate to the loss of the Egyptian 
national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the Group to 
operate outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the Administrative 
Court of first instance to be the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, 
are given in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most 
recently filed Annual Information Form (“AIF”) which is available 
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although it is possible to quantify 
the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not currently 
possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting 
operations to an area of 3km
2
.
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, including 
the making of formal legal appeals and, although their resolution 
may take some time, management remain confident that a 
satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved. In the meantime, 
however, the Group is continuing to pay international prices for 
diesel fuel oil. With respect to the Administrative Court ruling, 
on 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the 
Company’s application to suspend this decision until the merits of 
the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing 
assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during 
this process.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful in either or both 
of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are restricted 
to a reduced area, it is management’s belief that the Group will be 
able to continue as going concern. 
Recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation  
and development expenditure 
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation 
expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure being 
capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered 
likely to be recoverable through future extraction activity or sale 
or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which 
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves.
This policy requires management to make certain estimates and 
assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in particular 
whether the Group will proceed with development based on 
existence of reserves or whether an economically viable extraction 
operation can be established. Such estimates and assumptions 
may change from period to period as new information becomes 
available. If, subsequent to the exploration and evaluation 
expenditure being capitalised, a judgment is made that recovery 
of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned, 
the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the 
income statement.
As described in Note 13 to the financial statements, in February 
2015, the Company gave formal notice to Alecto Minerals plc 
(”Alecto”) terminating the joint venture agreement entered into 
between the Company and Centamin in September 2013 with 
regards to the development of Alecto’s licences in Ethiopia. 
Centamin’s rights in the Wayu Boda and Aysid Metekel licences 
have reverted back to Alecto, such that Alecto will hold 100% 
of the licences and will assume responsibility for the ongoing 
commitments in respect of the licences on termination of the 
joint venture and have thus written off all expenditure incurred to 
date including the acquisition costs in relation to those licences, 
amounting to US$2,327,778.
Going concern 
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting Council 
(“FRC”) the directors of UK listed companies are required to 
consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate basis 
of preparation of financial statements.
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by management, 
in which any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on 
which cash flow forecast is based, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Key 
assumptions under‑pinning this forecast include:
•	 litigation as discussed in Note 20 to the financial statements;
•	 forecast gold price;
•	 production volumes; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2014 have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis, 
which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of 
liabilities during the normal course of operations, in preparing 
the financial statements.

SGM is consolidated within the Centamin Group of companies, 
reflecting the substance and economic reality of the Concession 
Agreement (see Note 21 to the financial statements).
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, 
and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs 
The Group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and restore 
mines and processing sites at the end of their producing lives to 
a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. The provision 
has been calculated taking into account the estimated future 
obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal 
of facilities, restoration and monitoring of the affected areas. 
The provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the 
present value of the expenditure required to settle the restoration 
obligation at the reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates 
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions 
on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount rates and 
production costs for future cash flows. It also involves assessment 
and judgment of complex geological models. The economic, 
geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may 
change from period to period. Changes in ore reserves affect the 
carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, 
provision for rehabilitation assets and deferred taxes. Ore reserves 
are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation 
charged to the statement of comprehensive income and the 
calculation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari are partly 
based on estimates regarding future resource and reserve growth. 
It is the opinion of management and directors that these estimates 
are both realistic and conservative, based on current information. 
However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and 
exploration drilling for further reserve definition, the life of this part 
of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of 
this growth will not materialise with a consequent negative impact 
on current production forecasts which affect the unit of production 
used in depreciation calculations.
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs 
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs 
at the Sukari mine is based on reserve estimates. Management 
and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and 
conservative, based on current information. However, as the mine 
relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling 
for further reserve definition, the estimated reserves may change 
with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of 
capitalised underground mine development.

Exceptional items

should be disclosed separately if the consolidated financial statements are to fairly present the financial position and underlying business 
performance. In order to allow a better understanding of the financial information presented within the consolidated financial statements, 
and specifically the Group’s underlying business performance, the effect of exceptional items are shown below.

In January 2012 the Company received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able to continue supplying Diesel 
Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices. It is understood that the reason that this letter was issued was that 
Chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). It is understood that 
EGPC itself took the decision to issue this instruction because it had received legal advice from the Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State (an internal government advisory department) that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt were not 
entitled to such subsidies. In addition, the Company during the year received a demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies 
received in the period from late 2009 through to January 2012, amounting to some US$60 million (EGP403 million).
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State) and in consequence in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, 
the Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is every prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and 
in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the Group has since January 2012 advanced funds to its fuel supplier, Chevron, based on the 
international price for diesel.
As at the date of the financial statements, no final decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter.
Furthermore, the Group remains of the view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to 
recover funds advanced thus far should the court proceeding be concluded in its favour. However, management recognises the practical 
difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this reason has, fully provided against the prepayment of 
US$165.7 million, as an exceptional item, of which US$68.7 million was provided for during 2014 as follows:
a) a US$62.5 million increase in cost of sales (2013: US$51.0 million increase);
b) a US$0.2 million increase in stores inventories (2013: US$1.7 million increase);
c) a US$1.0 million decrease in mining stockpiles and ore in circuit (2013: US$2.1 million increase); and
d) a US$7.0 million increase in property, plant and equipment (capital WIP) (2013: US$0.8 million increase).
This has resulted in a net charge of US$62.5 million in the profit and loss. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

In Australia, Centamin Egypt Limited and Pharaoh Gold Mines NL have elected to form a tax‑consolidated group and therefore are treated 
as a single entity for Australian income tax purposes. Pharaoh Gold Mines NL has elected into the “Branch Profits Exemption” whereby 
foreign branch income will generally not be subject to Australian income tax.
In Egypt, Centamin has entered into a concession agreement that provides that the income generated by Sukari Gold Mining Company’s 
activities is granted a long‑term tax exemption from all taxes imposed in Egypt.
The tax expense for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows:

Tax consolidation
Relevance of tax consolidation to the consolidated entity 
Companies within the Group’s wholly‑owned Australian resident entities formed a tax‑consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2003. 
The head entity within the tax‑consolidated group is Centamin Egypt Limited. The members of the tax‑consolidated group are identified in 
Note 21.  
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 121
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Nature of tax funding arrangements and tax sharing agreements 
Entities within the tax‑consolidated group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax‑sharing agreement with the head 
entity. Under the terms of the tax‑funding agreement, Centamin Egypt Limited and each of the entities in the tax‑consolidated group 
has agreed to pay a tax‑equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax liability or current tax asset of the entity. 
Such amounts are reflected in amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax‑consolidated group. 
The tax‑sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax‑consolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation 
of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been 
recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax‑sharing agreement is 
considered remote.

Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost.
The average age of the receivables is 21 days (2013: 18 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. There are no trade receivables 
past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been recognised. Of the trade receivables 
balance, the gold sales debtor is all receivable from Johnson Matthey of Canada. The amount due has been received subsequent to year 
end and was considered to be fully recoverable.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

During the prior year, as a result of the decline in the gold price, the Group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of the property, 
plant and equipment. The review did not lead to a recognition of an impairment loss. The discount rate used in measuring value in use 
was 12% per annum and the assumed average gold price was US$1,342 per ounce. No impairment review was performed in 2014 as no 
indicators of impairment were identified. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

The exploration and evaluation asset relates to the drilling, geological exploration and sampling of potential ore reserves. During the first 
half of the year the Group acquired a 100% interest in Ampella Mining Limited for a total consideration (through the issue of shares in 
Centamin plc) of US$48.5 million including a cash component of US$9.3 million and additional assets of US$1.6 million. The transaction 
has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, using fair value measurement principles, with exploration rights covering an area of 
2,350km
2
, recorded as an addition to mineral properties in the period. The tenements collectively known as the Batie West permits are 
Danhal, Donko, Dounkou, Gbingbina, Mabera, Tiopolo, Niorka, Bottara, Kaldera, Kpere Batie, Timboura and Kpere. 
In February 2015 the Company gave formal notice to Alecto Minerals plc (the AIM quoted mineral exploration company) terminating the 
joint venture agreement dated September 2013, with regards to the development of Alecto’s licences in Ethiopia.
Centamin’s rights in the Wayu Boda and Aysid Metekel licences have reverted back to Alecto, such that Alecto will hold 100% of the 
licences and will assume responsibility for the ongoing commitments in respect of the licences on termination of the joint venture and have 
thus written off all expenditure incurred to date including the acquisition costs in relation to those licences.

The available‑for‑sale financial asset at period end relates to a 11.34% (2013: 12.62%) equity interest in Nyota Minerals Limited (“Nyota”), 
a listed public company. During the year, management made the decision to sell its interest in Nyota and the financial asset has now been 
classed as a current asset.
In 2013, as a result of the prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment in Nyota, an impairment loss has been recognised and 
the cumulative investments revaluation reserve balance within the accumulated profit reserve has been transferred to the statement of

In the prior year the interest in associate related to the Group’s 39.64% equity interest in Sahar Minerals Limited (“Sahar”), of which 33% 
was acquired in July 2011, 3% acquired in December 2012, and a further 4% acquired in September 2013. The associate holds exploration 
rights and continues to explore, however, management took the decision to write off the costs associated with the interest held in Sahar 
due to Sahar’s intention to put all assets into care and maintenance as a result of funding requirements.

(1) Employee benefits relate to annual, sick and long service leave entitlements. The current provision for employee benefits as at 31 December 2014 includes 
US$150,493 (31 December 2013: US$139,111) of annual leave entitlements. 
(2) The provision for restoration and rehabilitation represents the present value of the directors’ best estimate of the future outflow of economic benefits that 
will be required to remove the facilities and restore the affected areas at the Group’s sites discounted by 12% (2013: 7%). This estimate has been made on 
the basis of benchmark assessments of restoration works required following mine closure and after taking into account the projected area to be disturbed 
over the life of the mine, being 20 years. A detailed review was undertaken as at 31 December 2014 as a result of the commissioning of Stage 4 which has 
resulted in the US$4,623,470 decrease in the provision. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

20. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Contingent liabilities
Fuel supply
In January 2012, the Group received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would only be able to supply Diesel Fuel Oil 
(“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at international prices rather than at local subsidised prices, which had the effect of adding approximately 
US$150 per ounce to the cost of production. It is understood that the reason that this letter was issued was that Chevron had received a 
letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). It is further understood that EGPC itself issued 
this instruction because it had received legal advice from the Legal Advice Department of the Council of State (an internal government 
advisory department) that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt were not entitled to such subsidies. In November, 
the Group received a further demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received during the period from late 2009 through 
to January 2012, amounting to EGP403 million (approximately US$60.5 million at current exchange rates).
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by the Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State) and in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the Group believes that 
its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is a good prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the 
continuation of supply whilst the matter is resolved, the Group has since January 2012 advanced funds to its fuel supplier, Chevron, based 
on the international price for fuel.
As at the date of this document, no decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter. The Group remains of the view that an 
instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to recover funds advanced thus far should the court 
proceeding be successfully concluded. However, management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from 
the government and for this reason has fully provided against the prepayment of US$97.0 million, as an exceptional item. Refer to Note 6 
of the accompanying financial statements for further details on the impact of this exceptional provision on the Group’s results for 2014. 
No provision has been made in respect of the historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based on legal advice, the Company believes 
that the prospects of a court finding in its favour in relation to this matter remain very strong.
Concession Agreement court case 
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, amongst others, 
an independent member of the previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the agreement that confers on the 
Group rights to operate in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, was entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and Centamin’s wholly‑owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”), and was 
approved by the People’s Assembly as Law 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient evidence had 
been submitted to court in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation lease” between PGM and EMRA had received approval 
from the relevant minister as required by the terms of the Concession Agreement. Accordingly, the court found that the exploitation lease 
in respect of the area of 160km
2
 was not valid although it stated that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. 
Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km
2
 exploitation lease 
was approved by the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an executed original document was not supplied to 
the court.
Upon notification of the judgment the Group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine at Sukari. These 
included lodging a formal appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 2012. In addition, in conjunction with the 
formal appeal the Group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to suspend the initial decision until such time as the court was able 
to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. On 20 March 2013 the court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision 
and providing assurance that normal operations would be able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

20. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets continued
Contingent liabilities continued
Concession Agreement court case continued
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal was lodged, supporting 
the Group’s view in this matter. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly 
thereafter publicly indicated that, in his view, the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and that the “exploitation” lease was valid. 
The Minister of Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that Centamin brings to the country. The Company 
believes this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further investment in 
the Egyptian mining industry.
The Company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude, although it is aware of the potential for the process in Egypt to be 
lengthy. The Company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from a number of leading Egyptian law firms who have 
confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km² lease. It therefore remains of the view that the 
appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately be successful. In the event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the 
merits of the case put forward by the Group, the operations at Sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the Group’s operation 
exceeds the exploitation lease area of 3km² referred to in the original court decision.
The Company remains confident that normal operations at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal case is heard.
Contingent assets
There were no contingent assets at year end (31 December 2013: nil).

Through its wholly owned subsidiary, PGM, the Company entered into the Concession Agreement with EMRA and the Arab Republic of 
Egypt granting PGM and EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals in specific concession areas 
located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Concession Agreement came into effect under Egyptian law on 13 June 1995.
In 2005 PGM, together with EMRA, were granted an exploitation lease over 160km
2
 surrounding the Sukari Project site. The exploitation 
lease was signed by PGM, EMRA and the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and gives tenure for a period of 30 years, commencing 24 May 
2005 and extendable by PGM for an additional 30 years upon PGM providing reasonable commercial justification.
In 2006 SGM was incorporated under the laws of Egypt. SGM was formed to conduct exploration, development, exploitation and 
marketing operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement. Responsibility for the day‑to‑day management of the project 
rests with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM.
The fiscal terms of the Concession Agreement require that PGM solely funds SGM. PGM is however entitled to recover from sales revenue 
recoverable costs, as defined in the Concession Agreement. EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production surplus or profit share 
(defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). As at 31 December 2014, PGM has not recovered 
its cost and accordingly, no EMRA entitlement has been recognised to date, It is anticipated that the first payment to EMRA will become 
payable during 2017. Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a 
variable charge in the income statement.
The Concession Agreement grants certain tax exemptions, including the following:
•	 from 1 April 2010, being the date of commercial production, the Sukari Project is entitled to a 15 year exemption from any taxes 
imposed by the Egyptian government on the revenues generated from the Sukari Project. PGM and EMRA intend that SGM will in due 
course file an application to extend the tax‑free period for a further 15 years. The extension of the tax‑free period requires that there 
has been no tax problems or disputes in the initial period and that certain activities in new remote areas have been planned and agreed 
by all parties;
•	 PGM and SGM are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of machinery, equipment and consumable 
items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at the Sukari Project. The exemption shall only apply if there is no 
local substitution with the same or similar quality to the imported machinery, equipment or consumables. Such exemption will also be 
granted if the local substitution is more than 10% more expensive than the imported machinery, equipment or consumables after the 
additional of the insurance and transportation costs;
•	 PGM, EMRA and SGM and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export of gold and associated 
minerals produced from the Sukari Project;
•	 PGM at all times is free to transfer in US$ or other freely convertible foreign currency any cash of PGM representing its share of net 
proceeds and recovery of costs, without any Egyptian government limitation, tax or duty;
•	 PGM’s contractors and sub‑contractors are entitled to import machinery. Equipment and consumable items under the “Temporary 
Release System” which provided exemption from Egyptian customs duty; and
•	 legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed and movable 
assets remains with PGM and SGM. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

The Audit and Risk Committee and the external auditor have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditor’s objectivity 
and independence could be compromised. These safeguards include the implementation of a policy on the use of the external auditor 
for non‑audit related services.
Where it is deemed that the work to be undertaken is of a nature that is generally considered reasonable to be completed by the auditor 
of the Company for sound commercial and practical reasons, the conduct of such work will be permissible provided that it has been 
pre‑approved. All these services are also subject to a predefined fee limit. Any work performed in excess of this limit must be approved 
by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The amounts paid in 2014 were paid to our current external auditors and the amounts paid in 2013 were paid to our previous 
external auditors.

26. Financial instruments 
(a) Group risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the cash and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from the 
previous financial period.
The Group has no debt and thus is not geared at year end or in the prior year. The capital structure consists of cash and cash equivalents 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital and reserves as disclosed in Notes 17 and 18. The Group 
operates in Australia, Jersey, Egypt, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia. None of the Group’s entities are subject to externally 
imposed capital requirements.
The Group utilises inflows of funds toward the ongoing exploration and development of the Sukari Gold Project in Egypt, and the 
exploration projects in Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.

(b) Financial risk management and objectives 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential risk 
adverse effects and ensure that net cash flows are sufficient to support the delivery of the Group’s financial targets whilst protecting future 
financial security. The Group continually monitors and tests its forecast financial position against these objectives.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market; commodity; credit; liquidity; foreign exchange; and interest rate. 
These risks are managed under Board approved directives through the Audit and Risk Committee. The Group’s principal financial 
instruments comprise interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Other financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables, 
which arise directly from operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, Group policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
(c) Market risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the Australian dollar, Great British pound and Egyptian pound. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions 
and recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. Revenue is received 
in United States dollars. The risk is measured by regularly monitoring, forecasting and performing sensitivity analyses on the Group’s 
financial position.
Financial instruments denominated in Great British pound, Australian dollar and Egyptian pound are as follows:

US$/EGP decrease by 10%      102 (3,003)  —  — 
The Group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased at the end of the current period mainly due to the decrease in foreign currency 
cash holdings in Australian dollars and a corresponding increase in US dollar cash holdings.
The Group has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign 
currency liabilities. The Company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency holdings in line with 
underlying requirements and commitments.
(d) Commodity price risk 
The Group’s future revenue forecasts are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, in particular gold prices. The Group has not entered 
into forward gold hedging contracts. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

(e) Interest rate risk 
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from cash and short‑term deposits and is not considered to be a material risk due to the 
short‑term nature of these financial instruments. Cash deposits are placed on term period of no more than 30 days at a time.
The financial instruments exposed to interest rate risk and the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk as at balance date were as follows:

(f) Liquidity risk 
The Group’s liquidity position is managed to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet its financial commitments in a timely and 
cost effective manner.
Ultimate responsibility or liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who has established an appropriate management 
framework for the management of the Group’s funding requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash 
reserves and management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow. The tables above reflect a 
balanced view of cash inflows and outflows and shows the implied risk based on those values. Trade payables and other financial liabilities 
originate from the financing of assets used in the Group’s ongoing operations. These assets are considered in the Group’s overall liquidity 
risk. Management continually reviews the Group liquidity position including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position 
and maintain appropriate liquidity levels.

(g) Credit risk 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral or other security 
where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group measures credit risk on a fair value 
basis. The Group’s credit risk is concentrated on one entity, but the Group has good credit checks on customers and none of the trade 
receivables from the customer has been past due, nor have they been impaired. Also, the cash balances held in Australian dollars are 
held with a financial institution with a high credit rating. The gross carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained.
(h) Fair value
The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements represents their respective fair values, 
principally as a consequence of the short‑term maturity thereof.
(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position 
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
•	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•	 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

27. Share‑based payments 
Executive Directors Loan Funded Share Plan (“EDLFSP”) and Employee Loan Funded Share Plan (“ELFSP”)
Shares were issued to executive directors under the EDLFSP 2011 and employees under the ELFSP as part of their remuneration package. 
Under the terms of the EDLFSP and ELFSP , the Company has provided a limited recourse and interest free loan to certain employees of 
the Company for the purpose of acquiring the New Shares (the “Loan”). The purchase of the shares has been funded by the Loan and 
the shares will not vest until certain performance conditions are met. In the event the performance conditions are not met, or the shares 
are forfeited by the participant, the Company can either re‑acquire the shares or direct the trustee to sell them on, offsetting the proceeds 
against the outstanding loan amount and waiving the remainder of the Loan. Subject to performance conditions and time‑based hurdles 
being met, the Loan will be repayable by the relevant employee in full on the earlier of the termination date of the Loan (three years from 
the date of issue) or the date on which the shares are disposed of. No options have been offered under the EDLFSP and ELFSP in 2012, 
2013 or 2014.
2011 Employee Option Scheme (“2011 EOS”)
Options were issued under the 2011 EOS made in accordance with thresholds set in plans approved by shareholders at the Extraordinary 
General Meeting of Shareholders on 14 December 2011. All employees of the Group other than directors are able to participate in the 
2011 EOS. The Committee shall select from time to time from such group the actual participants in the 2011 EOS. There are no current 
plans for options to be granted under the 2011 EOS.
The 2011 EOS provides for employees (other than directors) to receive up to an annual aggregate of options over ordinary shares, with an 
exercise price calculated by either the volume weighted average closing price of ordinary shares sold on an exchange for the five trading 
days most recently preceding the day as at which the market value is calculated or if market value is required to be determined in another 
manner or another amount for the purposes of tax legislation in another jurisdiction, then the value is so determined at the date of issue. 
The ability to exercise the options is conditional on the Group achieving its performance hurdles. For the initial grants to be made under 
the 2011 EOS it is the current intention that the performance criteria will be the TSR performance criteria as detailed in the 2011 Executive 
LFSP . Further details of the performance conditions can be found in the remuneration report. There are no outstanding awards under this 
plan and there is no current intention to use the plan.
Under the 2011 EOS the exercise price of the options is denominated in Great British pounds. All options expire on the earlier of their 
expiry date or termination of the individual’s employment.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (“DBSP”)
During the year the Company implemented a DBSP which is a long‑term share incentive arrangement for senior management (but not 
executive directors) and other employees (participants).
Under the DBSP , the Board shall, at its absolute discretion, require such eligible participants to defer up to one hundred per cent (100%) 
of their bonus opportunity and such eligible participants shall not be paid their deferred bonus in cash but shall instead be granted a 
Deferred Bonus Award over such number of shares provided that the eligible participant remains in employment on the date of grant 
(effectively the vesting date). The award of the deferred shares will not have any performance criteria attached. They will however be 
subject to a service period.  
Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 137
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
On 4 June 2013, the Group offered to both the beneficiaries of the shares awarded under the ELFSP and to the majority of the 
beneficiaries of the options granted under the EOS the choice to replace their awards and options with awards under the DBSP . 
The Group has accounted for this change as modifications to the share‑based payment plans and will be recognising the incremental fair 
value granted, measured in accordance with IFRS 2, by this replacement over the vesting period of the new DBSP awards.
Under this offer, each participant has been granted a number of awards under the DBSP equivalent to the number of shares or options 
held under the ELFSP and EOS respectively. Such DBSP awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the DBSP and shall 
ordinarily vest in three equal tranches on the anniversary of the grant date, conditional upon the continued employment with the Group. 
All offers made to participants were accepted.
The total share‑based payment charge relating to Centamin plc shares for the year is split as follows:
       31 December  31 December 
       2014  2013 
       US$’000  US$’000
2011 EOS        68 74 
LFSP        (15) 596 
DBSP        2,440 1,614 
       2,493 2,284 
No LFSP awards or EOS options were granted during the year.
The fair value of share‑based payments awarded under the LFSP and granted under the 2011 EOS were measured by the use of the Black 
Scholes model where share‑based payments have non‑market based performance conditions. Where share‑based payments are subject to 
market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of a Monte‑Carlo simulation. The Monte‑Carlo simulation has been used to model 
the Company’s share prices against the performance of the chosen comparator group and the FTSE 250 at the relevant vesting dates.

(3) The fair value of shares in the DBSP was calculated by using the closing share price on grant date, converted at the closing GBP:US$ foreign exchange rate 
on that day, no other factors were taken into account in determining the fair value.
(4) The incremental fair value of the shares awarded on 4 June 2013 under the DBSP was calculated by using the closing share price on grant date, converted 
at the closing GBP:US$ foreign exchange rate on that day less the fair value of the share‑based payments awarded under the ELFSP and EOS immediately 
prior to the grant under the DBSP . No other factors were taken into account in determining the fair value of the shares awarded under the DBSP . 
The fair value of the share‑based payments awarded under the LFSP and granted under the 2011 EOS was measured by the use of the Black Scholes 
model where share‑based payments have non‑market based performance conditions. Where share‑based payments are subject to market conditions, fair 
value was measured by the use of a Monte‑Carlo simulation. The Monte‑Carlo simulation has been used to model the Company’s share prices against the 
performance of the chosen comparator group and the FTSE 250 at the relevant vesting dates. The incremental fair value of the shares awarded on 4 June 
2014 under the DBSP were calculated by using the closing share price on grant date, converted at the closing GBP:US$ foreign exchange rate on that day. 
No other factors were taken into account in determining the fair value of the shares awarded under the DBSP .

Centamin announced its dividend policy on 16 May 2014 which is based on the financial condition of, and outlook for, the Company 
and its cash flow and financing needs. When determining the amount to be paid the Board will take into consideration the underlying 
profitability of the Company. Specifically, the Board aims to approve an annual dividend within the range of 15‑30% of the Company’s 
net cash flow after sustaining capital costs and following the payment of profit share due to the government of Egypt. The following 
dividends have been declared in respect to the financial year ended 31 December 2014:
Interim dividend

shareholders on the register on the Record Date of 5 September 2014. 
Final dividend
A final dividend of 1.99 US cents per share (US$0.0199) on Centamin plc ordinary shares (totalling approximately US$23 million) 
was declared on 23 March 2015. The final dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 will be paid on 29 May 2015 to 
shareholders on the register on the Record Date of 24 April 2015. The ex‑dividend date is 23 April 2015 for LSE listed shareholders and

cash cost per ounce
cash costs per ounce is a non‑GAAP 
financial measure. Cash cost per ounce is a 
measure of the average cost of producing 
an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing 
the operating costs in a period by the total 
gold production over the same period. 
Operating costs represent total operating 
costs less administrative expenses, 
royalties, depreciation and amortisation. 
Management uses this measure internally 
to better assess performance trends for 
the Company as a whole. The Company 
believes that, in addition to conventional 
measures prepared in accordance with 
GAAP , certain investors use such non‑GAAP 
information to evaluate the Company’s 
performance and ability to generate cash 
flow. The Company believes that these 
measures provide an alternative reflection 
of the Group’s performance for the current 
period and are an alternative indication 
of its expected performance in future 
periods. Cash costs is intended to provide 
additional information, does not have 
any standardised meaning prescribed by 
GAAP and should not be considered in 
isolation or as a substitute for measures 
of performance prepared in accordance 
with GAAP . This measure is not necessarily 
indicative of operating profit or cash flow 
from operations as determined under 
GAAP . Other companies may calculate 
these measures differently

EBITDA
EBITDA is a non‑GAAP financial measure, 
which excludes the following from profit 
before tax:
i) finance costs;
ii) finance income; and
iii) depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a 
valuable indicator of the Group’s ability to 
generate liquidity by producing operating 
cash flow to fund working capital needs and 
fund capital expenditures. EBITDA is also 
frequently used by investors and analysts 
for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is 
multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” 
that is based on an observed or inferred 
relationship between EBITDA and market 
values to determine the approximate total 
enterprise value of a company. EBITDA is 
intended to provide additional information 
to investors and analysts and does not 
have any standardised definition under 
IFRS and should not be considered in 
isolation or as a substitute for measures of 
performance prepared in accordance with 
IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash 
costs and income of financing activities 
and taxes, and therefore is not necessarily 
indicative of operating profit or cash flow 
from operations as determined under IFRS. 
Other companies may calculate EBITDA 
differently. The following table provides a 
reconciliation of EBITDA to profit for the 
year attributable to the Company

give a reasonable indication of continuity

be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is 
expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, 
“intends”, “targets”, “aims”, “anticipates” or “believes” or 
variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, 
or may be identified by statements to the effect that certain actions, 
events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “should”, “might” or 
“will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Forward‑looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and a variety of material factors, many of which are 
beyond the Company’s control which may cause the actual results, 
performance or achievements of Centamin, its subsidiaries and 
affiliated companies to be materially different from any future 
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by 
the forward‑looking statements. Readers are cautioned that

purposes than outlined in this document. Such factors include, 
among others, future price of gold; general business, economic, 
competitive, political and social uncertainties; the actual results 
of current exploration and development activities; conclusions 
of economic evaluations and studies; fluctuations in the value of 
the US dollar relative to the local currencies in the jurisdictions 
of the Company’s key projects; changes in project parameters as 
plans continue to be refined; possible variations of ore grade or 
projected recovery rates; accidents, labour disputes or slow‑downs 
and other risks of the mining industry; climatic conditions; political 
instability, insurrection or war, civil unrest or armed assault; labour 
force availability and turnover; delays in obtaining financing or 
governmental approvals or in the completion of exploration and 
development activities; as well as those factors referred to in the 
“principal risks” section of the strategic report. The reader is also 
cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhausted of the 
factors that may affect the Company’s forward‑looking statements.
Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors 
that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially 
from those described in forward‑looking statements, there may 
be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ 
from those anticipated, estimated or intended. Forward‑looking 
statements contained herein are made as of the date of this 
document and, except as required by applicable law, the Company 
disclaims any obligation to update any forward‑looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or results 
or otherwise. There can be no assurance that forward‑looking 
statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future 
events could differ materially from those anticipated in such 
statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance 
on forward‑looking statements.

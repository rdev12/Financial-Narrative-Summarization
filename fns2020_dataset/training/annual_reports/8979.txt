KAZAKHMYS AT A GLANCE
PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS
Kazakhmys Copper has 15 operating mines and 10 concentrators
which are spread across four regional units, Zhezkazgan, Balkhash,
Karaganda and East Region. The copper mines also produce
signiﬁcant quantities of silver, gold and zinc as by-products.
The grades of copper and mix of copper and by-products vary
signiﬁcantly from mine to mine.
The Group also has a Gold Division with two mines producing
gold with copper as a by-product.
There are copper smelters at Balkhash and Zhezkazgan, which
operate within a single smelting unit, receiving feed from the
concentrators and converting it to ﬁnished cathode. Kazakhmys
Copper has its own coal mines and power stations, which ensure
security and cost of power supply.
The gold by-product is sold in the form of bullion and silver in
the form of granules. These are produced at a precious metals
reﬁnery in Balkhash. Zinc is produced and sold as concentrate.
OUTPUT AND GROWTH PROJECTS
In 2009 the Group produced 320 kt of copper cathode from
32 MT of ore at an average grade of 1.18%. Output is likely to
remain steady over the next four years, as smaller mine extensions
offset declining grade and output at some of the more mature
mines, particularly in the Zhezkazgan Region. Production should
increase after that, as the Group has two substantial growth projects
and several medium-sized projects, which are equivalent to around
60% of current output.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Kazakhmys is one of the largest employers
in Kazakhstan with 60,000 employees and
Kazakhstan revenue represents 2.5% of
Kazakhstan GDP . The Group has a strong
commitment to corporate responsibility,
including investment in health and safety,
improving its environmental record and
the active support of local communities.
This is set out on pages 50 to 57.
OUR KEY OPERATIONS
Kazakhstan is the 9th largest country in
the world, similar in size to Western Europe.
Along with copper, Kazakhstan is rich in
a wide variety of resources, including oil
and gas, chrome, iron ore, alumina, uranium,
zinc, gold and silver. The country has a strong
track record in attracting Foreign Direct
Investment, which since independence
amounts to over $103 billion. Kazakhstan
was the ﬁrst country in the former Soviet
Union to receive an investment-grade
credit rating.
The natural resources of Kazakhstan, and
its proximity to the major global markets
of China, Europe and Russia, give the
country signiﬁcant strategic opportunities.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
POWER
Kazakhmys is the largest power provider
in Kazakhstan, producing over 13%
of national output. Within Kazakhmys
Copper there are three power stations
providing power to the copper facilities.
There is a separate Power Division
containing the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-ﬁred
power plant. Since February 2010 Ekibastuz
GRES-1 has been jointly owned with
Samruk. Three power stations provide
power to the copper facilities.
Ekibastuz GRES-1 is the biggest power
station in Kazakhstan and one of the
largest coal power plants in the world.
Five out of eight blocks at Ekibastuz
GRES-1 are currently operational and
between them have annual capacity
of 2,500 MW. The plant is undergoing
a major refurbishment to return it to
its installed capacity of 4,000 MW.
This will require around $1 billion of
capital investment over the next seven
years. Ownership of Ekibastuz GRES-1
ensures power supply for all our future
growth projects.
Maikuben West is an open cast coal mine,
producing 3.7 MT in 2009. It supplies
about 25% of the required coal for
Ekibastuz GRES-1, as well as supplying
coal to external customers.
ENRC
The Group owns 26% of ENRC PLC,
which was worth $4,879 million on
31 December 2009. 14.6% of the
holding was purchased in October 2007,
before ENRC listed on the London Stock
Exchange. The rest of the holding was
acquired between July and October 2008.
The holding was bought at a total cost of
$3,834 million. The investment in ENRC
diversiﬁes the Group’s earnings and
provides strategic options.
ENRC is a mining company with its
principal operations in Kazakhstan and
is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Kazchrome division is one of the
largest producers of ferrochrome in
the world. The iron ore division produces
and sells iron ore concentrate and pellets,
and the aluminium division trades alumina
and produces aluminium.
OTHER OPERATIONS
MKM
MKM, based in Hettstedt, Germany,
produces reﬁned copper products
and manufactures and sells a variety
of pre-ﬁnished and semi-ﬁnished copper
and copper alloy products, including
wires, sheets, plate strips, tubes and bars.
These are sold primarily to customers
in the construction, automotive, aviation
and general engineering industries
through its worldwide sales team. MKM
purchases its copper from independent
traders. At the end of 2009, the decision
was made to sell the business.
PETROLEUM
Kazakhmys Petroleum consists of the
602km
2
Eastern Akzhar exploration
block, on the eastern fringe of the oil rich
Caspian depression. Eastern Akzhar is in
close proximity to the Loktibai-Kenkiyak
oil pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Atyrau
gas pipeline.
During 2009 analysis was made of the
seismic surveys and the ﬁrst two deep
wells were drilled. Further drilling and
analysis will be carried out in 2010.

11 Our Strategy
12 Chief Executive’s Review SUMMARY FOR 2009 FINANCIAL YEAR
At the end of 2008, we suspended four high
cost operations and set a target to produce
300 kt of copper cathode equivalent in 2009.
By making full use of stockpiled material and
beneﬁting from previous capital investment,
management exceeded this target and
produced 320 kt. The emphasis on efﬁciency
and conserving cash was also seen in unit
costs, which were contained at 72 US cents
per pound over the year, compared to the
116 US cents per pound reported in 2008.
Over the course of 2009, copper proved to
be a resilient metal. Even in the worst periods,
demand from our own customers remained
steady. By the time of our half-yearly results, in
August 2009, the copper price had recovered
to $6,305 per tonne and ﬁnished the year at
$7,346 per tonne. Demand for copper from
China, one of our principal markets, was
helped by a successful government stimulus
package. The key role that copper plays in a
wide range of applications, and the tightness
of copper supply, also assisted its price
recovery during 2009.
Our realised copper price was $5,024 per tonne
in 2009 compared to $6,714 per tonne in 2008.
The lower copper price impacted revenue from
continuing operations, which was $2,404 million
compared to $3,276 million in 2008. Additional
tonnage from stockpiled material and lower
costs both assisted profitability, although
Group EBITDA declined to $1,634 million
from $2,056 million in 2008 due to lower
commodity prices.
BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING
The balance sheet has strengthened over the
course of the year. Net cash was generated
from operations of $820 million and, shortly
after the year end, we completed the sale
of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 to Samruk for
$681 million. These proceeds leave the Group
with net debt of $689 million from continuing
operations, excluding the Power Division and
MKM. We also recently arranged a loan facility
of up to $2.7 billion, which places the Group in
a strong position to deliver its growth projects.
STRATEGY
Our long-term strategy remains the same as
that set at our Listing in 2005 – to optimise the
performance of our assets, deliver our growth
projects and take advantage of natural resource
opportunities in Central Asia.
In 2009, we focused on the ﬁrst part of our
strategy with considerable success, as seen
in these results. In 2010, there is still much
work to be done on optimising and improving
our efficiency, and we are in a good position
to deliver on the second part of our strategy,
and move our growth projects forward. We
will continue to evaluate other opportunities
for acquisition and development, the third
part of our strategy, as they become available.

THE FUTURE
8 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
At the start of 2009 we were presented with a challenging
environment. The instability in the global financial sector,
which had begun in 2008, fed through to industrial
activity with manufacturers uncertain about demand
for their products and constrained by lack of funding.
Reflecting the poor economic outlook, copper prices
started 2009 at a depressed level of $3,071 per tonne,
compared to their 2008 peak of $8,985 per tonne in July.
Against this background, the Board set two clear aims
for 2009; to focus on efﬁciency and to conserve cash.
These objectives were successfully achieved by operational
management, so that despite a very challenging situation,
the Group produced a very successful outcome.
Kazakhmys ended 2009 in a stronger position than
it had started, toughened by the experience and with
a full understanding of the importance of the value
of production, rather than the volume. Kazakhstan has several key advantages for future
development. The land is naturally resource rich,
with a wide range of commercially extractable
deposits. The location and transport links are
ideal for supplying several key markets.
The Group sells its copper to Europe and China,
each of which represents around 30% of global
demand, and China is the fastest growing market.
Kazakhmys has long established relationships in
each region, generally dealing directly with end
users. Material to China is transported by rail,
whereas material for Europe is railed to
the Black Sea.
Precious metals are sold to Europe and zinc
is sold around Central Asia and China. Power
is mainly used in the domestic market, although
there are signiﬁcant sales to Russia.
The copper price fell in 2008, as concerns grew
over the global economy. Copper started 2009
at $3,071 per tonne, but had recovered to
$7,346 per tonne by the end of the year. Copper
fared better than many metals in 2009. Copper
is used in a wide range of applications and items,
from small appliances to major infrastructure
projects. It remains the ﬁrst choice for conducting
electricity. Demand from China, now the largest
market for copper, remained ﬁrm in 2009, assisted
by successful stimulus packages.
We sign annual contracts with our customers
each year, where we agree volume, although
the underlying price is based on the LME at the
time of delivery. For 2010, we have commitments
from customers for around 90% of our production
target, which reflects continued strong demand
for our product.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
GROWTH PROJECTS
The Group has two major growth projects at
Aktogay and Bozshakol, where pre-feasibility
studies were completed in 2009. There is also
a series of mid-sized projects which we are
planning. Once commissioned, all these
projects should lead to a signiﬁcant increase
in copper output within the next four years.
Funding has now been established for
Bozshakol, through our new loan facility,
and the feasibility study should be completed
by the end of 2010. The pre-feasibility study
showed the project making attractive returns
and Bozshakol should be able to move into
ﬁrst production by early 2014. The feasibility
study for Aktogay will commence as soon
as we secure funding for the project.
ENRC HOLDING
We continue to be the largest shareholder
in ENRC PLC, with a holding of 26%. ENRC
is a major mining company, listed in London,
but principally operating in Kazakhstan.
ENRC has a different suite of metals from
us, producing iron ore, aluminium and
ferrochrome. We believe that this holding
diversifies our earnings and presents us
with strategic options.
POWER DIVISION
At the end of 2009, we announced the
sale of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 to Samruk.
When we purchased Ekibastuz GRES-1, we
stated that we would bring in a partner and
Samruk is well suited in many respects. Samruk
will share the capital risk of investment, provide
access to coal supplies and they have a sound
understanding of the sector.
Output declined at the start of the year,
with the economic downturn reducing
demand for power. Demand recovered
sharply during the year and in the future
Ekibastuz GRES-1 will benefit from rising
demand in Kazakhstan and Russia. Through
our 50% ownership of Ekibastuz GRES-1,
we have secured the necessary power
supply for all our future growth projects.
Shared with our new partner, we will be
investing around $1 billion over the next
seven years to restore the power station
to its original 4,000 MW capacity. In 2009,
higher ceiling power tariffs were set by the
Government for the next six years, which
will allow Ekibastuz GRES-1 to produce the
cash required for reinvestment and provide
sufﬁcient economic return to justify this level
of investment.
MKM
MKM is a downstream copper fabricating
business in Germany which we acquired
in 2004, before our Listing. MKM is a well
managed business, with modern technology
and some market leading positions, but it
has limited synergies with our main copper
mining business. The Directors have, therefore,
decided to dispose of the business and early
stage discussions with a number of potential
buyers are in progress.
SALES
Each year we contract between 80% and
90% of our anticipated sales of copper and
these contracts are evenly divided between
Europe and China. Kazakhstan is an ideal
location for serving these two major markets
and remains a strength for the Group. We have
an established group of customers in both
markets and the value of these relationships
was apparent over the past year. I should like
to thank our customers for their support and
we look forward to growing with them.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The success of the Group is principally due
to the efforts of our employees and this has
been particularly evident in 2009. I should
like to thank them for their assistance in
this challenging year.
On pages 50 to 57 of this report we set
out further information on our corporate
responsibility. We continue to develop
our reporting in the key areas of health
and safety, environment and community.
Kazakhmys has a strong commitment
to support the local communities where
we operate and this will be maintained.
In 2009, we spent around $88 million on
social investment, the largest programme
of its kind in Kazakhstan. This expenditure
included the completion of a major public
college in Astana and our own second
in-house training facility at Balkhash.
I regret to inform you that in 2009 there were
15 fatalities. This is the lowest level that there
has been since Listing and there are some
signs of actions in this area starting to have
an impact, although the challenges remain
substantial. The Board is committed to
zero fatalities and will provide whatever
investment in education or equipment
is required.
THE BOARD
During 2009, two non-executive Directors
were appointed to the Board, Peter Hickson
and Clinton Dines. Peter brings considerable
experience of the power industry whilst
Clinton has worked in the resource industry
in China for 30 years. Our Board not only has
an exceptional range of experience, but each
of our non-executive Directors has worked in
an area relevant to the Group. This breadth
and depth of knowledge is of great assistance
and I should like to thank them for their
continued guidance over the past year.
SHARE PRICE AND DIVIDENDS
The recovery of the copper price over
2009 and the success of our own actions
led to a sharp rise in our share price, from
231 pence at the beginning of the year
to 1,328 pence at the end. This 475%
increase made Kazakhmys shares the
strongest performer in the FTSE 100
index during 2009.
The dividend policy followed by the
Board remains the same as that set at
the time of Listing – to take into account
the profitability of the business, as well
as its cash ﬂows and growth requirements.
With the strengthening of the balance sheet
and the recovery in cash flows, we believe
that it is appropriate to reinstate a dividend
payment. Accordingly, for the 2009 ﬁnancial
year, the Board is recommending a ﬁnal
dividend of 9.0 US cents per share.
OUTLOOK
Demand for our products remains sound
and our sales contracts for 2010 have been
completed. We anticipate producing just over
300 kt of copper cathode equivalent, similar
to the target for 2009, and the emphasis
will remain on value and proﬁtability rather
than volume. We will continue to focus on
managing costs and we anticipate making
good progress on our growth projects
in 2010. I look forward to reporting
on these next year. A CONSISTENT STRATEGY

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
SUMMARY FINANCIALS FOR 2009
The ﬁnancial results for 2009 were dominated
by the lower price of copper. Group revenue
from continuing operations was $2,404 million,
a reduction of 27% from the previous year
and Group EBITDA (excluding special items)
declined 21% to $1,634 million.
The average market price over the year was
$5,164 per tonne, compared to $6,952 per
tonne in the previous year. Our average
realised price, of $5,024 per tonne, was lower
than the average market price, because our
production and sales were weighted to the
ﬁrst six months of the year.
Revenue in the Copper Division was
$2,357 million, compared to $3,227 million
in 2008, the reduction mainly being due to
the lower copper price. EBITDA (excluding
special items) in the Copper Division fell 36%
to $1,027 million, as the decline in the copper
price and sales volumes were only partially
offset by a reduction in costs.
Revenue in the Power Division was $238 million.
Sales at Ekibastuz GRES-1, on an annualised
basis, were in line with the previous year.
The increase in power tariffs matched the
slight decline in power generated and the
negative impact of the tenge devaluation.
At the start of 2009, we hedged 8.5 kt of
copper sales per month for the year, around
one third of our total output. The programme
was put in place to protect some of our
higher cost operations, and in particular
to protect employment, in the event of
prolonged weakness in the copper price.
The programme offset the negative impact
of copper prices falling below $3,000 per
tonne at the cost of sacrificing the upside
when the price rose above $4,000 per tonne.
Given the subsequent rise in the price of
copper, a loss was incurred of $129 million.
No similar transactions are in place for 2010
or beyond, as it remains our general policy
to be an unhedged copper producer.
Costs in the Copper Division fell sharply
in 2009. Costs were assisted by a sharp
devaluation of the tenge to 150 KZT/$
in February 2009, lower input prices and
targeted action to improve efﬁciency.
By-product credits beneﬁted from rising
prices over the course of the year. These
changes led to a decline in net costs from
116 US cents per pound in 2008 to 72 US
cents per pound in 2009. This achievement
was signiﬁcantly ahead of our net cash cost
target at the start of 2009, of between
90 and 120 US cents per pound.
In 2008 the Government of Kazakhstan
implemented new legislation to change tax
rates from 1 January 2009. The phasing in of
these new rates has since been slowed down,
which is covered further in the Financial Review.
The new tax regime is relatively aggressive
at lower metals prices, such as those seen
in 2009. There have also been some further

adverse tax impacts in the year, which have
reduced EPS on Underlying Proﬁt to $1.13 per
share, compared to $2.27 per share in 2008.
The presentation of our reported ﬁnancial
numbers has changed signiﬁcantly this year,
which is dealt with more fully on page 36.
Following the Board’s decision to dispose
of MKM, it is now classiﬁed as an asset held
for sale and its results are included under
discontinued operations. Following the sale
of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 in February 2010,
it will in future be treated as a joint venture.
Under IFRS requirements, for 2009, this
business is also classiﬁed as an asset held
for sale and is included within discontinued
operations. Ekibastuz GRES-1 remains an
important part of our Group.
COPPER DIVISION OUTPUT FOR 2009
At the start of 2009, with low copper prices
and concerns over the economic outlook,
we focused on controlling costs, protecting
margins and maximising cashﬂow generation.
Four high cost mines were suspended, which
led to a 9% decline in ore output to 32,409 kt.
Lower ore output combined with a reduction
in grade, from 1.26% to 1.18%, created a
15% decrease in mined metal output.
The reduction in mined metal, however,
was offset by pro-active, targeted actions
such that the production of copper in own
concentrate reduced by just 3% to 359 kt.
These actions included improved productivity
at continuing operations, the processing of
stockpiled ore, the reprocessing of waste
materials and higher recovery rates at
the concentrators.
Production of copper cathode equivalent,
our ﬁnished material, declined by 7% to 320 kt.
This ﬁgure was ahead of the target of 300 kt,
based on planned mine output, which we
set at the beginning of 2009. The target was
exceeded due to the management actions
referred to previously. Sales of cathode
equivalent were 341 kt, with additional
volume coming from a reduction in inventory
in the ﬁrst half of the year. There was some
rebuild of work in progress and inventory
at the year end, which had been reduced
to low levels during the year.
BY-PRODUCT OUTPUT FOR 2009
From our copper mines, we also produce
by-products of zinc, silver and gold. By-product
output in 2009 exceeded 2008, as the
reduction in by-product metals mined during
the year was offset by signiﬁcant contributions
from the processing of stockpiled polymetallic
ores, higher recovery rates at the concentrators
and lower levels of work in progress. www.kazakhmys.com 13
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
POWER DIVISION OUTPUT FOR 2009
Annual net power generated at Ekibastuz
GRES-1 in 2009 fell 6.4% from 2008, but the
recovery through the year was dramatic. The
demand for electricity declined signiﬁcantly
at the end of 2008 and remained low at the
beginning of 2009. A moderate improvement
in demand started in April 2009 and the trend
strengthened during the rest of the year, led
by rising industrial output in Kazakhstan and
Russia and some shutdowns at other generators.
There is a tight supply demand balance for
power in Kazakhstan and the sector needs
investment to meet growing future demand
for electricity. The Government, recognising
this need, increased the ceiling tariffs for the
years 2009 to 2015, in order to raise cash
ﬂows and allow greater investment in the
sector. The tariff at Ekibastuz GRES-1 was an
average of 3.19 KZT/kWh in 2009, compared
to 2.42 KZT/kWh in 2008. Domestic tariffs
ﬁnished the year in line with the ceiling
tariff of 3.60 KZT/kWh.
KAZAKHMYS GOLD OUTPUT FOR 2009
AND OUTLOOK
As anticipated, there was a decrease in ore
extraction and metal production in the Gold
Division during 2009. Zhaima mine closed in
September 2008, and the grade was lower at
the continuing operations of Mizek and Mukur.
The new Bozymchak gold/copper project
in Kyrgyzstan has moved to full development
stage, following the allocation of $100 million
funding by the China Development Bank
and Samruk.
Bozymchak should move into production by
the end of 2010 and has a potential annual
output of 30 koz of gold and 7 kt of copper.
Subject to completing various technicalities, it
is likely that the assets within the Gold Division
will be absorbed within the Copper Division.
KAZAKHMYS PETROLEUM
Kazakhmys Petroleum has continued its drilling
and testing programme at the Eastern Akzhar
exploration block in western Kazakhstan.
Remedial work is being carried out at the ﬁrst
two deep wells in order to continue testing,
which encountered some technical difﬁculties
during 2009. The drilling of a third deep well
is planned to be completed in the ﬁrst half
of 2010.
The results of 3D seismic data covering the
northwestern part of the licensed area will
be available in early 2010 and it is expected
that these results will be used to identify
prospective locations for future deep well
drilling. By the end of 2010, sufﬁcient data
should have been collected from the wells
to give a fuller economic evaluation of the ﬁeld.

PRODUCTIVITY
As part of our optimisation programme,
we have reorganised our smelters to
encourage cost control and improve
recovery rates. Zhezkazgan and
Balkhash smelters now work under
a single specialist metallurgical unit.
These changes have streamlined the
process of moving material from
concentrators to smelters. There has
also been a complete rebuilding of one
of the furnaces at Zhezkazgan and this
will now be commissioned and the
second furnace will undergo a similar
refurbishment. These initiatives will
save costs and improve quality.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
ENRC
Our 26% holding in ENRC PLC was worth
$4,879 million at the end of 2009, compared
to $1,600 million at the start of the year.
The increase in value reﬂects the recovery
in commodity markets. ENRC is principally
involved in ferrochrome, iron ore and
alumina. During the year, ENRC made
further investments outside Central Asia
including the purchase of Central African
Mining and Exploration Company PLC, who
have assets in Central and Southern Africa.
These acquisitions potentially give ENRC
greater exposure to base metals.
FUNDING
Over the course of the year we generated cash
from operations including dividends received
from ENRC PLC, before taxation and capital
expenditure, of $1,084 million. In March 2009,
we commenced capital repayments on our
principal $2.1 billion ﬁve year debt facility,
at the rate of $44 million per month.
At the end of 2009, $1,662 million was
outstanding on this facility and, after cash
and cash equivalents, there was net debt of
$689 million relating to continuing operations.
Interest on our principal facility is 1.25% over
US$ LIBOR. In 2009, a portion of the interest
payments were ﬁxed via interest rate swaps
to reduce volatility in our cash ﬂows.
At the end of 2009, the Group was allocated
up to $2.7 billion from a loan arranged between
the China Development Bank and Samruk.

drawn on 17 March 2010 for $300 million.
Interest is payable on funds drawn at a rate
of 4.80% over US$ LIBOR. This facility has
several attractions, being long term, flexible
in drawing and at a competitive rate.
OUTLOOK FOR COPPER DIVISION IN 2010
Mined ore output should rise slightly in 2010,
but this will be offset by a general decline in
grades. Given that mined metal output will be
at a similar level to 2009, we are setting the
same target for output of just over 300 kt of
copper cathode equivalent. There is some
stockpiled material, but not at the scale
of 2009.
The four suspended mines will not be
brought back into production in 2010.
The most significant of these is Akbastau,
where we are intending to build a
concentrator close to the mine, in order to
reduce transportation costs and maximise the
value of the ore reserve. With funding now
available from our new facility, we are now
carrying out preliminary economic studies.
Gross cash costs are likely to increase
next year given rising input costs and lower
grades. Inﬂation in Kazakhstan is currently just
under 10%, which will put some pressure on
domestic costs. The Kazakhstan tenge trades
in a ﬁxed band around the US dollar, which
has recently been widened and could allow
the currency to strengthen against the US
dollar, again putting pressure on costs.
There is unlikely to be further signiﬁcant
production of by-products from stockpiled
material, so that the by-product credit will
depend on mined metal and pricing.
COPPER GROWTH PROJECTS
The Group has two major copper growth
projects, Aktogay and Bozshakol. These
have both successfully completed their
pre-feasibility stage. Both projects showed
economic value on conservative pricing
assumptions, with signiﬁcant net present
value at Bozshakol.
As mentioned last year, we delayed the move
to feasibility stage until we had identified
partners and external sources of funding for
the projects. With the loan from the China
Development Bank and Samruk, we now have
committed funding for Bozshakol and the
feasibility study commenced in January 2010.
The study contractor is Aker Solutions. The
feasibility study should be completed by
the end of 2010, allowing the project to
move into development in 2011 with first
production of copper in concentrate by early
2014. Some items of large equipment are
likely to be ordered towards the end of
2010. The total capital investment will be
around $1.5 to $2 billion, but the feasibility
study will deﬁne this ﬁgure more accurately.
The funding facility from the China
Development Bank and Samruk will allow
the consideration and potential development
of other projects including the underground
mine at Kosmurun, the new concentrator at www.kazakhmys.com 15
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
Akbastau, the expansion of Zhomart and the
development of the underground mine
at Abyz.
We continue to look at funding alternatives
for Aktogay and anticipate that progress will
be achieved during the current ﬁnancial year.
At that point, the project will then move to
feasibility study.
All of these future copper projects potentially
represent over two-thirds of our current
production. We are, therefore, in a position
not only to replace the decline in our current
production, but to signiﬁcantly increase
output in the medium term.
KAZAKHMYS POWER OUTLOOK
FOR 2010 AND FUTURE EXPANSION
With the overhaul of Unit 5 in 2009, the plant
now has a capacity of 2,470 MW. During 2010,
Unit 3 will undergo a major overhaul and we
will start the complete rehabilitation of Unit 8.
Ekibastuz GRES-1 will see a signiﬁcant change
in capacity when Unit 8 is completed in 2013.
If demand continues to be strong, then the
refurbishment of one of the other two
dormant units may be brought forward.
As mentioned above, tariffs averaged
3.19 KZT/kWh, including Russian sales, which
were at a lower price than sales in Kazakhstan.
The ceiling for domestic sales in 2010 is
4.68 KZT/kWh and it is anticipated that the
OUR STRATEGY IN ACTION
REALISING OUR
GROWTH POTENTIAL
In 2009 the Group arranged a
debt facility of $2.7 billion, which
will be used to develop our signiﬁcant
growth projects. This is a ﬁfteen year
debt facility, which is ideally structured
for the development of long-life mining
assets. The assets we will be focusing on
include the major copper growth project
at Bozshakol and the copper gold
project at Bozymchak.
The facility will also be used for a range
of mid-sized copper developments and
new processing plants. Together these
projects will add substantial additional
production and, given their location and
the existing infrastructure, they are some
of the lowest-risk copper developments
in progress in the world.
$2.7billion
to develop signiﬁcant growth projects
price will reach that level over the course
of the year for domestic sales, though some
power will still be exported at a lower price.
CONCLUSION
In 2010, the cost environment is expected
to be more challenging than in 2009 and we
will need to maintain output while controlling
costs. The receipt of the loan facility from
Samruk and the China Development Bank
has transformed our ability to pursue our
growth projects and we are now in an
excellent position to take forward some
of the largest and lowest-risk copper
projects that are currently available globally.  OPTIMISING PERFORMANCE

Directors’ Report: Business Review
MEASURING OUR PROGRESS THROUGH KPIs
Relevance to our strategy
Measures the performance of the Group in maintaining its
low-cost base whilst maximising revenues through the sale
of by-products.
How we measure it
The total of cash operating costs excluding purchased
concentrate less by-product revenues, divided by the
volume of copper cathode equivalent sales.
Performance in 2009
In 2009 gross costs beneﬁted from lower input costs, currency
changes and cost actions taken by management. By-product
credits were helped by higher prices and production from
stockpiled inventories.
Relevance to our strategy
We consider this measure as the main operational indicator as
copper is a homogeneous product with a worldwide market.
How we measure it
Copper cathode equivalent produced from own ore either
as reﬁned copper cathodes or as recoverable copper in
concentrate or residues.
Performance in 2009
Suspension of high cost mines reduced output, but this was
partly offset by increased production from operating mines
and production from stockpiled materials.

339 Relevance to our strategy
EPS tells how much net proﬁt we have generated
and measures the return to our equity shareholders.
How we measure it
Proﬁt before special items and other non-recurring or variable
non-trading items, and their resulting taxation and minority
interest impact, divided by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Performance in 2009
EPS was affected by lower commodity prices, a relatively high
tax rate in 2009 and an increased number of shares in issue.
This was partially offset by lower costs.
Relevance to our strategy
We regard this as a measure of the underlying proﬁtability
of the Group.
How we measure it
EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation,
depletion, amortisation and mineral extraction tax as adjusted
for special items and including the share of EBITDA of
the associate.
Performance in 2009
EBITDA was dominated by lower commodity prices, partially
offset by a reduction in costs and an increased share of
earnings from ENRC.
Relevance to our strategy
We monitor how efﬁciently we use our capital with the
objective of delivering ROCE in excess of our weighted
average cost of capital.
How we measure it
Proﬁt before taxation and ﬁnance items, excluding special
items, as a percentage of the average of opening and closing
capital employed.
Performance in 2009
ROCE has decreased primarily due to lower earnings from
managed businesses and the impact of equity accounting
for ENRC.
Relevance to our strategy
We monitor the Group’s cash ﬂows which can be used to
fund returns to shareholders and invest in the future growth
and development of the business.
How we measure it
Net cash ﬂow from operating activities less sustaining capital
expenditure on tangible and intangible assets.
Performance in 2009
Similar to EBITDA, Free Cash Flow was impacted by
lower commodity prices, offset by lower levels of capital
expenditure and taxation during the year.

Kazakhmys’ principal product is copper, which was one of the stronger
performing LME quoted metals in 2009, rising 139% across the year.
The LME copper price climbed from a low of $3,051 per tonne in late
January 2009 to a high of $7,346 per tonne on 31 December 2009.
The average price during the year was $5,164 per tonne, 26% below
the average of $6,952 per tonne in 2008.
The recovery in the copper price was driven by a number of factors
which included strong demand from China which built up copper
inventories and experienced increased industrial activity driven
by economic growth and government investment. Prices were also
supported by the improvement in the global economic environment
in the second half of 2009, and continued weakness in the US dollar.
Despite the strong demand for copper from China in 2009, the global
consumption of refined copper is estimated to have decreased by
3.1% to 17.5 MT. China’s reﬁned copper consumption is forecast to
have increased by 1.6 MT to 6.7 MT in 2009, with refined copper
consumption expected to have declined in the rest of the world
by 1.1 MT. This reduction included a 23% fall in consumption
in Western Europe, Japan and North America.
Given Kazakhmys’ proximity to China, a signiﬁcant portion of copper
cathode production is supplied to the Chinese market. The reﬁned
copper demand prospects for China in 2010 are positive with an
estimated increase in consumption of 9% to 7.3 MT as economic
growth continues. Chinese reﬁned copper production is expected
to be 5.3 MT in 2010, implying an import requirement of 2.0 MT.
Kazakhmys Copper also has exposure to the Western European
market where the construction sector remained depressed and car
production volumes fell during 2009. Reﬁned copper consumption
in Western Europe is estimated to have contracted by 22% in 2009.
With most of the major Western European economies returning to
growth in late 2009 and with a recovery in demand from the power
sector, reﬁned copper consumption is expected to grow 2.1% to 2.7 MT
in 2010. The growth rate reflects the slower economic recovery
expected in the mature Western European markets as contrasted
with the continued strength of the economic growth in China.
Kazakhmys Copper will maintain a presence in both the Chinese
and European markets by selling to traders and end users in 2010.
Kazakhmys Copper has contracted the majority of its 2010 copper
cathode and rod production under annual agreements. The pricing
of sales is based on the LME price plus a premium to reﬂect the terms
of trade.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
Following the decline in prices during 2008, zinc prices remained
depressed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009 with an average LME price of
$1,174 per tonne. The low prices reﬂect the estimated 23% decline in
the worldwide steel market excluding China, due to weakness in the
construction and automobile sectors around the world.
From April 2009 the zinc price climbed steadily, with the LME average
price for the year being $1,659 per tonne, an 11% decrease from the
2008 average of $1,870 per tonne. The improvement in zinc prices
from April 2009 reﬂected the tightening of supply with mine production
cutbacks in early 2009 and as China’s zinc consumption grew by 20%,
broadly in line with the growth in demand for steel in the country.
While zinc prices trended higher during 2009, LME zinc inventories
grew by 93% from 253 kt to 488 kt at the end of the year and zinc
consumption is estimated to have declined from 11.5 MT in 2008 to
11.0 MT in 2009. A market surplus in zinc is forecast in 2010, although
a rebound in worldwide steel production is expected to support prices
as restocking takes place, along with growing demand from
developing economies.
In 2010, Kazakhmys will sell zinc concentrate within Kazakhstan and
into China. The pricing for zinc concentrate is based on the LME price
at the time of delivery.
GOLD
During 2009, gold prices were mainly supported by investment
demand with the metal maintaining its status as a safe haven during
periods of economic uncertainty. This was reﬂected in the gold price
which rose from $875 per ounce at the beginning of 2009 to trade
above $1,000 per ounce from October 2009, ﬁnishing the year at
$1,104 per ounce.
Investment demand is forecast to be the main driver of gold prices
in 2010 with the US dollar expected to be weak, real interest rates
remaining low, and concerns persisting around rising inflation.
Given the dependence on investment demand, the gold
price could be vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment.
In 2010, Kazakhmys Copper will sell gold to traders based
in Europe under annual contracts based on the LBMA price
at the time of delivery.
SILVER
Silver prices in 2009, like gold, were supported by investment
demand, a weak US dollar and concerns around inﬂation. These
factors largely offset the global slowdown in industrial production
which reduced the demand for silver used in industrial and
manufacturing processes.
Silver prices commenced the year at $11.1 per ounce and ended
at $17.0 per ounce, reaching a high of $19.2 per ounce in early
December. The silver market is projected to record a 49 Moz
surplus in 2009, with a similar surplus forecast in 2010.
Silver is expected to beneﬁt from an improvement in industrial
demand in 2010 as the global economy returns to growth. Due
to silver’s exposure to investment demand, the silver price could
be vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment.
Kazakhmys will sell its silver product to both end users and traders
based in Europe in 2010, principally under annual contracts based
on the LBMA price at the time of delivery.

Zinc: Market overview
Precious metals: Market overview At the beginning of 2009, Kazakhmys Copper focused on operational
efﬁciencies to protect proﬁt margins in response to the lower commodity
price environment and the uncertain economic outlook. A number
of high cost mines were suspended, one of the Zhezkazgan smelter
furnaces was closed for maintenance and stockpiled material, built-up
in previous periods, was processed during the year.
Ore extraction decreased by 9% in 2009 compared to 2008 reﬂecting
the reduction in the number of operating mines. The high cost mines
suspended were Belousovsky, Konyrat, North Nurkazgan and sections
of the West and North mines. The Kosmurun mine closed in the fourth
quarter of 2008 due to the depletion of the open pit with plans for the
mine to move underground currently being developed.
The main factor behind the lower production volumes was the
closure of the Akbastau mine, which, in 2008, produced 2.4 MT
of ore containing 59 kt of copper. The mine was suspended as the
ore body is being preserved ahead of the construction of a new
concentrator at the site which will reduce ore transportation costs.
The loss of ore output from the mine closures was partially offset
by the opening of the West Nurkazgan underground mine in early
2009 and an improved performance from the South mine following
operational difﬁculties in the ﬁrst half of 2008.
The copper grade was lower at 1.18% mainly due to no production
taking place at the high grade Akbastau mine. The impact of the
mine closure was partially offset by the average copper grade
at the Zhomart mine increasing to 1.80% up from 1.39% in 2008
and the suspension of the low grade Konyrat mine.
Own copper in concentrate production was 359 kt, only 3%
below 2008, despite a 15% reduction in copper in ore mined due
to the lower ore volumes extracted and decline in copper grade.
Production benefited from the processing of stockpiled materials
and an improved concentrator recovery rate for copper of 86.0%,
up from 84.6% in 2008. During the year, Kazakhmys Copper carried
out upgrade work on several concentrators, including Nurkazgan
and Karagaily, raising their copper and by-product recovery rates.
In 2009, 22.7 kt of copper in concentrate was sold to third parties,
principally into China, whilst in the prior year, sales of only 3.5 kt took
place. The sales to China were to test the marketplace and, following
a trial period, were largely stopped in July with concentrate produced
thereafter processed internally into cathodes. Going forward, copper
in concentrate sales may take place periodically, but due to Kazakhmys
Copper maintaining sufﬁcient smelting capacity, this is not expected
to be on a large scale. One of the two Zhezkazgan furnaces was closed
in early 2009 so excess concentrate from the region has been shipped
to the Balkhash smelter for processing.
Own copper cathode equivalent production, which includes copper
in concentrate sales, fell by 7% reflecting the lower concentrate
production. In the fourth quarter of 2009, there was a build-up of
copper in concentrate work in progress following a reduction earlier
in the year, which is expected to be smelted into cathode during
2010. In the prior year, spare smelting capacity was utilised by the
purchase of third party produced copper concentrate, however this
largely ceased in 2009 and the reported production from purchased
concentrate largely represents the rundown of inventory brought
forward from the prior year.
The processing of cathodes into rod is dependent on market
demand in China, which in 2009 did not generate sufficient
premiums. The small volume of rod produced and sold in
the year was to local customers in Kazakhstan.
In 2010, the average ore grade is expected to be lower, a combination
of raised ore output from lower copper content mines and a drop in ore
grade at certain mines. Overall ore output should rise, which, together
with the processing of stockpiled copper in concentrate from the fourth
quarter of 2009, is expected to result in own cathode equivalent output
of at least 300 kt. As the premiums available for copper rod sales have
improved on the prior year, approximately 10% of cathode production
is contracted to be processed further into rods, for sale into China and
to local customers.
The volume of third party copper concentrate processed at the
smelters by Kazakhmys Copper is expected to be minimal in 2010.

Zinc in concentrate production in 2009 was 9% higher than the prior
year. The processing of stockpiled materials and an improved zinc
recovery rate at the concentrators of 66.0%, up from 63.8%, was
sufﬁcient to offset a decrease in zinc metal in ore output of 55.5 kt.
The zinc grade rose year on year as the Akbastau mine, which had
a grade of just 0.63%, was closed during 2009. The zinc smelter’s
operations were suspended during 2009 as concentrate sales were
commercially more attractive. The smelter cleared its work in progress
over the ﬁrst quarter, generating 8.6 kt of zinc metal production, with
zinc concentrate production during the year being sold externally.
The production of zinc concentrate during 2010 is expected to fall from
the level achieved in 2009 as the contribution from stockpiled ore is
reduced. There are no plans at present to restart the zinc smelter, so
all zinc concentrate produced will be sold externally to customers
in Kazakhstan and China during 2010.

Average gold grade (g/t) 0.66 0.85
Gold own production (koz) 135 124
The production of precious metals was impacted by the suspension
of the Akbastau mine throughout the year and the gold rich Abyz
mine remaining closed for stripping work for the ﬁrst half of 2009.
The average gold grade was lower in 2009, also impacted by the
reduced output from the Akbastau and Abyz mines.
These factors led to a reduction in the volume of precious metal
containing ore extracted, however, for both gold and silver the
production of finished product exceeded the prior year due to
the processing of previously stockpiled materials and, for gold, an
improved recovery rate as the Karagaily concentrator was upgraded.
Gold production in 2010 is expected to remain in line with 2009
output with the Abyz mine operating throughout the year whilst silver
output is anticipated to decline due to reduced grades and a lower
contribution from stockpiled materials.
Fluctuations in commodity prices can have a signiﬁcant impact
on Kazakhmys Copper’s revenue and earnings. Any changes in
commodity prices have a direct effect on the revenues of the
Kazakhmys Copper business, with consequential impacts on
earnings and the cash cost of copper resulting from changes
in by-product credits.
The approximate effect on the proﬁt before taxation and ﬁnance
items resulting from a 10% movement in average realised commodity
prices is shown in the following table. These sensitivities are based

Kazakhmys Copper’s vertical integration includes three coal-ﬁred
power and heating plants at Karaganda, Balkhash and Zhezkazgan
with a total capacity of 900 MW. The Karaganda plant supplies energy
to Kazakhstan’s national grid enabling other Kazakhmys Copper
operations to receive electricity at only the cost of transmission.
The total output in 2009 was 6,199 GWh, up from 5,910 GWh in
2008. The capital spend in 2008 resulted in an improved performance
in 2009 with a reduced number of outages. The Karaganda station
beneﬁted from the installation of a 55 MW turbine, replacing a 50 MW
turbine which was at the end of its economic life. The power and
heating plants are supplied with fuel from Kazakhmys Copper’s two
coal mines which produced 7.5 MT of coal in 2009, in line with prior
year output.
Kazakhmys Copper owns over 1,000 km of railway in Kazakhstan, a
ﬂeet of 100 locomotives and over 800 wagons which are managed
on an outsourced basis to transport ore, concentrate and cathodes.
In the East and Karaganda Regions there is less railroad infrastructure
and Kazakhmys Copper operates road haulage fleets. A number
of these routes have been outsourced to third party suppliers.

Financial summary Revenues
Kazakhmys Copper’s revenues decreased by 27% from $3,227 million
in 2008 to $2,357 million in 2009. The fall in commodity prices, in
particular copper, was the principal driver with the realised copper
price $1,690 lower than the prior year at $5,024 per tonne. The 2009
realised price was 3% lower than the LME average for the year as
Kazakhmys recorded 58% of its copper cathode sales in the ﬁrst half
of 2009, when the LME copper price was weaker. The 2009 annual
sales volumes of copper products, including copper in concentrate,
were 47 kt below the prior year, due to reduced production from
both own and purchased copper concentrate. The impact of lower
production on sales volumes was partially offset by a sell down of
ﬁnished goods inventories at the start of the year, as copper sales
volumes were 15.3 kt higher than production volumes.
Copper concentrate sales of 22.7 kt were made in 2009, up from 3.5 kt
in 2008, as concentrate was shipped into China for the ﬁrst seven
months of the year. Copper rod sales were 8.5 kt in 2009 compared
to 46.7 kt in 2008. The premium on sales into China was not sufﬁciently
attractive so volumes were restricted to local demand in 2009.
Zinc revenues were impacted by an 11% fall in the average zinc price
in 2009 and the decision to sell zinc concentrate rather than process it
further into zinc metal. During 2009, zinc concentrate sales increased
by 38% from 2008. Silver, the largest by-product based on revenue,
experienced a 2% decrease in the average LBMA price which was
compensated for by revenue from the silver content in concentrate
sold. Gold revenues rose 17% to $127 million, the result of sales
volumes increasing by 6% and a 12% rise in the LBMA average
price compared to the prior year.
Other revenue is made up of a number of products including power,
coal, lead dust, heating and sulphuric acid. The growth in other
revenue compared to the prior year was largely driven by sales
of power from the Karaganda plant and the ramp up of sulphuric
acid production at Balkhash.
EBITDA (excluding special items)
EBITDA fell by $570 million or 36% in 2009 as copper revenues
declined signiﬁcantly. In response to the weakness in commodities,
Kazakhmys Copper implemented a number of cost reduction
measures which partially offset the loss in revenue, contributing
to cost of sales falling 30% compared to the prior year. The major
factors driving the lower costs include the suspension of high cost
mines, lower input prices, a reduction in purchased concentrate
and the impact of the tenge devaluation.
The suspension of high cost mines at the end of 2008 generated
savings on fuel, consumables and transportation costs as ore output
was 9% below the volume produced in 2008. Where possible, the
workers and equipment at the affected mines were re-assigned to
other operations. Salary costs were controlled by transferring staff
at several operations to part-time work. The decision to suspend
the zinc smelter in March 2009 removed the cost of processing
concentrate further into ingots, as all zinc in concentrate is now
sold externally.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the economic downturn gave
Kazakhmys the opportunity to renegotiate more favourable terms
with suppliers. In addition, the decline in commodity prices had a
beneﬁcial impact on costs, for example, oil, steel and cement prices
were all lower in 2009 than in 2008. However, improving economic
conditions and higher commodity prices in the second half of the
year led to a slight upward pressure on costs in that period.
The cost of purchased copper concentrate and blister copper used
in copper production fell following the decision to phase out major
purchases of copper concentrate, as one of the Zhezkazgan smelter
furnaces was closed for maintenance. Small quantities of copper
concentrate are still purchased to manage the level of sulphur in
the Balkhash smelter. In 2008, 37.8 kt of copper cathodes were
produced from purchased concentrate compared to 5.5 kt in 2009.
General and administrative expenses decreased by 5% in 2009 as
the tenge devaluation contributed to the cost reduction in US dollar
terms. In 2008, social spend included a number of one-off items in
respect of the 10th anniversary celebration of the capital, Astana.
In 2009, Kazakhmys focused on a number of ongoing programmes
and contractual obligations. During the year, Kazakhmys also made
contributions towards the construction of a technical college in Astana.
In February 2009, the tenge devalued by 25% against the US dollar,
moving from approximately 120 KZT/$ to 150 KZT/$. The devaluation
reduced tenge denominated costs such as labour, local services and
utilities. The currency was relatively stable against the US dollar for the
remainder of 2009, trading within the National Bank of Kazakhstan’s
target range of 145 to 155 KZT/$. The National Bank has indicated
a wider target range for the tenge in 2010 of between 127.5 to 165
KZT/$ until March 2011 which could result in additional transactional
and translational foreign exchange gains or losses going forward.
Early in 2009, to protect a number of marginal mines, Kazakhmys
Copper entered into a hedging programme for approximately
one third of monthly copper production. As the copper price rose
across the remainder of the year, the hedging programme ended
in December 2009 with a loss for the year of $129 million included
in other operating expenses. There are no such hedges in place
in 2010. Further details can be found in the Financial Review.
Cash costs
The gross cash cost of copper (before by-product credits) reduced
from 191 US cents per pound in 2008 to 159 US cents per pound in
2009. The decline in operating costs noted above more than offset
the lower volumes of copper sold in 2009.
The net cash cost of copper excluding purchased concentrate fell from
116 US cents per pound in 2008 to 72 US cents per pound. The lower
cash operating costs, together with an increase in by-product credits,
resulted in the net cash cost falling signiﬁcantly.
In 2010, a lower copper grade will raise the unit cost of production.
Expected inﬂationary rises in costs may be mitigated by price driven
movements in by-product credits.
The scope of Kazakhmys Copper’s capital expenditure programme in
2009 was constrained as the Group focused on conserving cash during
the economic downturn. The reduction was achieved by rationing
capital expenditure on new projects and negotiating lower prices.
Following a substantial spend on mining equipment in 2007
and 2008, the reduction in sustaining capital expenditure in 2009
did not have a material impact on achieving the production plan.
Equipment from suspended operations was transferred to other mines.
Sustaining
Sustaining capital expenditure in 2009 included payments for mining
equipment ordered in 2008. The scope of the 2009 equipment
programme was reduced with the focus on essential replacements.
Sustaining capital expenditure was incurred at the concentrators
to replace and modernise equipment to maintain operations and
improve recovery rates. A tailings dump at the Balkhash concentrator
underwent an overhaul.
Work was conducted at Kazakhmys Copper’s smelters during the year,
including the installation of a copper anode production line at the
Zhezkazgan smelter to improve the quality of copper cathodes.
The second furnace at the Zhezkazgan smelter, closed during 2009,
has now been repaired and is available to recommence operations
as required.
Maintenance was conducted on Kazakhmys Copper’s power stations.
This spend included the installation of a replacement 55 MW turbine
at the Karaganda power station and repairs to boiler units and turbines.
Sustaining capital expenditure in 2010 is expected to include the

purchase of replacement equipment at mining operations as part
of the ongoing renewal programme, repair work at the smelters and
power stations and replacing transportation infrastructure, particularly
maintenance of Kazakhmys Copper’s railway network.
Expansionary
In the Zhezkazgan Region, the increase of the capacity of the Zhomart
mine continued along with the purchase of mining equipment. In the
Karaganda Region, work was carried out to commence production from
the new West Nurkazgan underground mine. Further expenditure
will be made to increase the capacity of the underground mine
and to develop the ore body further.
The East Region incurred expansionary capital expenditure on a
number of mines to increase their production capacity and efﬁciency.
This included the introduction of conveyors at the Orlovsky mine and
the replacement of the ore lifting equipment to increase the capacity
of the Artemyevsky mine. This capital expenditure will assist production
from the mine when development of the deposit moves into the
second stage.
In 2010, the capital programme for discretionary expenditure is
expected to encompass work on a number of medium-term projects.
These projects will include the development of the Kosmurun and
Akbastau mines and associated concentrator, Zhomart second stage
and the extension of the Abyz mine amongst other projects.
Kazakhmys Copper has two major long-term expansion projects
comprising the large copper porphyry deposits at Bozshakol and
Aktogay managed by a specialist internal team, Kazakhmys Projects.
Bozshakol
The pre-feasibility study was successfully completed for the Bozshakol
sulphide ore deposit in April 2009. The study conﬁrmed that Bozshakol
is an economically viable project with net production costs expected
to have an attractive position on the cost curve.
The study also identiﬁed value engineering opportunities to reduce
capital costs, and additional engineering was completed in the latter
half of 2009 to conﬁrm these opportunities and enhance the robustness
of the project’s ﬁnancial return.
The Bozshakol deposit is substantial with a management estimated
geological resource of 1,169 MT of ore and a copper grade of 0.36%,
a gold grade of 0.21 g/t, a silver grade of 4.9 g/t and molybdenum
and rhenium by-products. Based on current projections of production
levels, the resource base supports a mine life of 40 years.
In January 2010, Kazakhmys commenced the feasibility study on
the deposit which will continue during 2010 to conﬁrm the project’s
scope and execution strategy prior to moving to the development
stage. Aker Solutions has been appointed as the study contractor
and will develop the project in conjunction with the Kazakhmys
Projects team. The feasibility study is expected to be completed
in the fourth quarter of 2010 with the potential for construction
to commence in 2011. The construction phase is estimated to
be three to four years in duration.
The ore will be mined by an open pit truck and shovel operation,
with total extraction volumes at the deposit increasing to 60 MT
per annum including stripping works. The Bozshakol processing plant
is expected to be a conventional copper concentrator with an ultimate
throughput rate of approximately 25 MT per annum. The feasibility
study will consider the optimal sales options, which include the sale
of concentrate to China or the sale of cathode after smelting internally.
The development of the project will be funded by the loan facility
negotiated with the China Development Bank and Samruk. From
the loan facility, Kazakhmys has allocated up to $2 billion to fund
the development of the project.
Aktogay
The technical studies for the development of the Aktogay deposit
have progressed during 2009 with a combined pre-feasibility study
completed in October 2009 that incorporated the deposit’s sulphide
and oxide ore bodies.
The study demonstrates that Aktogay is a large resource containing
nearly 5 MT of copper along with silver and molybdenum by-products.
The current estimated mineable oxide resource contains 119 MT of
ore with 0.37% copper grade, and a mineable sulphide resource of
1,268 MT of ore with 0.38% copper grade. Scope exists to expand
the resource in the Aktogay deposit with further exploration work.
The deposit would be mined using a conventional open pit truck and
shovel system. Based on the estimated production levels, the resource
base supports a mine life of 40 years. The project would involve the
construction of a processing plant and a copper concentrator.
Kazakhmys is currently evaluating the results of the 2009 pre-feasibility
study to identify opportunities for improving the economics of the
project and assessing financing options prior to its potential
advancement to feasibility stage. 26 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

During 2009, ore extraction took place at Kazakhmys Gold’s two

figures for 2009 reflect the impact of the closure of the Zhaima
mine in September 2008, and also lower output from Mizek Oxide.
The lower gold grade is due to a fall in gold content as the mines
continue to mature.
In 2010, output from the Kazakhstan operating mines may fall further as
extraction becomes more challenging with the mines expected to cease
output during 2011. The gold-copper development project in Kyrgyzstan,

Revenues
In 2009, Kazakhmys Gold sold doré under an annual contract to a
European trader, with the price determined by reference to the LBMA
price less reﬁning charges. These arrangements are expected to remain
unchanged in 2010.
Kazakhmys Gold’s revenues decreased by only $2 million to $47 million
in 2009, despite a reduction in gold sales volumes following the closure
of the Zhaima mine in 2008, and the decrease in output from Mizek
Oxide. The lower sales volumes were largely offset by the strength of
gold prices in 2009, with an average realised price of $982 per ounce,
12% higher than in the prior year.
EBITDA (excluding special items)
The improved EBITDA in 2009 resulted from the higher realised gold
price which maintained revenues at the same level as the prior year, whilst
production volumes, and therefore costs, were lower. Kazakhmys Gold
also beneﬁted from the currency devaluation on its tenge denominated
cost base and the price of various input materials fell compared to 2008.
Cash cost
The cash cost is lower in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the
devaluation of the tenge and lower input prices. The cash cost in 2008
included royalty payments of $21 per ounce which are not present in
2009 following changes to the Kazakhstan tax code.
Sustaining
Sustaining capital expenditure of $3 million in 2009 was for
the replacement of equipment at Kazakhmys Gold’s existing
mining operations.
Expansionary
Kazakhmys Gold’s major focus in 2009 was the progression of the
Bozymchak gold-copper project which successfully moved from the
feasibility stage to development towards the end of the year. The project’ s
development will be funded by the allocation of $100 million from the
loan facility negotiated with the China Development Bank and Samruk.
The Bozymchak deposit is located in Kyrgyzstan and contains gold,
copper and silver. The development of the deposit is proceeding
with stripping work to commence in April 2010. The delivery of the
concentrator is expected to take place in early 2010 and construction
should be completed in the latter part of the year.
Bozymchak will commence operations as an open pit mine in late 2010,
producing around 5 MT of ore over a six year period with a gradual
transition to underground mining from 2014, which will produce a
further 11 MT of ore.
The concentrator should reach an annual production capacity
of 35 kt of concentrate by the end of 2011. The planned annual
production of copper in concentrate is 7 kt and 30 koz of gold,
once fully commissioned.
During 2009, further technical studies were conducted on the Mizek
Sulphide project located in northeast Kazakhstan. The technical
studies are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010.
The development of the Mizek Sulphide site will remain on hold
until a viable option for the processing of ore is identiﬁed.
Exploration work at the Akjilga silver and copper deposit in Tajikistan
continued in 2009 which improved the understanding of the ore
body. At present, Kazakhmys does not believe Akjilga to be of
sufficient scale to develop further and accordingly is reviewing
options for the deposit.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
KAZAKHMYS POWER
Kazakhmys acquired the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal ﬁred power plant
and the Maikuben West coal mine in May 2008. Under an agreement
put in place as part of the acquisition, the assets were managed
by AES Corporation, the previous owner of the power plant and
coal mine. In the second quarter of 2009, Kazakhmys and AES
Corporation ended the management services agreement following
which the power plant and coal mine have been under Kazakhmys’
direct management.
In October 2008, Samruk, announced its intention to acquire a stake
in the power plant, and completed the acquisition of a 50% stake
in Ekibastuz GRES-1 in February 2010. Under the joint venture
agreement introduced as part of the transaction, the power plant
will be operationally managed by a Kazakhmys appointed team for
the next ﬁve years, following which a team selected by Samruk will
assume management for a ﬁve year ﬁxed term. A supervisory board
has been created, containing representatives of both owners, to
oversee the plant’s management team. The business has been
classified as held for sale at the 2009 year end under IFRS, as,
following the sale of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 to Samruk,
the business will be equity accounted as a joint venture.
Going forward, Ekibastuz GRES-1 is expected to source coal almost
exclusively from the Bogatyr mine, which is jointly owned by Samruk
and UC RUSAL. The strategic value in owning the Maikuben West
coal mine has consequently been reduced and Kazakhmys has
determined that the mine is now held for sale.
Demand
The economic downturn had a significant impact on electricity
demand in Kazakhstan and Russia as industrial output fell. In the
ﬁrst quarter of 2009, with energy intensive industrial users reducing
electricity usage, demand was weak and additional supply entered
the market as industrial groups with captive power generation used
surplus power to supply external customers.
From the second quarter of 2009, demand for electricity improved
as industrial production in Kazakhstan and Russia recovered and
industrial groups with captive power generation used an increased
proportion of energy production internally. Scheduled maintenance
at other power plants led to supply outages, enabling Ekibastuz
GRES-1 to supply additional volume into the market.
Power stations in the northern grid of Kazakhstan, including Ekibastuz
GRES-1, were given greater access to the southern and western grids
during 2009 as a consortium led by KEGOC, the operator of the
power network in Kazakhstan, made signiﬁcant improvements to the
transmission lines which link Kazakhstan’s three main electricity grids.
The network upgrades included the completion of a 400 MW
transmission line linking the northern and western grids in
February 2009. A second North to South transmission line was
completed in September 2009, increasing the total capacity
of the North to South line from 650 MW to 1,350 MW.

MARKET AND OPERATIONS REVIEW CONTINUED
These developments enabled Ekibastuz GRES-1 to increase its market
share of the volume of electricity generated in Kazakhstan from
approximately 9% at the commencement of the year to 15%
at the year end.
Electricity demand is forecast to continue to recover in 2010
as industrial activity recovers in Kazakhstan and Russia.
Tariffs
In April 2009, to encourage investment in power generation plants,
the Kazakhstan Government introduced a framework to raise tariff
ceilings for domestic electricity sales for the years 2009 to 2015.
The ceiling prices will be set by the Ministry of Energy on an
annual basis, and are subject to the generator meeting capital
investment commitments.
The Ministry of Energy set Ekibastuz GRES-1 a ceiling tariff in
April 2009 of 3.60 KZT/kWh. With the introduction of the higher
ceiling price and the recovery in electricity demand, Ekibastuz GRES-1
was able to increase electricity tariffs for the domestic market to close
to the ceiling tariff by July 2009. The tariff ceiling for 2010 has been
set at 4.68 KZT/kWh, a level which is expected to be achieved by
Ekibastuz GRES-1 in Kazakhstan during 2010.
Ekibastuz GRES-1 exports around 20% of its electricity generation to
Russia which is surplus to the demand requirements of the Kazakhstan
market. The exports were at lower prices than domestic sales in
Kazakhstan reﬂecting the excess capacity in Russia. Demand in the
Russian electricity market recovered over the course of 2009 due to
improved economic conditions and as supply was impacted by an
accident at Russia’s biggest hydro power plant, Sayano-Shusenskaya,
in August 2009. It is expected that export prices to Russia will rise
in 2010.

2008 comparatives are for the period from acquisition on 29 May 2008.
Net power generated in 2009 was primarily demand driven as the
power plant had spare capacity throughout the year. Demand for
power in Kazakhstan declined at the end of 2008 and remained
subdued in early 2009 but recovered strongly over the second half
of the year. Of the 9,737 GWh net power generated in 2009, 61%
was in the second half, representing growth of 21% over the same
period in 2008. Ekibastuz GRES-1 completed its scheduled annual
maintenance work on the units in September 2009, ahead of
neighbouring power stations, enabling it to take advantage
of the uplift in demand and increase its supply to existing
and new customers over the latter months of the year.
The increase of 3% in net dependable capacity from the prior year
reflects the overhaul work carried out on Unit 6 in 2008, which
returned to operation in October of that year. In 2009, the overhaul
of Unit 5 was completed in November.
Coal extraction from Maikuben West was in line with the prior year
with shipments to Ekibastuz GRES-1 and to third parties.
In 2010, demand for electricity is expected to be at least at the levels
seen in 2009 as the recovery in demand continues. All of the five
operating units at the power plant will undergo annual maintenance
which is scheduled to take units ofﬂine at different times and avoid
peak demand periods to minimise the potential impact on sales.
Unit 3 is scheduled to undergo an overhaul during 2010, with the
completion of the ﬁrst phase of the overhaul planned prior to the
winter season.

Revenues
Revenue for 2009 represents Kazakhmys Power’s ﬁrst full year under
Kazakhmys’ ownership during which sales beneﬁted from electricity
tariff increases in Kazakhstan and Russia, but were negatively
impacted by low sales volumes in the ﬁrst half of 2009 due to the
economic downturn. The revenues, as presented in US dollars, were
also negatively impacted by the tenge devaluation in February 2009.
The average realised electricity price for Ekibastuz GRES-1 in
Kazakhstan rose from 2.79 KZT/kWh in January 2009 to 3.58 KZT/kWh
in December 2009. The strength in demand in Kazakhstan during the
second half of the year enabled the power plant to raise prices and
grow sales volumes at the same time, assisted by the recovery in
industrial production, reduced supply from competitors, and
upgrade of the transmission lines giving access to new customers.
The average electricity tariff price achieved in the year, as shown
in the table above, includes sales to Russia at rates below those
in Kazakhstan. Approximately 20% of sales volumes are exported
to Russia, however in 2009, there were no export sales in the ﬁrst
two months due to extended price negotiations.
Kazakhmys Power’s revenues of $238 million included $29 million
from the Maikuben West coal mine from sales to residential and
industrial users. Third party coal sales volumes decreased by 33%
due to the downturn in electricity demand in Russia compared with
the prior year. Coal prices for sales to third parties remained largely
unchanged from 2008.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
EBITDA (excluding special items)
Almost 90% of Kazakhmys Power’s EBITDA is generated by Ekibastuz
GRES-1. Due to the challenging marketplace in the ﬁrst half of the
year, Kazakhmys Power’s EBITDA by the end of June 2009 was only
$41 million, compared to the second half EBITDA of $79 million,
driven by higher sales volumes and prices.
The coal used by Ekibastuz GRES-1, largely sourced from the nearby
Bogatyr mine, forms the main operating cost of the power plant. Coal
prices at the start of the year were 10% above those in 2008. During
the year, Bogatyr raised prices further and Ekibastuz GRES-1 began
purchasing varying grades of coal to keep the average cost down.
To further control costs, Kazakhmys Power took a number of actions
in 2009 including carrying out repair and maintenance work internally
and implementing projects to improve the efﬁciency of the power plant.
The majority of Kazakhmys Power’s operating costs are denominated
in tenge and therefore partially mitigated the impact of the tenge
devaluation on revenue when reported in US dollars.
Average cost
The cash cost per kWh of electricity decreased by 10% in 2009
due to the measures taken to control costs. Coal costs comprise
approximately 49% of all cash costs; the remaining 51% is made
up of transmission costs, emission taxes, fuel, water, labour, repair
and administrative costs.
Sustaining
Sustaining capital expenditure in 2009 related to work at Ekibastuz
GRES-1 to maintain and improve the operational efficiency of the
existing units. This annual maintenance work was mainly carried out
over the summer period with short-term outages. At the Maikuben
West coal mine, replacement equipment was purchased in order to
fulﬁl the targeted level of stripping works at the mine and to maintain
the mine’s railway network.
Expansionary
The overhaul of Unit 5 to modernise the unit and improve operating
efﬁciency commenced in April 2009 and was successfully completed
with the unit recommencing operations in November 2009. The overhaul
has increased Unit 5’s gross dependable capacity from 430 MW to
its nameplate capacity of 500 MW. A new electrostatic precipitator
is also being ﬁtted on Unit 5, with its installation to complete in
June 2010, avoiding outages during the peak winter period.
Preliminary work was also conducted on the rehabilitation of
Unit 8 during 2009. The rehabilitation programme will involve
the replacement of the majority of Unit 8’s components to bring the
dormant 500 MW unit into production by 2013. The recommencement
of Unit 8 will increase Ekibastuz GRES-1’s total available generation
capacity to 3,000 MW by 2013 and enable Ekibastuz GRES-1
to beneﬁt from the forecast growth in sales tariffs and power
demand in Kazakhstan.
The two other dormant units are scheduled to be restored following
Unit 8. Once the dormant units have been refurbished, the plant
will operate at its nameplate capacity of 4,000 MW. The expansion
programme is dependent upon the achievement of tariff increases
in future years.
The modernisation programme also includes a number of environmental
improvements to the power plant, with the installation of electrostatic
precipitators on all units to reduce ash emissions to international
benchmark standards and improvements to ash disposal systems.
In 2010, capital expenditure will be mainly focused on the rehabilitation
of Unit 8. An overhaul of Unit 3 will also be conducted as part of the
programme to overhaul each unit at Ekibastuz GRES-1 every ﬁve
years. The last overhaul on Unit 3 was performed in 2005.

Kazakhmys Petroleum is the Group’s oil exploration division which
holds the exploration rights to a 602 km
2
exploration block located
to the south of Aktobe in western Kazakhstan. Work has been carried
out on the site, close to a number of producing oil and gas operations,
since its acquisition in May 2007.
The focus of the exploration activities in 2009 was the deep well
drilling programme which commenced in 2008. The ﬁrst deep well,
a copy of a well drilled in the 1980s, reached the target depth of
5,185 metres and testing conﬁrmed the presence of hydrocarbons,
however recoverability was not determined due to technical
difficulties. These have proved complex to overcome and to
complete testing, a side-shaft is being drilled which is scheduled
to reach the desired depth later in 2010.
The main drilling rig used on the ﬁrst deep well was relocated to
a new site and a second deep well was completed at a depth of
5,228 metres. The initial test results have conﬁrmed the presence of
hydrocarbons, however the well pressure was lower than anticipated.
A number of options are being considered to raise the pressure
including hydro and acid treatments.
The drilling of the third deep well commenced in the second half
of 2009 and had reached a depth of 4,312 metres at the end of
December. The projected depth of 5,200 metres is expected
to be achieved by the end of March 2010 with testing to follow.
Further 3D seismic work has been carried out in 2009 on an area
to the northwest of the ﬁeld, previously the subject of a contractual
dispute, which has now been resolved in Kazakhmys Petroleum’s
favour. The results of the testing are being analysed and will be
used to determine the site of a future deep well. In 2010, the third
deep well will be completed and a fourth deep well drilled.

The negative EBITDA is due to the expensing of off-site operating costs,
in particular, the ofﬁce expenses in Almaty and management salaries.
MKM
MKM is the Group’s downstream copper business, which produces
and sells copper and copper alloy semi-ﬁnished products. Based in
Germany, the business is structured in three sections: wire products,
flat products (strips, plates and sheets) and tubes and bars.
Kazakhmys has determined that MKM is not considered a core
business as it is no longer consistent with the Group’s geographic
and strategic focus. The business has therefore been classiﬁed
as held for sale at the 2009 year end.

GVA is Gross Value Added which is calculated as turnover less the input cost
of copper cathode, i.e. MKM’s ‘value add’. It is not a statutory reporting
measure. The GVA ﬁgures are presented in Euros, MKM’s operating currency.
GVA
Gross Value Added (GVA) represents the conversion charge
that customers pay in excess of the copper cathode cost, and
is considered a key performance measure for MKM as it excludes
the impact of changes in the price of copper.
GVA fell by 24% in 2009, principally due to the economic weakness
in Europe, MKM’s core marketplace, which accounts for almost 90% of
sales volumes. Industrial output in the region was severely impacted by
the economic downturn, which led to lower demand across all product
lines. The lack of availability of debtor insurance which forms part of
MKM’s risk management policy, forced MKM to limit sales to certain
customers. These factors led to sales volumes falling by 13% from
273 kt to 237 kt, with reductions across all three sections.
To support sales activities, MKM maintained higher levels of inventory
which enabled more short-term orders to be accepted. Management
also made a number of changes to the structure of the sales force.
MKM was forced to accept lower margins to protect its market position.
Within the wire section, wire rod sales volumes were supported by
high demand in eastern Europe, however, overall volumes were
lower as sales to MKM’s core markets declined. GVA from the wire
section was also impacted in 2009 as a result of lower sales from
the higher margin drawn wire products driven by the weakness in
the automotive industry. Flat products, consisting of plates, strips
and sheets, experienced a 15% decrease in GVA per tonne due
to reduced demand and pricing pressure from competitors.
Tubes and bars saw volumes reduce by 15% due to a slowdown
in building industry activity.
Whilst the ﬁrst half of the year was extremely challenging, MKM
has seen a recovery in orders in the second half of 2009 as the
major European economies returned to growth.
EBITDA (excluding special items)
Although GVA decreased in 2009, EBITDA was $77 million higher than
in the prior year. EBITDA in 2009 includes a positive $58 million IFRS
inventory adjustment due to the rising copper price over the year,
compared to a negative $48 million IFRS adjustment in 2008. Excluding
the impact of the IFRS inventory adjustment and presented in Euros
to better reﬂect underlying performance, EBITDA was €15.0 million
in 2009, €14.9 million lower than in the prior year.
In response to the lower demand, certain production shifts were
cancelled, overtime work was substantially reduced, and temporary
workers were released. Other costs which reduced in 2009 include
utility costs with lower gas prices and energy consumption due to
the decline in production volumes. In addition, maintenance work
was carried out internally where possible.
Capital expenditure in 2009 was restricted due to the economic
downturn. Projects were completed on the tubes, bars and sheets
production lines to improve operational efﬁciency.

Financial summary Capital expenditure Kazakhmys holds an interest of 26% in ENRC PLC, a diversiﬁed
natural resources group with signiﬁcant operations in Kazakhstan.
ENRC listed on the London Stock Exchange in December 2007 and
had a market capitalisation as at 31 December 2009 of $18.8 billion.
ENRC’s operations in Kazakhstan are vertically integrated with
the ENRC group comprising six operating divisions covering
ferroalloys, iron ore, alumina and aluminium, energy, logistics
and other non-ferrous. The other non-ferrous division was added
in November 2009 when ENRC completed its acquisition of
Central African Mining and Exploration Company PLC (CAMEC).
This acquisition adds cobalt and copper to its portfolio of products
and further expands ENRC’s geographic focus.
The ferroalloys division has chrome and manganese mines from
which extracted ore is sold to third party producers or internally
processed into ferrochrome and other ferroalloys. The division’s
chrome reserves are substantial with an attractive grade. A second
chrome ore pelletising plant at Donskoy GOK was completed in
July 2009 providing additional output capacity of 700 kt per annum.
The vertical integration of ENRC includes captive power, a factor
giving ENRC a competitive position on the chrome cost curve.
The iron ore division mines and processes iron ore into concentrate
and pellets for sale principally to steel producers. The large scale
mines and processing plants are relatively low cost, with the position
on the cost curve beneﬁting from captive power production.
ENRC’s alumina and aluminium division is one of the world’s largest
suppliers of traded alumina in the world. The division operates two
bauxite mines which feed an alumina reﬁnery. During 2009, a capacity
expansion programme was commenced at the aluminium smelter,
which is expected to complete in 2010 and increase the smelter’s
production capacity to 250 kt per annum.
The energy division operates a coal-ﬁred power station at Aksu,
in the northern grid of Kazakhstan. The electricity produced is sold
internally to other divisions, with excess power sold to third parties.
The division also has sufficient internal coal supply to meet the
power plant’s needs, with excess coal production sold externally.
The logistics division provides cost effective transportation
and logistics services to ENRC’s operations in Kazakhstan
and to third parties.
The other non-ferrous division incorporates the copper
and cobalt assets of CAMEC in the Democratic Republic of
Congo and development opportunities in other parts of Africa.
In February 2010, ENRC entered into a conditional agreement
for the acquisition of Enya Holdings BV which principally holds
a 90% interest in Chambishi Metals PLC, a Zambian copper
and cobalt producer.

The 2009 results for ENRC are unaudited.
A decline in demand from the stainless steel industry led to lower
prices in the ferroalloys division. In response, chrome ore extraction
and ferrochrome output were reduced and management took
measures to control costs. The second half of 2009 saw strong
demand from China and ferroalloy production returned to full
capacity by the year end. The decrease in the division’s EBITDA
in 2009 was primarily price driven.
The iron ore division was affected by weakness in the steel market at
the start of 2009, which resulted in iron ore extraction being reduced.
Global market demand, led by China, rebounded during 2009 and
ENRC’s iron ore extraction was at near full capacity in the second
half of 2009. The reduction in EBITDA from 2008 was due to a
combination of market prices falling and a move by customers
from pellets to lower priced concentrate.
Alumina volumes were largely unchanged compared to the
prior year due to sales being made under a long-term contract.
Aluminium production increased beneﬁting from a full year at the
aluminium smelter’s phase 1 capacity of 125 kt. The division was
impacted by lower LME aluminium prices, the main factor in the
lower 2009 EBITDA, reﬂecting challenging economic conditions.
Energy production rose in 2009 following the completion of a turbine
refurbishment and other maintenance work. Lower demand from
the other divisions led to a greater volume of electricity being sold
externally compared to the prior year. The second half of 2009
saw internal demand rise as the ferroalloys and iron ore divisions
raised output. The energy division also beneﬁted from rising tariffs
in Kazakhstan for its external sales. The increase in available
generation capacity and higher third party sales contributed
to the division’s EBITDA growth.
Freight forwarding services provided by the logistics division
to external parties declined as internal demand increased.
EBITDA was lower in 2009 as revenue was impacted by a
reduction in railway repair services provided to third parties
and the devaluation of the tenge.
The other non-ferrous division reﬂects the initial contribution
from CAMEC following its acquisition in November 2009.
Kazakhmys adopted equity accounting for its interest in ENRC
when the Group owned in excess of 25% of the issued share
capital of ENRC in the second half of 2008. Kazakhmys’ share of
ENRC’s EBITDA of $423 million recognised for 2009 represents a
full year’s equity accounting, but is below the prior year reﬂecting
the lower pricing for ENRC’s main products during the ﬁrst half
of 2009.

RISK MANAGEMENT
MANAGING GROUP RISKS
The Group, in the course of its business activities, is exposed to
operational and financial risks. The Group’s approach to internal
control is business risk driven, with emphasis on both operational
and financial risks as explained in the Governance Framework
on page 67.
The Board has approved a formalised but pragmatic Group risk
management framework. This framework is designed to provide
assurance that risks are being identiﬁed and managed in a manner
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances. It comprises risk
identiﬁcation and assessment processes, together with risk
response and monitoring activities.
The Group Risk Manager coordinates the risk assessment
and identiﬁcation activities, and facilitates the development of
appropriate responses to identiﬁed risks. Details of the process
for identifying and managing the Group’s risks is set out below and
an overview of the risks identiﬁed are set out on pages 33 to 35.
Kazakhmys’ risk environment has improved signiﬁcantly over the past few years with
progress being made in better understanding and managing the Group’s signiﬁcant
risks and embedding a risk governance framework in operational management processes.
Overall management of these risks is vested in the Board, with the Audit Committee
having delegated authority for reviewing the Group’s risk management framework.

RISK FACTORS
Health, safety and the environment
Mining is a hazardous industry and failure to adopt and embed
health, safety and environmental management systems could result
in harm to Kazakhmys’ employees, the environment and the
communities in which the Group operates as well as ﬁnes and
penalties and damage to its reputation. Policies and measures
at a national and international level to tackle climate change
will increasingly affect the business, presenting environmental
and regulatory risks.
Impact
Health, safety and environmental incidents could lead to a number
of adverse consequences, including harm to people, the environment
and communities near Kazakhmys’ operations as well as production
disruption, reputational damage and ﬁnancial loss.
Action
Kazakhmys recognises that the highest standards of health, safety,
environmental and community practices are vital to its success,
and are a key responsibility of all employees. The Group’s policies
and procedures in these areas are designed to identify relevant
risks and opportunities and provide a clear framework for
conducting business. Further details are set out in the
Corporate Responsibility Report commencing on page 50.
Business interruption
The business of mining, smelting and reﬁning metals and the
production of power is resource intensive, and involves a number
of risks, including, but not limited to, geological and technological
challenges, weather and other natural phenomena such as ﬂood
and earthquake, ﬁres, explosions, equipment failure, delays in
supplies and loss of key inputs including electricity, water, coal,
which can cause prolonged mine or plant shutdowns or periods
of reduced production.
Impact
Any disruption to operational activities could have a negative impact
on the Group’s profitability and cash flows, and may require the
Group to make large unplanned capital expenditures. In addition
to revenue losses, long-term business interruption could result
in a loss of customers and reputational damage.
Action
Work is being carried out across the Group, with the support
of appropriate in-house and third party specialists, to address
operational risk issues. The Group is partially protected from the
loss of key assets by the availability of geographically diversiﬁed
operations and access to multiple power sources.
The Group’s insurance coverage can provide protection from
some, but not all, of the costs that may arise from unforeseen
events. A combined property damage and business interruption
catastrophic insurance programme is in place which can provide
protection from some of the ﬁnancial impact of a major incident
at the Group’s main concentrating, smelting and reﬁning facilities,
and power stations.
Assets controlled by third parties and joint ventures
Kazakhmys holds a 26% investment in ENRC PLC. The business
and financial performance of this investment is not controlled by
the Group. Furthermore in 2010, the Group has entered into a joint
venture arrangement in respect of the ownership and management
of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power station.
Impact
Decisions made by the board of ENRC PLC could have a material
impact on the reported earnings of Kazakhmys. Furthermore, changes
in market or macroeconomic conditions could impact the cash ﬂows
and the valuation of Kazakhmys’ investment in ENRC PLC.
The Group’s partner in the Ekibastuz GRES-1 joint venture may have
business interests inconsistent with those of the Group and may
exercise its right to block certain actions. The partner may take
actions which are inconsistent with the Group’s policies or standards.
Action
Kazakhmys monitors the business and ﬁnancial performance
of its 26% investment in ENRC PLC. The Group has the ability
to exercise its rights as the single largest shareholder of ENRC PLC.
Kazakhmys seeks to ensure that the appropriate governance
structures are in place to manage its Power joint venture in
accordance with the Group’s business interests and that they
are consistent with the Group’s policies and standards. Under
the terms of the joint venture arrangement, Kazakhmys is entitled
to appoint the operational management of the Power plant until
2015, overseen by a supervisory board consisting of
representatives of both joint venture partners.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
The signiﬁcant risks identiﬁed by Kazakhmys are those that could materially affect the
Group’s ﬁnancial condition, performance, strategies and prospects. These should be
carefully considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement set out on the inside
back cover. There may be other risks unknown, or currently believed immaterial,
by Kazakhmys which could turn out to be material.
OPERATIONAL RISKS 34 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
RISK FACTORS CONTINUED
New projects
The development of new projects involves many risks including
geological, engineering, ﬁnancing and regulatory risks. If the Group
fails to adopt an appropriate procurement and project management
strategy, it may experience delays to project schedules and an
increase in costs. Regulatory risks include failure to obtain and
maintain applicable permits, licences or approvals from the
relevant authorities to carry out or operate certain works.
Impact
Projects may fail to achieve the desired economic returns due to
an inability to recover mineral reserves and higher than expected
capital and operating costs. Projects may also suffer delays which
result in a ﬁnancial loss to the Group.
Action
Prior to an investment decision being made, certain activities
are performed including, where appropriate, feasibility and other
technical studies. The Group ensures that sufficient expertise,
from both in-house and third party specialists, is utilised on
projects throughout their life cycle. Furthermore, there are
procedures in place addressing areas such as budgeting
and management of capital expenditure projects.
Political risk
Most of the Group’s mining and power operations are in Kazakhstan.
Accordingly, the Group is substantially dependent on the
social, political, economic, legal and ﬁscal conditions prevailing
in Kazakhstan.
Impact
Changes to Kazakhstan’s foreign trade (export and import), foreign
investments, property, tax, environmental or mining regimes or
other changes that affect the supportive business environment
in Kazakhstan could negatively affect the Group’s business,
ﬁnancial position and performance.
Action
The Government of Kazakhstan has actively pursued a programme
of economic reform, helping to make it one of the most politically
stable and economically developed countries in Central Asia.
The Government of Kazakhstan has representation on the Board
of Kazakhmys and is a signiﬁcant shareholder in the Group.
The Board continues to view the political, social and economic
environment within Kazakhstan favourably, and looking forward,
remains optimistic about the conditions for business in the region.
Kazakhmys maintains a proactive dialogue with the Government
of Kazakhstan across a range of issues.
Subsoil use rights
In Kazakhstan and certain other countries in which the Group
operates, all subsoil reserves belong to the State. Subsoil use
rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be
agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
Rights may be terminated if the Group does not satisfy its licensing
or contractual obligations, which may include periodic payment
of royalties to State authorities and the satisfaction of mining,
development, environmental, health and safety requirements.
Impact
As many of Kazakhstan’s subsoil use laws have been adopted
relatively recently, the legal consequences of a given breach may
not be predictable. However, non-compliance with the requirements
of subsoil use contracts could potentially lead to regulatory challenges
and subsequently to ﬁnes/litigation and ultimately to the loss of
operating licences. The loss of any of the Group’s subsoil use rights
could have a material adverse effect on its mining operations.
Action
The Group’s management makes every effort to engage with
the relevant regulatory authorities and ensure compliance with
all relevant legislation and subsoil use contracts.
Reserves and resources
Kazakhmys’ ore reserves for operating mines and development
projects are largely based on the estimation method for reserves
and resources established by the former Soviet Union. There are
numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and
geological, technical and economic assumptions that are valid
at the time of estimation may change signiﬁcantly when new
information becomes available.
Impact
Changes in reserves could adversely impact mine plans and the
economic viability of projects resulting in economic losses, negatively
impacting the Group’s ﬁnancial position and performance.
Action
Kazakhmys engages the services of independent experts to review
reserve calculations for operating mines and development projects,
normally on an annual basis. For more details refer to page 158.
A project is underway to digitise selected mine reserves which
will be used in the future for revised estimates of reserves and
to support improved estimation of ore grades and mine planning. www.kazakhmys.com 35
Commodity prices
Kazakhmys’ results are strongly inﬂuenced by commodity prices
which are dependent on a number of factors impacting world supply
and demand. Due to these factors, commodity prices may be subject
to signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations from year to year. The Group’s normal policy
is to sell its products under contract at prices determined by reference
to prevailing market prices on international global metal exchanges.
Commodity price ﬂuctuations can also have an impact on demand
for specialist staff, equipment, materials and supplies in the mining
sector, which can cause skills and material shortages and create cost
pressure on the Group’s operating and capital costs, which affect
ﬁnancial performance.
Impact
Commodity prices can ﬂuctuate widely and could have a material
impact on the Group’s asset values, revenues, earnings and
cash flows. In addition, commodity price increases could
cause supply or capacity constraints in areas such as
specialist staff or mining equipment.
Action
The Group keeps under regular review its sensitivity to ﬂuctuations
in commodity prices, and a sensitivity analysis showing the impact
on proﬁts of a 10% movement in commodity prices is set out
on page 23. The Group does not as a matter of course hedge
commodity prices, but may enter into a hedge programme for
certain commodities where the Board determines it is in the
Group’s interest to provide greater certainty over future cash
ﬂows, as was the case in 2009. In response to the reduction in
commodity prices, the Group took a number of actions to control
costs of which further details are set out in the Business Review
on page 22.
Liquidity risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risks, including the risk that
borrowing facilities are not available to meet cash requirements,
and the risk that ﬁnancial assets cannot readily be converted to
cash without the loss of value.
Impact
Failure to manage ﬁnancing risks could have a material impact
on the Group’s cash ﬂows, earnings and ﬁnancial position as well
as reducing the funds available to the Group for working capital,
capital expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and other general
corporate purposes.
Action
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate
committed borrowing facilities and working capital funds.
The Board monitors the net debt level of the Group taking into
consideration the expected outlook of the Group. The Group has
also secured funding for Bozshakol and selected medium-sized
projects. Further details are set out in the Financial Review on
page 46.
Taxation
As the tax legislation in Kazakhstan has been in force for a relatively
short period of time, tax risks in Kazakhstan are substantially greater
than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems.
Tax law is evolving and is subject to different and changing
interpretations, as well as inconsistent enforcement. Tax
regulation and compliance is subject to review and investigation
by the authorities who may impose severe ﬁnes, penalties and
interest charges.
Impact
The uncertainty of interpretation and application, and the evolution,
of tax laws create a risk of additional and substantial payments of
tax by the Group, which could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s cash ﬂows, earnings and ﬁnancial position.
Action
The Group makes every effort to comply with tax legislation,
and works closely with the tax authorities to ensure compliance.
Further details are set out in the Financial Review on page 47.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The ﬁnancial statements presented on pages 86 to 150 have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS. The standards and interpretations
adopted in the year are described on page 94. The accounting policies
have been consistently applied to all years presented. As explained
on page 39, the Kazakhmys Power Division and MKM have been
classified as being held for sale at 31 December 2009. The MKM
and Kazakhmys Power operations represent separate major business
lines of the Group. As a result, these operations have been treated
as discontinued operations at 31 December 2009. A single amount is
shown on the face of the consolidated income statement comprising
the post-tax result of discontinued operations and the post-tax loss
recognised on the re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell of
the discontinued operations. Accordingly, the income and expenses
of both MKM and Kazakhmys Power are reported separately from the
continuing operations of the Group. The consolidated income statement
for the prior year has been restated to conform to this presentation.
The assets and liabilities of these divisions are also separately shown
within the consolidated balance sheet as single line items within
current assets and current liabilities. The consolidated balance sheet
for the prior year has not been restated. The consolidated cash ﬂow
statement includes the cashﬂows of continuing and discontinued
operations for both the current and prior years.

Revenues and EBITDA
The 2009 ﬁnancial year witnessed a substantial recovery in the pricing
of most of the Group’s main products driven largely by governmental
measures in response to the global ﬁnancial crisis. The apparent
bottoming out of the global economy, cutbacks in production and
renewed strong demand for raw materials from China have also
inﬂuenced commodity prices. The signiﬁcant reduction in copper
prices seen during the fourth quarter of 2008 eased at the beginning
of 2009 with prices stabilising, but at levels well below the highs
experienced in the last few years. These low prices proved to be short
lived and copper prices started to increase in the second quarter of
2009 with a particular upward trend in the last quarter of the year.
Copper closed the year at $7,346 per tonne, 139% higher than the
price at the start of the year. Signiﬁcant increases in prices were
also seen for zinc and silver which increased in price by 111% and
53% respectively, and gold maintained its strength during a year
of uncertainty.
Copper cathode equivalent sales of 341 kt were 12% lower compared
to 2008 reﬂecting lower production volumes following the suspension
of mining activities at certain high cost mines at the end of 2008.
Limited production from purchased concentrate also reduced sales
but this was offset by a reduction in ﬁnished goods inventories
at the start of the year. With lower sales volumes and copper
prices, revenues from copper cathode equivalent sales fell from
$2,605 million in 2008 to $1,711 million in 2009. The average realised
price for copper cathode was $5,024 per tonne, 3% lower than the
LME price for the year as a higher proportion of sales took place in
the ﬁrst half of 2009 when the average realised copper price was
$4,024 per tonne compared to $6,378 per tonne in the second half
of the year.
Revenues from zinc metal and zinc metal in concentrate were in line
with 2008 at $146 million. Zinc metal sales fell by 78% to $19 million
following the suspension of activity at the zinc smelter in March 2009,
but this was offset by an increase in zinc metal in concentrate sales
which increased by 107% to $127 million as zinc production beneﬁted
from the processing of stockpiled ore and improved recovery rates
at the concentrators. Revenues from silver were in line with the prior
year at $251 million, and revenues from gold were up 17% to
$127 million reﬂecting higher prices and sales volumes.
Overall, revenues from continuing operations fell by 27% to
$2,404 million in 2009 primarily as a result of the 25% reduction
in average realised copper price from $6,714 per tonne in 2008
to $5,024 per tonne in 2009 and lower sales volumes of copper
cathode equivalent.
In February 2009 the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced
that it would support the tenge, within a range of 3%, at a lower
level of 150 KZT/$, resulting in a devaluation of approximately 25%.
Whilst the devaluation has a beneficial impact on the profitability
of the Kazakhmys Copper mining business as its revenues are mostly
based on US dollar metals prices and approximately 30% to 40%
of its costs are denominated in tenge, there is an adverse impact
on the proﬁtability of the Kazakhmys Power business, which is
included within discontinued operations, since its revenues
and costs are largely denominated in tenge. www.kazakhmys.com 37
In response to the market conditions that existed at the end of 2008
and beginning of 2009, management successfully implemented a
series of cost cutting measures in the operating businesses. Within
the Kazakhmys Copper Division, the decision to suspend mining
activities at certain high cost mines, productivity improvements at the
concentrators and smelters and the phasing out of use of purchased
concentrate in the production process resulted in substantial
reductions in raw material costs compared to 2008. Furthermore, the
impact of a lower consumer price index in Kazakhstan and reduced
global mining industry inﬂation had a beneﬁcial impact on input costs
with cost pressures for fuel costs, mining consumables and employee
costs diminishing. As mentioned above, the devaluation of the
Kazakhstan tenge also improved the proﬁtability of the Kazakhmys
Copper business. The impact of the devaluation of the tenge may
prove to be inﬂationary and could potentially push up input prices
denominated in tenge in the short to medium term.
In January 2009, the Group commenced a hedging programme
which was intended to cover production from the higher cost mines
in the Zhezkazgan region such that the viability of these mines was
protected in the event of a decrease in the copper price below
$3,000 per tonne. The hedges covered 90 kt, or approximately 30%
of the estimated copper production for 2009, and established a price
protecting ﬂoor and a cap to the price receivable on the hedged
copper sales. During the ﬁrst quarter of the year, the average copper
price was between the ﬂoor and the cap and no settlement on the
hedges was required. However, as the copper price began to rise
above the cap in the second quarter, settlement of the hedges was
required resulting in a cash outﬂow and an expense of $129 million
being recognised in the income statement. This contrasts against a
$143 million gain in 2008 from hedging activities when forward
commodity contracts were used, in limited situations, to hedge
against copper quotational period differences on the price
ﬁxations between intragroup purchases and sales to end users.
Special items
In light of developments impacting the Group’s medium and major
projects and the general economic environment experienced during
2009, management have taken a number of operational decisions
which have resulted in a series of impairment charges being
recognised in the Group accounts. The signiﬁcant impairment
charges recognised in the consolidated income statement for
continuing operations are:
• an impairment charge of $50 million has been recognised in relation
to property, plant and equipment within the Kazakhmys Copper
Division primarily due to the curtailment of the Division’s capital
expenditure programme in the last 18 months and a focus on
selected projects only;
• an impairment charge of $23 million has been recognised in relation
to the Kazakhmys Gold Division following a decision not to proceed
with the Akjilga development project in Tajikistan in the foreseeable
future as more economically attractive projects exist within the
Group; and
• provisions against inventories includes an amount of $14 million
in respect of certain by-products held in stock at the end of the
year which have been written down to the lower of cost and net
realisable value reﬂecting a fall in the market value of these
by-products.
Total special items for continuing operations amounted to $88 million
compared to $366 million in 2008. Special items in respect of
discontinued operations of $256 million are explained on page 40.
Equity accounting
Following the share exchange with the Government and incremental
market purchases of shares during the second half of 2008, the Group’s
shareholding in ENRC stands at 26%. As the Directors are of the view
that the Group has the ability to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the
operating and ﬁnancial policies of ENRC, the Group has accordingly
equity accounted for its interest in ENRC.
The share of proﬁts from the associate recognised in the consolidated
income statement for the full year, net of tax, is $223 million based
on the unaudited results of ENRC for the year ended 31 December
2009 which were published on 24 March 2010. This contrasts against
a ﬁgure of $255 million in 2008 which arose from ﬁve months of
equity accounted earnings only.
Under equity accounting, dividends received from ENRC of
$84 million during 2009 have not been recognised in the consolidated
income statement, but are instead netted off against the carrying
value of the investment in associate in the consolidated balance sheet.
Based on the 2009 ﬁnal dividend announced by ENRC on
24 March 2010 of 6 US cents per share, the Group should
receive $20 million in June 2010.
Reconciliation of Group EBITDA (excluding special items)
Consistent with other international mining companies, EBITDA
(excluding special items) has been chosen as the key measure in
assessing the underlying trading performance of the Group. This
performance measure removes depreciation, depletion, amortisation
and non-recurring or variable items in nature which do not impact the
underlying trading performance of the Group.
Following the change in tax legislation in Kazakhstan on 1 January
2009 which introduced the mineral extraction tax (MET), this tax is
now excluded from the EBITDA (excluding special items) key ﬁnancial
indicator. The Directors believe that the exclusion of the MET
provides a more informed measure of the operational proﬁtability
of the Group given the nature of the tax as further explained in
the ‘Taxation’ section on page 38.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW 38 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Total segmental EBITDA (excluding special items) fell by 26% to
$1,211 million given the lower proﬁtability of Kazakhmys Copper
during 2009 compared to 2008, and despite the inclusion of a full
year of earnings from Kazakhmys Power which was acquired in
May 2008. Group EBITDA (excluding special items) fell by 21%
to $1,634 million. Included within Group EBITDA (excluding special
items) is the Group’s share of EBITDA of ENRC of $423 million based
on its published unaudited results for 2009. A full year of earnings
from ENRC is included for 2009 compared to 2008 when the Group
commenced equity accounting in August 2008.
Net ﬁnance items
Net ﬁnance income for the year was $256 million compared to a net
ﬁnance expense of $43 million in 2008. This difference is primarily
due to the impact of the devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge in
February 2009. An exchange gain of $336 million from continuing
operations has arisen in the year as a result of the re-translation of
US dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities within the
Group’s Kazakhstan subsidiaries as a direct result of the devaluation,
since the businesses in Kazakhstan have a tenge functional currency.
Furthermore, the Group has incurred interest charges of $51 million
during the year (2008: $49 million) on the pre-export ﬁnance debt
facility (PXF) which carries a margin of US$ LIBOR plus 1.25%.
In December 2008, the Group took out a series of six month
and 12 month interest rate swaps to hedge against the impact of
short-term volatility in US$ LIBOR rates thereby ﬁxing the estimated
cost of servicing a substantial proportion of the outstanding PXF
balance at 2.08%, including margin, for 2009. These swaps had
expired by 31 December 2009.
Record low US$ LIBOR rates that were seen during 2009, combined
with the lower average cash balances in the Group compared to
2008, has meant that interest income earned on cash and deposit
balances fell to $8 million from $21 million in 2008.
Taxation
Mineral extraction tax
The Government of Kazakhstan introduced a new Tax Code which
came into force on 1 January 2009. The new tax legislation reduced
corporate income tax (CIT) rates over a number of years, with the
CIT rate being reduced from 30% to 20% for the year ended
31 December 2009. Off-setting the reduction in CIT rates was the
introduction of the mineral extraction tax which is similar in nature
to the royalties that were levied prior to 1 January 2009. The MET
is a revenue based tax based on the volume and metal content of
extracted ore and global commodity prices and is determined largely
independently of the proﬁtability of operations. Given the signiﬁcant
increases in commodity prices in the second half of the year,
particularly for copper, the Group has recognised an expense of
$164 million for the full year in relation to the MET within cost of
sales, which compared to an expense of $71 million for the ﬁrst
half of the year.
Transfer pricing
Included within the tax charge is $28 million in respect of a transfer
pricing provision for 2009. New transfer pricing legislation came into
force on 1 January 2009 as part of the introduction of the new Tax
Code. This new legislation removed the 10% safe harbour provision
which was permitted under the previous transfer pricing legislation
and has been replaced by the concept of the ‘arm’s length principle’.
However, this new legislation does not fully reﬂect the arm’s length
concept which forms the underlying basis of transfer pricing
legislation within many OECD countries. The Group has recognised
a transfer pricing provision of $28 million as at 31 December 2009
based on management’s interpretation of the new transfer pricing
legislation and the prevailing status of discussions with the tax
authorities. The transfer pricing charge increases the Group’s
effective tax rate by 2.7% in 2009.
Excess proﬁts tax
The new tax legislation also removed the tax stabilisation of subsoil
use contracts which allowed the Government to amend the excess
proﬁts tax (EPT) methodology. Based on 2009 production and
material ﬂows within the Kazakhmys Copper Division, there is no
EPT charge for the year, compared to a charge of $28 million
in 2008.
Deferred income tax
The income tax expense for the year includes a charge of $7 million in
respect of deferred income tax. This debit arises due to the enactment
of new tax legislation within Kazakhstan in November 2009, effective
from 1 January 2010, such that the corporate income tax rate for the
years 2010-2012 has been frozen at 20%, rather than being gradually
reduced from 20% in 2009 to 15% in 2011 as was previously expected
under the Tax Code which was effective from 1 January 2009. The
deferred tax liabilities within the Group’s Kazakh businesses have
been recalculated taking into account the higher corporate income
tax rates resulting from the new Kazakh tax legislation for the
years 2010-2012.
Other
The Group’s interest in the earnings of ENRC is included, net of tax,
in the consolidated income statement below the Group’s operating
proﬁt in arriving at proﬁt before taxation, thereby reducing the
Group’s effective tax rate by 6.0%.
Non-deductible expenses for 2009 of $49 million are $34 million
higher than the prior year. $26 million of the increase is due to the
copper hedging programme within Kazakhmys LLC, such that no
tax deduction is available for the $129 million hedging loss given
the non-deductibility of these losses under Kazakhstan tax legislation.
The impact of the non-deductibility of these losses increased the
Group’s effective tax rate by 2.5% in 2009.
Withholding taxes of $18 million have been recognised in
2009 in relation to the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries as
at 31 December 2009, which are expected to be remitted to the
UK in the future through dividend distributions from Kazakhstan.
This factor contributed an additional 1.8% to the effective tax
rate in 2009.

All-in effective tax rate is calculated as the income tax expense plus the MET
and removing the tax effect of special items and other non-recurring items,
divided by proﬁt before taxation which is adjusted for the MET, hedging
gains/losses, special items and other non-recurring items and the share
of proﬁts from the associate.
Whilst the effective rate of tax for 2009 was 25.4% compared to a
rate of 28.3% in the prior year, the all-in effective tax rate, which is a
more representative tax rate on the recurring profits of the Group’s
managed businesses, was significantly higher at 42.5% compared
to 30.1% in 2008 primarily as a result of the introduction of the MET.
During periods of low copper prices, the all-in effective tax rate
is signiﬁcantly higher than the effective tax rate as the MET is
determined largely independently of the proﬁtability of operations.
However, as both the copper price and proﬁtability of operations
increase, the all-in effective tax rate decreases as the impact of the
MET lessens, given its revenue-based nature. Whilst higher copper
prices result in a higher absolute amount of taxes being levied, the
all-in effective tax rate decreases.
Future tax charges are materially affected by the application
of different taxes and tax rates in Kazakhstan. Although new tax
legislation, effective from 1 January 2010, freezes the CIT rate within
Kazakhstan at 20% for the years 2010-2012, with a phased reduction
in rates of 17.5% for 2013 and 15% for 2014 and beyond, higher
levels of MET will offset the beneﬁt arising from the lower CIT rates.
As explained above, the Group’s all-in effective tax rate will be
dependent on copper prices in the future given the nature of MET.
Discontinued operations
As explained above in the ‘Basis of preparation’ section on page
36, the Kazakhmys Power Division and MKM have been classiﬁed
as being held for sale and as discontinued operations within the
ﬁnancial statements.
Following the announcement on 10 December 2009 that the Group
had agreed to dispose of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP , a wholly
owned subsidiary within the Kazakhmys Power Division, to Samruk
for a consideration of $681 million, the Directors have classiﬁed the
entity as being held for sale and as a discontinued operation within
the ﬁnancial statements. The transaction completed in February 2010
and the Group has retained a 50% non-controlling interest in
the entity which shall be accounted for as a joint venture
after completion.
Furthermore, the Directors have decided to dispose of the Maikuben
West coal mine, also within the Kazakhmys Power Division, following
a change in the long-term strategy of the coal mine as a result of
the sale of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP to Samruk. This entity
has therefore been classiﬁed as an asset held for sale and as a
discontinued operation within the ﬁnancial statements.
Additionally, the Directors have decided to dispose of MKM given
that the Group’s strategy is to focus on natural resource opportunities
within the Central Asian region. This business has therefore been
classiﬁed as an asset held for sale and as a discontinued operation.
The proﬁt after tax of Kazakhmys Power and MKM, together with
impairment losses and any write down to fair value are included
within the consolidated income statement as part of the loss for the
year from discontinued operations. Prior to MKM and Kazakhmys
Power being reclassiﬁed as assets held for sale, impairment reviews
have been performed to write down the divisions to their recoverable
amount. Once classiﬁed as an asset held for sale, a further write down
is recognised to record the division at its expected fair value from a
disposal. A summary of the loss/proﬁt from discontinued operations
is shown below, with the 2008 comparatives having been restated:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW 40 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Kazakhmys Power
Kazakhmys Power made a net loss before tax for the year of
$79 million. Included within this amount is a foreign exchange loss
of $53 million arising as a result of the devaluation of the Kazakhstan
tenge in February 2009. An impairment loss of $69 million has been
recognised in order to write down the carrying value of Maikuben
West LLP to its recoverable amount. No impairment loss has been
recognised in relation to Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP . Excluding the
impact of the foreign exchange loss and impairment losses, the
proﬁt before tax of Kazakhmys Power would have been $43 million.
Treating the impairment loss as a special item, the EBITDA
(excluding special items) of Kazakhmys Power is $120 million for
2009, compared to $42 million for 2008. This increase is due to the
inclusion of a full year of earnings from Kazakhmys Power for 2009
compared to only seven months for 2008 and the impact of higher
tariff prices and a cost reduction programme within the business
during 2009. These factors have been offset by the devaluation
of the tenge which adversely impacted proﬁtability.
Even though the disposal of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP was announced
during 2009, and the cash proceeds of $681 million were received
by the Group in December 2009, since the disposal was conditional
upon receiving shareholder approval and regulatory clearances which
were only obtained in February 2010, the proﬁt arising on disposal
was recognised when all approvals were obtained and legal
completion occurred i.e. in the 2010 ﬁnancial year.
MKM
EBITDA (excluding special items) of MKM is $76 million for 2009,
compared to a loss of $1 million for 2008. MKM’s performance
during 2009 has been adversely impacted by the economic weakness
in Europe, its core marketplace. However, MKM’s earnings under
IFRS are also distorted by an inventory adjustment as a result of the
combined impact of copper price ﬂuctuations on the valuations of
inventories and inventory levels (2009: positive impact of $58 million,
2008: negative impact of $48 million).
MKM made a loss before tax for the year of $141 million. Included
within this figure is an impairment loss of $187 million arising as
a result of writing down the business to its recoverable amount
and subsequently re-measuring MKM’s net assets to fair value.
This impairment loss excludes provisions against trade receivables
of $3 million. Offsetting the write down of $187 million is a $27 million
one-off deferred tax credit, taking the post-tax MKM write-off to
$160 million. The impairment loss and write down to fair value
are treated as special items.
Underlying Proﬁt and earnings per share
Proﬁt for the year attributable to the owners of the Company from
continuing operations decreased to $768 million from $819 million
in 2008. Underlying Profit is seen as a more informed measure of
the performance of the Group as it removes non-recurring or variable
non-trading items from profit attributable for the year, and their
resulting tax and minority interest impacts. It therefore provides
a more consistent basis for comparing the underlying trading
performance of the Group between 2009 and 2008.
The reconciliation of Underlying Proﬁt from proﬁt attributable to
owners of the Company is set out below. The 2009 ﬁgures have

Basic earnings per share decreased by 44% to $1.04 from
continuing and discontinued operations. Earnings per share
based on Underlying Profit from continuing and discontinued
operations was $1.13 compared to $2.27 for the prior year,
a decrease of 50%. Earnings per share based on Underlying
Profit from continuing operations decreased by 56% to $1.02.
The reduction in both measures of EPS is as a result of the lower
underlying proﬁtability of the Group during the year, as well as
an increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue
which increased from 490.3 million in 2008 to 535.1 million in 2009
following the share exchange with the Government in July 2008.
Dividends
The dividend policy established at the time of Listing was for the
Company to maintain a dividend policy which took into account the
proﬁtability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the
Group, as well as its cash ﬂows and growth requirements. The Directors
would also ensure that dividend cover is prudently maintained.
In light of the global economic environment and uncertainty over the
sustainability of any recovery during 2009, together with the Group’s
need to meet funding requirements, no dividends were paid by the
Company during 2009. Dividend payments of $200 million were paid
in 2008 which comprised the 2007 ﬁnal dividend of 27.4 US cents per
share ($125 million) and the 2008 interim dividend of 14.0 US cents
per share ($75 million).
Following the improvement in economic conditions with higher
commodity prices being seen for the Group’s products, the sharp
reduction in the Group’s net debt position and the funding which
has been put in place for the Bozshakol project and the Group’s
medium-sized development projects, the Directors have decided
to reinstate a dividend payment in respect of the 2009 ﬁnancial year.
Accordingly the Directors recommend a final dividend in respect
of the year ended 31 December 2009 of 9.0 US cents per share
($48 million) which reﬂects a 10.4% pay-out ratio of the Group’s full
year Underlying Proﬁts as adjusted for the removal of ENRC’s equity
accounted earnings but including dividends received from ENRC
during the year. Subject to approval of shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting to be held on 14 May 2010, the dividend shall
be paid on 18 May 2010.

Summary of the year
Lower earnings were the main driver behind the reduced cash ﬂows
from operating activities, but an adverse movement in working capital
movements, primarily arising within MKM, offset by markedly lower
tax payments, also reduced cash flows from operating activities
compared to the prior year. Cash flows from operating activities
were $820 million for the year, a decrease of $279 million compared
to the prior year. Given lower levels of sustaining capital expenditure,
Free Cash Flow, a key performance indicator of the Group’s ability
to translate earnings into cash ﬂow, was a healthy $579 million.
Working capital
Working capital levels for the Group increased by $216 million during
the year. This adverse working capital movement is primarily due to:
• an increase in work in progress within the smelters in Kazakhmys
Copper in the last quarter of the year which will be processed into
copper cathodes during 2010;
• negative ﬁnal pricing adjustments on provisionally priced contracts
at 31 December 2008 within Kazakhmys Copper of approximately
$50 million were paid to Chinese customers in January and
February 2009 due to the sharp fall in copper prices at the end of
2008. This contributed to the adverse working capital movement in
respect of trade and other payables within Kazakhmys Copper;
• an increase in the level of trade receivables within the Kazakhmys
Copper Division given the sharp increase in commodity prices seen
during the second half of the year; and
• within MKM the adverse working capital impact on inventory levels
of $102 million and trade receivables of $16 million was largely
commodity price driven.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW 42 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Despite these adverse working capital movements, working capital
levels are being tightly controlled and managed across all of the
Group’s businesses.
Interest cash ﬂows
Interest paid during the year was $63 million, $7 million lower than in
2008. The impact of lower US$ LIBOR interest rates during 2009 and
the interest rate swaps that were taken out at the end of 2008 resulted
in the average interest rate during the year on the Group’s PXF being
2.08% compared to 3.92% in 2008. The impact of lower interest rates
was offset by the payment of 12 months of interest on the PXF in
2009 compared to seven months in 2008, as the facility was drawn
down in May 2008 to fund the acquisition of Kazakhmys Power.
Lower average cash balances throughout the year, coupled with
the lower US$ interest rates in 2009, also meant that interest income
received on cash and deposits fell from $28 million to $10 million
in 2009.
Income taxes and mineral extraction tax
The level of income taxes paid for the year was $144 million
which is signiﬁcantly lower than the $621 million paid in 2008.
This sharp reduction is primarily as a result of the lower earnings of
the Group for the year and the corresponding level of payments on
account being made to the Kazakhstan tax authorities. In addition, at
31 December 2008 Kazakhmys Copper had an income tax receivable
balance of approximately $100 million as a result of the payments on
account being made during 2008 not taking into account the sharp
reduction in proﬁtability seen in the last quarter of the year. Payments
on account for the ﬁrst quarter of 2009 continued to be based on the
signiﬁcantly higher level of earnings for 2008, with agreement being
reached with the tax authorities in the second quarter that no further
payments on account would be required until the tax receivable
balance had been utilised. Given the increase in commodity prices
and higher proﬁtability of Kazakhmys Copper in the second quarter
and thereafter, this income tax receivable balance was fully utilised in
the second half of the year and payments on account recommenced.
In addition to the income taxes paid, $120 million of taxes were
paid in respect of the MET. Of the total MET expense recognised of
$164 million, $44 million remained unpaid at the year end, and this
was paid in the ﬁrst quarter of 2010.
Capital expenditure
As a result of the market conditions that existed at the end of 2008,
capital expenditure during the year was sharply curtailed; sustaining
capital expenditure was $143 million lower at $241 million
compared to the prior year, and expansionary and new project
capital expenditure was $123 million lower at $187 million. Existing
supply contracts were also renegotiated in light of the economic
environment which also contributed to a reduction in capital
expenditure across the year.
Despite this reduction in capital expenditure, major items of
expenditure during the year included expenditure on the
pre-feasibility studies on Aktogay and Bozshakol, expenditure
on the Zhezkazgan and Balkhash smelters to improve recovery
rates, ramping up of the West Nurkazgan underground mine
which commenced mining operations in February 2009, purchase
of essential new machinery at mines to maintain operations, the
overhaul at Unit 5 and initial expenditure on the rehabilitation
of Unit 8 at Ekibastuz GRES-1, and continued exploration work
within Kazakhmys Petroleum.
Investing cash ﬂows
The Group paid $3 million in January 2009 as deferred consideration
relating to the Kazakhmys Power acquisition. Furthermore, as
explained below, on termination of the management contract of
the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power plant and Maikuben West coal mine, the
Group paid an additional $80 million in April 2009 under the earnout
agreement relating to the 2008 ﬁnancial year. The Group paid a
further $102 million under the termination agreement in October
2009 by cash collateralising early a standby letter of credit to AES
Corporation (AES).
Payment of $681 million was also received in respect of the disposal
of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP to Samruk as discussed below in
the ‘Discontinued operations’ section on page 43.
Dividends received
The Group received dividends of $84 million from ENRC in 2009,
compared to $38 million in 2008. As explained on page 37, these
dividends have been credited against the carrying value of the
investment in ENRC rather than being included within earnings.
BALANCE SHEET
Summary of movements
Equity attributable to owners of the Company was $6,582 million
at 31 December 2009, a decrease of $895 million compared to the
balance as at 31 December 2008. Whilst the Group has been proﬁtable
for the year, the impact of the devaluation of the tenge has given rise
to a non-cash foreign exchange loss within equity of $1,133 million
primarily due to the retranslation on consolidation of the Group’s
Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional currency is the tenge.

ROCE decreased from 21% in 2008 to 11% in 2009 primarily due
to the lower earnings within the Group and the impact of equity
accounting for ENRC whereby equity accounted earnings for 2009
were $223 million while the investment had a carrying value in the
consolidated balance sheet of $3,917 million at 31 December 2009.
ENRC
The Group’s 26% investment in ENRC is shown within investment
in associate in the consolidated balance sheet and has a book value
of $3,869 million at 31 December 2009 compared to $4,045 million
at 31 December 2008, as the Group’s share of equity accounted
earnings of $223 million for the year has been offset by $84 million
of dividends received from ENRC in 2009 and the net share of losses
of the associate recognised within equity of $310 million. Most of
these losses relate to the non-cash foreign exchange loss arising on
the devaluation of the tenge and the resulting impact on ENRC’s net
assets. At 31 December 2009, the ENRC shareholding had a market
value of $4,879 million based on the public price quotation on the
London Stock Exchange.
Net debt
Net debt consists of cash and cash equivalents, current investments
and borrowings. A summary of the net debt position of continuing
operations is shown below:

Excludes MKM and Kazakhmys Power for 2009.
The Group’s net debt position (net of capitalised arrangement fees
of $12 million) stood at $689 million at 31 December 2009 compared
with $1,628 million at 31 December 2008. The reduction in net debt
is primarily due to the receipt of $681 million in December 2009 prior
to completion of the disposal of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP to
Samruk in February 2010. The net debt of MKM and the Kazakhmys
Power Division at 31 December 2009 was $115 million.
Whilst net debt levels initially increased at the beginning of
2009 as commodity prices remained depressed, in addition to
the $681 million received from Samruk, the beneﬁcial impact of
stronger commodity prices seen during the second half of the year,
tight working capital management, the curtailment in the capital
expenditure programme and dividend receipts from ENRC had the
effect of reducing the overall net debt position. Monthly repayments
under the PXF of $44 million commenced in March 2009 with
$438 million of capital being repaid during the year, thereby reducing
the outstanding balance drawn under the PXF to $1,662 million at
31 December 2009. Repayments will continue until March 2013.
On 26 August 2008 the Group signed a $200 million revolving credit
facility with a group of banks for general corporate purposes and to
provide standby liquidity. On 30 March 2009 the facility was reduced
to $150 million and extended to 31 March 2010. On 26 March 2010
the $150 million facility was extended for an additional year to
March 2011. The facility has remained undrawn since its inception.
A further one year revolving credit facility for $100 million was signed
on 11 March 2010 with a maturity date in March 2011, thereby taking
the total revolving credit facilities available to the Group to $250 million
as at 29 March 2010.
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds
within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds
remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital
purposes. The funds within the UK are held within Western European
and US ﬁnancial institutions and their triple ‘A’ rated managed
liquidity funds. At 31 December 2009, $776 million of cash and
current investments were held in the UK, with $181 million being
held in Kazakhstan.
The Group’s liquidity requirements are met by ensuring adequate
working capital is available within Kazakhstan, surplus funds are
repatriated to the UK on a timely basis and accessing the revolving
credit facility if required.
On 30 December 2009, the Group announced that it had arranged
up to $2.7 billion of loan facilities with China Development Bank
(CDB) and Samruk, allocated from a $3.0 billion ﬁnancing line
agreed between CDB and Samruk. Of the $2.7 billion arranged
for Kazakhmys, facility agreements were signed for $2.1 billion on
30 December 2009, and for a further $200 million on 12 January 2010,
for the development of the Group’s projects at Bozymchak and
Bozshakol and other development projects, with the balance
of $400 million remaining available over the next three years.
Discontinued operations
As explained above in the ‘Basis of preparation’ section on page 36,
the Kazakhmys Power Division and MKM have been classiﬁed as
being held for sale and as discontinued operations within the ﬁnancial
statements. As a result of this classiﬁcation, the assets and liabilities of
these divisions are separately shown within the consolidated balance
sheet as single line items within current assets and current liabilities.
Current assets includes $1,615 million in respect of assets classiﬁed as
held for sale, which is primarily made up of $443 million of goodwill
and $801 million of property, plant and equipment, which relates to
Kazakhmys Power, inventories and trade receivables of $187 million
and $121 million, respectively, within MKM, and cash of $42 million
within Kazakhmys Power. Current liabilities include $460 million of
liabilities directly associated with assets classiﬁed as held for sale,
and is primarily made up of borrowings within MKM of $157 million,
provisions within Kazakhmys Power of $109 million and a deferred
tax liability of $110 million, of which $105 million relates to
Kazakhmys Power.
Kazakhmys Power
As explained in the ‘Discontinued operations’ section on page 39,
following the announcement on 10 December 2009, the Group
agreed to dispose 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP , a wholly owned
subsidiary within the Kazakhmys Power Division, to Samruk for a
consideration of $681 million. Since the transaction did not complete
until February 2010, when all necessary approvals had been received,
at 31 December 2009, a liability of $681 million is included within
trade and other payables as part of continuing operations.
In March 2009, the Group agreed the early completion of
the management contract with AES, such that management
of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power plant and Maikuben West coal
mine transferred to the Group during the second quarter of the year.
The early completion agreement included an earnout of $80 million
for the 2008 ﬁnancial year which was paid in April 2009, and a
payment of $102 million which was due for payment in January 2010.
The $102 million payment was covered by a standby letter of credit
to AES which had to be cash collateralised by 15 December 2009.
In light of surplus funds being held by the Group, the letter of credit
was cash collateralised early in October 2009, thereby extinguishing
any remaining liabilities due to AES as a result of the acquisition
of Kazakhmys Power in May 2008.

MKM
In June 2009, the MKM trade finance facility was refinanced
with a syndicate of banks. The size of the facility was reduced
from €230 million to €170 million, due to lower copper prices at
the time of reﬁnancing and more efﬁcient management of inventory.
The new trade ﬁnance facility is for a three year period with interest
being payable on drawn balances at a rate of EURIBOR + 3.00%.
The facility amortises over a 12 month period after June 2011 based
on the drawn balance as at 31 May 2011. At 31 December 2009,
borrowings under this facility were $157 million, up from $121 million
at 31 December 2008 as a result of higher working capital requirements
due to rising copper prices towards the end of the year.

The Group is subject to taxation in the UK and the various foreign
countries in which it operates. Tax legislation of the jurisdictions in
which the Group operates differs and is subject to interpretation by
management and the government authorities, and as such, creates
a risk of non-compliance with speciﬁc tax requirements. Whilst the
Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with tax
legislation and contractual terms entered into that relate to tax, the
absence of established case history, the complexity and judgemental
nature of tax legislation in certain jurisdictions result in additional
risk for the Group. Specific areas of interpretation include the
determination of the mineral extraction tax expense for each subsoil
contract, the applicability of excess proﬁts tax to the Group’s mining
and processing operations and the structuring of cross border
transactions, particularly in respect of the application of transfer
pricing policies.
The Group’s core objectives in managing and controlling its tax
affairs and related tax risks are as follows:
• ensuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations in
the jurisdictions in which the Group operates; and
• structuring the business in the most efﬁcient and transparent
manner with the emphasis being on the maximisation of
shareholder value.
The Group takes a responsible and transparent approach to the
management and control of its tax affairs and related tax risks, and
has therefore adopted a tax strategy, which has been approved by
the Board, that is aimed at achieving the objectives, thereby aligning
it with the Group’s long-term strategy:
• the Group’s tax risks are assessed as part of the Group’s formal
governance processes and are reviewed by the Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer who reports them to the Audit Committee on a
regular basis;
• signiﬁcant tax risks, implications arising from those risks and
potential mitigating actions are considered by the Board when
strategic decisions are being taken;
• the tax risks of proposed transactions or new areas of business
are fully considered before proceeding;
• the half year and annual effective tax rate and the composition
of the tax charge are reviewed by the Audit Committee as part
of their remit in reviewing the half-yearly and annual reports;
• the Group builds an equitable relationship with the tax authorities
in the jurisdictions in which it operates;
• the Group takes appropriate tax advice from reputable
professional ﬁrms;
• where disputes arise with government authorities with regard to
the interpretation and application of tax legislation, the Group is
committed to addressing the matter promptly and resolving the
matter with the relevant tax authority in an open and constructive
manner; and
• the Group employs professional tax managers within the corporate
head ofﬁce and the operating businesses, and provides ongoing
technical training to them.
Total tax contribution
During 2009, the Group paid $517 million (2008: $861 million) in
taxes across the countries in which it has a presence. Company taxes,
such as corporate income taxes, the mineral extraction tax, excess
proﬁts tax, royalties and employer taxes, comprised $420 million
(2008: $802 million) of this total. In addition, the Group indirectly
contributed $97 million (2008: $59 million) in employee taxes and
withholding taxes primarily on interest payments and dividends,
which the Group collected on behalf of government authorities
and paid over to them.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Background
The Board is committed to maintaining a high standard of
ﬁnancial risk management within the Group. The Group’s policies
with regard to ﬁnancial risk management are clearly deﬁned and
consistently applied.
The Group’s principal business is the identiﬁcation, extraction
and processing of mineral resources. The Group does not engage
in trading activities and sales contracts are generally negotiated with
trading companies or end users. The pricing basis applied in all sales
contracts is referenced to prevailing market benchmarks such as the
‘ofﬁcial’ settlement prices quoted by the London Metals Exchange
(LME). In general, the policy of the Group is not to hedge the
underlying price exposure to its principal commodities, although in
periods of high uncertainty or volatility the Group may consider some
hedging of revenue and cost items in order to reduce volatility or risk
on the Group’s cash ﬂows. The Board may in certain circumstances
authorise commodity hedging in order to guarantee the longer-term
viability of certain marginal cost operations or to satisfy the speciﬁc
covenant requirements of independently financed development
projects. This was the case in early 2009 when a short-term ‘collar’
hedge programme on copper prices was entered into at a time when
the outlook for copper prices was highly uncertain and vulnerable
on the downside. The hedge programme extended a maximum of
12 months through to the end of December 2009. Further details
of the hedge programme are set out above in the ‘Revenues
and EBITDA’ section on page 36.
Additionally, in limited circumstances where it is not possible to
structure intra-group commodity transactions on back-to-back pricing
terms, commodity futures may be used to reduce the Group’s
economic exposure.
The Group has an investment of 26% in ENRC, a company which
is also exposed to similar ﬁnancial risks as shown below. The impact
of these risks on ENRC will impact on its dividend stream and its own
market capitalisation.
Responsibility for ﬁnancial risk management is undertaken primarily
by the Group’s centralised Treasury function, operating under
oversight of a Treasury Committee which is chaired by the
Chief Financial Officer.
The signiﬁcant risks identiﬁed by Kazakhmys that could materially
affect the Group’s ﬁnancial conditions, performance, strategy and
prospects are set out on pages 33 to 35. Details of the Group’s
system of internal control is set out on page 67.
Financial risks
The principal ﬁnancial risks arising from the Group’s activities are
those relating to commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest
rate risk, counterparty credit risk, liquidity risks and capital structure.
The Group does not engage in any speculative treasury activity.
Commodity price risk
The Group’s mining revenues and earnings are directly impacted by
ﬂuctuations in the prices of the commodities it produces. The Group’s
principal commodities (copper, zinc, gold and silver) are priced via
reference to global metal exchanges, upon which pricing is derived
from global demand and supply and inﬂuenced by macroeconomic
considerations and speculative capital ﬂows. The pricing of the
Group’s principal commodities may also include a pre-determined
margin or discount depending on the terms of sales contracts.
Commodity prices, particularly those derived from global metal
exchanges, may ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly and may have a material
impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial results.
The Group manages potential downside commodity price risk by
focusing on maintaining its low cost producer status and also through
the wider strategy of revenue diversiﬁcation. Management closely
monitors the impact of ﬂuctuations in commodity prices on the
business and uses conservative pricing assumptions and sensitivity
analysis for its forecasting and investment appraisals.
MKM is exposed to ﬂuctuations in the price of the metal content of
its products to the extent that metal purchases price at different dates
from ﬁnished goods sales. MKM uses the natural hedge provided
by the back-to-back pricing of purchases and sales on its ongoing
operations to manage this pricing exposure. Where there are
temporary mismatches in volumes, commodity futures are used on
a limited basis to ensure MKM’s economic position is not materially
impacted by metal price movements.
The Power business positions the Group as a signiﬁcant net generator
in the Kazakhstan power market. The Kazakh power market has
a predominance of large industrial electricity users focused on the
natural resource sector, and consequently, electricity demand tends
to broadly follow the commodity cycle. Power tariffs are derived
through a complex interaction of regional demand and supply
imbalances, tempered by speciﬁc regulatory interventions to
minimise the inﬂationary pressure on domestic electricity users.
The Group sells its power to a mix of wholesale and industrial
customers through directly negotiated bilateral contracts.
Foreign currency risk
The presentational currency of the Group is the US dollar, consistent
with the pricing currency of the majority of the Group’s revenue.
Where possible, the Group, excluding MKM, attempts to conduct its
business, maintains its monetary assets and seeks to source corporate
debt capital in US dollars so as to minimise its exposure to other
currencies. The Group retains surplus cash balances in US dollars
for capital expenditure, acquisitions and returns to shareholders.
Working capital balances are maintained in a mix of US dollars and
local currencies depending on short-term requirements of the business.
Whilst there is a strong correlation between many mining input costs
and the US dollar, a signiﬁcant portion of the mining business’ operating
costs are denominated in local currencies, particularly the Kazakhstan
tenge. Rates of exchange for these currencies relative to the US dollar
could ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly and may materially impact the proﬁtability
of the underlying operations and the net assets of the Group.
Due to its geographic location, MKM conducts its business in
Euros and seeks to price its revenues in that currency, being also
the currency in which the majority of its operational costs are
denominated. The Group is exposed on its net investment in MKM to
the extent that movements in the Euro may make that investment
more or less valuable. The Group seeks to mitigate that risk by raising
MKM’s debt ﬁnancing in Euros, thus matching the negative exposure
of the debt servicing against the positive exposure of the revenue.
From time to time, acquisitions and capital investments may expose
the Group to movements in other currencies and the Group will
consider hedging such exposures on a case by case basis.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate management policy is generally to
borrow and invest at ﬂoating interest rates. In some circumstances,
an element of ﬁxed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
Hedging via interest rate swaps or similar instruments may be
undertaken during periods where the Group’s exposure to
movements in short-term interest rates is more signiﬁcant, or in
periods when interest rates are perceived to be below long-term
historical averages.

Directors’ Report: Business Review
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Counterparty credit risk
The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on balances
and commitments due from third parties. The Group has adopted
policies and procedures to control and monitor the distribution
of these exposures to minimise the risk of loss in the event of
non-performance by counterparties.
The Group’s mining business protects its exposure to customer credit
risk by maintaining strong business relationships with customers
and through a combination of documentary credit instruments and
requiring payment prior to delivery. Within the Kazakhmys Copper
Division, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the
goods for sales to European customers. Sales to Chinese customers
are made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery
and transfer of title of the goods. MKM manages its customer credit
risk with debtor insurance. The Kazakhmys Power Division receives
cash up front or has short payment terms depending on the nature
of the customer. The Kazakhmys Gold Division has a single long
standing customer with short payment terms which is agreed via
an annual sales contract.
The Group’s cash management policies emphasise security and
liquidity of funds ahead of investment return. The Group’s surplus
funds held outside Kazakhstan are predominantly invested in US
dollars through deposits or money market securities of investment
grade international ﬁnancial institutions. Maximum exposure and
minimum credit rating limits have been set to ensure credit risk
is reduced.
The Group must maintain a level of cash and deposits in Kazakhstan
with local branches of international ﬁnancial institutions and well
established local Kazakhstan banks. The Group limits its local cash
and deposits to working capital requirements and transfers surplus
funds to banks mainly in the United Kingdom.
Liquidity and capital management
The Group’s over-riding objectives with regard to managing its
liquidity and capital structure are to safeguard the business as a going
concern, to maximise returns for shareholders and beneﬁts for other
stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order
to lower the overall cost of capital.
The Group does not have a target debt/equity ratio, but has
determined a maximum debt capacity based on a ratio of long-term
‘normalised’ EBITDA which the Board believes establishes a
sustainable level of gearing through the commodity cycle. This
ratio is reviewed in conjunction with market conditions and prevailing
commodity prices in order to ensure an efﬁcient capital structure
that is balanced against the risks of carrying excessive leverage.
The Group maintains back-up liquidity for debt maturing within
12 months by way of committed revolving credit facilities totalling
$150 million and by maintaining cash on the balance sheet.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Summary
Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements is the need for the Directors
to exercise judgement and to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ
from the estimates and assumptions used.
Set out in note 2(h) on page 95 are the key judgements which the
Directors believe are likely to have the most signiﬁcant effect on the
amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements. Information about
signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty is also highlighted in that
note. The following summary provides more information about the
critical accounting policies (as opposed to speciﬁc judgements and
estimates set out in note 2(h)) that could have a signiﬁcant impact
on the results of the Group and should be read in conjunction with
the notes to the ﬁnancial statements.
Impairment
The Group reviews the carrying value of its non-current investments
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are
impaired. The assessment of whether an indicator of impairment has
arisen can require considerable judgement, taking account of future
operational and ﬁnancial plans, commodity prices, sales demand
and the competitive environment. In making these assessments for
impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash ﬂows
are allocated to an appropriate cash generating unit (CGU). The
recoverable amount of those assets, or CGUs, is measured at the
higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use and
requires signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions to be made about
future cash ﬂows. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating
unit or asset exceeds its recoverable amount, then an impairment
provision is recognised to write down the carrying value of the
cash-generating unit or the asset to its recoverable amount.
Management applies judgment in allocating assets to CGUs, in
estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash ﬂows
and in selecting appropriate discount rates to be applied within the
value in use calculation. Subsequent changes to CGU allocation or
estimates and assumptions in the value in use calculation could
impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
Notes 5 and 8 commencing on pages 104 and 116, respectively, show
the impairment charges recognised in the year. Signiﬁcant assumptions
made in performing the impairment testing of goodwill are shown in
note 16 on page 124. Changes in these assumptions may alter the
results of the impairment testing, impairment charges recognised
in the income statement and the resulting carrying values of assets.
Equity accounting
At 31 December 2009, the Group owned 26.0% of ENRC PLC,
a Kazakhstan-based mining company listed on the London Stock
Exchange. The investment has been recorded as an associate and
accounted for under the equity method as the Group has the ability
to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over ENRC as prescribed by IAS 28
‘Investments in Associates’. The Group’s interest in the net assets of
ENRC is included in ‘Investments in associates’ in the consolidated
balance sheet and its interest in the results of ENRC, net of tax, is
included in the consolidated income statement in ‘Share of proﬁts
from associate’ below operating proﬁt. The Directors have applied
judgment in determining that the Group has the ability to exercise
signiﬁcant inﬂuence over ENRC.
Useful economic lives
The Group’s mining assets, classiﬁed within tangible assets, are
depreciated using the unit of production method over the estimated
economically recoverable reserves to which they relate, or over a
shorter period prior to the depletion of the reserves having regard
to the asset’s physical life limitation. The estimation process for
recoverable reserves is complex and involves signiﬁcant judgement www.kazakhmys.com 47
and assumptions relating to the life of the mine and ore reserves
may change when new information becomes available. These include
assumptions as to grade estimates, recovery rates, commodity
prices, exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing
and reclamation costs and discount rates. The actual volume of ore
extracted and any changes in these assumptions are accounted for
prospectively as they could affect future depreciation rates and
carrying values.
The majority of other items of property, plant and equipment are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the appropriateness of useful economic lives at
least annually and any changes could affect prospective depreciation
rates and asset carrying values.
Contingencies
Material contingencies facing the Group are set out in note 34 of the
ﬁnancial statements commencing on page 142. A contingent liability
arises where:
• a past event has taken place for which the outcome will be
conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more
uncertain events outside of the control of the Group; or
• a present obligation exists but is not recognised because it is
not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation.
A provision is made when a loss to the Group is likely to crystallise.
The assessment of the existence of a contingency and its likely
outcome, particularly if it is considered that a provision might be
necessary, involves signiﬁcant judgement taking all relevant factors
into account. As laws and regulations in Kazakhstan continue to
evolve, for example, in the areas of taxation, environment and
subsoil rights, uncertainties regarding contingencies are greater
than typically found in countries with more developed legal and
regulatory frameworks.
Taxation
The determination of the Group’s obligations for taxes for each
reporting period requires the interpretation of tax legislation. Whilst
the Directors believe that the Group’s judgements are appropriate,
signiﬁcant differences in actual experience may materially affect the
Group’s future tax obligations.
The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination
of its tax liabilities. The tax system and tax legislation in Kazakhstan
have been in force for only a relatively short time compared to more
developed jurisdictions and are subject to frequent changes and
varying interpretations. The Directors’ interpretations of such
legislation in applying it to business transactions may be challenged
by the relevant tax authorities and, as a result, the Group may be
assessed for additional tax payments including ﬁnes, penalties
and interest charges, which could have a material adverse effect
on the Group’s ﬁnancial position and results of operations. Such
uncertainties may relate to calculating the proﬁtability of each
subsoil contract for mineral extraction tax purposes, the applicability
of excess proﬁts tax to the Group’s mining and processing operations
and the structuring of cross border transactions, particularly in respect
of the application of transfer pricing policies.

Directors’ Report: Business Review
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We fully understand that, alongside providing these beneﬁts,
we must operate responsibly by providing fair, safe and healthy
workplaces, protecting the environment and developing communities.
Doing so will directly enhance shareholder value, our primary objective,
by increasing access to capital and lowering operational costs.
Operating responsibly will also boost our reputation and maintain
the cooperation of local communities, as well as helping us attract
and retain the best employees.
We continue to develop our data collection systems for corporate
responsibility, so that reporting is in line with international standards.
Unless otherwise stated, the information within this report is for our
Copper and Power Divisions, which in 2009 represented 96% of our
total workforce and 70% of turnover.
MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Good health, safety and environmental (HSE) management is not
just responsible, it is essential for efﬁcient, cost-effective operations.
As a UK-listed company, our shareholders expect our management
practices to meet international standards, and we are working hard
to ensure this is the case. As a minimum we comply with the law
in each country where we operate. For instance, Kazakhstan law
stipulates limits for emissions to air and water, contractual obligations
to employees, social investments under licence agreements, and
standards of health and safety. We go beyond compliance where
practicable. Our approach is to manage HSE risks at a local level,
with oversight from the Group.
Organisation and responsibilities
The Board of Directors has a Group HSE Committee, led by
the Senior Independent Director, Philip Aiken. This oversees the
implementation of HSE policies, sets related standards, monitors
performance and guides operational management. The Committee
meets three times per year, always combining formal meetings
with site visits.
Our Group Head of HSE, who in 2009 reported to the Development
Director, coordinates the implementation of HSE policies and systems
throughout the Group and advises the Group HSE Committee
on progress.
A Fatal Accident and Serious Incident Review Panel assesses each
fatality and serious incident investigation and the action taken as
a result. This panel comprises of the Group HSE Committee, the
Chief Executive, relevant senior managers and Jeff Smith, a former
chairman of Wardell Armstrong LLP , an independent safety expert.
Each of our businesses has an operational HSE committee chaired
by its general manager and comprising senior operational and
HSE managers. These operational committees are responsible for
developing policies and systems, reviewing incidents and improving
performance. The Copper Division’s committee met three times in
2009, and discussed items including occupational injury and illness
rates; safety and environmental controls, training and certification;
and disciplinary action taken in response to poor safety performance.
Divisional HSE teams implement our policies and systems on a
day-to-day basis. Every employee is responsible for their own safety,
for others affected by their actions, and is required to follow our HSE
policies and procedures at all times.
Policies and management systems
Each division has HSE policies in place which describe their
commitments and responsibilities in these areas. These are based
on guiding principles agreed at Group level. The Copper Division is
in the process of integrating its management systems for health and
safety and environment, and is recruiting specialists to do so effectively.
As part of this work, the East Region has developed a new HSE
management structure, which it plans to test in 2010. If this model
proves successful we will roll it out across the Copper Division.
At the end of 2009, 17 facilities were certiﬁed to the international
environmental management standard ISO 14001, of which seven
received their certiﬁcation in 2009. Fifteen copper sites held the
OHSAS 18001 health and safety certiﬁcate, the same number as
in the previous year. Implementing the standard has not had a
noticeable impact on reducing fatalities and, whilst we continue
to ensure our management systems reach international standards,
we do not plan to pursue further formal certiﬁcation at this stage.
We believe it is better to focus our efforts and investment on
operational measures to directly improve performance.
Our business contributes to local communities and wider society by providing
vital resources for social and economic development, and by creating wealth and
employment in remote and underserved communities. We are a major contributor
to the economy of Kazakhstan and provide substantial support for Government
infrastructure and services at a local level.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
PREVENTING ROCK FALL
Our operations are introducing new technologies to prevent
rock falls and roof collapses – the most common cause of
fatalities in our operations.
For example, we have been working with mining engineers
Minova CarboTech on ways to strengthen rock. Our Artemyevsky
and Orlovsky mines are testing Minova’s roof-bolting systems
for tunnelling, as well as sealants and resins for ﬁlling cavities
and backﬁlling behind arch supports. The rock surrounding both
mines is unstable, increasing the risk of roof falls after blasting
or down-time. We usually backﬁll the dome folds resulting from
these rock falls with materials such as concrete and timber, but
roof collapses can still occur. In 2009, this led us to suspend
some operations for over two months, but work resumed
after backﬁlling with Minova’s Carboﬁll phenolic resin foam,
reinforced by metal arch supports. One square metre of this
solidifying foam can support up to 12 tonnes of rock,
substantially reducing the risk of rock falls and roof collapse.
In 2009, we installed a seismic monitoring system at our Zhomart
mine to identify changes in the stress-state of the rock, caused by
mining. We have used a similar system at Zhezkazgan since 2007,
where it has forecast all subsequent rock falls and collapses of
any signiﬁcance. The Zhomart mine’s system can record even
small fractures induced by mining. The underground and surface
sensors record around 60 signals a day, which we use to identify
the coordinates of fractures and assess changes in the rock.
This allows us to determine trends in the spread of rock fractures
and predict problems before safety is compromised. We plan to
install seismic monitoring at mines in other regions, starting in
2010 at our Orlovsky mine in the East Region, which is particularly
prone to rock bursts.
In 2009, we began to develop a broad set of key performance
indicators (KPIs) for measuring our progress on corporate responsibility.
We plan to start measuring these KPIs over the course of 2010 and
will begin reporting on them when data is available.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Mining and processing copper and minerals involves working with
large, heavy equipment, explosives and hazardous chemicals – often
underground and sometimes at extreme temperatures. Our employees
also experience common workplace hazards from driving vehicles,
working at heights and operating machinery.
We believe it is challenging but entirely possible to prevent accidents,
as long as the right approach and management systems are in place
and sufﬁcient equipment and training provided. Our long-term ambition
is to provide a safe workplace free from injuries and illness, though
we acknowledge that this will require considerable management
focus and investment.
Fatalities
We deeply regret that 15 employees lost their lives in 14 separate
incidents at Group operations in 2009, a rate of 2.4 fatalities per
10,000 direct employees. Thirteen of these were in the Copper
Division, one in the Power Division, and one in the Gold. Two
contractors in our Power Division also sadly died. We will report
contractor fatalities across the Group in the 2010 Annual Report.
Rock falls were the most common cause and led to eight deaths.
See the case study below for examples of our efforts to reduce this
kind of incident. Four fatalities involved moving machinery. There was
a substantial reduction in falls from height, the primary cause of fatalities
in 2008.
While every death is a tragic loss, there has been a 53% decrease in
the number of fatalities since 2008. Our operations investigated every
fatal incident and serious incident and reported their findings to the
Group HSE Committee and, where appropriate, to the Fatal Accident
and Serious Incident Review Panel. Our fatality and serious incident
investigation reports comprise a full description of the incident
including photographs and sketches, plus an analysis of the
work area, procedures followed and protective equipment used.
This information is used to identify the root cause of the incident
and preventative measures for the future. The reports are sent to
the divisional Chief Executives and HSE committee chairman within
48 hours of completing the investigation.
COMMITTED TO RESPONSIBILITY 52 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
and will report their progress at Group HSE Committee meetings
during 2010.
Our Zhomart copper mine invested almost $3 million to improve safety
in 2009. The mine purchased new underground vehicles and provided
specialist training and certiﬁcation for their operators, who then pass on
their knowledge to apprentices working with them. The new vehicles
are soundproof and air-conditioned, and are ﬁtted with additional
lighting and rear-view cameras to improve visibility. The mine also built
an underground service station for the vehicles, which has automated
many hazardous maintenance tasks to further improve safety.
Occupational health
Our aim is not only to prevent occupational ill health occurring,
but to improve the health and wellbeing of employees, contractors,
their families and communities. All employees receive medical
examinations on recruitment and then on an annual basis, to prevent
occupational diseases and detect and treat those that do occur at an
early stage. We pay particular attention to employees whose work
exposes them to health risks such as dust-induced lung disease
and hand-arm vibration syndrome.
The Copper Division has an occupational disease rate of 4.3
cases per 1,000 employees, and recorded 182 new cases in 2009.
The shaft-sinking department has the highest rate of occupational
illness, with 14.6 cases per 1,000 employees. The professions most
likely to experience occupational disease are tunnellers (23 cases per
1,000 employees), truck drivers (21 cases per 1,000 employees) and
blasters (15 cases per 1,000 employees).
Most work-related illness in 2009 related to manual handling
and spinal micro-trauma from riding in vehicles on uneven surfaces.
We recorded 65 cases of chronic radiculopathy, a nerve problem that
causes pain and numbness. Exposure to mine dust is the next most
common cause of occupational disease, leading to 55 cases of
silicosis and chronic bronchitis in 2009. We will be upgrading
respirators across our facilities in 2010, to reduce the occurrence
of respiratory disease.
In 2009, the Copper Division developed a three-year health protection
programme to ensure all facilities meet the requirements of our health
and safety policies. We are recruiting seven occupational health
specialists across the Division to help prevent, diagnose and treat
work-related illnesses. Future plans include establishing a dedicated
medical committee and the introduction of a standardised employee
health monitoring system. The programme will ensure all sites have
sufficient first-aid training, underground ambulance transport for
emergency medical aid, and modern equipment in their health
units. We also plan to establish rehabilitation centres for employees
with work-related injuries and occupational diseases.
2010 commitment
• Identify ﬁve priority projects within the Copper Division for
improving safety performance.
EMPLOYEES
Kazakhmys is one of Kazakhstan’s largest employers, with our
61,629-strong workforce representing around 0.8% of employed
people in the country. We aim to provide good working conditions, to
treat employees with respect and uphold their human rights at all times.
Each division has employment policies appropriate to the cultural
and legal requirements of its country of operation. These policies
cover all aspects of employment and are designed to recruit and
retain talented and motivated employees across the company.
Pay and beneﬁts
Competitive remuneration is essential for recruiting and retaining
a talented workforce. An internal benchmark carried out in October
2009 shows that the wages our Copper Division pays are higher than
both average wages in Kazakhstan and the salaries paid by other
large mining companies in the country.
We attribute the reduction in fatalities to improved production
controls, a greater emphasis on management responsibility and an
increase in the number of site inspections. We carried out 2,759 site
inspections in 2009 and stopped operations on 830 occasions as a
result of the safety violations found. We carried out disciplinary
proceedings with 1,975 employees in relation to these violations,
and 49 employees lost their jobs. We recognise that serious injuries
and fatalities can cause both emotional and ﬁnancial difﬁculties to
employees and their families, and we provide ﬁnancial support
to the families of the victims of fatal accidents.
Injuries
We record work-related accidents in line with Kazakhstan’s regulatory
reporting requirements. We are in the process of introducing the
industry standard lost-time injury frequency rate, and will report this
ﬁgure when it is available. There may be an initial rise in the number
accidents reported, primarily as a result of improved safety training
and greater awareness of the need to report incidents.
MKM recorded an injury frequency rate of 15 per million hours
worked in 2009, down from 34 in 2008.
Safety culture
A safety culture built on training and awareness is fundamental to
reducing accidents. Our health and safety policies are available in
English, Russian and Kazakh, and each employee receives a pocket
guide explaining 16 mandatory safety rules. During 2009, 10,440
employees received safety training, including 8,795 manual workers
and 1,645 engineers and technicians.
In 2009, we reported a goal of training all senior managers and engineers
in the NEBOSH occupational safety and health certiﬁcate. We now plan,
however, to introduce an internal certiﬁcation based on the NEBOSH
qualification. We have invited an external specialist to develop an
internal, mining-specific certificate in 2010, and to train up to 20
of our managers, who will pass on their training to their colleagues.
In 2009, the Copper Division introduced a ﬁve-year health and
safety management plan to reduce hazards, improve performance
and further embed a safety culture. The ﬁrst phase involves reviewing
our approach, structure and management system to ensure we
systematically identify, assess and control all risks. Once this is
complete, operational sites will develop and implement their own
management plans within six months, and these will be approved
by the Group and Copper Division HSE departments.
These site-speciﬁc plans will detail activities and deﬁne timetables
and responsibilities for completion, as well as the required budget
and resources. The Copper Division operational HSE committee is in
the process of identifying ﬁve priority projects for improving performance,

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
NURTURING TALENT
In 2005, we selected two talented young engineers to study for
a Masters degree at Beijing Science and Technology University.
After interviewing 10 applicants, we chose two engineers,
Sabira Makhambetova and Natalya Mutayeva, who worked
at the Zhezkazgan and Satpayev facilities respectively. These
applicants displayed a high level of professional qualiﬁcation,
good knowledge of economics and production management,
and excellent communication skills. Both chose to study for
a Masters degree in enterprise management, from a list
of relevant courses offered by the Company.
In 2009, both engineers completed their studies and returned
to higher-level, better paid positions at Kazakhmys. Sabira now
works as an economist in our capital construction investments
department, and Natalya has become an equipment engineer
in the procurement team.
Says Sabira, “I am able to exploit all the skills I have acquired –
understanding of economics and knowledge of Chinese – as our
department closely works with Chinese partners. I am grateful
to Kazakhmys for providing me with such an opportunity to
acquire a new speciality and to experience living in an exciting
and completely culturally different environment.”
Kazakhmys contributes to deﬁned contribution pension schemes in
Kazakhstan, Germany and the UK. These contributions are a legal
requirement in Kazakhstan. The Company has share plans for senior
executives, which are described on page 75.
Our Copper Division in Kazakhstan provides medical and dental
services at no cost to current employees, and at less than half price
for their families and retired employees. In 2009, medical facilities
across the Copper Division treated 15,657 people, of whom 6,380
were employees, 937 were retired employees and 2,213 employee
family members.
The Copper Division also provides leisure facilities to employees
and their families. It owns two health resorts, a holiday facility and six
children’s summer camps. In 2009, 4,395 employees and 637 retired
employees visited health and holiday facilities paid for by Kazakhmys.
Over 4,000 of our employees’ children spent their holidays at our
summer camps.
Training and development
Training is essential for employees to do the best job they can.
We invest in training and education for employees of all levels.
We provide formal education at colleges and universities, as well
as courses in mining specialities at our own training facilities. Our
purpose-built technical college in Satpayev offers classroom training
as well as operational and safety training both above and below ground.
At the end of 2009, we completed construction of a second technical
college at Balkhash, where we will open a similar training centre
for employees in 2010. We require all employees to pass periodic
operational, health and safety refresher courses and tests, and help
many employees to retrain in a new speciality to help them develop
their careers with us.
In 2009, 25,808 employees received professional training at our
technical college, universities and mining schools in Kazakhstan
and abroad. There are currently 388 continuing their training at
our technical college, 33 at Kazakhstani universities and 31 abroad.
In 2009, the Copper and Power Divisions spent over $900,000 on
external training, although this does not include the cost of running
our own training centres.
Equality and diversity
We want to provide a fair and diverse workplace free from
discrimination. This beneﬁts employees, and ensures we proﬁt from
a workforce that reﬂects the local population and the variety of skills
and experience within it. We are committed to recruiting, developing,
training and rewarding employees based on merit. We employ
disabled people with relevant skills, provided they can work safely.
Recruiting women is a challenge throughout the mining industry.
In our Copper Division, around 35% of all employees, including
many of our engineers, and 22% of managers are women.
Within Kazakhstan the Group employs a small number of non-Kazakh
nationals, generally where there is a skill shortage or where those
individuals bring particular experience or abilities which is unavailable.
A key aim is to ensure a transfer of skills and knowledge to existing
employees, in order to beneﬁt the local workforce and reduce
dependence on ‘expat’ labour.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
IMPROVING AIR QUALITY
We are installing electrostatic precipitators, developed by pollution
control specialists Lodge Cottrell, at the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power
station. Once installation is complete, these will capture 99.85% of
ash in the air and reduce particulate emissions by an estimated factor
of four – substantially improving local air quality. We plan to ﬁt the
precipitators to all eight power units at Ekibastuz GRES-1 by 2013,
and are in the process of testing the ﬁrst unit, installed in 2009.
In 2009, we also introduced new coal burning technology at
Ekibastuz GRES-1, developed by PolytechEnergo (Russia). Combined
with the new precipitators, this technology will further reduce
emissions. The new technology provides an alternative to
conventional dust-ﬁring and will allow the furnace to burn
optimum-quality design coal as well as lower-grade coal.
This will increase fuel efﬁciency, reducing emissions of nitrogen
oxides by over 30%. Another advantage is that the new technology
enables coal particles to coarsen, and ash from burning coarsened
coal has a greater surface area and is more easily collected by the
precipitators. This increases the ﬂue-gas puriﬁcation rate. Whilst
it is a ﬁrst in Kazakhstan, the technology is tried and tested, as
PolytechEnergo has installed it in over 50 projects in ﬁve countries.
Consultation and communication
Keeping employees informed about our business strategy and
matters that affect their work is critical to maintaining a loyal and
motivated workforce. We communicate with employees in a variety of
ways, primarily through face-to-face conversations between managers
and their teams, email, and also through a company-wide internal
newspaper and intranet site, both established in the past year.
Most employees are represented by trade unions, which negotiate
collective employment agreements with our divisions. In Germany,
employees are represented by a works council and approximately
55% of employees are members of the IG Metall union.
In 2009, the trade union representing employees in Kazakhstan
engaged with management on issues including living and working
conditions, food provision, and health and safety. We also negotiated
on measures implemented in response to the global recession and
resulting collapse in copper prices. These include the suspension of
several social beneﬁts such as preferential prices at health centres,
and a shortened working week for certain employees. The union
held almost 100 meetings during the year.
Our Youth Union boasts almost 18,000 members and supports
younger employees joining the Company. All copper staff under
the age of 35 are free to join. The Youth Union runs work-related
competitions plus cultural and sporting events, as well as organising
charitable and volunteering projects.
2010 commitment
• Open our second employee training centre at the new Balkhash
technical college.
ENVIRONMENT
Mining has substantial impacts on the natural environment, and we
aim to manage and minimise these both during operations and after
site closure. This means using energy, water and other resources
efﬁciently; reducing greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and emissions
to air, land and water; and responsibly managing and restoring our
land to prevent loss of biodiversity.
As part of the integrated HSE management systems our divisions are
implementing, we are putting in place measures to systematically
identify and control our environmental impacts, and ensure we
consider them when making operational decisions. A programme
of environmental auditing is providing a performance baseline
to improve on and help us monitor progress.
Independent specialists KazEcoProject carried out environmental
audits at 48 copper facilities between November 2008 and May 2009.
Whilst they made some recommendations for improvement,
the auditors concluded that our Copper Division complies with
Kazakhstan’s environmental regulations, such as permitted emissions
and efﬂuent levels. In addition, our environmental protection teams
performed 340 internal inspections in 2009. These resulted in a plan
to install more water meters at our copper operations to improve
usage measurement.
We make mandatory payments for the industrial efﬂuent we create,
such as waste water discharge, tailings, ash and slag, and report
emissions to the relevant authorities quarterly. These payments
amounted to $36 million in 2009 for the Copper Division.
Environmental regulators carried out 96 inspections at our
copper operations during the year to assess compliance
with regulatory requirements.
We have commissioned London-based Golder Associates to perform
a comprehensive audit in 2010, which will evaluate the Copper
Division’s social and environmental performance in detail, and
assess our compliance with the requirements of the World Bank
and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We will
use the resulting recommendations to develop a medium-term
environmental action plan.
Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions
At Kazakhmys we produce signiﬁcant greenhouse gas emissions
through electricity use and heat production at our mines and
production facilities, coal combustion in our four power stations
and fuel use in our vehicles. Increasing legislation relating to
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the use of fossil fuels
may pose long-term risks to our coal mining, power generation
and petroleum exploration businesses.
We are committed to reducing GHG emissions from our operations
through energy efﬁciency and the use of technology. In 2009, total
energy use in our Copper and Power Divisions was 15.9 petajoules.
Total GHG emissions were 21.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO
2
e) for the two businesses combined – 10.7 million
tonnes for copper and 10.9 million tonnes for power. This increase
COMMITTED TO RESPONSIBILITY www.kazakhmys.com 55
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
in CO
2
e from the copper business is because, in 2009, the Kazakhstan
Ministry of Environment changed the method it provides for
calculating methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Our purchase
of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power plant has clearly caused a large
increase in companywide emissions.
Emissions to air
Our copper smelters produce substantial amounts of sulphur dioxide
(SO2) which, if released, reduces air quality and aggravates asthma
and other breathing difficulties. Other emissions associated with
our operations include nitrogen oxides (NOx), arsenic, ash and dust.
We monitor and work hard to reduce all emissions our operations
release to air.
In 2009, our copper smelters released 189,099 tonnes of SO2
compared with 492,970 tonnes in 2008. This signiﬁcant reduction
is due to our sulphuric acid production plant at Balkhash, which is
transforming SO2 emissions from the complex’s copper operations
into a valuable by-product, greatly reducing the amount of the gas
released to air. By the end of 2009, production levels had risen to
almost 800,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid after 18 months of operation
– and used 75% of the SO2 emissions produced. The remaining SO2
emissions for the plant totalled 105,514 tonnes during the year,
well below the permitted limit of 126,904 tonnes.
Water use and emissions
Water supplies are coming under increasing pressure in many parts
of the world as populations grow and industrialise. Mining uses large
volumes of water, posing the risk of competition with local communities
in regions where water is scarce.
In Kazakhstan, water availability varies signiﬁcantly by season
and geography. In some areas where we operate, water is scarce,
especially during dry seasons. This makes efﬁcient water use critical
to the long-term viability of a number of operations. In addition, all
sites need to carefully control the efﬂuent they discharge into local
waterways, to avoid pollution and maintain local water quality.
Total water use decreased by around 46% to 129,183 megalitres
in 2009 (2008: 240,624 megalitres). There are three reasons for this
large reduction. Firstly, the 2008 figure includes some water used
by local communities, as well as our operations. This will be excluded
in all future water data. Secondly, we suspended zinc operations at
Balkhash. Finally, in Zhezkazgan, which suffers droughts in the dry
season, our copper operations have introduced a water recycling
system to reduce usage, as well as discharges into the Kara Kengir
river. Over ﬁve million cubic metres of treated operational and
municipal wastewater are now provided to underground mining
operations at the South and Stepnoy mines.
Increasing economic pressures and inefﬁcient water use are
endangering ecosystems in the Ili-Balkhash basin. In October 2009,
we signed a water use agreement as part of an integrated water
management plan for the area being developed by the Regional
Environmental Centre for Central Asia. This commits us to a series
of measures to reduce water use and efﬂuent over time. Examples
include improving the pipeline feeding the local settlement, and the
installation of a water recycling system that will reduce annual water
withdrawal from Lake Balkhash by 87 million cubic metres.
Land management
We recognise the need to minimise land disturbance and protect
biodiversity throughout the life of our operations. Local legislation
requires us to rehabilitate sites that have closed down. The Copper
Division sets aside provisions for this purpose as a condition of its
contracts and licences for subsoil use, and this amounted to $37 million
as of 31 December 2009 (2008: $48 million). The reduction is due
to the 25% devaluation of the tenge early in 2009.
Our operations carried out various land management activities in
2009, such as using overburden, ash and slag to backﬁll mines and
restore landscapes, and planting greenery on and around our sites.
For example, in 2009 the Copper Division hired a local contractor to
restore a 3,500m
2
former stone quarry at its Belousovsky mine,
previously used to store ash and slag. The first phase of the
restoration comprised levelling the area and laying subsoil and
topsoil. The second phase of reinstatement will focus on promoting
biodiversity, although the area is fertile and we expect many plants
to grow back naturally.
Waste
Mining, metallurgical operations and power generation create large
amounts of waste, which can cause environmental pollution if not
properly disposed of and is visually unappealing.
Our mining operations produce waste rock and overburden,
which we store in dumps and often use to backﬁll mines and when
rehabilitating sites after closure. Copper smelting produces tailings
and slag, which is classed as hazardous waste and must be securely
contained in dams to prevent leaching into the soil and water
sources. Our power plants create solid wastes such as ﬂy ash and
slag. Other wastes created include sludge from our wastewater
treatment facilities, slime from our sulphuric acid plant and
general waste.
In 2009, our Copper and Power Divisions generated 70 MT of waste,
down from 120 MT in 2008. We continue to seek additional ways
to beneﬁcially reuse our wastes, for example in brick production.
The Copper Division has also opened a tyre-recycling plant in
January 2010, see the case study on page 56.
Environmental awareness
Increasing awareness of the causes and effects of environmental
damage is essential for changing behaviour and improving
performance. In 2009, we took part in a variety of events
to this end.
These include:
• The Kazakhstan Environmental Protection Ministry’s exhibition
of natural resource companies;
• Public hearings in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Eastern Region, also attended
by Kazakhstan’s Environmental Protection minister;
• Meetings with the Environmental Protection Ministry at Nura-Sarysu;
• A workshop on climate change and ratiﬁcation of the Kyoto
Protocol held by the Climate Change Coordination Centre, a
Kazakhstan-based non-governmental organisation;
• A workshop on environmental problems in the Karaganda region;
• We also wrote and published various environment-related articles
and editorials in the local and national media.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
FOSTERING ENTERPRISE
DEVELOPMENT
Our Copper Division has invested over $7 million in Kazakhstan’s
ﬁrst tyre-recycling facility, bringing operational, economic,
employment and environmental beneﬁts.
Tyres for mining vehicles such as dump trucks and loaders
are costly and in short supply in Kazakhstan. To overcome these
problems, our Zhezkazgan operations will send their used tyres to
the new MysShina plant for the worn-out tread to be renewed, and
we will buy back the re-treaded tyres for 40% less than the cost of
a new tyre. Because the plant is close to our mines, this approach
will also reduce transport costs. As the lack of recycling facilities
meant used tyres were previously sent to landﬁll, re-treading the
tyres also reduces our environmental impact.
The plant has created 100 new jobs for local people, many
of whom were unemployed. Each year it will re-tread about
2,000 tyres, using technology developed by German company
Schelkmann, which supplied the equipment and trained our
employees. The new recruits received around six weeks of
classroom training before passing an exam. Initial trials
conﬁrm that our investment will provide a signiﬁcant return.
2010 commitment
• Develop a medium-term environmental action plan based on the
results of the audit carried out by Golder Associates.
COMMUNITIES
Our presence brings many benefits for communities, such as
employment, opportunities for local suppliers and investment
in local infrastructure. At the same time, our operations can cause
problems such as increased noise, dust and trafﬁc, so it is essential
that we work closely with local people to minimise disruption and
ensure they beneﬁt from our business.
In many places, the local community only exists because of our
operations. Our social investment is therefore not simply philanthropy
– our business depends on the development of communities where
our employees and their families can thrive. We have a long history
of close involvement with local communities and, while this relationship
will evolve, we will probably retain a stronger social commitment than
many other major resource companies.
In Kazakhstan, engagement about operational activities that may
affect a community generally takes place through the local authority.
However, we increasingly consult directly with local communities.
For example, in 2009 we met local families at Bozshakol and agreed
to provide access to a graveyard found within the project boundary.
Should the project expand, we will relocate the graves to a safe location
in close consultation with both the community and authorities.
Economic impacts
Kazakhmys is one of the largest employers and taxpayers in Kazakhstan,
and our Kazakh revenue represents 2.5% of the country’s gross
domestic product. The vast majority of our 61,629 people are
Kazakhstan citizens, whose income taxes and spending also
contribute to the national economy.
We are committed to helping further develop the Kazakh economy
and in 2009, along with the Government, founded Made in KZ,
a programme to support small and medium-sized companies in
the country. We are dedicated to purchasing products, equipment
and services from these companies wherever they are available
at the right quality and price.
In September 2009, we held a conference for local companies
in Karaganda, and invited them to tender for contracts to supply
Kazakhmys. We also announced plans to ﬁnance projects aiming
to increase local companies’ capacity to supply us. Following the
conference, 122 companies expressed an interest. We are already
working with 67 of these and have signed contracts totalling
$134 million for products ranging from construction materials
to tools and uniforms. In October, we took part in a similar,
Government-run conference in Pavlodar, and renewed contracts
with nine suppliers in the region as a result.
Our Copper Division has established a dedicated working group for
local enterprise development. In December 2009, we also established
a local procurement working group comprising procurement specialists
from all areas of the Copper Division. The working group visited
suppliers in Karaganda, Pavlodar and East Kazakhstan to assess
their products and production processes and raise awareness of our
commitment to local purchasing. The Copper and Power Divisions
spent $867 million on goods and services from Kazakhstan suppliers
in 2009 – around 44% of total spending on goods and services.
The Copper Division has centralised purchasing to ensure greater
quality control. In 2010, we will introduce standard, higher-quality
personal protective equipment across all copper facilities.
This will be produced for us by a local contractor, using
materials we purchase overseas.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
RESPECTING CULTURAL HERITAGE
There are several important archeological sites located within the
boundary of our Bozshakol copper project in northern Kazakhstan,
which we are taking great care to protect. In 2009, we selected
expert archaeologists to carry out detailed surveys, document the
artefacts found, establish whether they could be safely removed,
and carry out the excavations. The Margulan Archaeology and
Ethnography Institute in Almaty supervised all work.
Detailed surveys conﬁrmed the presence of 25 separate
archeological sites, 15 of which were previously undiscovered.
These span a timeframe from 350,000 years ago through to the
late medieval period, providing a comprehensive picture of
cultural development in north-eastern Kazakhstan. There are
six Stone Age sites, a Bronze Age settlement, ﬁve Iron Age
burial mounds, medieval burial sites, primitive mines and
ceremonial monuments.
The sites, along with artefacts found there such as knives, tools,
copper ore and bronze bullion, prove that ancient peoples in
the area were highly developed in their use of metals and
other materials. These artefacts have been carefully excavated,
and we plan to open a museum at the site to house them.
Community and infrastructure development
Our Copper Division invests heavily in the construction and
maintenance of social facilities such as schools and hospitals,
and the development of roads and infrastructure near our operations.
We concentrate our efforts on projects closely related to our operations,
ensuring our investment beneﬁts the business as well as communities
and strengthens our ties with local people.
In 2009, the copper business invested just under $88 million
in education, healthcare, sports and culture, infrastructure and
the environment, and sponsorship and charitable donations.
This includes capital expenditure and ongoing support for facilities,
and is by far the largest programme of its kind in Kazakhstan.
Education is one of our priorities. We are the largest corporate
contributor to education in Kazakhstan, and allocate $20 million
annually for this purpose. The Group runs 37 nursery schools and
provides ﬁnancial support to schools and orphanages located near
its operations. These include a boarding school in Astana for orphans
and children from low-income families – the ﬁrst of its kind in Kazakhstan.
Opened in September 2009, the school cost $30 million to build
and can take up to 700 students each year. There were 215 students
at the end of 2009. The school is equipped with workshops,
interactive classrooms and a media library, as well as a driving school,
swimming pool and sports complex. Students will gain qualiﬁcations in
construction, transport, metalwork and catering, as well as beneﬁting
from accommodation, medical services and broader skills development.
Our technical college in Balkhash is designed to train 1,300 students a
year in specialist skills for the mining sector. Opened in September 2009,
the college has 245 full-time and 307 part-time students training in
various technical and mining-related subjects. A training centre for
employees will open at the college in 2010. Tutors from the college
currently train employees on-site. A similar college in Satpayev has
already seen 200 graduates complete their training since opening
in September 2008.
Every year, Kazakhmys sponsors over 200 university and college
students to complete their education in Kazakhstan or abroad.
Our operations also provide internships for local college students.
For example, the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power station provides placements
for students from Ekibastuz Polytechnic, and three college students
began internships in November 2009.
We also invest in projects that encourage young people to participate
in sports. March 2009 saw the completion of the Kazakhmys-sponsored
reconstruction of the Ulytau Sports Palace in Zhezkazgan. This facility
includes a number of sports halls and a health centre, where 800 people
each day can take part in sports including volleyball, basketball, rugby,
tennis, wrestling and boxing.
2010 commitment
• Continue work on a variety of community and infrastructure
development projects, including a kindergarten, park, museum,
sports stadium in Zhezkazgan, water infrastructure at Uaitas-Aidos
and a national library and learning facility in Astana.

OTHER SENIOR MANAGEMENT: 62 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Governance
GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The Company is aware that, following its review of the impact
and effectiveness of the Combined Code last year, the FRC
has undertaken a consultation on the proposed revisions to the
Combined Code. The proposed revisions include proposals to
implement some of the recommendations of the Walker Report on
the governance of banks and other ﬁnancial institutions, which the
FRC consider should apply to all listed companies. The outcome of
the consultation and the revised Combined Code, which will be known
as the UK Corporate Governance Code, will apply to the Company’s
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The Company will monitor the proposed revisions and report
to shareholders on its compliance with the revised Combined
Code at the appropriate time.
COMBINED CODE COMPLIANCE
During the year, the Company has complied fully with the provisions
of the Combined Code, save in the following respects:
• the Chairman was not independent at the time of his appointment.
This arises due to Vladimir Kim’s signiﬁcant shareholding in the
Company. Vladimir Kim joined the Group in 1995 and has made
a major contribution to its development into an international
company. The Board is unanimously of the opinion that his
continued involvement in an executive capacity is vitally
important to the success of the Group.
• at least half the Board was not independent, for the purposes of
the Combined Code, throughout the period. To redress the balance
of independent Directors on the Board, the Board appointed
Peter Hickson and Clinton Dines with effect from 5 March 2009
and 1 October 2009, respectively, as independent non-executive
Directors. With effect from 1 October 2009, the Company complied
fully with this requirement of the Combined Code.
• the Audit Committee did not have at least three members
throughout the period. Following the appointment of Peter Hickson
as an independent non-executive Director and a member of the
Audit Committee with effect from 5 March 2009, the composition
of the Committee complied fully with this requirement of the
Combined Code.
THE BOARD
The Board is responsible for managing the Company on behalf of its
shareholders and each Director must act in a way that he considers
promotes the long-term success of the Company for the benefit
of those shareholders as a whole. The Board also ensures that an
appropriate balance between promoting long-term growth and
delivering short-term objectives is achieved.
The Board sets the overall strategy of the Group, reviews trading
performance, ensures adequate funding, examines major investments,
ensures the appropriate allocation of ﬁnancial resources and monitors
the performance of the executive team. It is also responsible for
providing leadership and support to the executive management
team in creating and sustaining shareholder value through the
management of the Group’s business, together with delivering
expected shareholder returns. Another key responsibility of the
Board is to approve the overall Group risk appetite and ensure that
management maintains a system of internal control that provides
assurance of effective and efficient operations, internal financial
controls and compliance with law and regulation.
The Board is committed to high
standards of corporate governance in its
management of the affairs of the Group
and in its accountability to shareholders.
This section of the Annual Report and Accounts has been prepared
in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in June 2008
(the ‘Combined Code’).
The Company’s policies on corporate direction and control
ensure that the Company applies all of the principles of
good governance contained in the Combined Code to the
organisational structure it has adopted to conduct its business,
its remuneration policy, its relations with its shareholders, and
the procedures adhered to in its ﬁnancial reporting, internal
control and assurance processes.
The rest of this section of the Annual Report and Accounts explains
in more detail how the Company applied the principles and complied
with the provisions of the Combined Code, and also gives further
details of the matters the Board and its committees considered
during the ﬁnancial year.
PHILIP AIKEN
Senior Independent Director www.kazakhmys.com 63
The Board has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved for
its decision. A summary of the matters reserved for the Board is set
out opposite. These are matters that are signiﬁcant to the Group as a
whole because of their strategic, ﬁnancial or reputational implications
or consequences. The Board has four principal committees to deal
with speciﬁc aspects of the Group’s affairs. The chairmen of the Board
committees report regularly to the Board on the matters discussed
at the Board committees, thereby ensuring that all Directors have
visibility and the opportunity to discuss such matters.
Directors are required to demonstrate unquestioned honesty
and integrity, a willingness to question, challenge and critique,
and a desire to understand and commit to the highest standards
of governance. Each Director must ensure that no decision or action
is taken that places his interests in front of the interests of the business.
Directors commit to the collective decision-making processes of the
Board. Individual Directors are required to debate issues openly
and constructively and be free to question or challenge the opinions
of others.
The Company Secretary, through the Chairman, is responsible
for advising the Board on governance matters, for ensuring good
information ﬂows within the Board and for providing guidance to
the Board in the responsible and effective execution of its tasks.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary and, in appropriate circumstances, may obtain independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense. No such external
advice was sought by any Director during the year. The appointment
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the
Board as a whole.
The Company Secretary is Robert Welch, who joined the Group in
2006 as Deputy Company Secretary and was appointed to his current
position in March 2007. He is an Associate of the Institute of Chartered
Secretaries and Administrators and is secretary to all of the Board
Committees except the Audit Committee. The secretary to the Audit
Committee is Stephen Hodges, Deputy Company Secretary, who
joined the Group in 2007 and is also an Associate of the Institute
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The Board has agreed a clear division of responsibilities between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive. The roles of the Chairman, Chief
Executive and other Directors are clearly deﬁned so that no single
individual has unrestricted powers of decision.
The Chairman is responsible for the strategic direction of the Group,
overseeing the responsibilities of management, leadership of the
Board and the relationships with the Government and business
community in Kazakhstan. As part of the evaluation of the
performance of the Chairman, the Board remains satisﬁed that the
Chairman is able to fulﬁl all of the commitments required of his role.
Key matters reserved for the Board include the approval of:
• the Group’s strategy, and medium and short-term plans;
• major acquisitions, mergers or disposals;
• the annual budget;
• the Group’s risk management strategy and policy on insurance;
• health, safety, environmental and ethical policies;
• major capital investments and projects;
• the Company’s dividend policy;
• the appointment and removal of any Directors of the Company;
• the authorisation of Directors’ conﬂicts or potential conﬂicts
of interest;
• the Board and its committees performance evaluation process;
• the Annual Report and Accounts and half-yearly reports;
• all circulars, reports, prospectuses or other related documents
for shareholders;
• the principal regulatory ﬁlings with stock exchanges;
• the rules and procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares; and
• the appointment or removal of the Company’s external auditor
and main ﬁnancial, legal and technical advisers.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED
ROLE OF THE CHAIRMAN
Key roles and responsibilities of the Chairman include:
• setting a vision for the Group and formulation of its strategy;
• providing leadership to the Board, ensuring the effectiveness
of the Board on all aspects of its role and setting its agenda;
• ensuring effective communication with shareholders;
• facilitating the effective contribution of non-executive Directors
and ensuring constructive relations between executive and
non-executive Directors;
• providing leadership to the senior management team;
• ensuring the creation and maintenance of safe working

• maintaining effective and constructive relations with the
Government and business community in Kazakhstan.
ROLE OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management
of the Group and the implementation of the strategy approved by
the Board.
Key roles and responsibilities of the Chief Executive include:
• establishing and maintaining an international organisation
that will enable the Group’s strategic direction to be
implemented effectively;
• developing a human resources plan to ensure the Group
has the capabilities and resources required to achieve its
strategic objectives;
• representing the Group as required and furthering its best
interests in the business and industry community;

health and safety standards and are undertaken with special
regard for environmental concerns in the countries in which the
Group operates; and
• ensuring at all times that the Group conducts its business in
accordance with the legal requirements of the countries in which
it operates.
ROLE OF THE SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Philip Aiken continued in his role as Senior Independent Director
during 2009. The key roles and responsibilities of the Senior
Independent Director are to:
• together with the other non-executive Directors, be available
to discuss matters of concern with shareholders. Furthermore,
Philip Aiken is available to shareholders should they have had any
concerns which could not be resolved through the normal channels
of communication with the Chairman or Chief Executive. No such
concerns were raised by shareholders during the year ended
31 December 2009;
• meet with the non-executive Directors without the Chairman
being present at least annually and lead the Board in the ongoing
monitoring and annual performance evaluation of the Chairman; and
• maintain contact as required with major shareholders to
understand their issues and concerns, including attending
meetings where necessary with shareholders, to listen to their
views in order to develop a balanced understanding of the issues
and concerns of major shareholders.
During the year, Philip Aiken attended a number of meetings with
institutional shareholders to discuss their views on the Group and
received feedback on the Chairman’s performance following the
annual Board performance evaluation process.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The non-executive Directors provide a strong independent element
on the Board and a solid foundation for good corporate governance.
Although all Directors are equally accountable under the law for
the proper stewardship of the Company’s affairs, the non-executive
Directors fulﬁl a vital role in corporate accountability. They have a
particular responsibility to examine critically the strategies proposed
by the executive Directors, scrutinise the performance of management
in meeting agreed goals and objectives, and play a leading role in the
functioning of the main Board committees. Between them, the current
non-executive Directors bring experience, expertise and independent
judgement from a variety of business sectors and public life.
BOARD INDEPENDENCE
Effective management and good stewardship are led by the Board,
which currently consists of ten directors, eight of whom served
throughout the ﬁnancial year, with Peter Hickson and Clinton Dines
having been appointed on 5 March 2009 and 1 October 2009,
respectively. Including the Chairman, there are three executive
Directors, ﬁve independent non-executive Directors and two
non-independent non-executive Directors; this balance ensures
that no individual or small group of Directors can dominate the
decision making process and that the interests of the minority
shareholders are protected. Biographies of all Directors are set
out on pages 60 and 61.
It is Kazakhmys’ policy that at least half the Board should be
independent non-executive Directors. Other than Vladimir Ni and
Daulet Yergozhin, the Board considers each of its current non-executive
Directors to be independent in character and judgement. In reaching
its determination of independence, the Board has concluded that each
provides objective challenge to management, is willing to stand up
and defend their own beliefs and viewpoints in order to support the
ultimate good of the organisation and there are no relationships or
circumstances likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the judgement
of Philip Aiken, Clinton Dines, Simon Heale, Peter Hickson and Lord
Renwick. The Board carries out a review of the independence of its
Directors on an annual basis. Vladimir Ni is not considered by the
Board to be independent, with effect from 1 January 2006, following
his appointment as chairman of Kazakhmys Corporation LLC, the

ATTENDANCE AT BOARD MEETINGS
All Directors are expected to attend each Board meeting and each
meeting of the committees of which they are members, unless there
are exceptional circumstances which prevent them from doing so.
Scheduled Board and committee meetings are arranged at least a
year in advance to allow Directors to manage their other commitments.
All Directors are provided with the papers for consideration and
other relevant information in advance of each meeting. If a Director
is unable to attend a meeting because of exceptional circumstances,
he will still receive the papers and other relevant information in
advance of the meeting and will have the opportunity to discuss with
the chairman of the meeting or the Company Secretary any matters
he wishes to raise to ensure his views are given due consideration
and, if necessary, follow up with the decisions taken at the meeting.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Company Secretary are always
available for the Directors to discuss any issues relating to a Board
or committee meeting or other matters. Reasons for non-attendance
are generally prior business and personal commitments or illness.
The attendance of Directors at scheduled meetings of the Board
which they were eligible to attend and the number of meetings
attended during 2009 is shown below:

Following an initial discussion between the Company Secretary
and Clinton Dines, a comprehensive induction programme,
tailored to his individual experiences and requirements, was
arranged on his joining the Board. The programme was designed
to ensure that he was provided with the necessary knowledge

to enable him to fulﬁl his duties on the Board and on the
Audit Committee.
The programme included:
• meetings with the Company’s brokers, legal advisers and
external auditor;
• meetings with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Head of Corporate
Communications, Head of Sales and Logistics and Head of
Business Development on their roles and responsibilities;

RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
New Directors appointed by the Board must submit themselves for
election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their
appointment. Thereafter, the Company’s Articles of Association require
that all Directors stand for re-election at least every three years.
INDUCTION, TRAINING AND INFORMATION
Following appointment to the Board, all new Directors receive a
comprehensive and structured induction tailored to their individual
requirements. The induction programme, which is arranged by the
Company Secretary, includes visits to some of the Group’s businesses
and meetings with senior managers and advisers as appropriate.
The programme is designed to facilitate their understanding of
the Group, the key drivers of business performance, the role of the
Board and its committees, the Company’s corporate governance
practices and procedures, and provides them with appropriate
training and guidance as to their duties, responsibilities and
liabilities as a director of a public limited company.
To assist Directors in the performance of their duties, there are
procedures to provide them with appropriate and timely information,
including information between meetings about developments
in the Group’s business and financial performance, so that they
can discharge their duties on strategic, financial, operational,
compliance and governance issues.
Where appropriate, additional training and updates on particular
issues are arranged. For example, over the last 12 months, members
of the Board have made visits to the Group’s operations in Kazakhstan
and Germany and have received speciﬁc brieﬁngs by management
on the implications of new legislation in the United Kingdom
and Kazakhstan.
To ensure the Board as a whole remains fully informed of the views
of shareholders, the Board receives regular reports on shareholder
sentiment from the Head of Corporate Communications. Although
not part of their induction programme, all non-executive Directors
have a standing invitation to attend shareholder meetings and analyst
presentations, and shareholders may meet informally with Directors
at the Annual General Meeting.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A full Board performance evaluation process was undertaken in late
2009, facilitated by an external consultant, with fully documented
results being presented to the March 2010 Board meeting. The
process was carefully structured but pragmatic, tailored to bring
about a genuine debate of issues that are relevant, and assisted
in identifying any potential for improvement in the Company’s
processes. It entailed the completion of detailed questionnaires on
the performance of the Board, its committees and its executive and
non-executive Directors by each Director (excluding Clinton Dines
who was appointed on 1 October 2009) and the preparation of a
composite report. The evaluation report concluded that the Board
and its committees continue to operate effectively and each Director
is contributing effectively and demonstrates commitment to his
role. While being satisﬁed with its overall performance, the Board
is developing action plans in respect of certain areas identiﬁed
for improvement including, for example, the setting of further
non-ﬁnancial targets and a greater focus on succession planning.
During the year, the Chairman held a number of meetings with
non-executive Directors without executive Directors being present.
The Senior Independent Director also led the non-executive Directors
in evaluating the performance of the Chairman.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Companies Act 2006 introduced a new statutory duty in October
2008 requiring a director to avoid a situation in which he has or can
have a direct or indirect interest that conﬂicts or possibly may conﬂict
with the interests of the Company. This duty is in addition to the
existing duty that a director owes to the Company to disclose to
the Board any transaction or arrangement under consideration by
the Company. The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public
companies to authorise conﬂicts and potential conﬂicts where the
Articles of Association contain a provision to that effect.
Shareholders approved amendments to the Company’s Articles of
Association at the 2008 Annual General Meeting which included
provisions giving the Directors authority to approve such situations
and to include other provisions to allow conﬂicts of interest to be
dealt with in a similar way to the position that existed prior to the
coming into force of this legislation. There is no breach of duty if
the relevant situation has been so authorised in advance.
The Board has a procedure when deciding whether to authorise
a conﬂict or potential conﬂict of interest. Under this procedure,
Directors are required to declare all directorships or other
appointments outside of the Group and which could give rise to
a conﬂict or potential conﬂict of interest. In consideration of each
conﬂict or potential conﬂict of interest declared by a Director, ﬁrstly,
only independent Directors (i.e. those who have no interest in the
matter being considered) will be able to take the relevant decision,
and secondly, in taking the decision the Directors must act in a
way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the
Company’s success. In addition, the Directors will be able to impose
limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this
is appropriate.

GOVERNANCE IN PRACTICE www.kazakhmys.com 67
The Company Secretary minutes the consideration of any conﬂict or
potential conﬂict of interest and authorisations granted by the Board
are recorded by the Company Secretary in a register of conﬂicts of
interest. On an ongoing basis, the Directors are responsible for
informing the Company Secretary of any new, actual or potential
conﬂicts that may arise or, if there are any changes in circumstances
that may affect an authorisation previously given. Even when
provided with authorisation, a Director is not absolved from
his duty to promote the success of the Company.
Furthermore, at the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders
approved further amendments to the Company’s Articles of
Association which include provisions relating to conﬁdential
information, attendance at Board meetings and availability of Board
papers to protect a Director being in breach of duty if a conﬂict of
interest arises. These provisions will only apply where the position
giving rise to the potential conﬂict has previously been authorised
by the Directors.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal
control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of
this system. Such a system is designed to identify, evaluate and
manage the signiﬁcant risks associated with the Group’s achievement
of its business objectives, with a view to safeguarding shareholders’
investments and the Group’s assets. This system is designed to meet
the Company’s particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed,
and is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk. Because of the
limitations inherent in any system of internal control, such a system
can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The Board conﬁrms that, throughout the year ended 31 December
2009 and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report and
Accounts, there have been processes in place for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the
Group in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance.
The Board has adopted a risk-based approach in establishing the
Group’s system of internal control and in reviewing its effectiveness.
To identify and manage key risks, the Board has established a number
of Group-wide procedures, policies and standards, has set up a
framework for reporting matters of signiﬁcance, has authorised the
Audit Committee to review the Group’s strategy with regard to risk
and the effectiveness of the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting, internal
control and assurance systems, has developed a system of regular
reports from management and has reserved speciﬁc key matters for
its decision. The process is designed to provide assurance by way
of cumulative assessment.
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control which have
operated throughout the year are:
• Group ﬁnancial, treasury, operating and administrative policies and
procedures which incorporate statements of required behaviour;
• continuous review of safety, operating and ﬁnancial performance
of the Group’s businesses;
• monitoring by the Board of a comprehensive reporting system,
including monthly results, periodic short-term forecasts, annual
budgets and long-term plans;
• well-deﬁned procedures for appraisal, approval, control and review
of major capital projects, including acquisitions and disposals;
• an established methodology for ranking the level of risk in
each of its business operations and the signiﬁcant risk issues
associated therewith;
• implementation of appropriate strategies to deal with
signiﬁcant risks, including measures such as insurance and
use of external specialists;
• a centrally coordinated internal audit programme to support the
Board in its role of ensuring a sound control environment;
• regular reports to the Audit Committee on the adequacy and
effectiveness of internal control;
• a remuneration policy for executives which motivates them,
without delivering excessive beneﬁts or encouraging excessive
risk taking; and
• regular reports to the Board and Group Health, Safety
and Environment Committee on health, safety and
environmental matters.
The Board, in conjunction with management, has agreed a number
of activities to further develop the internal control environment.
Progress on these initiatives, alongside the development of
embedded risk management and assurance processes, is being
made. Details of initiatives in the area of ﬁnancial risk management
can be found in the Financial Review commencing on page 36,
and initiatives in the area of health, safety and the environment
can be found in the Corporate Responsibility Report commencing
on page 50.
All acquired businesses will be brought within the Group’s system
of internal control as soon as practicable and in any event within
12 months of acquisition. ENRC PLC, in which the Group has a 26%
shareholding, has not been incorporated into the Group’s system
of internal control.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal audit advises management on the extent to which systems
of internal control are adequate and effective to manage business risk,
safeguard the Group’s resources, and ensure compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements. It provides objective assurance on risk and
controls to senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board.
Internal audit’s work is focused on areas of greatest risk to the Group
and its mandate and programme of work is approved by the Audit
Committee. Based on the approved audit plan, internal audit has
undertaken a number of audits across operations and functions to
facilitate improvement of the Group’s internal controls, reporting
ﬁndings to relevant operational management. The head of internal
audit reports regularly to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee receives reports from the head of internal audit
on the department’s work and ﬁndings and the effectiveness of the
internal audit function is reviewed and discussed on an annual
basis with the head of internal audit.
Internal audit reports include recommendations to improve internal
controls together with agreed management action plans to resolve
the issues raised. Internal audit follows up the implementation of
recommendations and reports progress to senior management
and the Audit Committee.
MANAGEMENT OF RISK
The Group, in the course of its business activities, is exposed to
strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and compliance risks. Overall
management of these risks is vested in the Board, with the Audit
Committee having delegated authority for reviewing the Group’s risk
management framework. The Board has approved a formalised but
pragmatic Group risk management framework. This framework
is designed to provide assurance that risks are being identiﬁed and
managed in a manner appropriate to the Group’s circumstances.
It comprises risk identiﬁcation and assessment processes, together
with risk response and monitoring activities. The Group Risk Manager
coordinates the risk assessment and identiﬁcation activities, and
facilitates the development of appropriate responses to identiﬁed risks.
Details of the process for identifying and managing the Group’s risks

Directors’ Report: Governance
GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS
The Board recognises the importance of good communications with
shareholders and maintains an active dialogue with its key ﬁnancial
audiences, including institutional shareholders, sell-side analysts and
potential shareholders. The Chief Executive and the Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer are closely involved in investor relations and the Head of
Corporate Communications has day-to-day responsibility for
such matters.
The Company has approved a communications policy which has been
adopted throughout the Group. The executive Directors are available,
through the Head of Corporate Communications, to discuss the
concerns of major shareholders at any time during the year and the
Chairman is available to discuss governance and strategy with major
shareholders. Non-executive Directors, and in particular the Senior
Independent Director, will continue to make themselves available
to attend meetings with shareholders in order to develop an
understanding of their views. The Company responds as necessary
to requests from individual shareholders on a wide range of issues.
There is regular dialogue with key institutional shareholders and
sell-side analysts to discuss strategy, ﬁnancial performance and
investment activities throughout the Group, who also from time to
time visit the Group’s operations. During 2009, executive Directors
and senior management met with institutional investors in London,
Scotland, continental Europe, United States of America and
Singapore. A number of roadshows also took place during 2009
and attendance at several United Kingdom, European and American
conferences provided a comprehensive dialogue with shareholders.
The Company issues quarterly production updates and interim
management statements in April and October to the market.
These, together with copies of institutional analyst presentations
each half year, the Group’s preliminary and half-yearly results and all
announcements issued to the London Stock Exchange, are available
on the Company’s website (www.kazakhmys.com). Furthermore,
the Company has taken full advantage of the provisions within the
Companies Act 2006 allowing the website to be used as the primary
means of communication with shareholders where they have not
requested hard copy documentation. The Company now produces
an annual Super Summary which is sent to all shareholders who
have not requested hard copy documentation to advise them
of the availability of the Annual Report and Accounts and Notice
of Annual General Meeting on the Company’s website.
The Shareholder Information section on pages 164 to 165 contains
further details on electronic communications together with more
general information of interest to shareholders which is also
included on the Company’s website.
The Notice of Annual General Meeting is circulated to all
shareholders at least 20 business days prior to such a meeting
and it is Company policy not to combine resolutions. All shareholders
are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting at which there is
an opportunity for individual shareholders to question the Chairman
and, through him, the chairmen of the principal Board committees.
After the Annual General Meeting, shareholders can meet informally
with the Directors. Furthermore, all shareholders are entitled to
receive dividends, when declared, to appoint proxies to attend
any general meeting of the Company and to exercise voting rights.
None of the Company’s shares carry any special rights with regard
to control of the Company and there are no restrictions on voting
rights. Major shareholders have the same voting rights per share
as all other shareholders.
All members of the Board (excluding Daulet Yergozhin who was
unable to attend due to a conﬂict in schedules) attended the 2009
Annual General Meeting. At the Annual General Meeting, the
Chairman provides a brief summary of the Company’s activities
for the previous year to the shareholders. All resolutions at the 2009
Annual General Meeting were voted by way of an electronic poll.
This procedure follows best practice and allows the Company to
count all votes rather than just those of shareholders attending the
meeting. As recommended by the Combined Code, all resolutions
were voted separately and the voting results, which included all votes
cast for, against and those withheld, together with all proxies lodged
prior to the meeting, were reported at the meeting and the final
results were made available on the Company’s website as soon as
practicable after the meeting. As in previous years, the Form of Proxy
made it clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not
be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for or
against a resolution.
The Directors’ responsibility statement for the preparation of the
Annual Report and Accounts is set out on page 82.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The four principal committees of the Board are the Audit, Group Health,
Safety and Environment, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
Board committee members are appointed by the Board upon the
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which reviews the
composition of each committee regularly. Committee members are
expected to attend each committee meeting, unless there are
exceptional circumstances which prevent them from doing so. The
Company Secretary, Robert Welch, is secretary to the Group Health,
Safety and Environment, Nomination and Remuneration Committees
and the Deputy Company Secretary, Stephen Hodges, is secretary to
the Audit Committee. The terms of reference of each committee are
available on the Company’s website (www.kazakhmys.com) and on
request from the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered
ofﬁce. The terms of reference of each committee are reviewed
annually. Each committee reports on its activities to the next
Board meeting following its meeting.

access to the Committee chairman and is accountable to the
Committee. Furthermore, the chairman of the Committee meets
from time to time with the external auditor and senior management
to ensure a full understanding of relevant issues.

ACTIVITIES IN 2009
At its meetings in 2009, the Committee considered, amongst other
matters, the following:
Financial reporting:
• reviewed interim management statements, half-yearly and annual
results, including accounting policies, estimates and judgements
applied in preparing them and the transparency and clarity of the
disclosures within them;
• received reports from management and the external auditor on
accounting, tax and legal issues; and
• reviewed the basis for preparing the Group accounts on a going
concern basis.
Internal control:
• received reports from management on the implementation of
enhanced ﬁnancial reporting procedures and controls, and IT systems;

external auditor and the statement concerning such disclosure in
the Annual Report and Accounts.
Risk management:
• reviewed the effectiveness of the Group risk management framework
as described on page 32 and reports arising out of the risk
management process; and
• monitored the Group’ s insurance arrangements.

the audit plan could be delivered as part of the overall assessment
of the effectiveness of the internal audit department.

• approved the terms of engagement of the external auditor, the
fees paid to them and the plan of the work carried out by them;
• reviewed policies on the independence of the external auditor
and the provision of non-audit services;
• assessed the independence and objectivity of the external auditor
and in this process reviewed a report from the external auditor
on all relationships that might reasonably have a bearing on their
independence and the audit partner and staff’s objectivity, and
the related safeguards and procedures;
• received reports on the ﬁndings of the external auditor during
their half-yearly review and annual audit and reviewed the
recommendations made to management by the external
auditor and management’s responses;
• reviewed letters of representation to the external auditor;
• assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor; and
• recommended the re-appointment of the external auditor.
Other matters:
• reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements by which staff

other improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting and other matters;
• reviewed the relevant disclosures in this Annual Report and
Accounts; and
• reviewed the Committee’s effectiveness and terms of reference.
The Committee also receives reports on developments in ﬁnancial
reporting practices, legislative and regulatory changes and other
relevant matters so as to enable it to fulﬁl its responsibilities.
The Committee’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by the
external auditor and their associates includes the identiﬁcation of
certain non-audit services which the external auditor is prohibited from
providing and a process through which other non-audit services are
approved. All non-audit services require the agreement of the Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer, and the approval of the Committee chairman for certain
services, before they can be undertaken, with certain engagements over
£50,000 only being awarded to the external auditor after a competitive
tender process. The non-audit services of the external auditor will only
be used where the Group beneﬁts in a cost-effective manner and the
external auditor maintains the necessary degree of independence
and objectivity. Details of all non-audit services are reported to the
Committee twice a year. The policy will be kept under review and
may be amended from time to time as necessary.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor for audit
and non-audit services for the year ended 31 December 2009
and information on the nature of non-audit fees appear in
note 11 to the ﬁnancial statements on page 119.
The Committee is primarily responsible for evaluating the effectiveness
of the Group’s policies and systems for identifying and managing health,
safety and environmental risks within the Group, for recommending
to the Board the Group’s policies on health, safety and environmental
matters and for ensuring that an effective system of health, safety
and environmental standards, procedures and practices is in place
at each of the Group’s operational sites.

and involved site visits and meetings with management responsible
for health and safety, with all visits lasting for two or three days.

Directors’ Report: Governance
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased
to present this Directors’ Remuneration
Report for the 2009 ﬁnancial year, which
sets out the Company’s remuneration
policy for executive Directors and
non-executive Directors and provides
details of their and certain senior
managers’ remuneration and
share interests for the year
ended 31 December 2009.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the reporting
requirements of The Large and Medium Sized Companies and
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
The unprecedented global economic downturn created an unusually
challenging economic environment. Kazakhmys has nevertheless
delivered a robust set of results while taking signiﬁcant steps to
promote long-term growth.
During 2009, the Committee reviewed Kazakhmys’ approach
to executive remuneration and the use of share-based incentives
across the Group. The review was driven by the changing economic
climate, the continued evolution of the Group since its Listing and
the need to remain competitive in the mining sector in which
Kazakhmys competes for talent.
In order to ensure that Kazakhmys can continue to attract, motivate
and retain high calibre personnel it is essential to offer arrangements
which are competitive with other industry participants. This year, at
Kazakhmys’ Annual General Meeting, the Company will be seeking
formal shareholder approval for UK and International Sharesave plans
and UK and International Share Incentive plans. The Company will also
be seeking approval of the rules of, and a number of amendments
to, Kazakhmys’ Long Term Incentive Plan and Executive Share
Option Plan. Details of these plans are included in the Notice
of Meeting, which accompanies this Annual Report and Accounts.
As part of its review, the Committee considered the remuneration
arrangements of the executive Directors and senior managers and
determined that Oleg Novachuk and Eduard Ogay should be
eligible to participate in Kazakhmys’ share-based incentive plans
to further align their interests with those of shareholders and better
allow them to participate in the long-term success of the Group.
During 2010, the Committee will be considering the changes being
proposed by the Financial Reporting Council to the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance and the recommendations arising from
the Walker Review on corporate governance in UK banks and other
financial institutions published in November 2009, and their
implications for the Company's remuneration policy. Any changes
to the Company’s remuneration policy will be reported in next
year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.

speciﬁc matters.
ACTIVITIES IN 2009
At its meetings in 2009, the Committee considered, amongst
other matters, the following:
• the 2008 Directors’ Remuneration Report;
• evaluation of the performance of the Committee;
• the Committee’s remit;
• levels of base salary for executive Directors and certain
senior managers;
• determining annual bonus outturn for executive Directors
and certain senior managers;
• setting awards levels and performance targets in respect
of the Company’s share-based incentive plans;
• changes to the LTIP comparator group;
• introduction of a number of new equity-based incentive schemes;
• introduction of new and revised bonus arrangements for below
Board level employees;
• proposed terms of appointment for David Munro; and
• incentive arrangements for David Munro.
External adviser
The Committee has authority to obtain the advice of external
independent remuneration consultants. It is solely responsible for
their appointment, retention and termination and for approval of the
basis of their fees and other terms. In the year to 31 December 2009,
the Committee received advice on executive compensation,
performance-related pay schemes and equity-based incentive schemes
from Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS). HNBS also provides advice to
the Company on remuneration matters for senior employees including
equity-based incentives. The terms of engagement between the
Committee and HNBS are available on request.
Remuneration policy
The Committee seeks to ensure that the Company’s remuneration
policies and practices facilitate the recruitment and motivation of high
calibre personnel with the appropriate skills to implement the Group’s
business objectives, while also relating reward to performance and
aligning the interests of executive Directors and senior managers
with those of shareholders. It aims to follow best practice in relation
to its remuneration policy and, in particular, complies with the
Combined Code.
In constructing and reviewing remuneration packages, the emphasis
is on rewarding executive Directors competitively for their contribution
to the Company’s performance and for enhancing value to shareholders,
taking into account market comparisons, the competitive pressures
in the mining sector, internal relativities and sound risk management
practices. External comparisons, including annual assessments of the
relevant senior executive remuneration market, look at comparable roles
in similar organisations in terms of operations and market capitalisation.
The Committee continues to take a responsible approach toward
benchmarking and aims to set reward opportunity for executive
Directors within the market competitive range, but with a
balanced overall positioning.
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
• determining, reviewing and recommending to the Board the
framework for executive remuneration;
• within the agreed framework, setting, reviewing and determining
individual remuneration arrangements for executive Directors
(including the Chairman) and certain senior managers;
• approving the design of, and determining the targets for, any
performance-related pay schemes;
• determining the design of any share incentive schemes for
approval by the Board, and the grant, award, allocation or issue
of shares, share options or payments under any such schemes; and
• approving the service agreements of each executive Director,
including termination arrangements.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on
the Company’s website (www.kazakhmys.com) or on request
from the Company Secretary’s department at the Company’s
registered ofﬁce.
ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 74 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Governance
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The strategy for executive Director remuneration, in general terms,
is to provide a balanced package around the relevant mid-market level
for comparable mining companies and other companies of a similar
size to Kazakhmys in the FTSE 100, with a high proportion of total
remuneration being awarded through performance-related elements.
In addition to consideration of market data, when setting salaries,
individual judgement is exercised by the Committee, having regard
to an individual’s performance, experience and responsibilities, the
Company’s performance as a whole, the markets in which the Group
operates and remuneration levels of Group employees. Remuneration
arrangements and performance targets are reviewed on a regular basis
to achieve these objectives.
The Committee strives to ensure that the remuneration policy provides
a strong and demonstrable link between incentives and the Group’s
strategy, and sets a performance-biased framework for remuneration
which is consistent with the Group’s scale and unique circumstances,
and which motivates its executive Directors and senior managers and
enables them to share in the long-term success of the Group, without
delivering excessive beneﬁts or encouraging excessive risk taking.
When designing remuneration structures and setting performance
targets the Committee is mindful of environmental, social and
governance (ESG) matters. In particular, it will consult with the
Group Health, Safety and Environment Committee to ensure effective
systems are in place to mitigate against any risks in remuneration
incentives. The Committee monitors progress and achievement
against ESG key performance indicators which, in part, determine
the operational performance component of the annual bonus of
the executive Directors.
The Committee intends to continue with the remuneration policy for
2010 and subsequent years, and will continue to consult on material
changes with major institutional shareholders.
As previously stated, the Committee will be considering during 2010 the
proposed changes to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
and the recommendations arising from the Walker Review, and their
implications for the Company's remuneration policy. In particular, the
Committee will be reviewing its remuneration policy in the context
of risk and ensuring that risk management controls are in place
and operating effectively.
At present the Committee already reviews the remuneration incentives
offered to those key individuals that have the most impact on the risk
proﬁle of the business. The Committee is satisﬁed with the way in which
performance objectives and risk assessments are reﬂected in the pay
structures for these individuals.
Overall the Committee is satisﬁed that remuneration policy is aligned
with the long-term needs of the business and that incentive quantum,
structure and objectives do not encourage excessive risk-taking.
The substantial shareholdings of the executive Directors and certain
senior managers assist alignment with shareholder value.
Review of remuneration, and proposed changes for 2010/2011
During the year, the Committee undertook a comprehensive review
of executive remuneration arrangements and the share-based incentive
arrangements used more widely throughout the Group.
As a result of the review, the Committee decided to make and propose
certain changes to its share-based incentive arrangements in order for
Kazakhmys to maintain its competitive position and better align the
interests of its employees with those of its shareholders. The key
elements of the changes can be summarised as follows:
Proposed UK and International Sharesave Plans
Shareholder approval is being sought for new UK Sharesave
and International Sharesave plans. These Sharesave plans provide
an opportunity for eligible employees to save over a period of either
three or ﬁve years and to use their accumulated savings (and any
interest) to exercise an option to acquire Kazakhmys shares at a
predetermined exercise price.
The terms of the UK Sharesave plan and the International Sharesave
plan are substantially the same, save that under the International
Sharesave plan the Committee will have a greater degree of
discretion to determine who of its 61,000 plus employees will be
eligible to participate and to permit eligible employees to save in a
currency other than pounds sterling. The International Sharesave plan
may be amended to adopt procedures in relation to its implementation
to take account of overseas securities laws, exchange controls, taxation,
ﬁnancial regulations and both local custom and practice.
The UK Sharesave plan will be subject to the approval of Her Majesty's
Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and has a number of tax beneﬁts; in
particular, no income tax or National Insurance contributions will
normally be due if the option is exercised after three years.
Subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders, it is currently
intended that invitations to participate in the Sharesave plans will be
offered for the ﬁrst time in or around August 2010 shortly following the
announcement of the Company's half-yearly results. A summary of the
principal terms of the Sharesave plans is set out in Appendix I to the
Notice of AGM which accompanies this Annual Report and Accounts.
Proposed UK Share Incentive Plan (UK SIP) and International Share
Incentive Plan (International SIP)
The UK SIP and International SIP will allow eligible employees the
opportunity to purchase Kazakhmys shares, in the case of the UK SIP ,
out of their gross earnings and, in the case of the International SIP , out
of their net earnings of up to £1,500 per tax year (or the local currency
equivalent) or, if less, an amount up to 10% of annual salary (known
as partnership shares). The Company may then match the number of
partnership shares purchased by an employee up to a maximum match
of two shares for every one partnership share purchased. In addition,
the Company may also offer eligible employees free shares worth up
to £1,500 per tax year (or the local currency equivalent).
The terms of the UK SIP and the International SIP are substantially
the same, save that under the International SIP the Committee will
have a greater degree of discretion to determine who of its 61,000
plus employees will be eligible to participate. The Committee may also,
in its discretion, change the structure of awards and adopt procedures
in relation to its implementation to take account of overseas securities
laws, exchange controls, taxation, ﬁnancial regulations and both local
custom and practice.
The UK SIP will be subject to the approval of HMRC and has a number
of tax beneﬁts; in particular, if plan shares are held in the UK SIP for at
least ﬁve years, no income tax or National Insurance contributions will be
payable when the shares are withdrawn from the employee beneﬁt trust.
Subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders, it is currently
intended that invitations to participate in the SIPs will be offered for the
ﬁrst time in or around April 2011 shortly following the announcement
of the Company's preliminary results for 2010. To encourage employee
ownership of Kazakhmys shares, the Company intends to match, share
for share, each partnership share bought on a one for one basis. A
summary of the principal terms of both the UK SIP and International SIP
are set out in Appendix I to the Notice of AGM which accompanies

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The rules of the LTIP were approved and adopted by the Board on
3 September 2007. The LTIP is a discretionary long-term incentive
plan and provides for the grant of conditional free share awards
to certain selected senior managers and employees (excluding
executive Directors). Awards will normally vest three years from the
date of grant, subject to the achievement of demanding performance
criteria based on Kazakhmys’ relative total shareholder return (TSR)
performance. At present awards under the LTIP may only be
satisfied using existing shares purchased in the market.
The Committee wishes to amend the LTIP to permit the grant
of awards to executive Directors and to allow future awards to be
satisﬁed using new issue shares and treasury shares as well as existing
shares purchased in the market. Accordingly, shareholders are being
asked to approve amendments to the rules of the LTIP that will permit
awards to be granted to executive Directors and to allow the Committee
to grant and satisfy future awards over new issue shares and treasury
shares as well as existing shares. The principal terms of the LTIP
and the proposed amendments are described in more detail in the
summary of the LTIP as set out in Appendix II to the Notice of AGM.
Subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders, the Committee
decided in September 2009 to make an LTIP award with a face value
of up to two times salary to Oleg Novachuk, subject to the same
performance condition (and performance period) applying to the
award made to Eduard Ogay on 26 November 2009, in order to
retain his services as Chief Executive and allow him to participate in
the long-term success of the Group. However, the award will not vest
until the third anniversary of its date of grant. No LTIP awards will be
made to either Vladimir Kim, due to his substantial shareholding in
the Company, or David Munro, who is unable to commit to carrying
out his present duties for the Company in Kazakhstan for more than
two years.
The main objective of introducing LTIP awards into the remuneration
structure for Oleg Novachuk is to provide a more balanced,
performance-biased remuneration package consistent with
packages provided to other chief executives in comparator
group companies which:
• takes into account current best practice in corporate governance
and ﬁts with Kazakhmys’ need to motivate its executive Directors;
• provides a mix of performance targets to reward both absolute
and relative performance;
• provides a more appropriate balance between short-term and
long-term reward, with balance becoming more long-term; and
• provides a more appropriate balance between ﬁxed and variable
compensation, with phased delivery over the short, medium and
long term.
Performance measure
Under the current and proposed TSR performance condition,
Kazakhmys’ performance will be compared to a comparator group
of 22 UK and international mining companies, with no vesting below
median TSR, 30% vesting for median performance and full vesting
for upper quartile performance; a sliding scale of vesting will be
applied for performance between median and upper quartile. This
target will be reviewed annually to ensure that it remains demanding
for future award grants. In the event of a change of control, awards
will normally vest on a pro rata basis by reference to the length of
time since the award was granted, and only if the performance
conditions can effectively be regarded as having been satisﬁed
at that time.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the comparator group and
the following companies were added: Cameco Corporation, Fresnillo
plc, Hochschild Mining plc, Inmet Mining Corporation and Southern
Copper Corporation. In addition, Zinfex Limited was removed from
the comparator group following its merger with Oxiana Limited.
The current group of comparator companies (applicable for
awards granted in 2010) comprises:
Alcoa Inc Anglo American plc
Antofagasta plc Aquarius Platinum plc
BHP Billiton plc Boliden AB
Cameco Corporation Eurasian Natural
Resources Corporation PLC
First Quantum Minerals Ltd Freeport-McMoran
Copper & Gold Inc
Fresnillo plc Hochschild Mining plc
Inmet Mining Corporation Korea Zinc Inc
Lonmin plc Lundin Mining
Corporation
Rio Tinto plc Southern Copper
Corporation
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Ltd Teck Resources Ltd ‘B’
Vedanta Resources plc Xstrata plc
Proposed Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
The ESOP is an HMRC approved discretionary company share option
plan that provides for the grant of market value options up to a value
of £30,000 to certain selected UK-based senior managers (excluding
executive Directors). Options will normally vest three years from the
date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and
the participant being a director or employee of the Group at that time.
At present options under the ESOP may only be satisﬁed using existing
shares purchased in the market.
The Committee wishes to amend the ESOP to permit the grant of options
to executive Directors and for options to be satisﬁed using new issue shares
and treasury shares as well as existing shares purchased in the market.
Options granted to executive Directors and senior managers under the
ESOP in the future will count towards the individual limits under the LTIP
and will normally be subject to the same performance conditions as
awards granted under the LTIP .
Accordingly, shareholders are being asked to approve amendments to
the rules of the ESOP that will permit awards to be granted to executive
Directors and to allow the Committee to grant and satisfy future awards
over new issue shares and treasury shares as well as existing shares.
The principal terms of the ESOP and the proposed amendments
are described in more detail in the summary of the ESOP as set
out in Appendix II to the Notice of AGM.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Executive Director remuneration in 2009
The Committee determines the remuneration package for the
executive Directors and certain senior managers. The package is
designed to attract and retain high quality executives, induce loyalty
and motivate them to achieve a high level of long-term corporate
performance in line with the best interests of shareholders, whilst
avoiding excessive short-term risk taking. The principal elements
of remuneration for executive Directors in 2009 were base salary,
beneﬁts in kind and an annual bonus opportunity, which are further
explained below.
Base salary and beneﬁts
Base salaries are reviewed annually, with any increases normally
effective from 1 January. Adjustments in base salary are made
to reflect movements in the employment market, the general
economic environment, internal relativities and individual and
Company performance. Base salaries paid to executive Directors
are adjusted to take account of the absence of any pension provision.
In line with competitive practice, executive Directors are entitled
to receive additional benefits including use of a car for business
purposes and medical insurance.
The base salaries for the executive Directors for 2008, 2009 and 2010
are shown in the table below. For 2009 Vladimir Kim and Oleg Novachuk
accepted a decrease in their base salaries of approximately 9%, reﬂecting
the difﬁcult economic environment of the Group. With effect from
1 January 2010, they received a 5% increase in their 2009 base salaries.
The increase reﬂects their contribution to the strong performance of the
Group in 2009 and the levels of base salary and total remuneration in
comparator companies. For David Munro whose salary was increased
from £600,000 to £720,000 with effect from 1 April 2009, reﬂecting his
relocation and that of his family to Kazakhstan and the direct role he
is playing in modernising and improving the Company’s operations in
Kazakhstan, and the fact that he does not participate in any share-based
incentive plans. With effect from 1 April 2010, he will receive an increase
in salary to £750,000. The base salaries of the Group’s workforce
in the United Kingdom and Kazakhstan increased on average
by approximately 4.2% and 7.5% for 2010, respectively.

Annual bonus opportunity
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the annual
performance bonus scheme to ensure it remains competitive, continues
to incentivise the executive Directors and aligns their interests with
those of shareholders.
For 2009, the potential maximum performance-related bonus payable
was 120% of base salary for Vladimir Kim and Oleg Novachuk, and
200% of base salary for David Munro.
Bonuses, which are payable wholly in cash, are disclosed for the year
in which they are earned although they are not due and payable until
the following March after the release of the audited ﬁnancial results.
Vladimir Kim and Oleg Novachuk
For Vladimir Kim and Oleg Novachuk the annual bonus opportunity
comprises four discrete elements: an operational performance
component (including safety) (representing 33.4% of potential bonus),
a ﬁnancial performance component (representing 22.2% of potential
bonus), a strategic development measure (including execution of new
projects) (representing 22.2% of potential bonus) and a shareholder
return measure (representing 22.2% of potential bonus). Specific
targets are not disclosed as they would give a clear indication of
the Group’s business targets which are commercially sensitive.
In determining the actual bonus payments, the Committee takes into
consideration such factors as performance related to the Group’s
financial KPIs, operational performance against budget, safety
performance, business development activities and performance
against industry peers. Payments are made in return for the
achievement of stretching objectives.
In the course of 2009, Kazakhmys substantially outperformed both
the FTSE100 comparator group and the FTSE350 Mining Index.
Helped by the recovery in copper prices, but also by very effective
management actions to control costs and successfully develop the
Group’s strategy, including the sale of 50% of the Ekibastuz GRES-1
power business to Samruk and progress in securing a $2.7 billion loan
from the China Development Bank and Samruk for the development
of the Bozshakol and other organic growth projects, Kazakhmys
delivered the best share price performance on the FTSE100
over the calendar year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
In recognition of these achievements, bonuses earned by Vladimir Kim
and Oleg Novachuk in 2009 were 85% of base salary, compared with
35% of base salary in 2008, reﬂecting the Group’s strong performance
in 2009. A top decile performance target on shareholder return and
above target performance on the other three measures were achieved.
The actual bonus payments received by them are shown in the
table opposite.
David Munro
In deference to the views of some shareholders and governance
institutions, David Munro decided to forego options granted to him
under a special once-only share option grant under Listing Rule 9.4.2(R)
as well as participation in the Change Management Plan as detailed
in the 2008 Annual Report and Accounts. Following this decision and
as David Munro does not receive any share-based incentives due
to the time-frame to which he is committed to his present role with
the Company (not more than two years), and nor does he receive any
pension beneﬁts, it was agreed that his base salary should be increased
to £720,000 per annum (£750,000 per annum with effect from 1 April
2010) and that his maximum bonus entitlement should be increased
to two times salary, with a target level of one times salary.
David Munro’s annual bonus opportunity comprises two discrete
elements: measurable improvements in the cost base of the Company
and its operations under the programme of change being developed
and implemented by him in Kazakhstan (representing 50% of potential
bonus) and progress on the Group’s two major organic growth projects
– Aktogay and Bozshakol (representing 50% of potential bonus).
In determining the actual bonus payment, the Committee takes
into consideration such factors as improvements in procurement,
outsourcing, maintenance and development, mine planning, IT support
and training (net of any currency movements), safety performance and
culture, and the achievement on time and on budget of the various
project milestones of the Group’s major organic growth projects.
The bonus earned by David Munro in 2009 has been set at 120%
of base salary. Above target performance on both measures was
achieved in 2009 reﬂecting the signiﬁcant progress made in
developing a change management plan across the Group’s
businesses in Kazakhstan and in developing the Aktogay
and Bozshakol projects.
Pensions
The Company does not provide pension beneﬁts on behalf of any
executive Directors. The absence of any pension provision is taken into
account when setting base salaries and other elements of remuneration.
Employee Beneﬁt Trust
The Kazakhmys Employee Beneﬁt Trust has been established to acquire
ordinary shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds
provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise
of awards under the Group’s share-based incentive plans. The trustees
of the Kazakhmys Employee Beneﬁt Trust have informed the Company
that their intention is to abstain from voting in respect of the Kazakhmys
shares held in the trust.
Performance graph
The graph below shows the value, at 31 December 2009, of £100
invested in Kazakhmys PLC shares on 6 October 2005 (the initial Listing
date) compared with an equivalent investment in the FTSE 100 Index and
FTSE 350 Mining Sector Index. These indices were chosen as they are
broad-based indices of which the Company is a member and are widely
recognised performance comparisons for large UK mining companies.

Directors’ Report: Governance
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Service agreements
The Company’s policy is that executive Directors will be employed on a
contract that can be terminated by the Company on giving no more than
one year’s notice, with the Director required to give up to six months’
notice of termination. The contracts of Vladimir Kim and Oleg Novachuk
are terminable by either the Company or the executive on three months’
notice. These were granted to them on 26 September 2005. The contract
of David Munro is terminable by either the Company or him on giving
six months’ notice. The contract was granted to him on 30 March 2009.
The Committee continues to believe that, in the event of
early termination, it is more appropriate to consider the speciﬁc
circumstances of each case. This includes, where appropriate, phased
payment of compensation over a ﬁxed period or until the executive
Director ﬁnds a new position, if earlier, and mitigation of payment of
compensation through a legal obligation on the part of the outgoing
executive Director to seek new employment, rather than explicitly
provide for compensation payments in service contracts.
Policy on external appointments
The Committee believes that the Company can beneﬁt from executive
Directors holding one approved non-executive directorship of another
company, offering Directors the opportunity to broaden their experience
and knowledge. Company policy is to allow Directors to retain fees paid
from any such appointment. David Munro is a non-executive director
of Lonmin plc and is a member of its Nomination Committee and Safety
and Sustainability Committee. In this capacity he receives a total annual
fee of £65,000 which he retains.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but each has
a letter of appointment with the Company. Each letter of appointment
provides for a one-month notice period. Non-executive Directors are
normally appointed for two consecutive three-year terms, with any
third term of three years being subject to rigorous review and taking
into account the need progressively to refresh the Board. Non-executive
Directors are subject to election at the AGM following their appointment
and subsequently at intervals of no more than three years. For each
non-executive Director who served during 2009, the effective date
of their letter of appointment and the date of the next Annual General
Meeting at which they are subject to re-election or election is shown
in the table below.

Non-executive Director fees
Fees for the non-executive Directors are determined by the Board
as a whole, upon the recommendation of the executive Directors,
with regard to market practice and to reﬂect individual responsibilities
and membership of Board Committees.
The Board reviews non-executive Directors’ fees periodically. In 2009,
the base fee for non-executive Directors was reduced from £120,000
to £84,000, with additional fees paid to the Senior Independent Director,
and Board Committee chairmen and members. Non-executive Directors
do not participate in any of the Company’s share schemes or incentive
plans, nor do they accrue pension beneﬁts from the Company for their
non-executive Director services. The fee structure as at 31 December
2009 is shown below. No increase in non-executive Director fees is
proposed for 2010.

Directors’ Report: Governance
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Principal activities
Kazakhmys PLC is the holding company of the Kazakhmys Group.
The principal activities of the Group are the production of copper
and other metals as by-products, including zinc, silver and gold,
and power generation.
A list of main subsidiary undertakings, and their principal activity,
is given in note 44 on page 149.
Directors
The Directors of the Company who served during the year were as
indicated on pages 60 and 61. Details of Directors’ interests in shares
can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 79.
Clinton Dines was appointed to the Board as a non-executive Director
on 1 October 2009. Newly appointed Directors are required to retire
at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting (AGM) following their appointment
and to seek election by shareholders. Therefore, Clinton Dines will be
seeking election by shareholders at the 2010 AGM.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association,
Philip Aiken, Simon Heale and David Munro will retire as Directors
at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, will offer themselves for
re-election. As explained in the service agreement paragraph on page
78, David Munro has a service agreement terminable by the Company
or the Director on six months’ notice. Neither Philip Aiken nor
Simon Heale has a service agreement.
During the year no Director had any interest in any shares or
debentures of the Company’s subsidiaries, or any material interests
in any contract with the Company or a subsidiary being a contract
of signiﬁcance in relation to the Company’s business.
Directors’ indemnity and insurance
Kazakhmys maintains liability insurance for its Directors and ofﬁcers.
The Company has also granted indemnities to each of the Directors,
Matthew Hird (Chief Financial Ofﬁcer) and the Company Secretary
to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities are uncapped in
amount, in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may
incur to third parties in the course of acting as a Director (or ofﬁcer
or company secretary as the case may be) of the Company or any of
its associated companies. Neither the indemnity nor insurance cover
provides cover in the event that a Director (or ofﬁcer or company
secretary as the case may be) is proved to have acted fraudulently
or dishonestly.
The indemnity is categorised as a ‘qualifying third-party indemnity’
for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 and will continue in force
for the beneﬁt of Directors (or ofﬁcer or company secretary as the case
may be) on an ongoing basis.
Dividend
The Board recommends the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 9.0 US
cents per ordinary share (2008: nil). If approved, the dividend will be
paid on 18 May 2010 to shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 23 April 2010. The Board decided not to pay an interim
dividend in 2009. Shareholders may elect to receive their dividend in
UK pounds sterling by completing a currency election form available
from the Company’s registrar.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held at 12.15pm

separate Notice of Meeting which accompanies this Annual Report
and Accounts.
A summary of the business carried out at the AGM will be published
on the Company’s website (www.kazakhmys.com).
Share capital
Further to the ﬁnal phase of implementation of the Companies Act
2006, the requirement for companies to have an authorised share

that the Group is capable of carrying on its business for the beneﬁt
of the shareholders of the Company as a whole.

The Group did not give any money for political purposes in the United
Kingdom nor did it make any donations to EU political organisations
or incur any EU political expenditure during the year. The Group made
charitable donations of $5.8 million during the year (2008: $5.3 million).
Further details of payments for charitable and community purposes
made during the year are given on pages 56 and 57.
Suppliers
It is the Company’s policy that payments to suppliers are made
in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed between the
Company and its suppliers, provided that all relevant trading terms
and conditions have been complied with.
The average creditor payment period for the year ended 31 December
2009 for the Company was 3.8 days (2008: 6.0 days).
Market value of land and buildings
Land acquired prior to 1 January 2002, is carried in the balance sheet
at deemed cost resulting from a revaluation, which was undertaken as at
1 January 2002 as part of the Group’s transition to reporting under IFRS.
Land and buildings acquired since 1 January 2002 are recorded at cost.
It is not practical to estimate the market value of land, buildings and
mineral reserves and resources at each balance sheet date. www.kazakhmys.com 81
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
Policy on derivatives and ﬁnancial instruments
The Group’s objectives and policies on ﬁnancial risk management,
and information on the Group’s exposures to foreign currency, credit,
commodity, price, liquidity and interest rate risks can be found in note
33 commencing on page 136.
Signiﬁcant agreements – change of control
The following signiﬁcant agreements contain certain termination
and other rights for the counterparties upon a change of control
of the Company.
The terms of a $2.1 billion pre-export ﬁnance debt facility (the ‘Facility’)
dated 29 February 2008 between the Company and the ﬁnancial
institutions named in the Facility provide that if any person (excluding
Vladimir Kim or Oleg Novachuk) or group of people acting in concert
secures control of the Company: (i) a lender under the Facility shall not
be obliged to fund a loan; and (ii) if a body of lenders representing
more than two-thirds of the amount of the Facility so require, the
parties shall enter into negotiations for a period of not more than
30 days with a view to agreeing alternative terms for continuing the
Facility. If no alternative basis has been agreed during such period then
the lenders may cancel the commitments of the lenders to lend the
Facility and declare all outstanding amounts due and payable.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to
impact the future growth and operating performance are set out in the
Business Review on pages 2 to 57. The ﬁnancial position of the Group,
its cash ﬂows, ﬁnancial risk management policies and available debt
facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 47.
In addition, note 33 commencing on page 136 sets out the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital structure,
liquidity position and ﬁnancial risks arising from exposures to
commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange.
With the recovery in the commodity prices throughout 2009 and
into 2010 and the disposal of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1, the Group
has a strong cash position with available funds of $903 million at
31 December 2009 and reduced debt levels of $1,650 million. The
Directors have considered the Group’s ﬁnancial position, the available
credit facilities, and the outlook for the Group’s products, along with
accessibility to customers in the key markets of China and Europe,
and believe there is sufﬁcient cover to meet the Group’s anticipated
cash ﬂow requirements.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Articles of Association
The following description summarises certain provisions of the
Company’s Articles of Association and applicable English law
concerning companies (the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006).
This summary is qualiﬁed in its entirety by reference to the
Company’s Articles of Association and the Companies Acts.
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by
a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. Where
class rights are varied, such amendments must be approved by the
members of each class of shares respectively.
At the 2010 AGM a special resolution will be put to shareholders
proposing to adopt new Articles of Association primarily in order to
reﬂect the ﬁnal phase of implementation of the Companies Act 2006
as well as the implementation of the Companies (Shareholder Rights)
Regulations 2009. If adopted, the changes will be reﬂected in the
summary of the Articles of Association which will appear in the 2010
Annual Report and Accounts.
Rights attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company are deﬁned
in the Company’s Articles of Association. The Articles of Association
may be changed with the agreement of shareholders. A shareholder
whose name appears on the register can choose whether his shares
are evidenced by share certiﬁcates or held in electronic form in CREST
(the electronic settlement system in the UK).
Voting rights
Members may attend any general meeting of the Company. On a
show of hands every member (or his representative) who is present in
person or by proxy has one vote on each resolution and on a poll every
member (or his representative) who is present in person or by proxy
shall have one vote on each resolution for each share of which he is
the holder.
At any general meeting a resolution put to a vote of the meeting shall
be decided on a show of hands, unless (before or on the declaration
of the result of the show of hands) a poll is duly demanded. Subject
to the provisions of Companies Acts, a poll may be demanded by the
chairman of the meeting or by at least ﬁve members present in person
or by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting or a member or
members present in person or by proxy representing not less than one
tenth of the total voting rights of all the members having the right to
vote at the meeting or a member or members present in person or by
proxy holding shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting, being
shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less
than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring
that right. As a result of changes introduced by the Companies Act
2006 to allow multiple proxies appointed by a single member to vote
on a show of hands, resulting in the potential for a vote on a show of
hands to be unrepresentative of the wishes of the meeting of the
Company, all substantive resolutions at general meetings will normally
be put to a poll vote. Any form of proxy sent by the Company to
shareholders in relation to any general meeting must be received
whether in written form or electronic form, not less than 48 hours
before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned
meeting at which the person named in the appointment proposes
to vote.
Dividend rights
Shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare dividends but the
amount of the dividend may not exceed the amount recommended
by the Board. The Board can declare and pay interim dividends.
The Board may declare and pay such interim dividends (including
any dividend payable at a ﬁxed rate) of the amounts and on the dates
and for the periods it decides provided the distributable proﬁts of the
Company justify such payment. If at any time the share capital of the
Company is divided into different classes, the Board may pay such
interim dividends on shares which rank after shares conferring
preferential rights with regard to dividends as well as on shares
conferring preferential rights, unless at the time of payment any
preferential dividend is in arrears.
If a dividend has not been claimed for 12 years after the date such
dividend became due for payment, it may be invested or otherwise
made use of by the Board for the beneﬁt of the Company.
Transfer of shares
The Board may refuse to register a transfer of a certiﬁcated share which
is not fully paid (or renunciation of a renounceable letter of allotment),
provided that refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the
Company from taking place on an open and proper basis. The Board
may also refuse to register a transfer unless (i) it is in respect of only
one class of shares, (ii) it is in favour of a single transferee or not more
than four joint transferees, (iii) the instrument of transfer is lodged, duly
stamped (if so required) and delivered for registration to the ofﬁce or
such other place as the Board may determine accompanied by the
certiﬁcate for the shares to which it relates and such other evidence
as the Board may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor
or person renouncing to make the transfer.
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using CREST and
the Board can refuse a transfer of an uncertiﬁcated share in accordance
with the regulations governing the operation of CREST. 82 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Governance
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION CONTINUED
The Board may decide to suspend the registration of transfers, for up
to 30 days a year, by closing the register to shareholders. The Board
cannot suspend the registration of transfers of any uncertiﬁcated
shares without gaining consent from CREST.
Winding up
In the event the Company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the
sanction of a special resolution of the Company and any other sanction
required by law, divide among the members in specie all or any part of
the assets of the Company and he can value any assets and determine
how the division shall be carried out as between the members or
different classes of members. The liquidator may also vest the whole
or any part of the assets in trustees on such trusts for the beneﬁt of
the members, but no member shall be compelled to accept any
assets on which there is a liability.
Variation of rights
If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into shares
of different classes, the rights attached to any share or class of shares
in the Company may be varied or abrogated in such manner (if any)
as may be provided by such rights or, in the absence of any such
provision, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less
than three quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class
or upon the adoption of a resolution passed at a separate general
meeting of the holders of shares of that class.
The rights or privileges attached to any class of shares shall be deemed
not to be varied or abrogated by the creation or issue of any new
shares ranking equally with or subsequent to those already issued or by
the reduction of the capital paid up on such shares or by the purchase
or redemption by the Company of its own shares in accordance with
the provisions of the Companies Acts and the Company’s Articles
of Association.
Powers of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for the management of the business of
the Company and may exercise all powers of the Company subject
to applicable legislation and regulation and Articles of Association.
Further to a resolution passed at the 2009 AGM, the maximum number
of Directors is 12.
Notiﬁcation of the acquisition or disposal of major shareholdings
Rule 5 of the Disclosures and Transparency Rules requires disclosure
to the issuer by (a) holders of shares with voting rights attached, (b)
those entitled to exercise voting rights, and (c) those holding ﬁnancial
instruments which result in a right to acquire shares with voting rights
already in issue, when their interests reach, exceed or fall below 3%,
and every percentage point above 3%.
Audit information
As required by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the
Directors has approved this report and conﬁrmed that so far as he
is aware, there is no relevant audit information (being information
needed by the auditors in connection with preparing their audit
report), of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and he has
taken all steps that he ought to have reasonably taken as a Director to
make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the auditors,
the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the existing
auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , be re-appointed. Ernst & Young LLP have
indicated their willingness to continue in ofﬁce and ordinary resolutions
re-appointing them as auditors and authorising the Directors to set
their remuneration will be proposed at the 2010 AGM.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the
Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the European Union and applicable law and have elected
to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements on the same basis.
The Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements are required
by law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union to present fairly
the ﬁnancial position of the Group and the parent company and the
performance for that period; the Companies Act 2006 provides in
relation to such ﬁnancial statements that references in the relevant
part of that Act to ﬁnancial statements giving a true and fair view
are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
parent company ﬁnancial statements; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company
will continue in business.
The Directors conﬁrm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company and the
Group keep proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy the ﬁnancial position of the Company and of the Group and
that enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities, and
have adopted a control framework for application across the Group.
Responsibility statement
Each Director conﬁrms to the best of his knowledge that:
• the consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards;
• the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company and
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole,
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties
that they face.
The Directors’ Report comprising pages 2 to 82, and including
the sections of the Annual Report and Accounts referred to in these
pages, has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF KAZAKHMYS PLC
We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements
(the ‘financial statements’) of Kazakhmys PLC for the year ended
31 December 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income,
the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated
and Company Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated and
Company Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to
46. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards
the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
set out on page 82, the Directors are responsible for the preparation
of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to
the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness
of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the
Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2009
and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006; and
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial
year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent
with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law
are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 82, in relation to going
concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
Year ended 31 December 2009 
 
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION 
Kazakhmys PLC (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland. The Company’s registered address is 6
th
 Floor, Cardinal 
Place, 100 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL, United Kingdom.  
The Group comprises the Company and its consolidated divisions  
as set out below. 
The Group operates in the natural resources industry. The Group’s 
operations are primarily conducted through the Company’s principal 
division, Kazakhmys Copper, whose major business is the mining and 
processing of copper ore into copper cathodes and copper wire, and 
the refining and sale of precious metals and other by-products of its 
copper mining process. 
The Group operates in a number of divisions within the natural 
resources sector, the principal activities of which are as follows as  
at 31 December 2009: 
Operating division Principal activity Primary country of operations
Kazakhmys Copper 
 
Mining and  
processing copper

Kazakhmys Power and MKM are included as discontinued operations 
within the financial statements (see note 5). 
The legal names of the constituent companies within the above 
divisions are shown in note 44 on page 149. 
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The financial statements set out on pages 86 to 150 have been 
prepared using consistent accounting policies. The Company has 
taken the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 
and has not published the Company’s income statement and  
related notes. 
(a) Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
impact its future growth and operating performance are set out in  
the Business Review on pages 2 to 57. The financial position of  
the Group, its cash flows, financial risk management policies and 
available debt facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 36 to 47. In addition, note 33 commencing on page 136 sets 
out the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital structure, liquidity position and financial risks arising from 
exposures to commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange. 
With the recovery in the commodity prices throughout 2009 and into 
early 2010 and the disposal of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1, the Group 
has a strong cash position with available funds of $903 million at  
31 December 2009 and reduced debt levels of $1,650 million.  
The Directors have considered the Group’s financial position,  
the available credit facilities, the outlook for the Group’s products, 
along with accessibility to customers in the key markets of China  
and Europe, and believe there is sufficient cover to meet the  
Group’s anticipated cash flow requirements. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. 
(b) Basis of accounting 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for certain classes of property, plant and 
equipment which have been revalued at 1 January 2002 to determine 
deemed cost as part of the first-time adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at that date, available for sale 
investments and derivative financial instruments which have been 
measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in US dollars ($) and all financial information has been 
rounded to the nearest million dollar ($ million) except when 
otherwise indicated. 
(c) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial 
position as at 31 December 2009 and the Group’s financial 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group. Control  
exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern  
the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same 
reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. 
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised 
profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in 
full. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised 
gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is 
no evidence of impairment. 
Minority interests primarily represent the interests in Kazakhmys LLC 
not held by the Company. The Company applies the equity concept 
method of consolidation and accounts for the acquisition of minority 
interests within equity. 
Refer to note 44 for a list of the Company’s significant subsidiaries. 
(d) Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and all its 
subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued  
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB, as adopted by the 
European Union, and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
(e) Adoption of standards and interpretations 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has 
applied the following standards and interpretations before or on  
their effective dates: 
• Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment 
Arrangements.’ The Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 2 on  
1 January 2009. The amendment to IFRS 2 has three elements: (i) 
the definition of share based transactions and arrangements has 
been amended, (ii) the scope of IFRS 2 has been amended, and (iii) 
guidance on the accounting for Group cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions has been provided. Adoption of the 
amendment did not have a significant effect on the financial 
position or performance of the Group; 
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures.’ The amended standard, 
effective from 1 January 2009, requires additional disclosures 
about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. Fair value 
measurements related to items recorded at fair value are to be 
disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy 
by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value.  
The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk 
disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used 
for liquidity management. The fair value measurement disclosures 
have not been presented as the value of financial instruments held 
at fair value is not material. The liquidity risk disclosures are not  www.kazakhmys.com 95
 
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
significantly impacted by the amendments and are presented  
in Note 33; 
• IFRS 8 replaced IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’ with effect from  
1 January 2009. The Group concluded that the operating segments 
determined in accordance with IFRS 8 are the same as the business 
segments previously identified under IAS 14. IFRS 8 disclosures are 
shown in note 6, including the related revised comparative 
information, where applicable; and  
• The Group adopted IFRS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ 
with effect from 1 January 2009. Adoption of the standard did not 
have a significant effect on the financial position or performance of 
the Group. 
(f) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has not 
applied the following relevant standards and interpretations that have 
been issued but are not yet effective: 
• IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations (Revised)’ which is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. IFRS 3 (Revised) 
introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business 
combinations occurring after this date that will impact the amount 
of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an 
acquisition occurs and future reported results; 
• IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements (Revised)’ 
which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 
2009. IAS 27 (Revised) requires that a change in the ownership 
interest of a subsidiary (without loss of control) is accounted for  
as an equity transaction. Therefore, such transactions will no  
longer give rise to goodwill, nor will they give rise to a gain or  
loss. Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting 
for losses incurred by a subsidiary as well as the loss of control of  
a subsidiary; 
• IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement – 
eligible hedged items.’ These amendments to IAS 39 were issued in 
July 2008 and become effective for financial years beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009. The amendment addresses the designation of a 
one-sided risk in a hedged item, and the designation of inflation as a 
hedged risk or portion in particular situations. It clarifies that an entity 
is permitted to designate a portion of the fair value changes or cash 
flow variability of a financial instrument as a hedged item. The Group 
has concluded that the amendment will have no impact on the 
financial position or performance of the Group; 
• Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – ‘Reclassification of Financial 
Instruments’ which is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009. The amendment permits an entity to reclassify 
non-derivative financial assets (other than those designated at fair 
value through profit or loss by the entity upon initial recognition) 
out of the fair value through profit or loss category in particular 
circumstances. The amendment also permits an entity to transfer 
from the available for sale category to the loans and receivables 
category a financial asset that would have met the definition of 
loans and receivables (if the financial asset had not been 
designated as available for sale), if the entity has the intention and 
ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future. The 
Group has concluded that the amendment will have no impact  
on the financial position or performance of the Group; 
• IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’, which is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
IFRIC 17 clarifies the terms as to the recognition of dividends 
payable and their measurement for non-cash items. This 
interpretation is not expected to have any effect on the Group as it 
generally does not distribute any non-cash assets to shareholders; 
• Improvements to IFRSs. The IASB’s improvements project is an 
annual project that provides a mechanism for making non-urgent 
but necessary amendments to IFRSs. There are a number of 
amendments to standards following the 2008 improvements 
project which may result in consequential changes to accounting 
policies and other note disclosures. The Group does not expect  
the impact of any changes to the consolidated financial statements 
arising from this project to be significant. 
These standards and interpretations will be adopted by the Group  
on the date that they become effective. The Directors do not 
anticipate, in light of the circumstances prevailing at the date of 
approval of this Annual Report, that the adoption of these standards 
and interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on 
the reported income or net assets of the Group in the period of initial 
application although the manner in which certain information is 
presented in the consolidated financial statements may change. 
(g) Change in accounting policies 
There have been no changes to accounting policies during the year, 
except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations as 
disclosed in note 2(e). 
(h) Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
(i) Judgements 
Determining many of the amounts included in the consolidated 
financial statements involves the use of judgements. These 
judgements are based on management’s best knowledge of the 
relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, 
but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the 
consolidated financial statements. The Directors believe that the 
following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, are likely 
to have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Equity accounting 
At 31 December 2009, the Group owned 26.0% of ENRC PLC,  
a Kazakhstan-based mining company listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. The investment has been recorded as an associate and 
accounted for under the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 
‘Investments in Associates.’ IAS 28 states that there is a rebuttable 
presumption that significant influence exists where an investor holds 
more than 20% of the voting power of the investee. Although 
Kazakhmys does not have representation on the board of ENRC, the 
Directors believe that the Group has the ability to exercise significant 
influence by virtue of its substantial shareholding, whereby the Group 
owns in excess of 25% of the issued share capital of ENRC and is the 
single largest shareholder. 
This interest confers the Group with certain additional rights and 
influence under the Companies Act 2006 (CA06) which allows the 
Group to block special resolutions proposed by ENRC at general 
meetings. Consequentially, through the provisions of the CA06,  
the Group is able to participate in policy making processes of ENRC, 
including participation about distributions such as share buy-backs, 
which form part of ENRC’s capital management strategy. 
The Directors are of the view that the Group has influence over the 
acquisition strategy of ENRC by having the ability in essence to block 
related party transactions, which ENRC have a history of making, 
where these transactions are over and above the de-minimis 
exemption in the Listing Rules. 
Furthermore, the frequency and nature of meetings between the  
two companies has changed substantially since the Group increased 
its shareholding above 25%, with matters such as acquisition strategy 
and the exchange of technical information regarding power 
generation, taxation and mining safety being discussed. 
In the Directors’ judgement, the Group has the ability to exercise 
significant influence over ENRC. The Directors therefore believe that 
it remains appropriate for the Group to equity account for its interest 
in ENRC in accordance with IAS 28.  96 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Useful economic lives and impairment indicators 
Tangible and intangible assets are depreciated over their useful 
economic lives. Management reviews the appropriateness of useful 
economic lives at least annually and any changes could affect 
prospective depreciation rates and hence, asset carrying values. 
Management also reviews the carrying value of the Group’s tangible 
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication  
of impairment such that the carrying values of the assets may not be 
recoverable. The assessment of whether an indicator of impairment 
has arisen can require considerable judgement taking account of 
future operational and financial plans, commodity prices, sales 
demand and the competitive environment. The carrying value of  
the assets of a cash generating unit is compared with the recoverable 
amount of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value  
and value in use, which is determined on the basis of discounted 
future cash flows. This involves management estimates on commodity 
prices, market demand and supply, economic and regulatory 
climates, long-term mine plans and other factors. Any subsequent 
changes to cash flows due to changes in the above mentioned  
factors could impact the carrying value of the assets. 
The global economic downturn has resulted in management 
undertaking a series of impairment tests. These tests have resulted  
in the following impairment charges being recognised in the 
consolidated income statement: 
• Kazakhmys Gold – an impairment charge has been recognised 
following a decision not to proceed with the Akjilga development 
project in Tajikistan in the foreseeable future as more economically 
attractive projects exist within the Group (see note 8); 
• MKM – an impairment charge has been recognised to write down 
the carrying value of MKM to its fair value in light of a number of 
impairment indications arising during the second half of 2009 
following the economic weakness in Europe, MKM’s core 
marketplace (see note 5(a)); and 
• Kazakhmys Power – an impairment charge has been recognised to 
write down the carrying value of Maikuben West to its recoverable 
amount following the decision to dispose of 50% of the Ekibastuz 
GRES-1 power station to Samruk (see note 5(b)). 
Allocation of excess purchase consideration 
Business combinations require judgement and estimates to be made 
at the date of acquisition in relation to determining asset and liability 
fair values and the allocation of the purchase consideration over the 
fair value of the assets and liabilities. 
In respect of mining company acquisitions, excess purchase 
consideration is typically allocated to the mining reserves and 
resources being acquired. The estimate of reserves is subject to 
assumptions relating to life of the mine and may change when new 
information becomes available. Changes in reserves as a result of 
factors such as production costs, recovery rates, grade of reserves  
or commodity prices could impact depreciation rates, asset carrying 
values and environmental and restoration provisions. Changes in 
assumptions over long-term commodity prices, market demand and 
supply, and economic and regulatory climates could also impact the 
carrying value of assets. 
In respect of non-mining company acquisitions, such as the acquisition 
of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power station in May 2008, the purchase 
consideration is allocated to the fair value of specific assets and 
liabilities acquired, and any excess purchase consideration is then 
recognised as goodwill, which is tested annually for impairment. 
Changes in assumptions over future tariff prices, market demand  
and supply, and economic and regulatory climates could impact on  
the carrying value of assets, including the goodwill. 
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Following the announcement on 10 December 2009 that the Group 
had agreed to dispose of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP, a 100% owned 
subsidiary within the Kazakhmys Power Division to Samruk, for 
consideration of $681 million, the Directors have classified Ekibastuz 
GRES-1 LLP as an asset held for sale at the balance sheet date, and 
correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the consolidated 
income statement. The transaction completed in February 2010 and the 
Group has retained a non-controlling interest of 50% in the entity which 
shall be accounted for as a joint venture after the date of completion. 
Furthermore, the Directors have decided to dispose of the Maikuben 
West coal mine (also within Kazakhmys Power Division) following a 
change in the long-term strategy of the coal mine as a result of the 
sale of 50% of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power station to Samruk. This 
business has therefore been classified as an asset held for sale at  
the balance sheet date, and correspondingly as part of discontinued 
operations in the consolidated income statement. 
Consequently, the businesses within the Kazakhmys Power Division 
are shown as discontinued operations and assets held for sale.  
The Directors consider that the businesses within the Kazakhmys 
Power Division meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale at  
the balance sheet date. 
Additionally, the Directors have decided to dispose of MKM given 
the Group’s strategy is to focus on natural resource opportunities in 
the Central Asian region. This business has therefore been classified 
as an asset held for sale at the balance sheet date, and 
correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the consolidated 
income statement. A write down has been recognised as MKM’s 
recoverable amount is re-measured to fair value less costs to sell.  
The Directors consider that MKM meets the criteria to be classified  
as held for sale at the balance sheet date, including, in particular,  
that a disposal is considered to be highly probable in 2010. 
For more details on discontinued operations, refer to note 5. 
Determination of mineral extraction tax 
The mineral extraction tax (MET) was introduced in the 2009 Tax Code 
that came into force on 1 January 2009 in order to offset the reduction 
in corporate income tax rates within Kazakhstan. MET legislation has 
evolved during the year to take into account the economic environment 
within Kazakhstan such that certain tax benefits might be provided to 
subsoil users whose mineral deposits are of low or no profitability. In 
determining the MET expense for each subsoil contract, judgement is 
required as to the full year profitability of each subsoil contract taking 
into account prevailing and future commodity prices as well as the 
underlying cost base. This profitability assessment impacts on the MET 
rates applicable to each subsoil contract and consequentially the levels 
of MET payable. Furthermore, there is also considerable uncertainty 
within Kazakhstan as to the nature of the tax benefits that might be 
available, if at all, to subsoil users whose mineral deposits are of low  
or no profitability. In the determination of MET payable, the Directors 
believe the Group’s judgements are reasonable and in compliance with 
Kazakhstan legislation, although there is a risk that the tax authorities 
will have a different interpretation of tax legislation at the time of a 
future tax audit. 
Determination of excess profits taxation 
Prior to 1 January 2009, excess profits tax (EPT) was imposed on  
the Group in addition to Kazakhstan corporate income tax on certain 
profitable subsoil contracts. EPT was based on an approximation of 
the internal rate of return (IRR) with EPT being applicable only where 
the cumulative IRR exceeded 20%. In determining the IRR for each 
subsoil contract, there was considerable judgement involved as to the 
allocation of profit amongst the Group’s subsoil contracts, the nature 
of deductions for capital expenditure and the timing of those 
deductions. For the determination of EPT payable prior to 1 January 
2009, the Directors believe the Group’s judgements are reasonable 
and in compliance with Kazakhstan legislation, although there is a risk 
that the tax authorities will have a different interpretation of tax 
legislation at the time of a future tax audit.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Following the introduction of the 2009 Tax Code on 1 January 2009, 
management has interpreted the new tax legislation and believe  
that EPT is not applicable to the Group’s operations during 2009. 
This view is supported by discussions and correspondence with  
the governmental authorities. The Directors believe the Group’s 
judgements at the current time are reasonable and in compliance 
with Kazakhstan tax legislation, although there is a risk that the tax 
authorities will have a different interpretation of tax legislation at  
the time of a future tax audit. 
Accounting for potential transfer pricing liabilities 
For the years ended 31 December 2006 to 2009, Kazakhmys LLC  
sold its exported products to Kazakhmys PLC (2006 and 2007) and 
Kazakhmys Sales Ltd (2008 and 2009), a wholly owned subsidiary  
of Kazakhmys PLC, under an exclusive purchasing agreement at the 
prevailing LME or LBMA prices, with a discount to LME or LBMA 
prices permitted by Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation and 
reflecting the commercial and credit risks borne by the UK 
operations. Management believe that these prices, and 
accompanying discount where applicable, reflect the balance of 
commercial and credit risks shared between Kazakhmys LLC and  
the UK operations. 
Management has recognised the nature of the transfer pricing 
legislation promulgated in Kazakhstan and the UK in determining any 
consequential tax liabilities in these jurisdictions resulting from the 
sale of exported products from Kazakhmys LLC to the UK operations 
for 2006 to 2009. The Directors believe the Group’s judgements are 
reasonable and in compliance with UK and Kazakhstan transfer 
pricing legislation, although there is a risk that the tax authorities will 
have a different interpretation of tax legislation at the time of a future 
tax audit. 
(ii) Estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates. 
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation 
uncertainty made by the Directors in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements is shown below: 
• Note 4 – Business acquisition. Assumptions and estimates are 
required when determining the fair value of the net assets and 
liabilities of the business acquired, including the timing of cash 
flows and selecting an appropriate discount rate; 
• Note 5 – Discontinued operations. Assumptions and estimates are 
required when determining the fair value less costs to sell of assets 
held for sale; 
• Notes 8 and 16 – Impairment losses. Notes 8 and 16 outline the 
significant assumptions made in performing impairment tests; 
• Note 13 – Income taxes. Management make estimates in relation 
to the level of taxes payable which may then be audited by  
the tax authorities; 
• Note 18 – Mining assets. Estimated recoverable reserves and 
resources are used to determine the depreciation of mining assets, 
in accounting for mine stripping costs and in performing 
impairment testing; 
• Note 28 – Provisions. Estimates are made regarding the timing  
of future payments; and 
• Note 34 – Commitments and contingencies. These require 
management to make estimates as to amounts payable and  
to determine the likelihood of cash outflows in the future. 
 
(i) Comparative figures 
Where a change in the presentational format of the consolidated 
financial statements has been made during the year, comparative 
figures have been restated accordingly. 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES 
The following significant accounting policies have been applied in  
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. These 
accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group. 
(a) Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined  
as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates. Transactions in currencies other than the functional 
currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling  
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and 
losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at  
the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation  
of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are 
taken to the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost 
are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. 
The functional currencies of the Company and Kazakhmys Sales Ltd, 
which became the primary UK trading entity with effect from 
1 January 2008, are the US dollar ($) as the majority of the operating 
activities are conducted in US dollars. The functional currency of 
Kazakhmys LLC, Kazakhmys Power, Kazakhmys Gold and Kazakhmys 
Petroleum is the Kazakhstan tenge (KZT) and of MKM is the Euro (€). 
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated 
into US dollars, at average rates of exchange. Balance sheet items  
are translated into US dollars at period end exchange rates. Exchange 
differences on the retranslation are taken to a separate component  
of equity. Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings 
financing those net investments are also dealt with in equity. All  
other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income 
statement in the year in which they arise. The following foreign 
exchange rates against the US dollar have been used in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
 
 
31 December
2009
Average 
2009 
31 December
2008
Average
2008
Kazakhstan tenge 148.36 147.50 120.77 120.30
Euro 0.70 0.72 0.71 0.68
UK pounds 
sterling 0.63 0.64 0.69 0.54
Devaluation of the tenge 
In February 2009, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced that  
it would support the tenge within a range of 3%, at a lower level of 
150 KZT/$, resulting in a devaluation of the tenge of approximately 
25%. The impact of the devaluation in the consolidated financial 
statements is as follows: 
• net finance income includes a foreign exchange gain of  
$336 million for continuing operations which primarily arises due  
to the retranslation of US dollar denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities within the Group’s Kazakhstan subsidiaries which have a 
tenge functional currency. The loss for the year from discontinued 
operations includes a foreign exchange loss of $53 million; 
• the goodwill balance arising on the acquisition of Kazakhmys 
Power has been retranslated as at 31 December 2009 since the 
goodwill arises in respect of businesses acquired whose functional 
currencies are the tenge. This gives rise to a foreign exchange  
loss of $10 million being recognised within equity and a 
corresponding reduction in the goodwill balance to $443 million  
9 98 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
as at 31 December 2009 prior to the goodwill being re-classified  
as an asset held for sale; 
• a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $1,060 million (which includes 
the $10 million goodwill foreign exchange loss) has been 
recognised within equity. This is primarily due to the re-translation 
on consolidation of the Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries 
whose functional currency is the Kazakhstan tenge; and 
• a reduction in the carrying value of the investment in associate  
of $342 million as the Group has recognised its share of the  
foreign exchange loss recognised in equity by ENRC. 
(b) Business combinations 
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase method of accounting 
is applied whereby the purchase consideration is allocated to the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (identifiable  
net assets) on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.  
The cost of the business combination is the aggregate of: (a) the fair 
values at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange 
for control of the acquiree; and (b) cost directly attributable to the 
business combination. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost  
of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
If the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the Group 
reassesses whether it has correctly identified and measured the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets 
or liabilities that are identified in that review. If that excess remains 
after reassessment, the Group recognises the resulting gain as 
negative goodwill in the income statement on the acquisition date.  
(c) Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, or of an interest in a joint venture, 
associate, or joint arrangement, the purchase consideration is 
allocated to the assets and liabilities on the basis of their fair value  
at the date of acquisition. Those mineral reserves and resources that 
are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair 
values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources and mineral 
rights for which, in the Directors’ opinion, values cannot be reliably 
determined, are not recognised. When the cost of acquisition 
exceeds the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets the difference is treated as purchased goodwill. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
amortised, rather it is tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is 
allocated to the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating 
units expected to benefit from the related business combination for 
the purpose of the impairment testing. An impairment loss in respect 
of goodwill is not reversed. 
(ii) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets, including mineral licences, which are 
acquired by the Group and which have finite useful lives, are stated at 
cost (which comprises its purchase price plus any directly attributable 
costs of preparing the asset for its intended use) less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. The cost of intangible assets 
acquired in a business combination is its fair value which can be 
measured reliably as at the date of acquisition. 
(iii) Amortisation 
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, primarily comprise mineral 
licence acquisition costs, which are amortised on a unit of production 
basis. Amortisation for other intangible assets, which have expected 
useful lives of three to ten years, is computed under the straight-line 
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
(d) Research and development 
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect  
of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, 
is recognised in the income statement as incurred. 
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are 
applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete development. The expenditure 
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an 
appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development 
expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. 
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
(e) Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Initial measurement 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of a tangible fixed asset 
comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to 
bringing it into working condition for its intended use. The cost of 
self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour 
and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost or 
‘deemed cost’ of property, plant and equipment (hereafter referred 
to as ‘cost’) at 1 January 2002, the date of Kazakhmys LLC’s transition 
to IFRS, was determined by reference to its depreciated replacement 
cost at that date in accordance with IFRS 1. 
(ii) Depreciation 
The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has 
due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present 
assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine 
property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful 
lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery 
and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset or on a  
unit of production basis depending on the type of asset. Changes in 
estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are accounted 
for prospectively.  
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are used within  
the business. Freehold land is not depreciated. 
The expected useful lives are as follows: 
Buildings 15-40 years 
Plant and equipment 4-25 years 
Other 3-15 years 
(iii) Construction in progress 
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate 
component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the 
cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category. 
Construction in progress is not depreciated. 
(iv) Repairs and maintenance 
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, 
plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, is capitalised 
with the carrying amount of the replaced component being written 
off. Repairs and maintenance expenditure is capitalised if future 
economic benefits will arise from the expenditure. All other repairs 
and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement 
as incurred. 
(v) Government grants 
Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching 
conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an 
expense item, it is recognised as income over the periods necessary 
to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES CONTINUED

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, the  
fair value is credited to the cost of the asset and is released to the 
income statement over the expected useful life in a consistent 
manner with the depreciation method for the relevant asset. 
(vi) Leasing and hire purchase commitments 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the leased items, are capitalised at the 
commencement of the lease. Plant and equipment acquired by way 
of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair 
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at 
inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. The capital elements of future obligations under leases and 
hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. 
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and 
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges  
are charged directly against income. Capitalised lease assets are 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the  
asset or the lease term. All other leases are treated as operating 
leases and the cost is expensed to the income statement as incurred. 
(f) Mining assets 
(i) Mineral properties 
Costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalised on the balance 
sheet in the year in which they are incurred. Costs associated with  
a start-up period for significant developments are capitalised during 
the commissioning period (development expenditure) where  
the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a 
commissioning period. Mineral properties are amortised using  
proven developed and undeveloped reserves. 
(ii) Mine development costs 
Mine development costs are, upon commencement of production, 
depreciated using a unit of production method, which is the ratio  
of commodity production in the period to the estimated quantities  
of commercial reserves over the life of the mine (using proven 
developed reserves as determined by the local geological 
classification system) based on the estimated economically 
recoverable reserves to which they relate. 
(iii) Mine stripping costs 
Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing 
ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of production. 
Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine on a unit 
of production basis using proven developed reserves. 
The cost of removal of the waste material during a mine’s production 
phase is deferred if the stripping activity permits an increase in the 
output of the mine in future periods through providing access to 
additional sources of reserves that will be produced in future periods. 
Capitalised stripping costs are amortised in systematic manner over 
the reserves that directly benefit from the specific stripping activity. 
(iv) Exploration assets 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest, other 
than that acquired through a purchase of transaction, is carried forward 
as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met: 
• such costs are expected to be recouped through successful 
exploration and development of the area of interest or, 
alternatively, by its sale; 
• exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not  
yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the 
existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and  
active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing. 
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the 
conditions outlined above is written off. Administrative and general 
expenses relating to exploration and evaluation activities are 
expensed as incurred. A significant portion of exploration and 
evaluation expenditure relates to mineral licences, which are 
classified and accounted for as intangible assets. 
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a purchase 
transaction are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition from 
another mining company. Exploration assets are reassessed on a 
regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at 
least one of the conditions outlined above is met. 
Exploration and evaluation assets attributable to producing interests 
are amortised on a unit of production basis. 
(g) Oil and gas assets 
(i) Exploration, evaluation and production assets 
The Group adopts the successful efforts method of accounting for  
oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs. All licence acquisition, 
exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised in cost 
centres by well, field or exploration area, as appropriate. Directly 
attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate 
to specific exploration and development activities. Pre-licence costs 
are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
All capitalised licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs 
are then written off unless commercial reserves have been 
established, or the determination process has not been completed 
and there are no indications of impairment. 
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant and 
equipment. Property, plant and equipment related to production 
activities are depreciated on a unit of production basis. 
(ii) Commercial reserves 
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, 
which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil,  
natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical  
and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of 
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs  
and which are considered commercially producible. There should  
be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable 
reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven and 
probable reserves. 
(iii) Depletion and amortisation – discovery fields 
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the 
commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which  
is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated 
quantities of commercial reserves over the life of the field, generally 
on a field-by-field basis. Costs used in the unit of production 
calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the 
estimated future field development costs. Changes in the estimates 
of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt 
with prospectively. 
(h) Impairment 
The Group conducts annual internal assessments of the values of 
goodwill and capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure. 
Values of mine properties and property, plant and equipment are 
assessed for impairment when indicators of such impairment exist.  
If any indication of impairment exists an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount is calculated. 
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the 
income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount to its 
recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of fair value less costs to sell  
and value in use). 
Impairment losses related to continuing operations are recognised  
in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with 
the function of the impaired asset. 
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each 
reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have 
decreased. If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate  
of the recoverable amount.  100 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
(i) Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in  
use and fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. This  
is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the  
asset belongs. The Group’s cash-generating units are the smallest 
identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups 
of assets. 
(ii) Reversals of impairment 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there  
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.  
If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to  
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or 
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset 
in prior years. Such reversals are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in relation to goodwill are not reversed 
for subsequent increases in its recoverable amount. 
(i) Investment in associate 
Entities in which the Group has the ability to exercise significant 
influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures,  
are associates, and are accounted for using the equity method  
of accounting. There is a rebuttable presumption of the ability  
to exercise significant influence when the Group holds between  
20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 
Under the equity method of accounting, the investment in the 
associate is recognised on the balance sheet on the date of 
acquisition at cost representing the fair value of the purchase 
consideration and therefore includes any goodwill on acquisition.  
The carrying amount is adjusted by the Group’s share of the  
post-acquisition profit or loss net of any impairment losses and 
dividends receivable from the associate. Where there has been  
a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate,  
the Group recognises its share of such changes in equity. 
Adjustments are made in the consolidated financial statements  
to eliminate the Group’s share of unrealised gains and losses on 
transactions between the Group and its associate. The carrying value 
of the associate is reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment  
in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which those 
circumstances are identified. The Group’s share of an associate’s 
losses in excess of its interest in that associate is not recognised 
unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses. 
The Group discontinues its use of the equity method from the date 
on which it ceases to have the ability to exercise significant influence, 
and from that date, accounts for the investment in accordance with 
IAS 39 (with its initial cost being the carrying amount of the associate 
at that date), provided the investment does not then qualify as a 
subsidiary or joint venture. 
The Group’s income statement reflects the share of associate’s results 
after tax and the Group’s statement of changes in equity includes any 
other amounts attributable to the equity holder recognised by the 
associate in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The carrying amount of an available for sale investment at the date  
it becomes an associate is considered to be its cost in applying the 
equity method. Consequently, no adjustment is made to reverse 
previous fair value adjustments. Dividend income continues to be 
recognised in the income statement up to the date the investment 
becomes an associate. Any gain recognised within other 
comprehensive income remains there until the associate is either 
impaired or disposed. 
(j) Parent company’s investments 
Non-current investments are held at cost. The Company assesses 
investments for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may 
not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the 
Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the 
carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. 
(k) Inventories 
Raw materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. Cost includes  
all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each 
product to its present location and condition. Cost for raw materials 
and consumables is the purchase price and for work in progress and 
finished goods is the cost of production, including the appropriate 
proportion of depreciation and overheads. The cost of work in 
progress and finished goods is based on the weighted average cost 
method. In the case of work in progress and finished goods, cost 
includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal 
operating capacity. 
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal. 
(l) Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice price (which is the  
fair value of the consideration receivable) less provision made for 
impairment of these receivables. A provision for impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable 
amount, being the present value of expected cash flows receivable. 
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. 
(m) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand,  
short-term deposits held on call or with maturities less than three 
months at inception and highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject  
to insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. 
(n) Assets held for sale 
When an asset or disposal group’s carrying value will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use, it is classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying 
value and fair value less costs to sell. No depreciation is charged in 
respect of non-current assets held for sale. 
(o) Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES CONTINUED  www.kazakhmys.com 101
 
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
(p) Employee benefits 
(i) Long-term employee benefits 
Kazakhmys LLC provides long-term employee benefits to employees 
before, on and after retirement, in accordance with a labour union 
agreement. Such benefits are valued consistent with an unfunded 
defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’. 
The agreement provides for one-time retirement grants, financial aid, 
dental care, medical benefits, long-term disability allowances, 
sanatorium visits, annual financial support to pensioners, free tickets 
for city buses, privilege tickets for shuttle buses and funeral aid. 
MKM provides for part-time work for older employees. There are  
no long-term employee benefits provided in the United Kingdom. 
The future benefit that employees have earned is discounted to 
determine the present value. The discount rate is the yield at the 
balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that have 
maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s benefit 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary. 
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses falling outside a 
‘corridor’ of the greater of 10% of the benefit obligation or 10%  
of the assets, amortised over the expected average future working 
lifetime of employees in the arrangements. The expense in relation  
to these long-term employee benefits is charged to the income 
statement so as to match the cost of providing these benefits to  
the period of service of the employees. 
(ii) Share-based payments 
Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration  
in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity 
settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions with 
employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are 
granted. The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting 
conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value 
at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually 
vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the 
estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which 
have vested. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting 
date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. 
(iii) Own shares 
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (own shares) are 
recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference 
between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire 
such equity instruments is recognised within equity. 
(iv) Trust activities 
Assets held in trust or in a fiduciary capacity are not treated as assets 
of the Group and, accordingly, are not included in the consolidated 
financial statements. Transactions entered into with these trust 
activities are expensed in the consolidated financial statements. 
(v) Social programmes 
The Group is obliged to contribute towards social programmes  
for the benefit of the local community at large. The Group’s 
contributions towards these programmes are expensed to the  
income statement as incurred. 
(q) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. If the effect of 
the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
(i) Site restoration costs 
Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated 
future costs of closure and restoration, and for environmental 
rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of 
infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of 
disturbed areas) in the accounting period when the related 
environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted where 
material and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance 
costs. Over time, the discounted provision is increased for the change 
in present value based on the discount rates that reflect current 
market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. At the time 
of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised 
where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over future 
production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is 
reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount 
rates or life of operations. Any change in restoration costs or 
assumptions will be recognised as additions or charges to the 
corresponding asset and provision when they occur. For permanently 
closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately 
in the income statement. 
(ii) Payments for licences 
In accordance with the terms of subsoil use contracts, provision is made 
for future licence payments when the Group has a present obligation  
to repay the costs of geological information provided for licensed 
deposits. The amount payable is discounted to its present value. 
(iii) Other 
Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or 
constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow 
of resources and for which the amount can be reliably estimated. 
(r) Revenue 
Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to  
third parties during the year. Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
consideration receivable, and excludes any applicable sales tax. Mining 
royalties and mineral extraction taxes are included within cost of sales. 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue associated with the sale of goods is 
recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when 
title and any insurance risk has passed to the customer and the goods 
have been delivered in accordance with the contractual delivery 
terms or when any services have been provided. 
Almost all sales agreements for copper cathodes, copper rods and 
copper and zinc concentrate are provisionally priced, (i.e. the selling 
price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a quotation period, 
typically the average price either for the month or the month 
following delivery to the customer), based on the LME market price 
for the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract. Such a 
provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is required  
to be separated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale 
of commodity at the provisional invoice price, and the embedded 
derivative is the forward contract for which the provisional sale is 
subsequently adjusted. At each reporting date, the provisionally 
priced metal sales are marked-to-market using forward prices, with 
adjustments (both gains and losses) being recorded in revenue in  
the consolidated income statement and in trade receivables in the 
consolidated balance sheet.  102 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
(s) Finance income 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and 
foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, 
calculated in accordance with the effective interest rate method. 
(t) Finance costs 
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings which are  
not capitalised under the borrowing costs policy (see 3(u) below), the 
unwinding of interest cost on provisions and foreign exchange losses. 
(u) Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
commencement of construction or production of qualifying assets 
after 1 January 2008 (which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale), 
are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets, until such 
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 
sale. The Group continues to expense borrowing costs relating to 
construction projects that commenced prior to 1 January 2008. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement  
in the period in which they are incurred as part of finance costs. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity 
incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. 
(v) Income tax 
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income 
tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that  
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
it is recognised in equity. Excess profits tax is treated as income tax 
and forms part of the income tax expense. 
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are 
not provided for: 
• those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss; and 
• investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable 
right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority. 
(w) Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are 
approved by shareholders. Dividends receivable are recognised when 
the Group’s right to receive payment is established. 
(x) Financial instruments 
(i) Recognition 
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance 
sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instrument. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported 
in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
(ii) Measurement 
When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are 
measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus 
directly attributable transaction costs. Any gain or loss at initial 
recognition is recognised in the income statement. 
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted 
bid prices on the trade date. When quoted prices on an active market 
are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price 
quotations for similar instruments traded. 
The Group classifies investments depending upon the intent of 
management at the time of the purchase. Investments with fixed 
maturities and fixed or determinable payments that management  
has both the positive intent, and the ability to hold to maturity,  
are classified as held-to-maturity. 
Loans and receivables are loans and receivables created by the 
Group providing money to a debtor. Loans and receivables comprise 
loans and advances other than purchased loans. 
Held-to-maturity investments and originated loans and receivables 
are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above 
and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Allowance for impairment is estimated on a  
case-by-case basis. 
Assets held for trading are financial assets held for short-term trading 
purposes, and are measured at fair value through the income statement. 
Available for sale investments are non-derivative financial assets and 
include investments that are held for sale, although there is no time 
frame in which management is required to sell them. They are 
included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose 
of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date, in 
which case they are included within current assets. These assets are 
recorded at fair value with the unrealised movements in fair value 
being recognised directly in equity until disposal or sale, at which 
time, those unrealised movements from prior periods are recognised 
in the income statement. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as commodity 
forward contracts to hedge risks associated with commodity price 
fluctuations. These are designated as cash flow hedges. At the 
inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging 
relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of 
the hedged item. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that 
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement, and is either 
included in the ‘other operating income’ or ‘other operating 
expenses’ line. 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES CONTINUED  www.kazakhmys.com 103
 
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement  
in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income 
statement, in the same line of the income statement as the 
recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction 
that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or  
a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in 
equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the 
hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in 
equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred 
in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
(iii) Derecognition 
A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over 
the contractual rights that comprise that asset. This occurs when the 
rights are realised, expire or are surrendered. A financial liability is 
derecognised when it is extinguished. 
Held-to-maturity instruments and originated loans and receivables  
are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group. 
(iv) Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any 
objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets  
is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to 
be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment 
as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event 
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial  
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
For available for sale financial investments, the Group assesses at 
each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that an 
investment or group of investments is impaired. In the case of equity 
investments classified as available for sale, objective evidence would 
include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of impairment,  
the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the 
acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss  
on that investment previously recognised in the income statement – 
is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through 
the income statement and increases in their fair value after 
impairment are recognised directly in equity.  104 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

4. BUSINESS ACQUISITION – EKIBASTUZ POWER PLANT AND MAIKUBEN WEST COAL MINE 
On 29 May 2008 the Group acquired 100% of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-fired power plant and Maikuben West coal mine in Kazakhstan.  
In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ based on further tax information received during 2009 in relation to the fair value of 
provisions at the acquisition date, the acquisition fair value table has been amended such that the fair value of provisions is $26 million  
lower at $21 million than that published in the 2008 Annual Report and Accounts. Accordingly, the restated net identifiable assets balance  
is $696 million (previously: $670 million) and goodwill arising on acquisition is $568 million (previously: $594 million). The final fair value table 
is shown below.

As a requirement of IFRS, the goodwill balance has been re-translated as at 31 December 2009 since the goodwill arises in respect of 
businesses acquired whose functional currencies are the Kazakhstan tenge. This gives rise to a foreign exchange loss of $109 million being 
recognised within equity and a corresponding reduction in the goodwill balance to $443 million as at 31 December 2009 prior to the 
goodwill being impaired by $16 million and reclassified as an asset held for sale (see note 5). 
5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
Discontinued operations consist of MKM (see note 5(a)) and the Kazakhmys Power Division (see note 5(b)) comprising the Ekibastuz GRES-1 
coal-fired power plant and Maikuben West coal mine. 
Following the announcement on 10 December 2009 that the Group had agreed to dispose of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP, a 100% owned 
subsidiary within the Kazakhmys Power Division, to Samruk for a consideration of $681 million, the Directors have classified Ekibastuz GRES-1 
LLP as an asset held for sale at the balance sheet date, and correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income 
statement. The transaction completed in February 2010 and the Group has retained a non-controlling interest of 50% in the entity  
which shall be accounted for as a joint venture after the date of completion. 
The results from discontinued operations for the year as shown in the consolidated income statement are shown below:

Analysed as: 
MKM  (130) (41)
Kazakhmys Power  (84) 131 
The MKM and Kazakhmys Power operations represent separate major business lines of the Group. As a result, these operations have been 
treated as discontinued operations at 31 December 2009. A single amount is shown on the face of the consolidated income statement 
comprising the post-tax result of discontinued operations and the post-tax loss recognised on the re-measurement to fair value less costs  
to sell of the discontinued operations. Accordingly, the income and expenses of both MKM and Kazakhmys Power are reported separately 
from the continuing operations of the Group. The consolidated income statement for the prior year has been restated to conform to this  
style of presentation. The assets and liabilities of these divisions are also separately shown within the consolidated balance sheet as single 
line items within current assets and current liabilities. The 2008 consolidated balance sheet has not been restated.  www.kazakhmys.com 105

(a) MKM 
The Directors have decided to dispose of MKM given the Group’s strategy is to focus on natural resource opportunities in the Central Asian 
region. This business has therefore been classified as a disposal group with the assets and related liabilities being shown as held for sale  
at the balance sheet date, and correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement. The Directors consider 
that MKM meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date for the following reasons: 
• the Directors are committed to selling the MKM business and an active programme to sell the business was initiated in the second half  
of 2009; 
• MKM is available for immediate sale and can be sold to a potential buyer in its current condition; 
• expressions of interest have been received from prospective buyers with a view to making an offer for the business and certain of them 
have undertaken due diligence on MKM; and 
• the Directors expect to sell MKM during 2010.  106 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a loss of $141 million before tax. In a light of the continuing economic weakness in Europe, 
MKM’s core marketplace, a pre-tax impairment loss of $29 million has been recognised to write down the carrying value of MKM to its 
recoverable amount on a value in use basis. A further impairment charge of $158 million has been recognised to write down MKM to its 
expected fair value less costs to sell.

2012. Interest is payable on the drawn balance at a rate of EURIBOR + 3.00%. The loan is secured over the inventories and receivables of MKM. 
The amount of inventories held as security for MKM borrowings is $187 million (2008: $132 million). 
The amount of trade receivables held as security for MKM borrowings is $121 million (2008: $97 million).

• Following the announcement on 10 December 2009 that the Group had agreed to dispose of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP, a 100% 
owned subsidiary within the Kazakhmys Power Division, to Samruk for a consideration of $681 million, the Directors have classified 
Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP as an asset held for sale at the balance sheet date, and correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the 
consolidated income statement. The transaction completed in February 2010 and the Group has retained a non-controlling interest  
of 50% in the entity which shall be accounted for as a joint venture after the date of completion.  www.kazakhmys.com 107

Maikuben West coal mine 
• Additionally the Directors have decided to dispose of the Maikuben West coal mine following a change in the long-term strategy of  
the coal mine as a result of the sale of 50% of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power station to Samruk. The Directors considered that the  
Maikuben West coal mine meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date for the following reasons:  
– the Directors are committed to selling the Maikuben West coal mine and an active programme to sell the business was initiated  
in December 2009; 
– it is available for immediate sale and can be sold to a potential buyer in its current condition; and  
– the Directors have received expressions of interest from a potential buyer and expect to sell the mine during 2010.

In light of the Directors’ decision to dispose 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP to Samruk, a pre-tax impairment loss of $69 million has been 
recognised to write down the carrying value of Maikuben West coal mine to its recoverable amount on a value in use basis. No impairment 
losses have been recognised in relation to Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP. 
Following completion of the sale of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP in February 2010, a profit on disposal will be recognised in the Group’s 
results for the year ended 31 December 2010. Even though the disposal was announced during 2009, and the cash proceeds of $681 million 
were received by the Group in December 2009, since the disposal was conditional upon receiving shareholder approval and regulatory 
clearances, which were obtained in February 2010, the profit on disposal can only be recognised when all approvals are obtained and  
legal completion takes place in the 2010 financial year.

6. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
For management purposes the Group is organised into five separately managed business units, as shown below, according to the nature  
of the products and services provided. Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8  
‘Operating segments.’ The operating segments are: 
Kazakhmys Copper 
The Kazakhmys Copper business is managed as one operating segment and comprises a Kazakhstan based company, Kazakhmys 
Corporation LLC, and a UK based company, Kazakhmys Sales Ltd. The principal activity of Kazakhmys Corporation LLC is the processing  
and sale of copper and other metals, while Kazakhmys Sales Ltd consists of a trading function responsible for the purchase of exported 
products from Kazakhmys Corporation LLC and subsequently applies an appropriate mark-up prior to onward sale to third parties. 
The products produced by the Kazakhmys Copper business are subject to the same risks and returns, exhibit similar long-term financial 
performance and are sold through the same distribution channels. The business processes substantially all the copper ore it produces and 
utilises most of the copper concentrate it processes. The segment also has a number of activities that exist solely to support the mining 
operations including power generation, coal mining and transportation. These other activities generate less than 10% of total revenues  
(both external and internal) and the related assets are less than 10% of total assets of the operating segment. 
The UK trading function is a sales function on behalf of the Kazakhmys Copper business and consequently the assets and liabilities related  
to those trading operations, i.e. trade payables and trade receivables, are included within the Kazakhmys Copper operating segment. 
MKM 
MKM operates in Germany, where it manufactures copper and copper alloy semi-finished products. MKM faces different risks to the  
Group’s other businesses, and produces different products, and is therefore shown as a separate operating segment. 
As stated in note 5(a), the Directors have decided to dispose of MKM. As a result, at 31 December 2009, MKM has been classified as a 
disposal group held for sale and as a discontinued operation, and the comparative segment information has been restated accordingly. 
Kazakhmys Power 
Kazakhmys Power operates in Kazakhstan. The principal activity of the Kazakhmys Power operating segment, representing the Ekibastuz GRES-1 
coal-fired power station and the Maikuben West coal mine, is the sale of electricity and coal to external customers. This segment does not 
include the power stations and coal mines which are part of the Kazakhmys Copper segment as the output from those power stations and  
coal mines are primarily used within the Kazakhmys Copper business, and the level of external sales is comparatively insignificant. 
As stated in note 5(a), following the announcement on 10 December 2009 that the Group had agreed to dispose of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 
LLP, a 100% owned subsidiary within the Kazakhmys Power Division, to Samruk for a consideration of $681 million, the Directors have 
classified Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP as an asset held for sale at the balance sheet date, and correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the 
consolidated income statement. The transaction completed in February 2010 and the Group has retained a non-controlling interest of 50%  
in the entity which shall be accounted for as a joint venture after the date of completion. Furthermore, the Maikuben West coal mine has also 
been classified as an asset held for sale and a discontinued operation. The comparative segment information has been restated accordingly. 
Kazakhmys Gold 
The principal activities of the Kazakhmys Gold operating segment is the mining and processing of gold ore into refined ore and exploration 
and development activity in the precious metal sector within the Central Asian region. The Kazakhmys Gold business operates primarily in 
Kazakhstan and has a development project in Kyrgyzstan. 
Kazakhmys Petroleum 
The Kazakhmys Petroleum business holds a licence to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activity in the Eastern Akzhar 
Exploration Block in western Kazakhstan. 
The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA excluding special items. Special items are those items which are  
non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business. 
The Group’s Treasury department monitors finance income and finance costs at the Group level on a net basis rather than on a gross basis  
at an operating segment level. 
The accounting policies adopted by each operating segment are consistent with those published in note 3. There are no inter-segment sales 
within the Group. 
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by-product. Segmental information relating to employees 
is provided in note 9.  www.kazakhmys.com 109

Year ended 31 December 2009 
(a) Kazakhmys Copper property, plant and equipment 
An impairment charge of $50 million has been recognised in relation to property, plant and equipment within the Kazakhmys Copper 
Division primarily due to the curtailment of the Division’s capital expenditure programme in the last 18 months and a focus on selected 
projects only. 
(b) Kazakhmys Gold 
An impairment charge of $23 million has been recognised in relation to the Kazakhmys Gold Division following a decision not to proceed 
with the Akjilga development project in Tajikistan in the foreseeable future as more economically attractive projects exist within the Group. 
(c) Kazakhmys Copper inventories 
Provisions against inventories includes an amount of $14 million within the Kazakhmys Copper Division in respect of certain by-products  
held in stock at the end of the year which have been written down to the lower of cost and net realisable value reflecting a fall in the  
market value of these by-products. The remaining balance included within provisions against inventories represents a general slow  
moving inventories provision.  
(d) Kazakhmys Copper receivables 
Provisions against trade and other receivables include an amount of $23 million within the Kazakhmys Copper Division in respect of trust 
activities. Under the terms of its subsoil licences, Kazakhmys LLC is required to provide certain social services to the communities in which  
its mining activities operate. These trust activities are provided by municipal authority companies under trust management agreements.  
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, full provision is recognised in light of their past payment histories. 
(e) Discontinued operations 
Impairment losses within discontinued operations relate to the impairment of MKM ($190 million) and the Maikuben West coal mine  
($69 million) – see notes 5(a) and 5(b) respectively.   www.kazakhmys.com 117
 
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
(f) Zinc smelter 
Included within impairment of property, plant and equipment is an impairment charge of $75 million relating to the Balkhash zinc smelter, 
which is included within the Kazakhmys Copper segment, and is part of this segment’s zinc cash generating unit. An impairment charge  
has been recognised following management’s decision to cease production at the zinc smelter in light of adverse changes in assumptions 
about future zinc prices and operating costs. The carrying value of the zinc smelter as at 31 December 2008 was $75 million, and in light  
of management’s decision to cease production, the entire carrying value has been impaired. 
(g) Kazakhmys Gold 
Impairment of mining assets includes an amount of $112 million relating to the impairment of Kazakhmys Gold. An impairment charge has 
been recognised following a general change in the long-term strategy of the division, with the outlook for existing mines and development 
projects being less attractive than originally anticipated at the time of the acquisition. The value in use was assessed by reference to cash flow 
forecasts discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10%. Furthermore, goodwill of $46 million recognised on the acquisition of Kazakhmys Gold (as a 
result of the requirement to provide deferred tax on the acquisition fair value adjustments) has also been written off during the year. See  
note 16(a) for details on the assumptions used in the Kazakhmys Gold impairment test. 
(h) Kazakhmys Copper mining assets and property, plant and equipment 
An impairment charge has been recognised within the Kazakhmys Copper segment on the property, plant and equipment and mining  
assets associated with the closure of certain mines which are loss making in a period of sustained commodity price weakness and are unlikely, 
in management’s best estimate, to reopen in the foreseeable future. 
(i) Kazakhmys Copper and MKM inventories 
Impairment of inventories include an amount of $73 million and $15 million in respect of Kazakhmys Copper and MKM, respectively.  
For Kazakhmys Copper, the impairment primarily relates to the impairment of stockpiled ore which is not going to be processed in the 
foreseeable future as its processing is uneconomic at current commodity price levels. Within MKM, a provision has been recognised to 
record inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value. This primarily relates to finished goods held in stock at the end of the year 
which have been written down reflecting the fall in copper price in December.

 The UK statutory income tax rate for January to March 2008 was 30% and for April to December 2008 was 28%, giving a weighted average full year rate  
of 28.5% for 2008. 
Corporate income tax is calculated at 28.0% (2008: 28.5%) of the assessable profit for the year for the Company and its UK subsidiaries and 
20.0% for the operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan (2008: 30.0%). MKM, which is included as part of discontinued operations, has a tax rate 
of 28.5% (2008: 28.5%) and relates to German corporate income tax and trade tax. 
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2009 is 25.4% (2008: 28.3%). 
New tax legislation 
The Government of Kazakhstan introduced a new Tax Code which came into force on 1 January 2009. Included within the new tax legislation 
was a phased reduction in corporate income tax (CIT) rates from 30% in 2008 to 15% in 2011, together with the introduction of the mineral 
extraction tax.  
Excess profits tax 
The new tax legislation removed the tax stabilisation of subsoil use contracts and changed the excess profits tax (EPT) methodology.  
Based on 2009 production and material flows within the Kazakhmys Copper and Kazakhmys Gold Divisions, there is no EPT charge for  
the year, compared to a charge of $28 million in 2008. Prior to 1 January 2009, excess profits tax (EPT) was levied on certain profitable 
subsoil contracts where the cumulative internal rate of return for the current year exceeded 20% in a given period.  www.kazakhmys.com 121
 
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
The effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate due to the following reasons: 
Transfer pricing 
Included within the tax charge is $28 million in respect of transfer pricing for 2009. New transfer pricing legislation came into force on  
1 January 2009 as part of the introduction of the new Tax Code. This new legislation removed the 10% safe harbour provision which was 
permitted under the previous transfer pricing legislation and has been replaced by the concept of the ‘arm’s length principle’. However,  
this new legislation does not fully reflect the arm’s length concept which forms the underlying basis of transfer pricing legislation within many 
OECD countries. Kazakhmys LLC has recognised a transfer pricing provision of $28 million at 31 December 2009 based on management’s 
interpretation of the new transfer pricing legislation and the prevailing status of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax authorities. 
Non-deductible expenses 
Included within non-deductible expenses is an amount of $26 million in respect of the copper hedging programme within Kazakhmys LLC.  
A tax deduction is not available for the $129 million hedging loss due to the tax treatment of these losses under Kazakhstan tax legislation.  
Unremitted overseas earnings 
Withholding taxes of $18 million have been recognised in 2009 in relation to the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries as at 31 December 2009, 
which are expected to be remitted to the UK in the future through dividend distributions from Kazakhstan.  
Equity accounting  
The Group’s interest in the earnings of ENRC is included, net of tax, in the consolidated income statement below the Group’s operating 
profit in arriving at profit before taxation, thereby reducing the Group’s effective tax rate. 
Year ended 31 December 2008  
The income tax expense for the year includes a credit of $178 million in respect of deferred income tax due to the impairment of the 
Kazakhmys Gold business and the enactment of the new tax legislation within Kazakhstan. This credit is split between continuing operations 
of $52 million and discontinued operations of $126 million, and is primarily made up of the following: 
Continuing operations 
On the acquisition of Kazakhmys Gold in July 2007, a deferred tax liability of $46 million was recognised arising from the requirement  
to provide deferred tax on the acquisition fair value adjustments, with a corresponding entry to goodwill. The goodwill recognised on 
acquisition and a proportion of the mining assets of the Kazakhmys Gold business were impaired during the year and this resulted in  
a taxation credit in the income statement of $32 million. 
Additionally, the non-acquisition related deferred tax liabilities within the Group’s Kazakhstan businesses were recalculated taking into 
account the lower corporate income tax rates resulting from the new Kazakhstan tax legislation. This calculation gave rise to a $20 million 
taxation credit in the income statement. 
Discontinued operations 
On completion of the acquisition of Kazakhmys Power in May 2008, a deferred tax liability of $267 million was recognised arising from  
the requirement to provide deferred tax on the acquisition fair value adjustments, with a corresponding entry to goodwill. The deferred tax 
liability was calculated based on a corporate income tax rate of 30%, the prevailing tax rate at the date of acquisition. As a consequence  
of the new Kazakhstan tax legislation, the deferred tax liability on the fair value adjustments was recalculated as $141 million resulting in  
a taxation credit in the income statement of $126 million. 
Future tax rates 
Future tax charges are affected by the mix of profits and tax rates in the various tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. With the 
enactment of further new tax legislation in Kazakhstan in November 2009, which is effective from 1 January 2010, the corporate income  
tax rate will be frozen at 20% for the years 2010-2012 rather than being reduced to 17.5% in 2010 and 15% in 2011, which were to have  
been the revised rates under the previous tax legislation, which was effective from 1 January 2009. The lower corporate income tax rate in 
Kazakhstan will have the effect of significantly lowering the Group’s overall future effective tax rate below the current UK statutory corporate 
income tax rate of 28%.

Details of the Group’s tax losses arising in the jurisdictions in which it operates are as follows: 
(i) Kazakhstan 
At 31 December 2009, Kazakhmys LLC has corporate income tax losses on certain mines that can be carried forward and used against future 
taxable profits arising from those mines. Under Kazakhstan tax legislation, tax losses from loss making mines may not be offset against the 
taxable profits of profitable mines. Kazakhmys LLC expects that certain mines will be in a tax loss making position for the foreseeable future 
and will have no taxable profits against which the losses can be offset. Therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the 
tax losses associated with these mines. Tax losses arising from mines that are expected to be profitable in the future have been recognised as 
deferred tax assets. 
(ii) Germany 
MKM has at 31 December 2009 corporate income tax losses that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits, subject to 
restrictions set out under German tax legislation. There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses. Due to the past history of tax 
losses, there is insufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise against which the losses can be offset. For these reasons, no deferred tax 
asset has been recognised.  
(d) Unrecognised deferred tax liability 
The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of the distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls 
them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The gross temporary differences in respect of the undistributed reserves of the Group’s subsidiaries, as shown in their statutory accounts 
prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, are as follows:

(a) Basic and diluted EPS 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
of 20 pence each outstanding during the year. Purchases of the Company’s shares by the Employee Benefit Trust are dilutive ordinary shares. 
(b) EPS based on Underlying Profit 
The Group’s Underlying Profit is the profit for the year after adding back items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not 
impact the underlying trading performance of the business and their resultant tax and minority interest effects, as shown in the table below. 
EPS based on Underlying Profit is calculated by dividing Underlying Profit by the number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding 
during the year. The Directors believe EPS based on Underlying Profit provides a more consistent measure for comparing the underlying 
trading performance of the Group. 
The following shows the reconciliation of Underlying Profit from the reported profit and the share data used in the computations for EPS

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Impairment testing – Goodwill 
The Group performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and when there are indicators of impairment. In assessing whether goodwill 
has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated, is compared to its recoverable amount. 
(a) Kazakhmys Gold 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
All goodwill associated with Kazakhmys Gold was fully written off in 2008. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
The $46 million of goodwill relating to Kazakhmys Gold arose as a consequence of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on 
the fair value adjustments, and was allocated to Kazakhmys Gold’s four cash generating units as follows: (i) Kazakhstan operating mines –  
$6 million, (ii) Mizek sulphide development project (Kazakhstan) – $14 million, (iii) Bozymchak development project (Kyrgyzstan) – $20 million, 
and (iv) Akjilga development project (Tajikistan) – $6 million. 
During the year, the Group has undertaken an impairment review of the Kazakhmys Gold segment, and the goodwill of $46 million arising on 
the acquisition has been impaired in full in addition to mining assets of $112 million following a general change in the long-term strategy of 
the division, with the outlook for existing mines and development projects being less attractive than originally anticipated at the time of the 
acquisition (see note 8(g)). 
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a combination of ‘value in use’ and ‘fair value less costs to sell’ calculations and is 
based on the cash flows expected to be generated from existing operations and development projects. Cash flows are projected for periods 
up to the date that mining and refining is expected to cease based on management’s current expectations. For current operations, the 
completion dates are based on recent assessments of the reserves and resources available and annual ore extraction rates, and are  
expected to cease by the end of 2011. For the development projects, the commencement dates for mining (between 2011 and 2014)  
reflect management’s expectations of the life of mine given current financing constraints, the time required to complete technical studies  
and to develop infrastructure and facilities at the mines for production to commence. Mining will cease at the development projects at  
dates between 2016 and 2027 depending on the project, and cash flows have been forecast to these dates. 
The key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations are: 
• recoverable amount of reserves and resources; 
• commodity prices; 
• discount rates; 
• timing of capital expenditure; 
• inflation; and 
• exchange rates. 
Economically recoverable reserves and resources are based on management’s expectations based on the availability of reserves at mine 
sites, technical studies and exploration and evaluation work undertaken by in-house and third party specialists. 
Long-term commodity prices are based on external market consensus forecasts. Specific prices are determined from information available in 
the market after considering the nature of the commodity produced and long-term market expectations. The long-term gold and silver prices 
used in the impairment test, based on market consensus, were $750/oz and $11.50/oz, respectively. 
A discount rate of 10% was used in the recoverable amount calculations, which represents the pre-tax rate that reflects the Group’s current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating unit. 
Management have estimated the timing of capital expenditure on the development projects based on the Group’s current and future 
financing plans and the results of technical studies completed to date. 
Long-term inflation rates for the countries that the operating mines and development projects are located in have been used in the 
calculations. These are based on information available in the market and country specific research. Long-term inflation rates used  
for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the impairment test were 4.9%, 5.9% and 9.7%, respectively. 
In assessing the ‘fair value less costs to sell’, another key assumption is foreign exchange rates. These are based on external market 
consensus forecasts, and specific rates are determined from information available in the market after considering long-term market 
expectations and the countries in which the cash generating unit operates. 
(b) Kazakhmys Power 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
Prior to the Kazakhmys Power Division being classified as an asset held for sale, an impairment test was performed on the acquisition 
goodwill of Kazakhmys Power in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ using a ‘fair value less costs to sell’ basis. Goodwill of  
$459 million arose on the acquisition of Kazakhmys Power (after re-translation – see note 4) and is allocated to the division’s two cash 
generating units as follows: (i) Ekibastuz power plant – $443 million, and (ii) Maikuben West coal mine – $16 million.  
When determining the fair value less costs to sell for the Ekibastuz power plant, management have used the sales price agreed with Samruk. 
Management have concluded that given that the Power Division is classified as an asset held for sale it was more appropriate to derive the 
fair value less cost to sell from the observable market price rather than a discounted cash flow calculation.  
Based on the results of the impairment test, the amount by which the Ekibastuz power plant’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying 
amount is $243 million (recoverable amount $1,362 million and carrying value $1,119 million), and therefore the goodwill arising on  
the acquisition of the Ekibastuz power plant is not impaired.   126 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
16. INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED 
The goodwill relating to the acquisition of the Maikuben West coal mine has been written down to zero. This impairment is a result of a 
change in the long-term strategy of the mine following the announcement of the sale of 50% of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power station to 
Samruk (see note 5(b)). 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Management has performed an impairment test of the goodwill arising from the acquisition of Kazakhmys Power at the year end as required 
by IAS 36 using a ‘fair value less costs to sell’ basis. Goodwill of $568 million arose on the acquisition of Kazakhmys Power and is allocated to 
the division’s two cash generating units as follows: (i) Ekibastuz power plant – $548 million, and (ii) Maikuben West coal mine – $20 million. 
The key assumptions used in the impairment test are: 
• electricity generation volumes; 
• tariff prices; 
• discount rates; 
• timing of capital expenditure; and 
• inflation and exchange rates. 
Electricity generation volumes are based on management’s expectations based on supply and demand dynamics within Kazakhstan and  
the timing of capital expenditure required to increase the capacity of the power station. 
Tariff prices are based on management’s expectations with reference to commentary given by the Government with regards to setting tariff 
prices in the future and increase from $0.020/kWh in 2008 to $0.030/kWh in 2012. The Department of Energy has stated that they expect 
tariff prices to reach $0.035/kWh by 2010. However, for the purposes of the impairment test, a more conservative approach has been 
adopted with tariff prices not expected to exceed this level until 2014. Tariff prices are assumed to increase at the long-term inflation rate  
for all years after 2012. 
The discount rate used in the recoverable amount calculations represents the pre-tax rate that reflects the Group’s current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the two cash generating units. The discount rates used in the impairment 
test for the Ekibastuz power plant and Maikuben West coal mine were 12.4% and 15.8%, respectively. 
Management have estimated the timing of capital expenditure based on the Group’s current and future financing plans and the results  
of technical studies completed at the time of acquisition. 
Long-term inflation and exchange rates for Kazakhstan have been used in the calculations. These are based on information available in  
the market and country specific research. A long-term inflation rate of 4.9% for Kazakhstan has been used in the impairment test and the  
 test was KZT150/$1 in 2009 to KZT135/$1 in 2013. 
Based on the results of the impairment test, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Kazakhmys Power is not impaired. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
If the values of the key assumptions were to move by the following amounts, then fair value less costs to sell would equal the carrying  
value of each cash generating unit. All changes are assumed to happen in isolation: 
Ekibastuz power plant cash generating unit: 
• if electricity sales volumes were to decrease by 3.2% for each year, then the recoverable amount would equal the carrying amount; 
• if the rate of growth in tariff prices was less than forecast such that tariff prices grew at a rate of 3.1% less than that assumed for each year, 
then the recoverable amount would equal the carrying amount; 
• if the discount rate increased from 12.4% to 13.5%, then the recoverable amount would equal the carrying amount. 
Maikuben West coal mine cash generating unit: 
• if coal sales volumes were to decrease by 1.3% for each year, then the recoverable amount would equal the carrying amount; 
• if the rate of growth in coal prices was less than forecast such that coal prices grew at a rate of 1.2% less than that assumed for each year, 
then the recoverable amount would equal the carrying amount; 
• if the discount rate increased from 15.8% to 16.3%, then the recoverable amount would equal the carrying amount. 
The amounts by which the units’ recoverable amount exceeds their carrying amount is $146 million for the Ekibastuz power plant and  
$4 million for the Maikuben West coal mine.

(a) Deemed cost of assets within Kazakhmys LLC 
For the purpose of the transition to IFRS in 2002, the Directors commissioned an independent company which held a State licence to 
conduct valuations, to carry out an independent appraisal of property, plant and equipment as of 1 January 2002 to determine their  
deemed cost at that date. 
The deemed cost of property, plant and equipment as of 1 January 2002 was determined primarily with reference to depreciated 
replacement cost. The Directors believe that the deemed cost reflected the economic conditions of the Group’s property, plant and 
equipment at that time. 
(b) Cost of assets within acquired businesses 
The cost of property, plant and equipment acquired through business acquisitions since the IFRS transition date in 2002 is based on  
the results of IFRS fair value exercises undertaken at the time of acquisition. 
(c) Impairment 
During 2009, property, plant and equipment of $200 million (2008: $120 million) was impaired, of which $50 million relates to the  
Kazakhmys Copper segment, $133 million relates to MKM and $17 million relates to the Power segment (see note 6(a)(iii)). 
(d) Fully depreciated assets 
At 31 December 2009, the cost of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment within Kazakhmys LLC was $380 million  
(2008: $333 million), within MKM was $22 million (2008: $8 million), and within other Group entities was $5 million (2008: $8 million). 
(e) Capitalised borrowing costs 
No borrowing costs were capitalised by the Group during the year (2008: $nil) as no significant qualifying assets commenced construction 
after 1 January 2008.  128 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

19. INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATE 
In 2007, the Group acquired an 18.8% interest in ENRC at a price of $806 million. At the time of the listing of ENRC on the main board  
of the London Stock Exchange in December 2007, new shares were issued by ENRC to which the Group did not subscribe and hence  
the Group’s interest in ENRC reduced from 18.8% to 14.6% taking into account the full exercise of the over-allotment option. 
On 24 July 2008, the Company issued 80,286,050 ordinary shares of 20 pence each to the Government in exchange for 98,607,884 shares  
in ENRC, which it received on 28 July 2008. The share price of the Company as at the date of the share issue was £13.17 per share, and  
the market value of the shares issued was $2,110 million. In addition stamp duty of $10 million was incurred, taking the total cost of the 
transaction to $2,120 million. Following completion of these transactions, the Group’s share holding in ENRC increased to 22.2%. 
Between 31 July and 8 August 2008, the Group purchased for a total cost of $800 million, a further 35,733,717 shares in ENRC thereby 
taking the Group’s total holding in ENRC to 25.0% of the issued share capital. 
Between 2 October and 27 October 2008, the Group purchased, for a total cost of $108 million, a further 12,647,009 shares in ENRC  
thereby taking the Group’s total holding in ENRC to 334,824,860 or 26.0% of the issued share capital. 
After the completion of these transactions, the total number of shares held by the Group in ENRC at 31 December 2008 and 2009  
was 334,824,860.  www.kazakhmys.com 129

 Based on ENRC’s published unaudited results. 
At 31 December 2009, the Group’s 26.0% in ENRC had a market value of $4,879 million (31 December 2008: $1,600 million) which  
is determined by reference to the published price quotation on the London Stock Exchange. 
In light of the positive movement in share prices seen during the 2009 financial year, particularly those of natural resource companies,  
and the upward trend in short and long term commodity prices, the Directors do not believe that an impairment indicator has arisen  
with regards to the Group’s investment in ENRC at 31 December 2009. 
The accounting period end of ENRC is 31 December. 
The following is a summary of the financial information of the Group’s investment in ENRC based on ENRC’s published unaudited results:

Year ended 31 December 2008 
Following the piecemeal acquisition of ENRC, the Group’s investment in associate has been impaired by $2,636 million. This impairment 
charge has been recognised directly in equity against the unrealised gain on the available for sale investment, and there is no impact on the 
consolidated income statement. The impairment arose due to the requirements of IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments  
in associates’ which requires the cost of acquisition of each tranche to be compared to the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the 
acquiree. With the exception of the acquisition of the final tranche of ENRC shares in October 2008, the acquisitions in July and August 2008 
were undertaken at a time prior to the sharp decrease in commodity prices and share prices of listed natural resource companies, and the 
prevailing market value of ENRC at that time was considerably in excess of the recoverable amount. The Group’s cost of investment in the 
associate in excess of the fair value, arising from the piecemeal acquisition, has therefore been impaired and this has been recognised 
against the unrealised gain within equity (from when the shareholding was classified as an available for sale investment) arising prior to  
the time when the Group equity accounted for its investment in ENRC. The recoverable amount used in assessing the impairment charge  
is value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13%.

26. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS 
Commencing from 2007, the Company established a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP).  
The total expense for the year ended 31 December 2009 arising from these plans was $1 million (2008: $1 million). 
Both plans are discretionary benefits offered by the Company for the benefits of its employees. The main purpose is to increase the  
interest of the employees in Kazakhmys’ long-term business goals and performance through share ownership. They represent incentives  
for employees’ future performance and commitment to be aligned to the goals of the Group. The shares issued under these plans are 
dilutive ordinary shares as the Company purchased 379,825 shares at a cost of $7 million through an Employee Benefit Trust during the year. 
For any future awards, the Company may issue new shares to the Employee Benefit Trust rather than purchase the shares in the open market. 
(a) Long Term Incentive Plan 
Under the LTIP, shares are granted to senior management of the Company at nil cost. The vesting of the shares is dependent on the total 
shareholder return (TSR) of the Group as compared to a group of listed comparator companies, as well as a requirement for the recipients  
of awards to remain in employment with the Company over the vesting period. There are no cash settlement alternatives. 
The first awards, granted on 3 December 2007, under the LTIP were made with either a two year vesting period or a three year vesting 
period. Awards over 11,226 shares were granted with a two year vesting period and awards over 37,862 shares were granted with a  
three year vesting period. The awards with a two year vesting period did not vest and lapsed during the year. 
On 7 April 2008, awards over 66,202 shares were granted with a three year vesting period. 
On 7 April 2009, awards over 262,987 shares were granted with a three year vesting period. A further 74,240 shares were granted on  
26 November 2009 with a three year vesting period. 
Additional awards are due to be granted to senior management in April 2010 and these will be subject to the same vesting criteria as  
the awards granted on 7 April 2009. 
The fair value of the shares was estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the shares were granted. This model simulates the TSR and compares it against the group of comparator  
companies. It takes into account historic dividends and share price fluctuations to predict the distribution of relative share performance. 
The following table shows the movements in the number of shares during the year: 
Number 2009 2008
Outstanding at 1 January 115,290 49,088
Granted on 7 April 2008 – 3 year vesting period – 66,202
Granted on 7 April 2009 – 3 year vesting period 262,987 –

The award of shares are not affected by the risk free rate of interest since no investment is required by the recipient, and therefore no  
interest could be earned elsewhere. On vesting of the award, the participants are entitled to cash equal to the value of dividends (excluding 
the dividend tax credit) that would have been paid on those shares between the grant date and the date of vesting. Therefore, expected 
dividend yield does not affect the valuation of the awards and has been set at zero to achieve this effect. Expected volatility is based on 
historic share price movements. 
(b) Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
On 7 April 2009, awards over 63,740 shares were granted to employees based on an average share price at grant date of £4.22 with a  
two year vesting period. Under the DSBP, the awards were based on the deferred amount of an employee’s 2008 bonus. 
On 7 April 2008, awards over 11,403 shares were granted to employees based on an average share price at grant date of £15.95 with a  
two year vesting period. Under the DSBP, the awards were based on the deferred amount of an employee’s 2007 bonus. 
Additional shares under the DSBP are due to be granted to employees in April 2010 based on the deferred amount of an employee’s 2009 
bonus. The number of shares granted to employees will be based on the cash value of the deferred bonus and the average share price for a 
period of time prior to the grant date in April 2010. The shares granted will vest after a period of two years after grant date. At 31 December 
2009, the cash value of the awards eligible for the DSBP, for which shares will be granted in April 2010, was $0.4 million.  www.kazakhmys.com 133

28. PROVISIONS CONTINUED 
(a) Site restoration and clean up 
The costs of decommissioning and reclamation of mines within the Group are based on the amounts included in the Group’s contracts for 
subsoil use. The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated costs to decommission and reclaim the mines at the dates of 
depletion of each of the deposits. The present value of the provision has been calculated using a discount rate of 3% (2008: 3%) per year. 
The liability becomes payable at the end of the useful life of each mine which ranges from one to 40 years. Uncertainties in estimating these 
costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives, and the levels of discount and 
inflation rates. 
(b) Payments for licences for mining assets 
In accordance with its contracts for subsoil uses the Group is liable to repay the costs of geological information provided by the Government 
of Kazakhstan for licensed deposits. The total amount payable by the Group is discounted to its present value using a discount rate of 8% 
(2008: 8%). The uncertainties include estimating the amount of the payments and their timing. The amounts are payable prior to 2019. 
(c) Payments for licences for exploration assets 
In accordance with the terms of the exploration licence, Kazakhmys Petroleum LLP is liable to make payments to the Government for 
geological information and social commitments in Astana and the Aktobe region. The present value of the obligations is estimated  
by applying a discount rate of 12% (2008: 12%). 
(d) Deferred consideration 
Provision for deferred consideration was made for future payments arising from the acquisition of Kazakhmys Power in May 2008. On a  
gross basis $80 million was payable to AES Corporation in April 2009 and $102 million was required to cash collaterise the standby letter  
of credit in December 2009. No further amounts are payable in respect of this acquisition after December 2009. 
(e) Other 
Other provisions are recorded where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation and a future outflow of resources is considered 
probable. Other provisions primarily relate to a provision for property taxes as at the date of acquisition of Kazakhmys Power in  
May 2008, settlement of which was made in July 2009 thereby extinguishing any further liability at 31 December 2009.

(a) Continuing operations 
Pre-export finance facility 
On 29 February 2008 Kazakhmys Finance PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a five year pre-export finance facility for 
$2,100 million with a syndicate of banks to be used for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power 
plant and Maikuben West coal mine and incremental purchases of shares in ENRC. As at 31 December 2008 and 2009, the facility was fully 
drawn. The loan is secured on the value of copper sales contracts with certain designated customers. Monthly loan repayments commenced 
in March 2009 and will continue through to February 2013 following a one year availability period. Arrangement fees with an amortised cost 
as at 31 December 2009 of $12 million (2008: $21 million), gross cost before amortisation of $26 million (2008: $26 million), have been 
netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39. Interest is payable on the drawn balance at a rate of US$ LIBOR + 1.25%. 
Kazakhmys PLC, Kazakhmys LLC and Kazakhmys Sales Ltd act as guarantors of the loan. The pre-export finance facility contains change of 
control clauses which are shown on page 81. 
Revolving credit facility 
On 26 August 2008 Kazakhmys Finance PLC signed a $200 million revolving credit facility with a group of banks for general corporate purposes

Revolving trade finance facility 
In May 2006 MKM entered into a revolving trade finance facility with a syndicate of banks for a four year loan to finance the repayment of 
external borrowings and intercompany balances due to Kazakhmys LLC, and to fund working capital. In June 2009 the facility was refinanced 
with a new €170 million facility for three years with a final maturity in June 2012. Interest is payable on the drawn balance at a rate of 
EURIBOR + 3.00%. The loan is secured over the inventories and receivables of MKM.

33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The financial information disclosed in the tables relating to the year ended 31 December 2009 represents continuing operations only. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and 
commodity price risk. These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Group’s Treasury 
department in close cooperation with the Group’s business divisions under oversight of a Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Chief 
Financial Officer. The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the monitoring of financial risks, management of the Group’s cash 
resources, debt funding programmes and capital structure, approval of counterparties and relevant transaction limits, and oversight of all 
significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group. The Treasury department operates as a service centre to the business divisions of the 
Group and not as a profit centre. 
A Group Treasury Policy has been approved by the Board and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial markets and 
the financial exposures facing the Group. The Treasury Policy covers specific areas of financial risk management, in particular, liquidity risk, 
credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk. The Group’s Treasury Committee and the Group’s Internal Audit 
department monitor compliance with the Treasury Policy on a regular basis. 
The Group’s Treasury department prepares monthly treasury reports for senior management which monitor all major financial exposures  
and treasury activities undertaken by the Group. In addition, a treasury report is prepared for each Board meeting which includes a summary 
of the credit markets and their impact on the implementation of the Group’s strategy, progress on the Group’s financing initiatives and the 
significant financial exposures faced by the Group. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivatives used for  
risk management purposes. The Group’s borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instruments are controlled and managed 
centrally by the Group’s Treasury department. Liquidity retained within Kazakhstan is only held for working capital purposes. 
The Group’s accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 3. 
(a) Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and 
exchange rates. The Group’s philosophy is generally not to hedge its core revenue streams. In periods of significant market volatility  
or uncertainty, the Group may use derivative instruments as a means of reducing volatility and any negative impact on its operating  
cash flows. Strict limits on the size and type of any derivative hedge transaction are laid down by the Board and subject to strict internal 
controls. The Group does not hold any speculative financial instruments. 
In 2008 and 2009, in light of significant market volatility and disruption in the financial sector, the Group entered into a number of interest 
rate swap contracts to convert debt carried at floating rates into debt which is carried at fixed interest rates in order to reduce the volatility  
of finance costs. No such instruments have been entered into in respect of 2010 or future years. 
During 2008, forward commodity contracts were used, in limited situations, to hedge against copper quotational period differences arising 
on the price fixations between purchases of copper cathode by Kazakhmys Sales Ltd from Kazakhmys LLC and sales of copper cathode by 
Kazakhmys Sales Ltd to end customers.  
During 2009, the Group commenced a hedging programme which was intended to cover production from the higher cost mines in the 
Zhezkazgan region such that the viability of these mines was protected in the event of a decrease in the copper price below $3,000 per 
tonne. The hedges covered 90 kt, or approximately 30% of the estimated copper production for 2009, and established a price protecting 
floor and a cap to the price receivable on the hedged copper sales. As a result of the recovery in copper prices, losses under this hedging 
programme amounted to $129 million and have been recognised within other operating expenses (see note 7(e)). The hedging programme 
terminated in December 2009 and no positions remain outstanding in respect of 2010 or future years. 
MKM uses natural hedging arising on back-to-back purchase and supply contracts to manage, to the fullest extent possible, its economic 
exposure to changes in the price of copper. In the event of any timing mis-match on the purchase and supply contracts, MKM uses 
commodity futures to manage its short-term exposure to changes in the price of copper. All commodity hedge contracts are for short-term 
duration (less than 12 months). 
For cash flow hedges the pre-tax amount removed from equity during the year and included in the income statement is a loss of $138 million 
(2008: gain of $143 million). In the income statement $129 million loss is included in other operating expenses (2008: $143 million gain 
included in other operating income) and $9 million loss is included in finance costs (2008: $nil). As at 31 December 2009 there are no 
amounts retained in equity as all the cash flow hedges have matured.  www.kazakhmys.com 137

trade and other payables (excluding payments received in advance and taxes payable that are non-financial instruments) and dividends payable by subsidiaries. 
3
 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments. 
(c) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating company in currencies other 
than that company’s functional currency. The functional currency of Kazakhmys LLC, Kazakhmys Power, Kazakhmys Gold and Kazakhmys 
Petroleum is the Kazakhstan tenge, with MKM having a Euro functional currency, Kazakhmys Services Ltd having a UK sterling functional 
currency, and the Company and the other entities within the Group having a US dollar functional currency. The currencies giving rise to this 
foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar based revenues and certain costs, bank deposits, trade receivables and certain trade payables 
of Kazakhmys LLC, and the US dollar balances in respect of certain revenues, and trade receivables and payables of MKM. The Group 
generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.  
No foreign exchange hedge transactions were entered into during 2009 or 2008. 
(i) Foreign currency exposure by company profile 
The analysis in the table below of the net monetary assets and liabilities indicates the Group’s exposure to currencies other than the 
functional currency of a company. These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and  
losses recognised in the income statement. As at 31 December 2009 and 2008, these exposures were as follows:

A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased equity and profit after tax

A 10% weakening of US dollar against the above currencies at 31 December would have had an equal but opposite effect on the above 
currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. 
(f) Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in the price of copper, which is quoted in US dollars on the international markets. The 
Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of copper prices in the  
future. The Group is also exposed, to a lesser degree, to the prices of other metals, including zinc, gold and silver, which are products 
produced by the Group as by-products to the copper production process. The Kazakhmys Power business is exposed to the effect of 
fluctuations in electricity tariffs that it is able to charge to customers. 
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities  
at 31 December 2009. This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in 
commodity prices over the course of a period of time. A 10% increase/(decrease) of commodity prices would have increased/(decreased) 
profit after tax by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular costs, remain constant. The analysis  
is performed on the same basis for 2008: 
 Impact on profit
 
$ million 2009 2008
Copper  1 1 
Other commodities  –  – 
As explained in note 33(a) above, the Group used forward commodity contracts to hedge against quotational period differences arising on 
price fixations within the UK sales operation during 2008, and for 2009 the Group entered into a hedging programme to protect the viability 
of higher cost mines in the Zhezkazgan region in the event of a decrease in the copper price below $3,000 per tonne. There were no 
commodity hedge contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2009 (2008: $nil). 
(g) Interest rate risk 
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates primarily impact 
borrowings by changing their future cash flows (floating rate debt) or their fair value (fixed rate debt) and deposits. The Group’s interest rate 
management policy is to generally borrow and invest at floating rates of interest. In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding 
may be considered appropriate. Local market conditions in Kazakhstan dictate that borrowings are generally fixed in nature and as such, 
borrowings in Kazakhstan are generally short-term in nature and used for working capital purposes only. A limited amount of fixed rate 
hedging using interest rate swaps may be undertaken during periods where the Group’s exposure to movements in short-term interest  
rates is more significant, or in periods when interest rates are perceived to be below long-term historical levels. 
At 31 December 2009, nil% (2008: 64%) of total debt was at a fixed rate and the balance was at floating rate. The exposure of the  
Group’s financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows:  www.kazakhmys.com 139

 Of the floating rate borrowings of $2,200 million, $1,400 million has been hedged using interest rate swap contracts from floating to fixed rate (see below). 
2
 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance and taxes payable that are non-financial instruments. 
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate (such as LIBOR). Interest on  
financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. 
Considering the net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2009, any increase in interest rates would result in a net loss in the 
consolidated income statement, and any decrease in interest rates would result in a net gain. The effect on profit after tax of a 10% 
movement in US$ LIBOR and EURIBOR rates, based on the year-end borrowings and with all other variables held constant, is estimated  
to be $1.7 million (2008: $1.7 million). 
(h) Credit risk 
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets. 
Investments in cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments are with approved counter-party banks  
and other financial institutions in accordance with the Group’s Treasury Policy. Counterparties are assessed prior to, during, and after the 
conclusion of transactions to ensure exposure to credit risk is limited to an acceptable level. The maximum exposure with respect to credit 
risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet. 
Credit risk relating to trade receivables 
The Group’s major exposure to credit risk is in respect of trade receivables. Given the number and geographical spread of the Group’s 
ultimate customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk is believed to be limited. The Group regularly monitors its  
exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure. 
Customer credit risk is managed by each division but is subject to Group oversight to ensure that each division’s customer credit risk 
management system operates in a prudent and responsible manner. Credit evaluations are performed for all major customers and credit 
limits are established based on internal or external rating criteria. The credit quality of the Group’s significant customers is monitored on  
an on-going basis, and receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality. 
Letters of credit are obtained where customer credit quality is not considered strong enough for open credit. 
There were no material impairments of trade receivables as at 31 December 2009 or 2008. The solvency of the debtor and their ability  
to repay the receivables were considered in assessing the impairment of such assets. 
Within Kazakhmys Copper, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers. Sales  
to Chinese customers are made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.  140 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
Payment from European and Chinese customers is subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments. Kazakhmys Copper is 
therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are not considered material. 
Kazakhmys LLC also provides certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its contractual 
obligations under its subsoil licences. For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, full provision is recognised in light of  
past payment history. 
Kazakhmys Gold has a single long standing customer with short payment terms which is agreed via an annual sales contract. 
Kazakhmys Power receives cash upfront or has short payment terms depending on the nature of the customer. 
MKM has put in place credit insurance for the majority of its sales and credit limits are set by the credit insurance company depending on  
the financial strength and location of each customer. For those sales where credit insurance is not available, short payment terms and regular 
dialogue with customers ensures credit risk is kept to a minimum. 
As at 31 December 2009, 10 (2008: 10) customers accounted for 87% (2008: 34%) of the trade and other receivables balance of Kazakhmys 
Copper. By 24 March 2010, 81% (25 March 2009: 98%) of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.

(iii) Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits 
Credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, comprising principally cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative 
financial instruments arises from the potential default of counterparties. Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions 
is managed by the Group’s Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy. Investment of cash and deposits are 
made only with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. These limits are 
reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and updated accordingly. The limits are set to minimise  
the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure. 
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non performance of the counterparties to derivative financial 
instruments. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was:

(i) Liquidity risk 
The Group maintains a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of 
liquid cash investments of varying maturities, credit facilities and longer term debt instruments. Management regularly reviews the funding 
requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments. 
In the event that bank term deposits in Kazakhstan need to be liquidated at short notice in advance of their contracted maturity date, the 
terms of these investments permit their immediate conversion to cash, and in some instances, the forfeiture of interest accrued to the date  
of liquidation. 
The Group’s policy is to centralise debt and surplus cash balances to the maximum extent possible.

 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance and taxes payable that are non-financial instruments. 
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to  
estimate the fair values: 
• cash and cash equivalents, current investments, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and dividend payable approximate 
to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments; 
• during 2008 and 2009, the Group entered into interest rate swaps with various bank counterparties. The fair value of interest rate swaps 
are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and the yield curve over the remaining term  
of the instrument; 
• provisions for cash payments are discounted back to their present value; and 
• the fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt and remaining maturities. 
(k) Capital management 
The over-riding objectives of the Group’s capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through 
the commodity cycle and to maintain an optimal capital structure with a view to maximising returns to shareholders and benefits to other 
stakeholders by reducing the Group’s cost of capital. 
As a result of acquisitions made during 2008, the Group has moved into a net debt position from continuing operations of $689 million as  
at 31 December 2009 (2008: $1,628 million). Included within the debt facilities are financial covenants related to maximum borrowing levels 
(determined by reference to a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio) and minimum tangible net worth for which compliance certificates are produced.  
All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements. There are no 
covenants under negotiation at present. 
At 31 December 2009, total capital employed (which comprises equity shareholders’ funds, minority interests and borrowings) of the Group 
amounted to $8,502 million, compared to $9,697 million at 31 December 2008. Total capital employed is the measure of capital that is used 
by the Directors in managing capital. 
34. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
(a) Legal claims 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints. The Directors believe that the ultimate liability,  
if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations  
of the Group. As of 31 December 2009 and 2008, the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration. 
(b) Kazakhstan taxation contingencies 
(i) Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation 
The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities. Kazakhstan tax legislation and practice are in a state  
of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively. 
Management’s interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of the  
tax authorities. As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties  
and fines which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position and results of operations. 
(ii) Status of tax audits 
Kazakhmys Copper – corporate income tax 
During 2006, Kazakhmys was subject to a corporate tax audit for the years 2003 to 2005. The tax computations for the years after 2005 
remain open for inspection. Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change. 
The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and any contractual terms 
entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.  www.kazakhmys.com 143
 
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Kazakhmys Copper – transfer pricing 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
During 2007, Kazakhmys LLC was subject to a transfer pricing audit for the years 2001 to 2005. In producing the tax audit act arising from  
the transfer pricing audit for 2001 to 2005, the tax authorities allowed for a 10% deviation from LME market prices, and also assumed that 
average LME prices for the month preceding the month when the bill of lading was issued were relevant for the purposes of transfer pricing 
rather than the quotation periods stipulated in the contracts that were used in determining revenues for accounting purposes. This same 
criteria has been applied to 2008 export sales and therefore management believes that Kazakhmys LLC does not bear the risk of additional 
tax exposures relating to 2008 export sales. Assuming the approach adopted by the tax authorities in future tax audits is consistent with that 
which has been applied in prior years, no tax provision has been provided for by Kazakhmys LLC in relation to transfer pricing on 2008 export 
sales. However, the risk remains that the Kazakhstan tax authorities may take a different approach at the time of a future tax audit, and seek 
to impose additional tax assessments for transfer pricing for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008. 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
New transfer pricing legislation came into force on 1 January 2009. This new legislation removed the 10% safe harbour provision which  
was permitted under the previous transfer pricing legislation and has been replaced by the concept of the ‘arm’s length principle’.  
However, this new legislation does not fully reflect the arm’s length concept which forms the underlying basis of transfer pricing legislation  
within many OECD countries. Kazakhmys LLC has recognised a transfer pricing provision of $28 million at 31 December 2009 based  
on management’s interpretation of the new transfer pricing legislation and the prevailing status of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax 
authorities. The risk remains that the Kazakhstan tax authorities may take a different position with regards to the interpretation of the  
new transfer pricing legislation and the outcome of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax authorities may be materially different than 
management’s expectations. 
Kazakhmys Copper – excess profits tax 
The issuance of the tax audit act following the tax audit performed in 2006 implicitly confirmed management’s approach to excess profits tax 
for the years subject to audit. The cumulative nature of excess profits tax calculations may result in a further assessment of excess profits tax 
for the years already subject to audit if subsequent tax audits challenge the methodology adopted by Kazakhmys LLC. However, 
management believes the excess profits tax methodology adopted by Kazakhmys LLC is in compliance with legislation, and interpretations 
thereof, and has been applied for to the years subsequent to the period of the tax audit, i.e. 2006 to 2008. The Group has fully provided in 
its financial statements for all potential tax liabilities relating to application of excess profits tax. 
New tax legislation came into force in Kazakhstan on 1 January 2009 which removed the tax stabilisation of subsoil use contracts and 
changed the excess profits tax methodology. Based on production and material flows for the year ended 31 December 2009 within 
Kazakhmys LLC, management’s interpretation of the new tax legislation is that excess profits tax is no longer levied on Kazakhmys LLC’s 
operations. Management’s position is supported by discussions and correspondence with the governmental authorities. However, the risk 
remains that the Kazakhstan tax authorities may take a different position with regards to the interpretation of the new legislation and seek  
to impose excess profits tax on Kazakhmys LLC’s operations for the years subsequent to 2008 at the time of a future tax audit. 
(iii) Period for additional tax assessments 
The tax authorities in Kazakhstan are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in respect 
of all taxes, except for excess profits tax. In respect of excess profits tax, they are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after 
the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract. 
(iv) Possible additional tax liabilities 
The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and any contractual terms 
entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise. However, due 
to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation 
of contractual provisions or tax law. 
The resulting effect of this matter is that additional tax liabilities may arise. However, due to the range of uncertainties described above in 
assessing any potential additional tax liabilities, it is not practicable for the Directors to estimate the financial effect in terms of the amount  
of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable. 
(c) UK taxation contingencies 
(i) Status of tax audits 
In 2008, the UK tax authorities agreed the 2005 tax computation for the Company. The enquiry window for the 2006 tax computation has 
now closed but the 2007 and 2008 tax computations remain open for inspection. Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial 
statements for these years may be subject to change. 
The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in the UK and any contractual terms entered 
into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise. 
(ii) Transfer pricing 
The Directors believes the Group is in substantial compliance with regards to UK transfer pricing legislation as an appropriate profit margin 
has been generated within the UK sales operation since its formation at the time of Listing to cover the transfer of risks and rewards from 
Kazakhstan to the UK.  144 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

34. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED 
(d) Insurance 
The insurance industry in Kazakhstan is in a developing state and many forms of insurance protection common in other parts of the world  
are not yet generally available. The Group has purchased a catastrophic insurance programme in the London market to mitigate the effect of 
the loss or damage of certain of its assets located at its facilities and the resultant business interruption, although such a programme may not 
provide full cover in the event of a major loss. The Group does not have third party liability coverage in respect of property or environmental 
damage arising from accidents on Group property or relating to Group operations. There is a risk that the loss or destruction of certain assets 
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s operations and financial position. 
(e) Environmental contingencies 
Environmental regulations in Kazakhstan are continually evolving and new emissions legislation is expected to become effective from  
2012. The outcome of the environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated  
at present. As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. The Directors 
believe that there are no significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, 
however recognise that any future changes in legislation may have a significant impact on the Group’s results. The provision that has been 
made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits (see note 28), is based upon the 
estimation of the Group’s specialists. Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision  
will be adjusted accordingly. 
(f) Use of subsoil and exploration rights 
In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (the ‘Ministry’) granting exploration 
and production rights to third party bodies. Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be agreed 
before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence. These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its 
contractual obligations. The current subsoil rights will expire at varying dates up to 2062. 
(g) Other commitments 
The table below sets out the Group’s expenditure commitments in property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2009 and 2008: 
$ million 2009 2008 
Property, plant and equipment 196 298
The Group has capital expenditure commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as well as commitments under its mining 
subsoil agreements and the petroleum exploration licence. Committed expenditure under these subsoil agreements relates to investments  
in community-related projects, and includes investments in social sphere assets, infrastructure and public utilities. 
(h) Guarantee of employee loans 
Kazakhmys LLC’s employees are permitted to enter into loan arrangements with banks on normal commercial terms under which Kazakhmys 
LLC has guaranteed to deduct repayments from employees’ remuneration in accordance with agreed schedules of repayment. The total 
value of this guarantee amounted to $4 million as at 31 December 2009 (2008: $5 million). 
(i) Operating lease commitments 
The operating lease expense for the year was $1 million (2008: $1 million). At 31 December 2009 and 2008, the Group had the following 
total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases: 
$ million 2009 2008

(j) Discontinued operations – German taxation contingencies 
(i) Status of tax audits 
In 2007 the German tax authorities finalised a tax audit of MKM for the years 1999 to 2002. The tax audit for the years from 2003 to 2005  
is currently underway and the years 2006 to 2008 remain open for inspection. Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial 
statements for these years may be subject to change. 
The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Germany and any contractual terms 
entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.  www.kazakhmys.com 145

(i) Government 
Share issue 
On 24 July 2008, the Company issued 80,286,050 ordinary shares of 20 pence each to the Government, thereby making the Government  
a 15% shareholder of the Company and a related party with effect from this date. 
Sale of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP to Samruk 
On 10 December 2009 it was announced that the Group had agreed to dispose 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP, a 100% owned subsidiary 
within the Kazakhmys Power Division, to Samruk, an entity wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Kazakhstan, for consideration 
of $681 million. Although the transaction completed on 26 February 2010, the Group received the consideration in December 2009 and  
it is included within trade and other payables (see note 30). 
Other transactions 
Throughout the normal course of business, the Group conducts transactions with entities controlled by the Government. The principal 
activities relate to the payment of electricity transmission fees, use of railway infrastructure and payments to tax authorities. Transactions 
between the Group and Government departments and agencies are considered to be related party transactions unless they meet all of  
the following criteria: 
• they were done in the ordinary course of business of the Government department and/or company; 
• there is no choice of suppliers; and 
• they have terms and conditions (including prices, privileges, credit terms, regulations etc) that are consistently applied to all entities,  
public or private. 
The Group did not have any non-arm’s length or privileged transactions with entities controlled by the Government. 
Dividend payment 
The Government’s share of the interim dividend paid by the Company on 24 October 2008 was $11 million. 
(ii) ENRC 
In 2009 the Group received dividends of $84 million from ENRC, the associated undertaking (2008: $38 million). 
(iii) Companies under trust management agreements 
The Group operates a number of companies under trust management agreements with local and state authorities. The activities include 
heating distribution systems, road maintenance and aviation services. The purpose of these agreements is to provide public and social 
services without any material financial benefit for the Group. Transactions between the Group and these companies are conducted on  
an arm’s length basis. 
(iv) Other 
Transactions with other companies primarily relate to the provision of goods and services, on an arm’s length basis, with companies  
whose boards include members of senior management from the Group’s subsidiaries. 
During 2009 for commercial purposes, Kazakhmys LLC advanced amounts totalling $25 million to Eduard Ogay, the Chief Executive of 
Kazakhmys LLC, who engaged third parties to negotiate with suppliers to ensure that competitive terms and pricing were being obtained  
for the benefit of Kazakhmys LLC. Until 31 December 2009, the third parties repaid $5 million of the amounts advanced to Eduard Ogay, who 
has in turn repaid these amounts to Kazakhmys LLC, such that the amount outstanding at 31 December 2009 was $20 million. As at 29 March 
2010, all outstanding amounts had been repaid by Eduard Ogay to Kazakhmys LLC. 
(b) Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties 
Prices for related party transactions are determined by the parties on an ongoing basis depending on the nature of the transaction.  146 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

(i) Kazakhmys LLC 
During 2008, a Group reorganisation took place such that the Company’s investment in Kazakhmys LLC was transferred to an intermediate 
holding company through a share for share exchange. As at 31 December 2009, Kazakhmys LLC is indirectly held by the Company whose 
beneficial interest is 99.73% (2008: 99.73%). 
(ii) ENRC 
On 24 July 2008 the Company issued 80,286,050 ordinary shares of 20 pence each to the Government in exchange for 98,607,884 shares  
in ENRC (7.66% of ENRC’s issued share capital) which it received on 28 July 2008. The share price of the Company as at the date of the  
share issue was £13.17 per share, and the market value of the shares issued was $2,120 million, including issue costs of $10 million. 
At 31 December 2008, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in ENRC was $1,129 million reflecting the recoverable amount of the 
7.66% interest in ENRC held at the Company level. This reflects an impairment loss of $991 million being charged to the Company’s income 
statement. The impairment arises due to the different IFRS accounting treatment at the Company level of the 7.66% interest in ENRC which  
is recorded as an investment at cost, compared to the Group’s equity accounting treatment. The recoverable amount used in assessing the 
impairment charge is value in use, using a discounted cash flow model. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate  
of 13%. 
During 2009, a Group reorganisation took place such that the Company’s investment in ENRC was transferred to an intermediate holding 
company through a share for share exchange. 
(iii) Other investments 
Balances within additions reflect investments in intermediate holding companies through which the Group’s entities are held in MKM, 
Kazakhmys Power, Kazakhmys Gold, Kazakhmys Petroleum and associated capitalised acquisition costs. The Company acquired these 
investments in intermediate holding companies through share for share exchanges. 
The impairment charge of $39 million is in respect of the Company’s investment in Kazakhmys Services Ltd a wholly owned subsidiary.  
The carrying value of the investment has been written down by $39 million to the net asset value of Kazakhmys Services Ltd.

The capital reserve is a non-distributable reserve created when the shares issued pursuant to the share exchange agreements prior to the 
Company’s listing were recorded at fair value. To the extent the Company receives dividends from Kazakhmys LLC’s profits created in the 
period prior to the share exchange, the capital reserve is realised through a transfer to distributable retained earnings. 
(ii) Capital redemption reserve 
As a result of the share buy-back programme, transfers are made from share capital to the capital redemption reserve based on the nominal 
value of the shares cancelled.  www.kazakhmys.com 147

42. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The UK sales function was transferred to Kazakhmys Sales Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, on 1 January 2008 so the financial 
risks borne by the Company have significantly reduced since that date. The Company has a limited exposure to foreign currency, credit and 
interest rate risks and these are shown below. The Company has no exposure to commodity, liquidity or price risks. 
(a) Foreign currency risk 
The Company has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from transactions in currencies other than that the Company’s 
functional currency being the US dollar. Prior to the Group reorganisation in which the Company’s interest in Kazakhmys LLC was transferred 
to an intermediate holding company, the primary currency giving rise to this foreign currency risk was the Kazakhstan tenge as a result of 
dividends receivable from Kazakhmys LLC within other operating income. The Company is also exposed, to a lesser degree, to corporate 
costs (included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables) which are primarily denominated in UK sterling. The 
Company generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk. 
Following the transfer of the UK sales function to Kazakhmys Sales Ltd on 1 January 2008 and the Group reorganisation in which the 
Company’s interest in Kazakhmys LLC was transferred to an intermediate holding company in 2008, the Company does not have any 
significant foreign currency risks.  
(b) Credit risk 
The UK sales function was transferred to Kazakhmys Sales Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, on 1 January 2008 and therefore 
the Company no longer has any credit risk with regards to customers from that date. Any remaining credit risk for the Company relates to 
cash and cash equivalents. Balances within trade and other receivables mostly relate to amounts owed by Group undertakings resulting in 
reduced credit risk for these balances. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: 
$ million 2009 2008 
Trade and other receivables  102  22 
Cash and cash equivalents  39  137 
  141  159 
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at 31 December 2009 and 2008 by geographic areas was Europe $102 million 
(2008: $22 million).  148 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009

(d) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Group’s financial instruments that are carried in  
the financial statements: 
   2009  2008

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction 
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other 
payables and intercompany borrowings approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
(e) Capital management 
The over-riding objectives of the Company’s capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern 
through the commodity cycle and to maintain an optimal capital structure with a view to maximising returns to shareholders and benefits  
to other stakeholders by reducing the Company’s cost of capital.  www.kazakhmys.com 149

46. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE 
(a) Sale of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP to Samruk 
On 10 December 2009 it was announced that the Group had agreed to dispose 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP, a 100% owned subsidiary within the 
Kazakhmys Power Division, to Samruk, an entity wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Kazakhstan, for consideration of $681 million. 
The transaction completed on 26 February 2010 and the Group has retained a non-controlling interest of 50% in the entity which shall be accounted 
for as a joint venture after the date of completion. 
The main governing board of the joint venture will be the supervisory board, which will comprise four members, two from the Group and two 
from Samruk. The supervisory board will make decisions (which require unanimity) in respect of areas such as personnel, investments, reporting, 
budgets, sales, procurement and loans. Management of Ekibastuz will initially be undertaken by a representative appointed by Kazakhmys for  
the first five years and will then rotate every five years. The appointment of the General Director and Audit Committee members will also rotate 
every five years. The Group and Samruk will each have 50% of the voting rights and no party will have overall control over Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP. 
(b) China Development Bank funding 
Summary of the transaction 
On 13 October 2009, the Group announced that it was in discussions with China Development Bank Corporation (‘CDB’) and Samruk regarding a 
potential loan facility. On 30 December 2009, Kazakhmys announced that it had secured up to $2.7 billion loan facilities with CDB and Samruk, 
allocated from a $3.0 billion financing line agreed between CDB and Samruk. Of the up to $2.7 billion secured for Kazakhmys, facility agreements 
were signed for $2.1 billion on 30 December 2009, and for a further $200 million on 12 January 2010, for the development of Kazakhmys’ projects  
at Bozymchak and Bozshakol and other development projects, with the balance of $400 million remaining available over the next three years. In  
the event Samruk is unable to source financing for the Moynak hydro-electric plant then $100 million of the $400 million may be made available  
for the Moynak plant reducing the funds available to Kazakhmys to $300 million. Samruk has separately signed an agreement for $300 million of the 
$3.0 billion to be used elsewhere and not for the benefit of the Group. As part of this financing package, the Company, along with a subsidiary of 
Samruk, provided a guarantee in favour of CDB in respect of Samruk’s obligations under the $3.0 billion financing line, including up to 85% of the 
$300 million which was not on-lent for the benefit of the Group, which could increase to 85% of $400 million in the event that $100 million is lent  
for the Moynak plant. 
The financing arrangements with CDB and Samruk were agreed on competitive terms, particularly given the prevailing market conditions and the 
difficulty experienced by CIS companies in accessing credit. Under the terms of the facility agreements, Kazakhmys secured a significant amount  
of funds on flexible and long dated terms which will be used to develop Kazakhmys’ growth projects.  
Related party transaction 
Samruk is an entity wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Kazakhstan, the ultimate owner and controller of a 15% stake in  
the Company. The transaction therefore constitutes a ‘related party transaction’ for the purposes of the Listing Rules. Due to the size of the  
up to $340 million guarantee liability, the UK Listing Authority confirmed on 1 March 2010 that the transaction falls within the modified  
requirements for a ‘smaller related party transaction’ set out in Listing Rule 11.1.10. 
Details of the transaction 
The transaction consists of a two-tier structure, with loans from CDB to Samruk and ‘back-to-back’ arrangements between Samruk and the Company. 
Samruk has signed facility agreements with Kazakhmys Finance PLC (‘Kazakhmys Finance’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to 
which Samruk will lend $2.3 billion of the up to $2.7 billion loan facility lent to it by CDB. It is intended that the remaining up to $400 million will be 
lent by CDB to Samruk and on-lent by Samruk to Kazakhmys Finance over the next three years for funding the development of the Group’s projects 
approved by CDB and Samruk, which could decrease to $300 million if $100 million is lent for the Moynak plant. 
The agreements between Samruk and Kazakhmys Finance operate ‘back-to-back’ with the agreements between CDB and Samruk, such that any 
payment (both interest and principal) by Kazakhmys Finance to Samruk will result in a corresponding payment by Samruk to CDB. Other relevant 
terms, such as the period during which the loans are available and the termination dates of the agreements, also correspond. The funds are available 
for drawing anytime within a three year period and once drawn will attract interest semi-annually at an annualised rate of US$ LIBOR plus 4.8%. The 
loans have a final maturity of between 12 and 15 years from the first drawdown and repayment of capital commences from the end of the third year 
following the first drawdown. 
As part of the financing package, the Company and JSC Kazakhtelecom (‘Kazakhtel’), a subsidiary of Samruk, have provided a guarantee to CDB for  
a maximum of $2.0 billion of the $3.0 billion of loans made and to be made by CDB to Samruk (the ‘Guarantee’). The Company’s liability under the 
Guarantee is capped at $1.7 billion of principal plus 85% of any interest and any other duly payable costs and expenses. Any payments under the 
Guarantee will be netted off against payments to be made by Kazakhmys Finance under the loan agreements between it and Samruk. As the 
Guarantee is several and covers the separate $300 million loan made by CDB to Samruk (but not lent on for the benefit of the Group), the Company 
will be liable as to 85% of that amount (i.e. up to $255 million) if Samruk fails to make a payment due under that loan to CDB. In addition, should 
Samruk not secure $100 million for its Moynak hydro-electric plant by 31 March 2010, then the Guarantee will increase by 85% of this amount, to 
$340 million. Furthermore, the Company has granted a separate $2.7 billion parent company guarantee to Samruk, pursuant to which the Company 
guarantees repayment of all amounts lent by Samruk to Kazakhmys Finance, as is typical in such corporate loan facilities. 
The guarantees under this facility took effect on 1 March 2010 following receipt of confirmation from the UK Listing Authority. The first draw down 
under the facility for $300 million was made on 17 March 2010, with $100 million of the funds being for the Bozymchak project in Kyrgyzstan and 
$200 million of the funds being for the development of the Group’s projects, other than Bozymchak and Bozshakol. 
(c) Tenge bond 
On 29 January 2010 the Group completed its debut bond issue on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange. The bond, with a total value of 10 billion tenge 
(approximately $67 million), was issued by Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP, for general corporate purposes, including financing the future capital expenditure 
programme in the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power plant. The bond has a coupon of 12% and will mature in five years. 
(d) Revolving credit facilities 
On 11 March 2010, Kazakhmys Finance PLC signed a one year $100 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date in March 2011. 
On 26 March 2010, Kazakhmys Finance PLC signed an agreement to extend the $150 million revolving credit facility for an additional year  
to March 2011. 
(e) Post year-end dividend 
The Directors recommend a final ordinary dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 of 9.0 US cents per share. Subject  
to approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 May 2010, this dividend shall be paid on 18 May 2010.

MINING RESERVES AND RESOURCES 
 
RESERVES AND RESOURCES ESTIMATION METHODS 
Kazakhmys Copper 
The Republic of Kazakhstan has incorporated by law the classification system and estimation methods for reserves and resources established  
by the Former Soviet Union (‘FSU’) and later revised in 1981. In practice, this means that the statements of reserves and resources developed by 
Kazakhmys and the mining plans to which they relate must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry of Energy 
and Mineral Resources for which adherence to the standardised national system of reserves and resources estimate on is mandatory. 
As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of Conditions for Estimation of Reserves (‘Conditions’) were prepared  
by the corresponding national design institute and were approved within the national (formerly Soviet) State Plan. The Conditions apply  
a well-defined process of classifying the specific deposit into one of five major deposit categories, subject to which, the principles for 
exploration and classification of reserves and resources have been established. The Conditions for each deposit specify the method of 
computation of reserve blocks, the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations  
which may apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present difficulties. 
Reserves and resources have been estimated by Kazakhmys LLC according to the FSU ‘Classification and Estimation Methods for Reserves 
and Resources’. It is apparent that there is now more scope than previously for flexibility and discussion with state authorities with respect to 
ore reserve estimation methods. This has been reflected in the continuing steps taken by Kazakhmys LLC to prepare the records and reserves 
development plans for the Zhezkazgan mines as computer-aided-design (CAD) files and to use these as the basis for revised estimation of 
reserves volumes and to support improved estimation of ore grades. IMC recognises this as an important step to achieve verifiable and 
internally consistent estimates.  
IMC has reviewed the reserves and resources statements of Kazakhmys LLC and has restated the reserves and resources in accordance  
with the criteria required to meet JORC standards. As a general rule, in situ tonnages quoted as balance reserves under the national system, 
and which meet criteria for categories of confidence and which can be considered to have the potential for future economic extraction,  
are assessed as resources. The Kazakhmys LLC internal reporting system derives from these resources a category designated as commercial 
reserves, on which production planning is based, estimated only from ‘active’ resources to which modifying factors for losses and dilution are 
applied. These estimates form the basis for the process of restatement of reserves in accordance with JORC compliant criteria. All reserves 
quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution. Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution and are 
inclusive of reserves. All figures in reserves and resources are in metric tonnes and are dated 31 December 2009. 
Kazakhmys Gold 
Following international convention, the Kazakhmys Gold resources reported in this document are in situ estimates, while the reserves make 
due allowance for mining recovery and dilution, based on actual operational experience in 2009 or assumptions made in feasibility studies. 
Reserves are contained within the resources.  
Kazakhmys Power 
The resources and reserves were calculated on the basis of the following set of parameters: maximum ash content of 40% and minimum  
coal seam thickness of 2 metres with a specific gravity of 1.3 and a maximum dirt parting of 1 metre, which are excluded from the calculations. 
The dilution and losses are 1.96% and 2.15% respectively with an average stripping ratio of 4:1.   www.kazakhmys.com 159

The slight decrease in reserves and resources is largely attributable to production of oxide and transitional ore from Mizek. At Mukur,  
recently established resources have made up for production in 2009. Resources at the other deposits remain unchanged since 2008,  
pending new estimates based on exploration carried out in 2009. These resource estimates are expected by mid-2010.

IMC GROUP CONSULTING LIMITED 
 
 
REVISION OF RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT TO 31 DECEMBER 2009 
IMC Group Consulting Ltd (‘IMC’) has undertaken a review of the reserves and resources estimates prepared by Kazakhmys PLC  
(the ‘Company’), as the basis for the preparation of a statement of reserves and resources as at 31 December 2009.  
Tabulations of reserves and resources, comparisons with the previous annual reserve statement and short technical descriptions,  
are provided for Kazakhmys Copper, Kazakhyms Gold and Maikuben West. 
The Statement of Reserves and Resources is restated in accordance with the criteria of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves’ (2004), published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy 
and collaborating institutions (the ‘JORC Code’). 
IMC is satisfied, from the review undertaken, that the recently revised estimates of reserves and resources prepared by the Company, is in 
accordance with the reserve classification system required by law in the Republic of Kazakhstan and that, correspondingly, the estimates  
have a consistent basis for expressing the degree of confidence for stating quantities of exploitable ore at specific grades of metal content. 
On the basis of the estimates supplied by the Company, IMC has applied the same criteria as expressed in the Competent Person’s Report  
at the time of Listing, for preparation of the restatement of reserves and resources as at 31 December 2009, in accordance with the reporting 
criteria of the JORC code. 
In previous annual statements of resources and reserves prepared by IMC, for the mature copper mining operations the policy has been 
adopted that the category of Measured Resource, and Proven Reserve, will be restricted to that ore which has been exposed or is in the 
process of development within the rolling three-year forward operations plan as formally reported to the State Reserves Committee.  
This policy has again been used for the present statement for Kazakhmys Copper operations as at 31 December 2009.

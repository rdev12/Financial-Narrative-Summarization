IN THIS REPORT KAZ Minerals is a pure-play copper company focused  
on open pit mining in Kazakhstan.
We plan to increase our copper production substantially 
over the next three years as we ramp up Bozshakol and 
complete the Aktogay project. Our assets are:
In 2015 we made significant progress in the delivery  
of our strategic goals, with the commencement of  
copper cathode production at Aktogay in December  
and the first copper concentrate output from Bozshakol 
following in February 2016.
LOW COST: Positioned in the first or second quartiles  
of the global cost curve.
LARGE SCALE: Our new open pit mines are the largest 
greenfield development projects in the CIS region and  
are amongst the largest newly developed copper deposits  
in the world. 
HIGH GROWTH: By 2018 we expect to be producing  
300 kt of copper, with 80% of this coming from the new 
projects. This represents a compound annual growth  
rate from 2015 to 2018 of more than 50%.

STRATEGIC REPORT
11 www.kazminerals.com 11 On 10 December 2015 the Group announced that Clinton Dines 
would step down from his position as a non-executive Director, 
after six years of service, with effect from 31 December 2015. 
Clinton’s knowledge of China combined with his experience of 
the global resources sector has been a great asset to the Group.
Following Clinton’s departure, John MacKenzie was appointed to 
the Audit Committee with effect from 1 January 2016. The Board 
remains fully compliant with the independence requirements of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, with a majority of 
independent non-executive Directors.
Health and safety
The Board is committed to achieving zero fatalities, so it is with 
regret that I report that three fatal incidents occurred at our 
operations during 2015, two of which involved contractors and 
one a KAZ Minerals employee. In 2014 we had seven fatalities  
at our continuing operations. The reduction in fatalities in 2015 
occurred in a period in which the total number of man-hours 
worked increased by 78% as we entered high intensity stages  
of construction at Bozshakol and Aktogay and ramped up 
production at Bozymchak. In 2016 we will continue our efforts  
to improve our safety culture. At Bozshakol and Aktogay, new 
joiners are being trained in international best practice. We will 
establish a strong safety culture at the growth projects and then 
transfer these new working methods to drive improvements in 
our existing operations.
2015 has been a difficult year for the mining industry, with 
declining commodity prices. The LME copper price ended the 
year 26% lower and the FTSE 350 mining index fell by 48%. 
The Group has, despite the challenging markets, performed well. 
Following the Restructuring in 2014, KAZ Minerals entered the 
year with a portfolio of cash generative, low-cost mines and two 
major growth projects under construction. The operating mines 
achieved their production targets and we successfully reduced 
gross cash costs. We also recorded the first copper production 
from oxide ore at the Aktogay project and commenced 
commissioning works at the Bozshakol concentrator in December, 
with the first shipment of copper concentrate to China due in 
March 2016. During 2015, KAZ Minerals has made significant 
progress towards realising its strategic objective to become a 
low-cost producer focused on large scale, open pit copper mines.
Board changes
There were three changes to the Board during 2015. As 
announced on 26 February 2015, Lord Renwick of Clifton 
stepped down from the Board following the Annual General 
Meeting on 7 May 2015. We are grateful for the immense 
contribution Robin has made to the Group since his appointment 
as a non-executive Director in 2005.
John MacKenzie was appointed as a non-executive Director  
of KAZ Minerals PLC on 1 March 2015. Prior to joining KAZ 
Minerals, John was the CEO of Copper for Anglo American and 
he brings extensive operational experience of the copper mining 
industry to the Board.
“KAZ Minerals has made significant 
progress towards realising its 
strategic objective to become a 
low-cost producer focused on large 
scale, open pit copper mines.”

Simon Heale
Chairman
12 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Environment
Copper mining and processing are energy-intensive activities  
with associated environmental impacts such as the generation  
of tailings waste, water and energy consumption and the emission 
of CO
2
. The Group seeks to minimise its impacts wherever 
possible and in 2015 they are considerably lower across many 
metrics compared to 2014 following the disposal of mining, 
smelting and power assets in the prior year. In the East Region  
we made improvements at our concentrators that reduced our 
energy consumption. The Bozshakol and Aktogay projects utilise 
modern technology that will improve our energy efficiency per 
tonne of ore processed and water recycling rates. The tailings 
waste management at our projects will also be highly efficient.
Operational and financial performance
KAZ Minerals has a strong record of operational delivery and  
I am pleased this was maintained in 2015. The East Region and 
Bozymchak reported copper cathode production of 80.7 kt, 
supported by silver, zinc and gold by-products. The East Region 
benefited from improvements made at its concentrators, raising 
recoveries and lowering reagent consumption. At Bozymchak, 
optimisation work at the concentrator was conducted in the 
fourth quarter which will enable higher output in 2016.
The East Region and Bozymchak reported a gross cash cost of 
230 USc/lb, compared to 277 USc/lb in the second half of 2014. 
The combined net cash cost was 109 USc/lb, comparable to the 
second half of 2014 as lower costs offset the impact of reduced 
by-product pricing. Weak commodity prices led to revenues of 
$665 million, $181 million below 2014. EBITDA before special 
items was $202 million. 
Major growth projects
2015 was an important year for the Group in the delivery of our 
major growth projects. Both Bozshakol and Aktogay commenced 
pre-production mining and on 1 December the Aktogay project 
started production of copper cathode from oxide ore. The 
Bozshakol project began commissioning works at its sulphide 
concentrator in December, with production of the first  
copper in concentrate from sulphide ore in February 2016. The 
commencement of copper production from two projects of this 
scale within a short timeframe is a considerable achievement and 
demonstrates the skill and determination of the Group’s 
management, employees and contractors.
Over the past few years we have assembled an internationally 
experienced operations team to manage the ramp up phase at 
Bozshakol. A timely ramp up to full capacity will deliver cash flow 
and reduce balance sheet gearing. During this growth phase the 
Group will place a high priority on maximising the benefits of the 
project to local communities in Kazakhstan through local sourcing 
and by training the next generation of employees at these 
modern facilities. 
Delivery of the main sulphide phase of the Aktogay project is our 
next major construction goal and works are currently proceeding 
on schedule to commence production in 2017. Both the 
construction and operations teams at Aktogay are benefiting 
from our experience at Bozshakol as the projects share many 
common elements of design.
“The delivery of Bozshakol has greatly 
reduced the Group’s project execution risk.”
CORPORATE VALUES
KAZ Minerals established its corporate values in 2015 as a 
restructured company. These are the principles by which we 
seek to conduct our business. They guide our decision making 
and how we monitor our performance. By upholding these 
values we will build a strong internal culture, improve 
relationships with our external stakeholders and deliver value 
to our shareholders.

64 Corporate Governance Overview
68 Governance Framework Financial position
The Group has increased its gearing during the construction of 
the two major growth projects, although the launch of Bozshakol 
at the start of 2016 and the commissioning of Aktogay in 2017  
will rapidly improve our debt metrics. The delivery of Bozshakol 
has greatly reduced the Group’s project execution risk and will 
support our financing activities in 2016. 
KAZ Minerals’ liquidity position in 2016 and 2017 has also 
benefited from the agreement reached in November 2015 
with NFC to defer the payment of $300 million in respect of 
Aktogay construction costs to 2018. The deferral of Aktogay 
payments, with no change to the project cost, demonstrates  
the strength of our relationship with NFC and continues our 
track record of securing support from our partners in China  
for KAZ Minerals’ strategically important copper projects.
OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
We are creating a new culture of safety at KAZ Minerals. 
Bozshakol and Aktogay are leading our efforts to adopt 
international best practice, with intensive training for  
new joiners. At Bozshakol over 1,000 operational staff  
have been selected and trained in safe working practices, 
including safety training specific to their roles and the 
equipment they will be operating.
The health and safety policies and procedures developed  
at Bozshakol and Aktogay will be used as the benchmark  
for the rest of the Group.
Operational safety training at Bozshakol
The Group has also built a strong track record with its lenders,  
by maintaining debt service and taking a proactive approach to  
its financing which has avoided any breach of terms in its debt 
facilities. Repayment of the CDB Bozshakol and Bozymchak 
facilities commenced in 2013 with $395 million of scheduled  
debt repayments made to date, and the Group’s PXF facility 
has been reduced from $2.1 billion in 2010 to $349 million in 
2015, including two successful refinancings in 2012 and 2014.
Dividends
The Group’s dividend policy, established at the time of Listing,  
is for the Board to consider the cash generation and financing 
requirements of the business and then recommend a suitable 
dividend. This maintains flexibility which is appropriate given the 
underlying cyclicality of a commodity business. The Group has  
a strong record of payments to shareholders with returns of 
$2,095 million in ordinary dividends, buy-backs and special 
dividends since its Listing in 2005. Given the ongoing financing 
requirements of the major growth projects during their 
construction and ramp up and the uncertain economic outlook, 
the Board does not recommend a dividend in respect of the 2015 
financial year. It is, however, the Board’s intention that the Group 
resumes dividend payments in the future, following completion  
of the major growth projects.
Outlook
As we enter 2016, the steps taken in previous years to re-position 
the business are set to deliver value to our shareholders as we are 
now a low-cost producer with excellent growth prospects. Our 
long-term financing has enabled us to continue with the execution 
of our strategy through the downturn, as we develop our 
strategic assets close to China, the world’s largest consumer  
of copper. The Group’s focus is now the ramp up of Bozshakol 
and the completion of the Aktogay sulphide project. The delivery 
of these two world class projects will enable us to de-gear the 
balance sheet and complete our transformation into a low-cost 
operator of large scale, open pit copper mines in Kazakhstan.

STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT CONTINUED Health and safety
I am disappointed to report three fatalities at our operations 
during 2015. Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees  
is our highest operational priority.
Two of the fatalities were in the East Region and one occurred  
at the Aktogay project. In 2014 we had seven fatalities at the 
continuing operations. There has been a reduction in the  
number of injuries suffered in a year in which man-hours worked 
increased by 78% as we entered a period of intense construction 
at our major projects, bringing a greater exposure to working at 
height, heavy lifting and electrical hazards.
We made significant efforts in improving our health and safety 
performance during the year, seeking to address key fatality risks 
as a matter of urgency. Reviews of our working procedures for 
underground mining, energy isolation and working at height have 
been coordinated by the Group Health and Safety team, working 
directly with site managers to establish new standards. We will 
continue to implement improvements as we seek to create a 
culture of best practice at our new projects to serve as a 
template for our other operations. 
Review of operations 
East Region and Bozymchak
The mines in the East Region and Bozymchak delivered a strong 
operational performance in 2015, achieving the guided range for 
copper cathode output with production of 80.7 kt (2014: 83.5 kt). 
Underlying copper in concentrate output was 89.4 kt, in line  
with 2014 as optimisation works in the East Region delivered 
improved concentrator recovery rates and output from 
Bozymchak ramped up.
In 2015 KAZ Minerals completed its first full year of operations 
following the Restructuring in 2014. I am pleased to report that 
significant progress was made during the year on our major 
growth projects, Bozshakol and Aktogay. In December 2015  
we began the commissioning of the Bozshakol concentrator and 
in February 2016 the project recorded its first production. The 
ramp up of Bozshakol is now underway and the mine will add  
100 kt per annum to production at a first quartile cash cost over 
the first 10 years. The oxide plant at Aktogay commenced output 
in December 2015 and we are progressing on schedule and on 
budget with the construction of the Aktogay sulphide plant.
The Group’s operating mines in the East Region and Bozymchak 
hit their production targets for the year at a net cash cost of 
109 USc/lb, placing them in the first quartile of the cash cost 
curve. This net cash cost was achieved despite weaker by-product 
prices as management delivered operational efficiencies and cost 
savings. Operating costs in US dollar terms also benefited from 
the devaluation of the tenge which occurred from 20 August 
2015. Capital expenditure was tightly controlled, with $68 million 
of sustaining capital expenditure during the year compared to  
our guidance of $80–$100 million, as spend was optimised or 
deferred where possible. 
“Our immediate priorities in 2016 
are the ramp up of Bozshakol,  
the construction of Aktogay  
and to keep operating costs  
low across the Group.”

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW Zinc in concentrate production of 94.3 kt was at the upper end of 
expectations for the year. The Group exceeded its silver granule 
production guidance by 25% with total production of 3,135 koz, 
supported by the mining of higher grade sections, improved silver 
recovery rates and a release of work in progress. Group gold bar 
production of 34.6 koz was in line with guidance issued at the half 
year. The Bozymchak mine accounted for 12.5 koz of gold bar 
production from 17.8 koz of gold in concentrate production, as 
some unprocessed metal in concentrate is carried over into 2016 
due to the timing of shipments dispatched in December. New 
equipment was installed at Bozymchak in the fourth quarter  
of 2015 to optimise production, which will increase copper  
and gold output from the mine in 2016.
Bozshakol construction
On 1 1 December 2015 we announced that commissioning works 
at the Bozshakol sulphide concentrator had commenced with 
production of copper concentrate following in February 2016. 
This major milestone was achieved despite a number of 
challenges faced during the year, including a fire in the main 
concentrator building which damaged equipment in the grinding 
area. There were no resulting injuries and the project team  
was able to recover from this event quickly, using replacement 
parts transferred from Aktogay. The ramp up of production at 
Bozshakol in 2016 will include the completion and commissioning 
of the separate 5 MT per annum clay plant. A review of the 
remaining works has led to a reduction in the project budget  
of $50 million, with the final $270 million of the $2,150 million 
project to be incurred in 2016.
Bozshakol operations
Pre-production mining operations began at Bozshakol in May 
2015 to expose sulphide sections ahead of the commissioning  
of the main concentrator, with 6,567 kt of clay ore and 532 kt  
of sulphide ore removed and stockpiled by the end of the year. 
The sulphide concentrator commenced processing material in 
February 2016, with the first shipment of copper concentrate 
expected to be dispatched to Chinese smelters in March 2016.
Aktogay construction
Construction of the oxide section of the Aktogay project  
was completed in December 2015. The construction of the 
sulphide plant has also progressed well during the year, with the 
foundations for the primary crusher and conveyor now complete. 
The external cladding of the sulphide concentrator building was 
installed ahead of the onset of cold weather so that construction 
could continue inside the building throughout the winter. The 
assembly of the mills and the installation of flotation cells are now 
ongoing. Parts and equipment have been delivered to replace the 
items that were sent to Bozshakol to assist with fire repairs and 
the sulphide section of the project remains on track to commence 
production in 2017. Capital expenditure of $280 million is 
expected in 2016 following the agreement with NFC to defer 
$300 million of construction costs to 2018.
Aktogay operations
Pre-production mining operations commenced at Aktogay in June 
2015. By the year end, 3,003 kt of oxide ore had been mined and 
placed on pads. Leach irrigation began on 26 September 2015  
and on 1 December 2015 the project produced its first copper 
cathode in the SX/EW processing facility. The cathode from 
the oxide operations is of high purity. 
Production outlook
East Region and Bozymchak copper production will benefit  
from a full year of contribution from the ramped up Bozymchak 
project in 2016; however, this will be offset by the expected 
closure of the Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky mine during the year  
and ventilation shaft maintenance works at Orlovsky in the 
second half. The Group therefore expects to produce 70-75 kt  
of copper cathode from its East Region and Bozymchak mines. 
Zinc production will decline to 70-75 kt of zinc in concentrate  
as mining at Artemyevsky moves through a low zinc grade zone 
ahead of its mine extension project and as output from Orlovsky 
is reduced due to mine maintenance. Silver granule production  
is expected to reduce to 2,250-2,500 koz due to lower grades  
at Irtyshsky and the maintenance works at Orlovsky. East Region 
and Bozymchak gold bar production is expected to increase  
to 40-50 koz as the optimisation works at Bozymchak raise  
overall throughput. 
The Bozshakol mine is expected to produce 45-65 kt of  
copper cathode equivalent and 50-70 koz of gold bar equivalent, 
dependent on the speed of ramp up. We expect to declare  
the project commercial during 2016 which is considered to  
be operating at in excess of 60% of design capacity for three 
consecutive months. 
At Aktogay the oxide operations are expected to ramp up  
quickly to capacity, producing 15 kt of copper cathode in 2016.
The total aggregate Group copper cathode equivalent production 
in 2016 is therefore expected to be between 130 and 155 kt and 
Group gold bar equivalent production is expected to be between 
90 and 120 koz.
Financial performance
Revenues declined in 2015 to $665 million (2014: $846 million) 
largely as a result of lower metal prices in 2015. 
Sales from own production were 78.6 kt, below production levels 
due to a build-up of finished goods inventory at the end of the 
year and the exclusion of 0.9 kt of sales volumes from Bozymchak, 
which occurred during the pre-commercial production phase in 
the first half of the year.
16 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED The Group’s cash costs were reduced in 2015 following 
management actions taken in the East Region operations  
and the devaluation of the tenge from 20 August, which further 
contributed to lowering the cash costs in US dollar terms during 
the final four months of the year. Net cash costs benefited  
in 2015 from the contribution of Bozymchak, which has a high 
gold by-product credit and achieved full year net cash costs of 
40 USc/lb. By-product credits fell as a result of lower zinc, silver 
and gold prices and a reduction in zinc and silver production 
compared to the prior year. 
Gross cash costs for the East Region and Bozymchak in 2015 
were 230 USc/lb, a 17% reduction compared to the gross cash 
cost of 277 USc/lb in the second half of 2014, during which period 
the East Region began to operate as a stand-alone business. Net 
cash costs for the East Region and Bozymchak operations were 
109 USc/lb, in line with the 107 USc/lb reported for the second 
half of 2014. In 2016, per unit gross cash costs in the East Region 
and Bozymchak are expected to face upward pressure due to  
a full year contribution from Bozymchak (which has higher gross 
cash costs), reduced production volumes and local inflation. 
However, the full year effect of a weaker tenge in 2016 is 
expected to result in a gross cash cost for the East Region  
and Bozymchak of between 200 and 220 USc/lb.
Following the movements in the exchange rate of the tenge 
against the US dollar we have reviewed the unit cost guidance  
for our major growth projects. The guidance provided  
is a 10 year average (in 2016 terms) and the benefit from the 
weaker tenge is partially offset by lower by-product pricing  
and future inflationary pressures. Bozshakol is now expected  
to achieve net cash costs of 70-90 USc/lb and Aktogay  
100-120 USc/lb.
EBITDA (excluding special items) of $202 million declined 
compared to $355 million from continuing operations in the prior 
year as the lower costs in 2015 were not sufficient to offset the 
impact of reduced metals prices. 
Sustaining capital expenditure was limited to $68 million as some 
investments were carried forward into 2016. Despite the lower 
revenues, the reduction in costs and management of sustaining 
capital expenditure led to a Free Cash Flow before interest of 
$2 million in 2015.
Sustaining capital expenditure in 2016 is budgeted to be between 
$80 and $90 million for the East Region and Bozymchak. 
Expansionary capital expenditure of $20 million is planned for 
2016 at the Artemyevsky mine in the East Region to continue  
the development of a new section of the mine.
Financial position
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had significant committed 
liquidity, including $1,251 million of gross funds and $250 million  
of undrawn debt facilities. The Group’s net debt position was 
$2,253 million at the year end. The recent commencement of 
production at Bozshakol has expanded the financing options 
available to the Group.
Outlook
Having commenced production from both of our major growth 
projects, our immediate priorities in 2016 are to expedite the 
ramp up of Bozshakol, to progress the construction of Aktogay 
and to keep operating costs low across the Group. We are 
confident in the medium-term outlook for copper due to both 
industry supply challenges and future demand growth, with 
copper an essential part of a greener economy. KAZ Minerals  
is positioned to deliver the highest production growth in the 
sector from its portfolio of first and second quartile assets.

This is a measure of the underlying 
profitability of the Group, widely 
used in the mining sector.
How we measure 
EBITDA is earnings before interest, 
taxation, the non-cash component 
of the disability benefits obligation, 
depreciation, depletion, 
amortisation and mineral extraction 
tax, as adjusted for special items. 
2015 performance
EBITDA (excluding special items) 
for 2015 of $202 million declined 
by $153 million compared to the 
continuing operations EBITDA in 
2014, reflecting the 21% reduction 
in revenues in 2015. The Group’s 
realised prices for all metals 
declined in 2015, including a 22% 
lower realised price for copper.
The decline in revenues was 
partially mitigated by a 6% decrease 
in cash operating costs resulting 
from the ongoing cost control 
initiatives and the weakening of the 
tenge in the second half of the year. 
Relevance 
Monitors Group cash flows used  
to fund returns to shareholders, 
reduce debt and invest in the 
future growth and development  
of the business.
How we measure
Net cash flow from operating 
activities before capital expenditure 
and non-current VAT associated 
with expansionary and new projects 
less sustaining capital expenditure.
2015 performance
Group Free Cash Flow for the year 
was $114 million below 2014 as a 
$354 million reduction in Group 
EBITDA, including EBITDA 
from disposed assets in the prior 
year, was partially mitigated by 
$233 million in lower capital 
expenditure and $48 million and 
$15 million reductions in MET  
and income tax paid, respectively. 
The negative $145 million Free 
Cash Flow in 2015 is after the 
deduction of $147 million of 
interest payments (2014: 
$150 million) principally incurred 
financing the development of  
the major growth projects. 
Relevance
EPS based on Underlying Profit  
can be used as an indication of 
profits available to shareholders  
for distribution or retention in  
the business. 
How we measure
Profit before special items and 
other non-recurring or variable 
non-trading items, and their 
resulting taxation impact, divided  
by the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year.
2015 performance
Underlying EPS from continuing 
operations was a loss of $0.02 per 
share. Underlying Profit from 
continuing operations fell from 
$86 million in 2014 to a loss of 
$10 million in 2015, impacted 
by the lower EBITDA and foreign 
exchange losses arising from the 
devaluation of the Kyrgyz som and 
the Kazakh tenge during 2015. 
The Group is expected to return  
to earnings growth in 2016 with  
the ramp up of operations at 
Aktogay oxide and Bozshakol 
sulphide plants.

This KPI should be considered 
alongside other measures including 
production costs and maintenance 
spend, to ensure extraction  
is valuable. 
How we measure
Kilotonnes of ore extracted from 
our mining operations.
2015 performance
Ore output in 2015 has seen a 
three-fold increase compared to 
output from continuing operations 
in 2014 as Bozshakol and Aktogay 
mining operations commenced. 
There was 3,003 kt of ore 
extracted at Aktogay oxide and 
placed on heap leach pads and 
7,099 kt from Bozshakol has been 
stockpiled in 2015 to be processed 
at the sulphide and clay plants in 
2016. Ore extraction at the East 
Region and Bozymchak mines has 
remained in line with expectations, 
but was marginally below extraction 
from continuing operations in the 
prior year. 
Ore output will continue to 
increase in 2016 with a full year  
of ore extraction anticipated for 
Bozshakol and Aktogay oxide.

This measures the performance  
of the Group in maintaining its  
low-cost base whilst maximising 
revenues through the sale of 
by-products. 
How we measure
The total of cash operating costs 
excluding purchased copper 
products less by-product revenues, 
divided by the volume of copper 
cathode equivalent sales. 
2015 performance 
The cash cost of copper sold after 
by-product credits for 2015 of  
109 USc/lb was above the 
continuing operations net cash  
cost in 2014, reflecting the decline 
in by-product revenues in 2015 
resulting from the fall in commodity 
prices during the year. 
Excluding the impact of by-product 
credits, the Group’s gross cash cost 
in 2015 of 230 USc/lb has reduced 
compared to 257 USc/lb from the 
East Region in 2014 or 277 USc/lb 
in the second half of 2014 when 
the East Region operated 
independently of the Disposal 
Assets. Cost saving initiatives  
and the beneficial impact of the 
weakening of the tenge following 
the currency’s transition to free 
float in August 2015 have led to  
a lower gross cash cost.
Relevance 
Copper, the Group’s principal 
product, represents 69% of 
revenue and is the main  
operational indicator. 
How we measure
Copper cathode equivalent 
produced from own ore either  
as refined copper cathodes or  
as recoverable copper in 
concentrate or residues sold.
2015 performance
Cathode equivalent production  
in 2015 was consistent with 
production from continuing 
operations in 2014. The first 
production from Aktogay oxide 
was received in December 2015 
with a contribution of 0.4 kt of 
cathode. Bozymchak produced 
2.2 kt of copper cathode, with  
the project achieving commercial 
production on 1 July 2015. 
East Region cathode output has 
fallen by 6% from 83.5 kt in 2014 
to 78.5 kt in 2015 with capacity 
constraints at the Balkhash smelter 
leading to a build-up of work in 
progress at the end of the year.
Relevance
Indicates how much cash flow  
is required to maintain current 
output and how efficient we are  
at controlling capital expenditure. 
How we measure
Sustaining capital expenditure  
for our mining operations, divided 
by copper cathode equivalent 
production volumes.
2015 performance
Maintenance spend per tonne  
of cathode has increased by  
$196 per tonne compared to 
continuing operations maintenance 
spend in 2014. 
East Region and Bozymchak 
sustaining capital expenditure of 
$67 million increased by $14 million 
compared to 2014, but was below 
the guided range of $80 million  
to $100 million. The downturn in 
commodity prices has resulted in 
capital expenditure being deferred 
where possible.
Work has continued on two 
significant optimisation projects: the 
modernisation of the Nikolayevsky 
concentrator, expected to be 
completed in the first half of 2016, 
and construction of a railway line 
between the Artemyevsky mine 
and the Nikolayevsky concentrator, 
which is expected to be finished  
in 2017.

occurring from an occupational 
injury or disease at the Group’s 
operations during the year. The 
definition of an occupational fatality 
is taken from the ICMM health  
and safety performance indicators 
published in January 2014, which 
the Group has adopted in 2015  
to further align its health and safety 
performance KPIs with those of  
its peers.

2015 performance
Three fatalities occurred in 2015, 
one of which involved an employee 
in the East Region and two involved 
contractors, one in the East Region 
and the second at the Aktogay 
project. Three fatalities in 2015 
compares to seven fatalities in  
the continuing operations in 2014, 
and 14 for the full Group in 2014
1
. 
KAZ Minerals considers all fatalities 
to be avoidable and has a target of 
zero fatalities. 
The reduction in fatalities for 
continuing operations has 
occurred in a period in which the 
number of man-hours worked 
increased by 78%, from 23 million 
in 2014 to 41 million in 2015. The 
rate of fatal incidents per million 
hours worked in the continuing 
operations has therefore reduced 
from 0.29 in 2014 to 0.07 in 2015, 
which compares to the ICMM 
average fatality rate per million 
hours worked for 2014 of 0.02. 
Relevance
TRIFR measures the frequency of 
occupational injuries occurring at 
the Group’s operations and is 
therefore a key indicator of 
our health and safety performance. 
How we measure
The number of Total Recordable 
Injury (TRI) cases occurring for 
every million man-hours worked 
during the year. The definitions  
of TRI and TRIFR are taken from 
the ICMM health and safety 
performance indicators published  
in January 2014 which include new 
injury cases of sufficient severity 
that require medical treatment 
beyond first aid or result in the 
worker’s inability to perform his  
or her routine work function on 
the next calendar day.
Historically, the Group reported 
injury rates as LTIFR (lost time 
injury frequency rate). Following 
the adoption of the ICMM 
indicators, the Group has restated 
its injury statistics for 2014 to 
TRIFR. The definition of injuries 
under TRIFR is wider than under 
LTIFR as it includes injuries which 
did not result in lost time, resulting 
in a higher rate under the new KPI. 
2015 performance
There were 51 TRI cases in 2015, a 
reduction of 36% compared to 80 
in 2014 from continuing operations. 
The TRIFR has fallen significantly 
from 3.48 for the continuing 
operations in 2014 to 1.25 in 2015 
as the reduction in the absolute 
number of injuries has been 
achieved in a year in which there 
has been a 78% increase in the 
number of man-hours worked. 
13C represents continuing operations only in 2013. 
14C represents continuing operations only in 2014.
1 2014 Annual Report and Accounts stated six fatalities from continuing operations and 13 in the full Group. One fatality in 2014 had been initially assessed as due to natural 
causes but has been subsequently reclassified as work-related.
2 ICMM definitions for TRIFR were adopted by the Group in 2015. The 2014 TRIFR for continuing operations has been estimated by applying the new injury definition  
to available historic data.

STRATEGIC REPORT KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS CONTINUED Effective risk management is of critical importance 
for the operation of our business, shaping the 
Group’s strategy and protecting its stakeholders.
Further details of the Group’s approach to internal control are  
set out in the Governance Framework report on pages 73 and 74.
Risk management framework
The Group operates a formal and rigorous risk management 
framework, designed to ensure that risks are clearly identified, 
effectively managed and continually monitored.
Under this framework, risk profiling exercises are undertaken by 
operating businesses, and at division and Group level, to identify, 
evaluate and control risk. The Group Risk Manager coordinates 
the risk assessments and identification activities, as well as 
facilitating the development of appropriate responses to identified 
risks. The Board and its committees are provided with detailed 
information to ensure that they are aware of the risks to the 
business and their respective responsibilities are set out opposite:
EFFECTIVE
RISK MANAGEMENT
• The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and 
determines the Group’s risk strategy, assessing the balance of  
risk necessary for the Group to carry out its business successfully 
and to achieve its strategic goals.

RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Identification of principal risks
Through the risk management framework, the Group’s principal 
risks are identified and each risk is assessed according to the 
potential severity of its effect and the likelihood of occurrence. 
The principal risks are placed on to the Group risk map and this is 
regularly reviewed by the Board and Audit Committee to ensure 
that continual monitoring and appropriate mitigating actions are in 
place and that these risks continue to be accurately represented 
on the Group risk map. There are other risks which have been 
identified by management but are not considered to be principal 
risks at the current time. These risks are also continually assessed 
and monitored by management.
A description of our principal risks, including impact and mitigating 
actions, can be found on pages 26 to 34.
Viability statement
The Board has conducted an assessment of the Group’s viability 
for the three years to 31 December 2018. The Board considers 
that the timeframe chosen for the viability assessment is 
appropriate as it covers the period when the Group’s gearing 
metrics are expected to peak with the development of the 
Bozshakol and Aktogay projects. The major growth projects are 
also expected to ramp up output over this period and therefore 
the Group’s exposure to liquidity and project delivery risks should 
reduce substantially by the end of the assessment period.
The Board also considers the viability assessment period  
to be appropriate due to the current uncertainties in the  
global economic outlook which limits the reliability of a  
longer-term assessment.
Principal risks facing the Group
For the purposes of reviewing the Group’s viability outlook, the 
Board has considered all the principal risks set out on pages 26  
to 34 but has focused on the following principal risks which could 
alone or in conjunction have a material impact on profitability, 
cash flows, liquidity and the available mitigation options over the 
assessment period:
Commodity prices
• A sustained low commodity price environment would impact  
the Group’s financial outlook.
New projects
• The major growth projects may fail to ramp up output and/or 
achieve the operating parameters as planned. 
Foreign exchange and inflation risk
• A significant appreciation of the KZT/$ exchange rate from its 
current level or increased inflation in Kazakhstan could have a 
material impact on operating costs.
Liquidity risk
• Non-compliance with financial covenants could result in 
borrowing facilities becoming uncommitted and repayable if 
negotiations with the banks were unsuccessful. A faster than 
expected normalisation of US interest rates would also impact 
the Group’s financial outlook.
Process to assess the Group’s prospects 
The Board has performed their viability assessment based on  
the Group’s five-year plan which is prepared from the annual 
budgeting process, individual project plans and existing mine 
operational life of mine (LOM) plans. These LOM plans reflect  
the expected production profile and related operational cost 
structures of the assets over their expected economic life. 
The key assumptions made in the viability assessment are based 
on externally sourced views on commodity pricing, exchange  
rate and inflation. As part of the viability assessment, the Board 
has considered the key assumptions and is satisfied that they  
are appropriate. The exchange rate and inflation assumptions  
are also consistent with those used by management in testing the 
Group’s assets for impairment, where such tests are performed, 
as disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The five-year plan is regularly reviewed by the Board along  
with the Group’s operational plans, capital plans, financing 
requirements and external market factors. In reviewing and 
considering management’s forecast and strategy, the Board  
takes into account the principal risks facing the Group, which  
are assessed on a regular basis.

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
24 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW CONTINUED When making the viability assessment the Board considered  
the current status of the major growth projects, in particular the 
commencement of concentrate production at Bozshakol and its 
expected ramp up and the progress being made on developing 
the Aktogay project. 
To reflect the principal risks which could have a material impact 
on the Group’s viability over the three-year period, the plan was 
subjected to stress testing and sensitivity analysis. The analysis 
considered severe scenarios but not those the Board considered 
to be implausible and included:
• upside and downside commodity prices;
• a stronger KZT/$ exchange rate, higher cost inflation and  
higher US interest rates; and
• lower than planned output at the Bozshakol and  
Aktogay operations.
Confirmation of longer-term viability 
The Group has a strong competitive position and, once the 
Bozshakol and Aktogay mines are in full production, will be a large 
scale and low-cost producer of copper. This makes the Group an 
attractive investment opportunity both for debt providers and 
equity investors over the long term.
As detailed in the ‘Going concern’ section in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 1 15, the Group’s  
PXF and CAT debt facilities are subject to certain financial 
covenants, in particular the net debt to EBITDA covenant  
which is suspended until 1 July 2016. In the absence of a material 
improvement in commodity prices, or a waiver from the banks, 
the net debt to EBITDA covenant will be breached when tested 
for the period ending 31 December 2016. This is largely as a result 
of the current low commodity prices and the timing of the ramp 
up of production from Bozshakol. 
Based on discussions with its banks, the Board is confident that 
the banks will view favourably a waiver or temporary suspension 
request of such a technical covenant breach, provided the 
Group’s debt service obligations are maintained. This conclusion  
is supported by the short-term nature of the breach as well as  
the quality of the Group’s business as described above. Consistent 
with the going concern analysis, the Board’s evaluation therefore 
assumes that the existing debt facilities continue throughout the 
viability assessment period.
Should commodity prices gradually recover in line with analysts 
consensus, but there are short-term delays in the ramp up of the 
major growth projects and/or operating costs are higher than 
expected, the Group has mitigating actions available that should 
provide adequate liquidity throughout the viability assessment 
period. The mitigating actions include the postponement of 
capital expenditure and increasing available financing facilities, 
which the Board is confident can be achieved given the quality  
of the Group’s business as described above. 
In a severe downside scenario where commodity prices do not 
recover from current levels and/or there are delays in the ramp 
up of the major growth projects and/or operating costs are 
higher than expected, the scale of mitigating actions would need 
to increase further and/or other types of action may need to be 
taken. The Board believes it is unlikely, although not implausible, 
that these circumstances will occur due to the finely balanced 
copper market and the current status of the major growth 
projects. However, in such a scenario a major restructuring  
of the Group’s debt facilities and/or other new sources of 
financing would be required to provide sufficient liquidity  
over the viability assessment period. 
While there are scenarios which could negatively impact the 
Group’s liquidity, after a robust assessment of the principal  
risks, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity, the Board believes  
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able  
to manage its liquidity risks in order to continue in operation  
and meet its liabilities as they fall due throughout the period  
to 31 December 2018.

STRATEGIC REPORT
25 MANAGING
OUR RISKS
 OPERATIONAL RISKS
Health and safety
Description
Mining is a hazardous industry with 
inherent risks and the failure to adopt  
and embed health and safety management 
systems could result in harm to the 
Group’s employees, contractors or local 
communities as well as fines and penalties 
and damage to its reputation.
Impact
Health and safety incidents could lead  
to a number of adverse consequences, 
including harm to people, as well as 
production disruption, financial loss and 
reputational damage. Reputational damage 
could negatively impact KAZ Minerals’
ability to attract and retain employees, 
affect its standing in the local community 
and its relations with the Government 
and reduce access to finance 
and attractiveness to investors.
Action
KAZ Minerals recognises that the highest 
standards of health and safety practices 
are vital to its success and are a key 
responsibility of all employees. The 
Group’s goal is for zero fatalities and  
to minimise the number of health and 
safety incidents. The Group’s policies and 
procedures in these areas are designed to 
identify relevant risks and opportunities
and provide a clear framework for 
conducting business. Significant investment 
is being made into the health and safety 
practices at the open pit mines and 
modern processing facilities at Bozshakol 
and Aktogay which will ramp up 
operations during 2016. These open  
pit mines will provide inherently safer 
operating environments for employees. 
Further details of the measures being 
taken to improve health and safety 
practices, including the work of the 
Group’s HSE function, are set out in  
the Corporate Responsibility report 
commencing on page 55.
The principal risks identified by KAZ Minerals are those that could materially affect the Group’s financial 
condition, performance, strategy and prospects. There may be other risks unknown, or currently believed 
immaterial by the Group, which might become material. 
A new principal risk has been added during the year in relation to foreign exchange and inflation. The 
Kazakhstan tenge moved to a free float against the US dollar in August 2015, which resulted in the tenge 
devaluing significantly against the US dollar, increasing foreign exchange volatility and the possibility of 
higher domestic inflation. The principal risks relating to employees and suppliers and contractors have  
been updated as inflationary pressures could increase costs. In addition, the commodity prices and the 
liquidity risks have been impacted by the falls in commodity prices during 2015. The Group’s exposure  
to China risk has been updated to reflect the production of copper concentrate from the growth projects 
which will be sold to China.
The principal risks set out below are not in order of likelihood of occurrence or materiality and should be 
viewed, as with any forward-looking statements in this document, with regard to the cautionary statement  
on page 180.
26 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS Political
Description
The Group’s mining operations and 
development projects are all based  
in Kazakhstan, except the Bozymchak 
mine, which is located in Kyrgyzstan.  
The Group’s operational and financial 
performance is impacted by the social, 
political, economic, legal and fiscal 
conditions prevailing in both countries.
Impact
Changes to foreign trade (export and 
import), foreign investments, property, 
tax, environmental and subsoil use 
regimes, social responsibility expectations 
or other changes that affect the business 
environment in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan 
could negatively affect the Group’s 
business, financial position and 
performance and decisions on future 
investments. The changes may also lead  
to reputational damage, in particular  
with investors, and potentially the loss  
of licences to operate.
Action
KAZ Minerals maintains a proactive 
dialogue with the governments of both 
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan across a range 
of issues, including subsoil use regulations, 
taxation, the environment and social 
responsibility and community relations. 
The Government of Kazakhstan has 
actively pursued a programme of 
economic reform, helping to make  
it one of the most politically stable  
and economically developed countries in 
Central Asia. Political, legal and regulatory 
developments affecting the existing 
operations and projects are monitored 
closely and lobbying is conducted where 
appropriate. The Board continues to  
view the political, social and economic 
environment within Kazakhstan  
favourably and, looking forward,  
remains optimistic about the  
conditions for business in the region.
 OPERATIONAL RISKS CONTINUED
Business interruption
Description
The Group’s mining and processing 
operations are resource intensive, and 
could be subject to a number of risks, 
including, but not limited to: geological  
and technological challenges; weather and 
other natural phenomena such as floods 
and earthquakes; fires and explosions; 
failures to critical machinery with long lead 
times for replacement; delays in supplies  
or services; and loss or interruption to key 
inputs such as electricity and water. Any  
of these factors could result in prolonged 
shutdowns or periods of reduced 
production from the Group’s mines  
and concentrators. 
Impact
Any disruption to operational activities 
could have a negative impact on the 
Group’s profitability and cash flows, may 
require the Group to incur unplanned 
capital expenditure for repair and 
replacement, may result in harm to people 
and may cause environmental damage. 
Business interruption could result in the 
loss of customers, affect growth prospects 
and lead to reputational damage.
Action
Work is undertaken across the Group, 
with the support of appropriate in-house 
and third-party specialists, to manage 
operational risks. The Group maintains  
its equipment and facilities and regularly 
inspects the condition of its facilities. The 
Group’s operational assets are in areas 
which have low earthquake and flood risk 
ratings. The Group is reliant on a relatively 
small number of operating assets, which 
increases the impact of business 
disruption. However, the operating  
assets are geographically diversified,  
which potentially mitigates a single  
incident causing widespread disruption 
across the operations. 
A combined property damage and 
business interruption catastrophic 
insurance programme is in place which  
can provide protection from some of the 
financial loss arising from a major incident 
at the Group’s concentrating facilities or  
an incident at a facility of a key external 
supplier. Should a major outage occur at 
the Balkhash smelter where the Group’s 
concentrate from the East Region and 
Bozymchak is currently processed into 
copper cathode, gold bar and silver 
granule, the Group believes it could sell 
concentrate directly to customers. Risk 
engineers conduct inspections of the 
Group’s key processing assets to assess  
the key risks and provide recommendations 
to management for improvements.

45 Financial Review  OPERATIONAL RISKS CONTINUED
New projects
Description
The development of new projects involves 
many risks including geological, engineering, 
procurement, staffing, financing and 
regulatory risks. If the Group fails to adopt 
an appropriate procurement and project 
management strategy it may experience 
delays to project schedules and an increase 
in development costs. Regulatory risks 
include failures to obtain and maintain 
applicable permits, licences or approvals 
from the relevant authorities to perform 
certain development work. These risks  
will increase in 2016 during the ramp  
up of the Bozshakol and Aktogay oxide 
projects as equipment is commissioned 
and operating practices established. The 
speed of ramp up is dependent on the 
successful start-up and operation of 
equipment and the performance of 
suppliers and the workforce.
Impact
Projects may fail to achieve the desired 
economic returns due to an inability  
to recover mineral resources, failure to 
achieve expected operating parameters, 
and as a result of the capital or operating 
costs of the projects being higher than 
expected. Design or construction 
deficiencies could result in projects being 
delayed, or failing to complete. These 
factors could result in additional rework 
costs and delays to cash flows which could 
affect the Group’s liquidity and financial 
results. A reduction in future production 
volumes would also increase the cash cost 
on a per unit basis. In addition, a lack of 
available funding may prevent or delay  
the completion of projects.
Action
Prior to an investment decision being 
made, certain evaluation activities are 
performed including, where appropriate, 
feasibility and other technical studies. 
Significant projects are subject to the 
Group’s capital appraisal process, including 
Board review and approval as they 
progress. There are also a number of 
planning and monitoring procedures  
in place addressing the management of 
capital expenditure within the Group.  
The Group ensures that sufficient 
expertise, from both in-house and 
third-party specialists, is utilised on 
projects throughout their life cycle.
The Bozshakol and Aktogay major growth 
projects have been designed using modern 
equipment which is proven technology  
and the Group has in place a specialised 
internal project management team with 
significant international mining experience. 
The Group is also utilising the services  
of Non Ferrous China, primarily for the 
construction and commissioning of the 
Bozshakol sulphide and clay processing 
plants. Non Ferrous China is also 
constructing and commissioning the 
sulphide processing plant at Aktogay with 
the other sections of the project divided 
between several smaller contractors.  
A Projects Assurance Committee has 
been established to regularly assess  
the operational and financial status  
of the projects to identify and manage  
any material risks to a successful 
commissioning. In respect of project 
funding, committed financing is in place  
for Bozshakol and Aktogay. Details of  
the current status of the major growth 
projects is included in the Operating 
Review on pages 43 and 44.
28 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED Suppliers and contractors
Description
The Group relies on services and materials 
provided by external suppliers and 
contractors. Smelting, electricity supply, 
shaft sinking, auxiliary construction and 
maintenance services may be provided  
by the Disposal Assets, owned by Cuprum 
Holding, a related party. As these suppliers 
are not owned by KAZ Minerals, there  
can be no guarantee that these services  
or other services sourced externally will 
be provided to the standards required by 
the Group and will not be subject to delay, 
interruption or periods of non-availability. 
In periods of increased demand, supplies 
may not always be readily available which 
can result in an increase in lead times and 
cost inflation for raw materials and items 
such as mining and processing equipment. 
The Group is reliant on the services of 
specialist contractors for the development 
and commissioning of the major growth 
projects. KAZ Minerals also requires 
transportation and logistics providers  
to move production materials and  
finished goods.
Impact
If there is any interruption to the supply  
of: mining equipment; materials; smelting; 
electricity supply and transmission;  
shaft sinking and auxiliary construction; 
transportation; and maintenance services 
then this may have a negative effect on  
the Group’s financial position and ability  
to operate effectively and future 
performance. Inflation in services, mining 
equipment and supplies will increase 
operating and capital costs which will  
affect the Group’s financial performance, 
and these factors together may impact  
the economic viability of certain mines  
and projects. Disruption of operations  
or increased costs could arise if key 
contractors are unable to provide services. 
Failing to properly manage related party 
transactions could result in litigation, 
regulatory censure and reputational 
damage for the Group. The actions  
of suppliers and contractors could give  
rise to reputational damage and potential 
liabilities for the Group.
Action
The performance of the Balkhash smelter 
is closely monitored and, whilst it is not  
as financially attractive, the concentrate 
from the East Region could be shipped  
to China for processing, should a significant 
outage occur at the smelter. The Group 
has appointed alternative suppliers for a 
number of services previously provided  
by Cuprum Holding and will continue to 
encourage multiple suppliers to bid for 
tenders to create competition where 
appropriate. The Group also actively 
monitors the market for mining equipment 
and supplies to remain competitive in  
the procurement of mining equipment  
and supplies. The Group ensures  
that appropriate monitoring and  
disclosure procedures are in place  
for related party transactions. 
Employees
Description
The Group’s future development will be 
partly dependent on its ability to attract 
and retain highly skilled and qualified 
personnel. KAZ Minerals competes against 
local and international mining and industrial 
companies to attract skilled personnel into 
the business. The remote location of some 
of the Group’s operations also makes the 
attraction and retention of skilled staff at 
these sites more challenging. The hiring 
and training of skilled personnel is 
important for the successful operation  
of the Bozshakol and Aktogay projects.
Impact
Labour productivity, skill levels, efficiency 
and turnover may have a direct influence 
on the Group’s ability to provide a safe  
and efficient working environment and 
to fulfil its production plan and financial 
performance. The ability to attract, train 
and retain skilled staff for the Bozshakol 
and Aktogay operations teams may 
directly affect the ramp up of operations, 
operating performance, financial results 
and projected cash flows. A shortage of 
skilled employees could increase the 
Group’s operating costs as wages are 
raised to recruit the required staff. 
However, in the current commodity price 
environment recruitment conditions for 
internationally experienced mining staff 
are expected to be more favourable.
Action
The Group actively monitors the market 
to remain competitive in the hiring of staff. 
KAZ Minerals has an extensive social 
benefits programme for its employees  
and their dependants and invests in 
training facilities and staff development  
to raise skill levels. Providing employees 
with a safe working environment is also a 
fundamental priority. Active engagement 
ensures a good relationship is maintained 
with labour unions. The Bozshakol and 
Aktogay operations teams have a detailed 
recruitment and training plan, which is 
currently being implemented. International 
workers with appropriate expertise  
have been employed during the initial 
operational years of the projects to assist 
the successful ramp up of the operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT
29  OPERATIONAL RISKS CONTINUED
Labour and community relations
Description
Many of the Group’s employees are 
represented by labour unions under 
various collective labour agreements. 
Negotiation of wages may become more 
difficult in times of higher commodity 
prices or higher domestic inflation as 
labour unions may seek wage increases 
and additional forms of compensation.  
The recent sharp moves in the tenge  
US dollar exchange rate have increased 
the uncertainty over future wage 
negotiation. The Group’s employees may 
seek wage increases outside the collective 
labour agreements and labour agreements 
may not prevent a strike or work 
stoppage. Labour unions may resist 
measures to raise labour efficiency.
The Group currently operates in areas  
of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan where it  
is a major employer and may also provide 
targeted support to the local community. 
Community expectations are typically 
complex with the potential for different  
and varying views by stakeholders that  
may be difficult to resolve. Industrial 
accidents, health and safety and 
environmental incidents may negatively 
affect the Group’s community relationships.
Impact
Poor employee relations influenced by 
internal and external factors could result 
in an unstable workforce that disrupts 
operations or seeks wage increases and 
other forms of compensation, having a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial performance. Community 
disputes, local strikes or other forms of 
collective protest could disrupt operations 
and result in lower production volumes 
and an increase in operating costs. 
The dependence of certain communities 
on the Group for employment and the 
provision of services may impose 
restrictions on the Group’s flexibility in 
taking certain operating decisions and 
could have a material adverse effect  
on the Group’s financial position.  
Failure to manage relationships with  
local communities, government and 
non-governmental organisations may 
disrupt operations and negatively affect 
the Group’s reputation as well as its ability 
to bring projects into operation. Support 
provided to communities may adversely 
impact the Group’s cash flows.
Action
A full engagement strategy with 
community representatives, unions and 
employees operates within the Group 
which aims to address concerns raised  
by different stakeholders. The Group  
first seeks to identify and minimise any 
potentially negative operational impacts 
and risks through responsible behaviour 
and acting transparently, prioritising  
the health and safety of its workers, 
environmental compliance, promoting 
dialogue and complying with 
commitments. Action has been taken  
to protect workers from some of the 
impact of the decline in the tenge value to 
the US dollar. The Group also has a social 
programme for its employees and their 
dependants and works closely with local 
authorities on social matters. Bozshakol 
and Aktogay are in remote locations  
and therefore community relations risk  
is reduced. Further details of the Group’s 
social programme are set out in the 
Corporate Responsibility report 
commencing on page 55.
Reserves and resources
Description
KAZ Minerals’ ore reserves for operating 
mines and development projects are 
largely based on the estimation method 
for reserves and resources established  
by the former Soviet Union. There are 
numerous uncertainties inherent in 
estimating ore reserves and geological, 
technical and economic assumptions that 
were valid at the time of estimation may 
change significantly when new information 
becomes available.
Impact
Changes in ore reserves and mineral 
resources could adversely impact mine 
plans and the economic viability of 
development projects resulting in 
economic losses, negatively impacting  
the Group’s financial position and 
performance. The Group is dependent on 
production from a relatively small number 
of mines and the confirmation of reserves 
at each mine is critical to future 
production levels.
Action
The Group’s ore reserves and mineral 
resources are published in accordance 
with the criteria of the JORC Code.  
KAZ Minerals engages the services of 
independent technical experts annually to 
convert reserve and resource calculations 
for operating mines and development 
projects from the estimation method 
established by the former Soviet Union  
to the method prescribed by the JORC 
Code. This also includes mine site visits, 
where considered appropriate, by 
independent technical experts. Drilling  
and exploration programmes are 
conducted by the Group to enhance the 
understanding of geological information at 
the deposits. Further details are provided 
in the disclosure on ore reserves and 
mineral resources commencing on page 171.

Subsoil use rights
Description
In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan all subsoil 
reserves belong to the State. Subsoil use 
rights are not granted in perpetuity and 
any renewal must be agreed before the 
expiration of the relevant contract or 
licence. Rights may be terminated if  
the Group does not satisfy its licensing  
or contractual obligations, which may 
include financial commitments to State 
authorities and the satisfaction of mining, 
development, environmental, social, and 
health and safety requirements. In recent 
years, legislation relating to subsoil use 
rights has increased licence obligations, 
technical documentation, work 
programmes and the level of goods and 
services sourced from Kazakhstan. The 
authorities have also increased their 
monitoring of compliance with legislation 
and subsoil use contract requirements.
Impact
As many of Kazakhstan’s subsoil use laws 
have been adopted relatively recently and 
remain untested in the country’s judicial 
system, the legal consequences of a given 
breach may not be predictable. However, 
non-compliance with the requirements of 
subsoil use contracts could potentially lead 
to regulatory challenges and subsequently 
to fines, litigation, restrictions to business 
operation and ultimately to the loss of 
operating licences. The loss of any of  
the Group’s subsoil use rights could  
have a material adverse effect on its  
mining operations.
Action
The Group’s management makes every 
effort to engage with the relevant 
regulatory authorities and ensure 
compliance with all relevant legislation  
and subsoil use contracts. The Group’s 
procedures to ensure compliance with  
the terms of subsoil contracts have been 
updated to reflect the requirements  
of legislation, including more active 
procurement of goods and services from 
Kazakhstan. In 2015, over half of the goods 
and services used by the operations were 
sourced from Kazakhstan. A specialist 
department is also tasked with monitoring 
compliance with the terms of the subsoil 
use contracts.
Environmental compliance
Description
The Group operates in an industry that is 
subject to numerous environmental laws 
and regulations. As regulatory standards 
and requirements continually develop,  
the Group may be exposed to increased 
compliance costs and environmental 
emission charges. Policies and measures at 
a national and international level to tackle 
climate change will increasingly affect the 
business, thereby demanding higher 
standards and increasing regulatory risks.
Impact
A violation of environmental laws, or 
failure to comply with the instructions  
of the relevant authorities, could lead  
to the suspension of operating licences, 
challenges to subsoil use mining rights,  
fines and penalties, the imposition of  
costly compliance procedures, reputational 
damage and financial loss. New or 
amended environmental legislation  
or regulations may result in increased 
operating costs, additional capital 
investment or, in the event of the Group’s 
non-compliance, the possibility of fines, 
penalties or other actions which may 
adversely affect the Group’s financial 
performance and reputation. Emissions 
charges in Kazakhstan have been 
increasing over recent years and the 
authorities are adopting an increasingly 
robust stance on compliance with 
environmental standards.
Action
The Group has policies and procedures in 
place which set out the required operating 
standards for all employees and monitors  
its emissions. The Group liaises with the 
relevant governmental bodies on 
environmental matters, including the 
development of new legislation. The 
generation of overburden from stripping 
works, consumption of water and energy 
and CO
2
 emissions will increase as the 
Group ramps up production at Bozshakol 
and Aktogay. These projects will utilise 
modern technology that will improve energy 
consumption and water recycling rates  
per tonne of ore processed at the same  
time as managing tailings waste more 
effectively than at our historic operations. 
Implementation of new modern design 
projects provides an opportunity to reduce 
the Group’s overall environmental footprint. 
Further details of the environmental 
measures being taken by the Group are  
set out in the Corporate Responsibility 
report commencing on page 55.

Commodity prices
Description
The Group’s policy is to sell its products 
under contract at prices determined by 
reference to prevailing market prices  
on international global metal exchanges. 
The Group’s financial results are strongly 
influenced by commodity prices, in particular 
copper and the major by-products, gold, 
silver and zinc. The prices for these metals 
are dependent on a number of factors, 
including world supply and demand and 
investor sentiment. In particular, KAZ 
Minerals is exposed to demand from 
China, a major consumer of the metals 
which the Group produces. During 2015, 
as a result of a challenging economic 
environment and poor investor  
sentiment, the market prices of all the 
Group’s commodities fell sharply. The 
average LME copper price in 2015 was 
$5,495 per tonne, a 20% decrease from 
2014. At the start of 2016 the LME copper 
price has traded below $4,400 per tonne.
Impact
Commodity prices can fluctuate 
significantly and could have a material 
impact on the Group’s asset values, 
revenues, earnings, cash flows and  
growth prospects. The financial impact  
of commodity price movements on the 
Group’s financial position will increase  
with the ramp up in output from 
Bozshakol and Aktogay.
Action
The Group regularly reviews its sensitivity 
to fluctuations in commodity prices. The 
Group does not as a matter of course 
hedge commodity prices, but may enter 
into a hedge programme for certain 
commodities where the Board determines 
it is in the Group’s interest to provide 
greater certainty over future cash flows. 
The Group adopts a prudent approach  
in its financial planning and investment 
appraisal, reflecting the volatility in 
commodity prices. Further details of the 
performance of the markets in which the 
Group operates are set out in the Market 
Overview section commencing on page 35.
Foreign exchange and inflation
Description
The Group is exposed to currency risk 
when transactions are not conducted in 
US dollars. The Group’s operations are 
primarily located in Kazakhstan, with  
the Bozymchak operations located in 
Kyrgyzstan. Prior to August 2015, the 
Kazakhstan tenge was a managed currency 
with relatively low volatility. In August 
2015, the tenge was floated triggering a 
significant devaluation and significantly 
increased volatility. The Kazakhstan tenge 
depreciated from a rate of 182 KZT/$ at 
the start of 2015 to a rate of 339 KZT/$ at 
the year end. The lower tenge reduces the 
Group’s operating cost in US dollar terms. 
The fall in value of the tenge increases the 
risk of higher inflation rates. 
Impact
Fluctuations in rates of exchange or 
inflation in the jurisdictions to which the 
Group is exposed could result in future 
increased operating costs and adversely 
affect financial performance. The 
functional currency of the Group’s 
operations is the local currency, such that 
the translation of US dollar denominated 
monetary assets and liabilities can give rise 
to exchange gains and losses in the income 
statement, which are largely offset by 
corresponding translation gains 
and losses recognised in equity. This 
increases the volatility of financial results 
reported in the income statement. In 
addition, the translation of the Group’s 
operating assets from a local functional 
currency to US dollars for financial 
reporting can result in volatility in the level 
of net assets recorded on the Group’s 
balance sheet.
Action
Where possible the Group attempts to 
conduct its business and maintain its assets 
and financial liabilities in US dollars to 
minimise exposure to other currencies. 
Surplus cash balances are maintained in  
US dollars. The Group generally does not 
hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk 
in respect of operating expenses. Further 
details are set out in note 31 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
32 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED Acquisitions and divestments
Description
In the course of delivering its strategy, the 
Group may acquire or dispose of assets  
or businesses. Corporate transactions  
may, however, fail to achieve the expected 
benefit or value to the Group. All business 
combinations or acquisitions entail a 
number of risks, including the cost of 
effectively integrating acquisitions to  
realise synergies, significant write-offs or 
restructuring charges, unanticipated costs 
and liabilities and loss of key personnel. 
The Restructuring was effected under  
the laws and regulations of Kazakhstan 
which are subject to change and open  
to interpretation, including the legal and 
tax aspects of the Restructuring in 2014, 
which could give rise to liabilities for  
KAZ Minerals.
Impact
Changing market conditions, incorrect 
assumptions or deficiencies in due 
diligence processes could result in 
acquisitions failing to deliver the expected 
benefit or value to the Group, leading to 
adverse financial performance and failure 
to meet expectations. Acquisitions could 
also lead to the Group assuming liability  
for the past acts of acquired businesses, 
without recourse to other parties. The 
disposal of assets or businesses may not 
achieve the expected proceeds due to 
changing market conditions, reductions  
in value, delays in the sale or deficiencies  
in the sales process.
Action
Specialised staff are assigned to manage 
corporate transactions, supported where 
appropriate by external advisers. Due 
diligence processes are undertaken on 
acquisitions and material transactions are 
subject to Board review and approval, 
including ensuring the transaction is aligned 
with the Group’s strategy, consideration of 
the key assumptions being applied and the 
risks identified. 
Exposure to China
Description
In addition to the impact of Chinese 
demand on the pricing of KAZ Minerals’ 
major products, as noted under the 
‘Commodity prices’ risk above, the Group 
makes significant physical sales to a limited 
number of customers in China. In 2015, 
sales to China accounted for a significant 
proportion of revenues which will increase 
further with the ramp up in output of 
copper concentrate from Bozshakol in 
2016 and from Aktogay from 2017. In 
addition, the Group uses contractors, 
services and materials from China. China  
is also an important source of financing  
to the Group with long-term debt facilities 
secured which provide access to funding  
of $3.1 billion at 31 December 2015, 
primarily for the development of 
Bozshakol and Aktogay.
Impact
Changes to China’s fiscal or regulatory 
regimes or lower Chinese copper 
consumption could reduce demand in 
China for the Group’s major products, 
which would result in a greater volume  
of sales being directed to the Group’s 
other major market, Europe. Changes  
to Chinese government policy on credit  
or cross border lending may affect the 
availability of financing from Chinese  
banks to the Group.
Action
The Group has historically sold a significant 
volume of its copper cathode production 
into Europe, as well as into China, thereby 
taking advantage of its geographic position 
which provides access to both major 
markets. In the event that demand 
reduced in China for the Group’s finished 
products, KAZ Minerals would allocate its 
sales of copper cathode between the two 
markets to improve the commercial terms 
obtained. The financing line for Bozshakol 
has been drawn and the Aktogay loan 
agreement is a committed loan facility, 
thereby providing greater certainty  
over the funding of the Group’s growth 
projects. KAZ Minerals also maintains 
relationships with a number of international 
lending banks, having the PXF facility in 
place, and has the flexibility to consider 
other sources of capital such as the bond 
or equity markets, if so required.

STRATEGIC REPORT
33  FINANCIAL RISKS CONTINUED
Liquidity
Description
The Group’s cash flows are subject to 
various risks, including commodity prices 
and operational risks as set out above. 
Over the next 12 months a sustained fall  
in commodity prices below current levels 
combined with delays in the ramp up of 
the major growth projects would require 
mitigating actions to increase liquidity 
which could include obtaining additional 
external financing and the postponement 
of certain capital expenditure, both of 
which the Board believes could be achieved.
The Group’s PXF facility is subject to 
financial covenants, which are suspended 
until 1 July 2016. In the absence of a 
material improvement in commodity 
prices, the facilities’ covenants will be 
breached when tested for the period 
ending 31 December 2016. Based on 
discussions with members of the banking 
group to date, the Board believes that it 
will reach agreement on amending its 
facilities such that no covenant breach occurs 
for the period ended 31 December 2015.
At the end of 2015 the Group had net 
debt of $2,253 million, available cash  
and liquid investments of $1,251 million 
and undrawn uncommitted facilities of 
$250 million. The debt financing of the 
Bozshakol and Aktogay projects has 
resulted in an elevated net debt level, 
which has been exacerbated by current 
commodity prices and the level of net 
debt is expected to increase in 2016  
during ramp up.
Impact
Non-compliance with financial covenants 
could result in borrowing facilities 
becoming uncommitted and repayable  
if negotiations with the banks are 
unsuccessful. Failure to manage liquidity 
risk could have a material impact on the 
Group’s cash flows, earnings and financial 
position as well as reducing the funds 
available to the Group for working capital, 
capital expenditure, acquisitions, dividends 
and other general corporate purposes. 
Action
KAZ Minerals adopts a prudent approach  
in managing its liquidity risk, reflecting the 
volatility in commodity prices. The Group 
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
levels of committed borrowing and working 
capital and closely monitoring forecast cash 
flows to ensure financial liabilities can be  
met as they fall due. The Board monitors  
the financing strategy and net debt level of 
the Group to ensure it is appropriate, taking 
into consideration the expected outlook of 
the Group’s financial position, expected cash 
flows and commitments and available sources  
of financing.
The Group has secured committed funding 
for the development of Bozshakol and 
Aktogay. The liquidity outlook was assisted  
by an agreement with Non Ferrous China,  
to defer the payment of $300 million of 
construction costs which were scheduled  
to be paid in 2016 and 2017 until the first half 
of 2018. The Group also raised an additional 
$50 million via a new facility with CAT.  
The successful commissioning of Bozshakol 
has expanded the range of financing options 
available to the Group. Further details of the 
financial risks impacting the Group, including 
interest rate risk are included in note 31 to 
the consolidated financial statements. Further 
details regarding going concern and viability 
are included in note 2 to the consolidated 
financial statements and within the viability  
statement on page 24.
Taxation
Description
As the tax legislation in Kazakhstan  
and Kyrgyzstan has been in force for a 
relatively short period of time, the tax 
risks in these countries are substantially 
greater than typically found in countries 
with more established tax systems. The 
reduction in commodity prices over the 
last 12 months has adversely impacted 
government finances in Kazakhstan  
and Kyrgyzstan. The Government of 
Kazakhstan is in the process of conducting 
a review of the existing tax code and tax 
administration. Tax regimes may therefore 
be subject to change and also subject to 
different and changing interpretations,  
as well as inconsistent enforcement. The 
timing and mechanism by which tax 
payments are made to and balances  
are recovered from the tax authorities, 
may be subject to change. Tax regulation 
and compliance is subject to review  
and investigation by the authorities  
who may impose severe fines, penalties 
and interest charges. 
Impact
The uncertainty of interpretation, 
application and the evolution of tax  
laws creates a risk that additional and 
substantial payments of tax could arise  
for the Group, or that tax receivable 
balances are not recovered as expected, 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s cash flows, financial 
performance and position. Failure to 
comply with tax laws could also impact  
the Group’s reputation in the countries  
in which it operates.
Action
The Group obtains appropriate tax advice, 
makes every effort to comply with existing 
tax legislation and works closely with the 
Government and tax authorities in the 
review of proposed amendments to tax 
legislation and regulation. Further details  
of the Group’s tax strategy and risk 
management are set out in the Financial 
Review on pages 53 and 54.
34 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED MARKET
OVERVIEW
The price of copper is impacted by global supply-demand 
fundamentals and can therefore be volatile and cyclical, with  
the outlook for the Chinese economy of particular significance. 
China is estimated to represent 46% of global refined copper 
consumption, ahead of the second largest consumer, the United 
States, at 8%. 
By-products
Approximately 50% of world zinc production is used in the 
construction sector. It is also used in industrial machinery, 
electronics and consumer products. Pricing of zinc concentrate  
is based on the LME zinc price, less processing charges. 
Approximately three-quarters of KAZ Minerals’ zinc production 
is sold within the CIS, with the remaining balance sold to China.
Gold is used as an investment asset, for jewellery and various 
industrial and electronic applications. Benchmark prices are 
generally based on London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) 
quotations. The Group’s gold bar production is sold to the 
National Bank of Kazakhstan based on the LBMA price.
Silver has similar demand fundamentals to gold but with a higher 
exposure to industrial applications which results in increased price 
volatility. Silver production is sold to traders based in Asia for 
delivery to Europe and Asia, principally under annual contracts 
based on the LBMA price at the time of delivery. 
Market environment:
Our products
In 2015, sales of copper generated around 70% of revenues with 
remaining revenues from by-products of zinc, gold and silver.
The Group’s operations in the East Region and at Bozymchak 
produce copper in concentrate which contains gold and silver 
content as by-products. The East Region also produces zinc 
concentrate. The copper concentrate from the East Region  
and Bozymchak is toll processed at the Balkhash smelter into 
finished products of copper cathode, gold bars and silver bars, 
which are sold to customers. Zinc concentrate is sold to regional 
and Chinese customers.
Production of cathodes from Aktogay oxide began in December 
2015 and is now being sold alongside the cathodes from the  
East Region and Bozymchak. The sulphide plant at Bozshakol  
has commenced production of copper concentrate which will  
be sold to smelters in China.
Copper
Copper material used in the production of refined copper is 
derived primarily from mines, with output from Latin American 
mines estimated to provide around 41% of global copper 
production. Secondary copper materials, such as scrap, also 
provide an important alternative source of copper material  
for the refined copper production process.

The balance is consumed by transport, industrial machinery  
and electrical networks.
Copper
2015 market performance
2015 was a challenging year for copper, as similar to many  
metals it suffered a significant fall in price due to slowing

Dec Nov Oct Sep Aug Jul Jun May Apr Mar Feb Jan
Following a sharp decrease in January 2015, the copper price 
trended to a year high of $6,448 per tonne in early May, resulting 
from falling inventories and Chinese interest rate cuts to stimulate  
the economy. Prices have since come under pressure from 
lacklustre global economic growth and a strong US dollar.  
Market sentiment has been particularly impacted by negative 
economic data from China, the largest consumer of copper,  
as well as emerging markets more generally in 2015. Chinese 
demand has also been impacted by a tightening of available credit, 
which has adversely affected smaller downstream purchasers.
The copper price fell below $5,000 per tonne in August, 
triggered by a devaluation of the Chinese renminbi and  
a resulting sell off of equities. The announcement of production 
cuts by miners in the second half of the year has done little to 
compensate for demand concerns arising from the health of the 
Chinese economy. In the last quarter of the year the LME copper 
price has declined steadily, falling below $5,000 per tonne again  
in November following the terrorist attacks in Paris, a surge of 
short selling and a further worsening of investor sentiment.
Outlook
A small supply surplus of around 0.3 MT, 1% of global 
consumption, is anticipated in the global refined copper market 
in 2016, similar to 2015. Copper output from mines is predicted 
to increase by less than 1% in 2016, with additional supply from 
mine expansions being offset by price-related closures announced 
in 2015. 
Further price-related production cutbacks, or deferral of 
investments, could bring forward a return to deficit and positive 
price momentum. At prices seen in the second half of 2015,  
a number of copper mines are producing at a net cash loss,  
which could support further supply cuts in 2016. However,  
mining companies have been able to achieve significant cost 
reductions, aided by the strong US dollar and mining cost 
deflation, to protect margins and avoid production cutbacks. 
The medium and long-term outlook for copper remains positive. 
Demand for copper is forecast to increase through population 
expansion, continuing urbanisation and a resulting increase in 
electricity consumption. This rate of growth will decline from the 
levels seen in recent years, but continued growth from a higher 
base will see copper consumption increase significantly. The 
nature of growth is also changing, away from construction and 
infrastructure to the consumer sectors and to green applications, 
such as renewable energy, hybrid and electric vehicles and high 
speed trains, which are copper intensive. In China there have 
been some positive demand indicators towards the end of the 
year, with grid investment and electrical network infrastructure 
offering opportunities for growth. The automotive sector should 
benefit from tax concessions announced in October 2015.
From a supply perspective the current supply surplus is small,  
and the market is forecast to remain finely balanced over the  
next few years. The slower rate of Chinese growth in 2015 has 
however led market commentators to predict a deficit in the 
copper market arising later than previously estimated. Demand  
is forecast to exceed supply at some point between 2018 and 
2020 as production from existing mines reduces and because  
of a lack of project approvals. 
The market for copper concentrate moved into a statistical deficit 
by the end of 2015, with China stocks down to normal working 
levels. In China whilst some State Owned Enterprise smelters 
have cut production, generally smelters are not reducing output 
in order to maintain social employment. Furthermore, additional 
Chinese smelting capacity is scheduled to be commissioned in 
2016. It is expected the market for copper concentrate will be 
balanced in 2016, with a deficit in capacity for the first half of  
the year moving into a surplus in the second half.

Estimate (after market adjustments).
Estimate
Actual
The refined copper market remained tight in 2015 and is 
expected to have recorded a supply surplus of 0.3 MT, which 
equates to around 1% of global consumption. Global refined 
copper consumption is estimated to have reached 21.9 MT in 
2015, 1.6% above the prior year. This is below the levels predicted 
by some analysts as Chinese demand growth slowed more 
sharply than had been expected. 
Copper mine production is estimated to have increased by 3.4%, 
a lower figure than forecast previously, due to supply disruptions 
and the announcement of price-related production cuts.

STRATEGIC REPORT MARKET OVERVIEW CONTINUED Demand for the Group’s copper products remains strong.  
Annual contracts have been agreed for approximately 85%  
of 2016 copper cathode sales, with around 60% expected  
to be sold to China, similar to previous years. The remaining 
volumes will be contracted on a spot basis to allow for monthly 
variations in production and sold to China or Europe subject to 
market conditions. 
Copper concentrate output from Bozshakol will be sold to 
Chinese smelters under annual contracts. Bozshakol produces  
a ‘clean concentrate’, with low iron and silver content and no 
arsenic, which is well suited to Chinese smelter technology.
Zinc
2015 market performance
From a large surplus in 2014 and the first half of 2015, the zinc 
market moved into balance in the second half of the year 
following stock drawdowns and price-related production cuts. 
The average zinc price was $1,928 per tonne in 2015, 1 1% below 
the average price in 2014, driven by a strong US dollar and global 
economic uncertainty. In October 2015, Glencore announced 
cuts to production of 500,000 tonnes. Despite the reduced 
supply, continued demand concerns led to zinc reaching a six  
year low of $1,462 per tonne in December. 
Outlook
The outlook for zinc is positive due to the metal’s strong 
medium-term fundamentals. There are no large advanced stage 
development projects in the pipeline to replace mine closures  
and cutbacks, with demand growth expected to outstrip supply. 
The market is forecast to move into a small deficit from 2016, 
supported by a group of 10 Chinese smelters announcing they 
would collectively cut output by 500,000 tonnes, and a growing 
deficit from 2017 when a shortage of concentrates could become 
acute, which should translate into higher zinc prices. However, in 
the short term uncertainty persists due to concerns about the 
outlook for demand.
The Group has concluded its annual zinc concentrate contracts 
for 2016 and will sell three-quarters of zinc concentrate 
production from the East Region within the CIS, with the 
remaining output sold to China. Pricing of the zinc concentrate 
sales will be based on the LME zinc price less processing charges 
which are set on an annual basis.
Gold and silver
2015 market performance
Gold fared slightly better than most commodities in 2015, but still 
saw a reduction in the average LBMA price of 8% from 2014 to 
$1,160 per ounce. At the year end, gold was over 40% below its 
all-time high price of $1,895 per ounce in 201 1. A strong US dollar, 
slow demand from Asia and expectations of an increase in US 
interest rates have contributed to a decline in gold prices in 2015. 
The low level of inflation in the major economies in 2015 has also 
contributed to reduced gold demand from financial investors, as 
evidenced by the outflows from gold-backed investment funds. 
The LBMA silver price performed worse than gold due to its 
increased exposure to industrial usage, averaging $15.7 per ounce 
in 2015, an 18% decline from 2014. As a precious metal, similar  
to gold, the silver price was also impacted by poor investor 
sentiment arising from low inflation, a strong US dollar and 
expectations of an increase in US interest rates.
Outlook
The 2016 outlook for gold and silver remains challenging and will 
be influenced by the US dollar, inflationary expectations, potential 
further increases to US Federal Reserve interest rates and 
geopolitical developments. In the medium term silver prices  
are expected to benefit from price-related supply constraints  
as a significant proportion of current production is at a cost  
above current prices, and further reductions from base metals 
producers, which often produce silver as a by-product, would  
also reduce supply.
Gold bar production from the East Region and Bozymchak will  
be sold in 2016 to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, as required 
by Kazakhstan, based on the LBMA price at the time of delivery. 
The copper concentrate produced by Bozshakol contains gold 
which forms part of the copper concentrate sales terms. Silver 
bar production will be sold to traders based in Asia for delivery  
to Europe and Asia under annual contracts based on the LBMA 
price plus a premium at the time of delivery.

37 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The Group’s operations include the four mines and three 
concentrators in the East Region, the mine and concentrator  
at Bozymchak and the growth projects at Bozshakol, Aktogay  
and Koksay. The Group disposed of the mining, processing and 
power operations based in the Zhezkazgan and Central Regions 
upon completion of the Restructuring on 31 October 2014. The 
Disposal Assets are classified as a discontinued operation for the 
prior year in the Group’s financial statements. Details of the 
performance of the Disposal Assets in the prior year can be 
found in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts.

Ore output 3,986 4,202
Copper grade (%) 2.42 2.48
Copper in ore mined 96.3 104.4
Copper in concentrate 86.3 89.2
Copper cathode production 78.5 83.5
Ore output from the East Region totalled 3,986 kt in 2015,  
which was 216 kt or 5% below the volume extracted in the prior 
year. The decline in output was primarily due to the mining of 
deeper ore horizons at Orlovsky and as extraction moved to a 
transitional area between the two ore bodies at Artemyevsky. 
Ore output from Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky was also below the 
prior year as the residual reserves are extracted. This mine is 
expected to cease operation in the second half of 2016. 
REVIEW OF
OPERATIONS
The average copper grade of 2.42% was below the prior  
year with lower grades at Artemyevsky due to mining in the 
transitional area and at Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky as the residual 
reserves are extracted. A reduction in ore output from Orlovsky, 
which produces the highest copper grade ore in the East Region, 
also contributed to the fall in average grade. 
The 5% lower ore volume extracted and the reduction in  
grade led to copper in ore extracted of 96.3 kt, 8% below  
the prior year. 
Copper in concentrate production
kt 2015 2014
Orlovsky concentrator 47.2 50.7
Nikolayevsky concentrator 29.0 27.8
Belousovsky concentrator 10.1 9.0
Third party processing – 1.7
86.3 89.2
Copper in concentrate output of 86.3 kt was 2.9 kt or 3% below 
the prior year with a decrease in output from the Orlovsky 
concentrator as a result of the reduction in copper mined. 
Recovery rates were improved at all three East Region 
concentrators, partially offsetting the reduction in copper in ore 
mined. The Nikolayevsky concentrator’s throughput increased 
following modernisation works and output rose by 1.2 kt in 2015, 
enabling all the ore produced from Artemyevsky and Yubileyno-
Snegirikhinsky to be processed internally. In the first half of 2014 
some material from Artemyevsky was processed by a third party. 
Copper output from the Belousovsky concentrator rose by 1.1 kt 
as the facility benefited from the additional copper output from 
the Irtyshsky mine where higher grade sections were mined.
The copper concentrate produced by the East Region is processed 
into cathode on a tolling basis at the Balkhash smelter. Copper 
cathode production decreased by 5.0 kt to 78.5 kt due to the 2.9 kt 
reduction in copper in concentrate production and as maintenance 
works in the first half of 2015 limited the Balkhash smelter’s 
processing capacity, resulting in a build-up of work in progress 
which was not fully released in the second half of the year.
Copper cathode production for the East Region is anticipated  
to reduce to around 70 kt in 2016 as output declines from 
Orlovsky with the mining of lower grade zones and as 
maintenance works at the mine restricts output in the second  
half of the year. Copper output from Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky is  
also expected to fall with operations at the mine planned to  
cease in the second half of 2016.

Zinc grade (%) 3.23 4.07
Zinc in ore mined 128.9 171.1
Zinc in concentrate 94.3 121.4
The volume of zinc in ore mined decreased by 42.2 kt or 25%  
to 128.9 kt in 2015. This was mainly due to the reduction in zinc 
grades at both the Orlovsky and Artemyevsky mines where 
operations were conducted at lower by-product content zones. 
Zinc in concentrate production was at the top end of the 
guidance for 2015 but compared to the prior year fell by 27.1 kt 
or 22% to 94.3 kt. The decline in output reflected the lower 
volume of zinc mined in 2015, partially offset by the stockpiling  
of ore in 2014 when modernisation works restricted output from 
the Nikolayevsky concentrator. Zinc in concentrate production  
is expected to reduce to between 70 kt and 75 kt in 2016 as the 
Artemyevsky mine continues to move through the transitional 
ore zone which contains lower by-product grades.

Silver in ore mined 6,024 7,979
Silver in concentrate 3,110 3,836
Silver granule 3,052 3,435
The East Region mined 6,024 koz of silver in ore in 2015 which 
was 1,955 koz or 25% below the prior year. The decrease was 
primarily due to lower silver grades at Artemyevsky as mining 
operations moved through a transitional zone. Silver output at 
Orlovsky was also lower due to the reduction in ore extraction 
and silver grades with the mining of deeper ore sections. 
Silver in concentrate production of 3,1 10 koz was 726 koz or  
19% below the prior year due to the lower volume of silver  
in ore mined, partially offset by the stockpiling of ore while 
modernisation works restricted output from the Nikolayevsky 
concentrator in the prior year. 
Silver granule output of 3,052 koz was 383 koz below the prior 
year due to the fall in silver in concentrate production, partially 
offset by the release of work in progress at the Balkhash smelter. 
Silver granule production is expected to decline to between 
2,250 koz and 2,500 koz in 2016 with lower output from 
Orlovsky and as output in 2015 benefited from a release  
of work in progress.

Gold grade (g/t) 0.63 0.82
Gold in ore mined 81.1 110.3

Gold bar 22.1 34.6
The East Region mined 81.1 koz of gold in ore in 2015, a decrease 
of 29.2 koz or 26% when compared to the prior year. This was 
mainly due to the reduction in ore output and gold grades at 
Orlovsky and the decline in grades at Artemyevsky.
The gold in concentrate production of 24.3 koz was 1 1.2 koz  
or 32% below the prior year, reflecting the change in gold in  
ore mined and lower concentrator recovery rates which  
were negatively affected by the reduction in grade of  
material processed. 
Gold bar production reduced by 12.5 koz to 22.1 koz in 2015 with 
a 1 1.2 koz decline in gold in concentrate output and a build-up of 
work in progress at the Balkhash smelter. Gold bar output from 
the East Region is expected to be between 18.0 koz and 22.0 koz 
in 2016.

Revenues
The revenues generated by the East Region decreased by 23%  
to $649 million, reflecting the weak price environment for all its 
commodities during the year.
Revenue from copper cathode sales fell by 18% to $452 million  
as a result of a lower realised copper price. The average LME 
copper price decreased by 20% to $5,495 per tonne in 2015,  
from $6,862 per tonne in 2014. Cathode is sold to customers  
in China or Europe based on the LME price plus a premium  
to reflect the terms of trade.
Cathode sales of 82 kt includes 5 kt of cathode which was 
purchased externally to compensate for variances in monthly 
cathode output, mainly because of maintenance at the Balkhash 
smelter. The sale of the externally purchased cathode contributed 
revenue of $28 million at a small margin. Excluding externally 
purchased material, copper cathode volumes were in line with  
the prior year. 
Revenue from by-products fell by a total of $99 million or 33%  
to $197 million due to lower realised prices and sales volumes. 
The average 2015 market prices of zinc, silver and gold fell by 1 1%, 
18% and 8% respectively compared to 2014. Zinc in concentrate 
sales of 96 kt were 21% below the prior year, largely due to lower 
production and grades. Silver sales volumes reduced by 30%  
to 2,965 koz also due to lower production and as a result of a 
significant release of inventory in 2014. Gold bar sales volumes 
declined by 39% or 14 koz to 22 koz, as a result of lower 
production and grades. Other revenue includes income from  
the sale of sulphuric acid which is produced as a by-product from 
the toll smelting of copper in concentrate at the Balkhash smelter. 
Going forward the East Region will supply a significant portion of 
the sulphuric acid it produces to the heap leach operations  
at Aktogay.
EBITDA (excluding special items)
EBITDA of $235 million was $168 million below the prior year 
due to the lower revenues, partially offset by a reduction in cash 
operating costs. Cash operating costs of $386 million (excluding 
the cost of acquiring third party cathode) fell by 13% compared  
to 2014.
The East Region’s cash operating costs in the first half of 2014  
do not fully reflect the cost of services which were provided 
centrally by Kazakhmys Mining, or the terms agreed with Cuprum 
Holding for smelting and maintenance services, as the region’s 
operations were managed as part of Kazakhmys Mining up to 
their economic separation from the Disposal Assets in August 
2014. The East Region’s cash operating costs in the second half  
of 2014 of $237 million are therefore considered to be more 
representative of the operations as a stand-alone business than 
those for the whole of 2014. Cash operating costs of $386 million 
for the full year 2015, excluding the cost of acquiring the third 
party cathode sold of $28 million, represent a 19% reduction 
when compared to the run rate of costs in the second half  
of 2014. 
A significant portion of the East Region’s operating costs are 
denominated in tenge which devalued sharply against the US 
dollar after the tenge moved to a free float in August 2015. The 
tenge traded at an average of 222 KZT/$ in 2015, finishing the 
year at 339 KZT/$, compared to an average of 179 KZT/$ in 2014.
Operating costs benefited from a continued focus on cost control, 
optimisation initiatives taken by management and a fall in the cost 
of key consumables used in mining and processing activities. The 
prices for key inputs, such as rubber, steel and cement which is 
used for backfilling works, have decreased. Lower fuel prices  
have reduced transportation and energy costs. Refinements  
were made at the operations, particularly at the concentrators,  
to optimise the usage of grinding media and consumables such as 
reagents. The cost of repair works also declined when compared 
to the prior year. Following completion of the Restructuring in 
October 2014, a review of suppliers was undertaken to increase 
competition, re-tender contracts and to ensure the Group 
benefited from falling commodity prices. These measures more 
than offset external cost pressures, including the 9% increase in 
electricity tariffs from 1 January 2015.
Administration costs were lower than in 2014 or the run rate  
in the second half of 2014 as the benefits of favourable exchange 
were largely offset by additional costs incurred for the stand-
alone business, including internal transportation and energy 
support services. There was also an increase in social 
responsibility costs as KAZ Minerals provided support to  
the local communities in which it operates.
40 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED Cash costs
The cost efficiency of the operations is measured by the gross  
and net cash cost of own copper cathode sold. The gross cash 
cost for the year of 227 USc/lb was 12% below the 257 USc/lb 
recorded in 2014. However, as noted above, during the first  
half of 2014 the East Region was not operating as a stand-alone 
business. The gross cash cost for 2015 was 18% below the 277 
USc/lb recorded in the second half of 2014, a more representative 
period of the East Region operations as a stand-alone business. 
The fall in gross cash costs reflected the cost measures noted 
above and the weakening of the tenge from August 2015, which 
more than offset the marginal reduction in own cathode sales.
Whilst the gross cash cost was lower than the prior year, the  
net cash cost increased by 31% to 1 1 1 USc/lb. This was the result 
of a significant reduction in by-product credits due to lower 
realised prices.
The East Region gross cash cost of copper sold is expected to  
be between 200 USc/lb and 220 USc/lb in 2016. In forecasting  
a reduction in gross cash costs, the tenge is assumed to trade  
in the mid-300s during 2016 with the weaker tenge leading to 
higher inflationary pressures on local costs including salaries  
and goods and services. The slightly lower copper production 
forecast from the East Region will also put some upward  
pressure on unit cash costs.
Capital expenditure
Sustaining
Sustaining capital expenditure totalled $64 million in 2015, which 
was $1 1 million above the level in the prior year but below the 
guided level at the start of the year of $70 million to $90 million. 
As a result of the downturn in commodity prices management 
has sought to defer expenditure where possible.
Included within sustaining capital expenditure was $1 1 million for 
modernisation work at the Nikolayevsky concentrator. The final 
stages of the works includes the upgrade of the thickening and 
filtration sections and are expected to complete in the first half  
of 2016. The modernisation work has already enabled the 
concentrator to increase its processing capacity and improve 
recovery rates. At Artemyevsky, design works are being prepared 
and land has been purchased for a railway line which will reduce 
ore transportation costs between Artemyevsky and the 
Nikolayevsky concentrator. The construction of the line  
will commence during 2016. 
The largest component of sustaining capital expenditure in  
the year related to mine development works at the Orlovsky, 
Irtyshsky and Artemyevsky mines. There was limited 
development at the Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky mine as it is 
expected to cease operations in the second half of 2016.  
Mine development expenditure was higher in the second half  
of 2015 as new contractors were introduced in the year, replacing 
services previously provided by the Disposal Assets, with the new 
contractors needing time to mobilise at the East Region mines.
Also included within sustaining capital expenditure was the purchase 
of mining equipment, improvements to ventilation at the Orlovsky 
mine, developing tailings facilities at the concentrators and investing  
in projects to maintain transportation, heating and electricity 
infrastructure for its operations and the local community. 
In 2016, the East Region’s sustaining capital expenditure 
requirements are expected to be between $70 million and  
$80 million, including around $20 million on optimisation projects. 
Expansionary
The feasibility study work on the extension of the operational  
life of the existing Artemyevsky mine continued during 2015. The 
Group has been able to extend the life of the existing operations 
and is seeking to defer capital expenditure where possible. The 
optimal development of the mine extension is still being assessed 
and is expected to be incurred over a period of 6-8 years. Initial 
mine development work is expected to commence in 2016  
with spend of around $20 million forecast for this work during 
the year.

Copper cathode production 2.2 –
Ore extracted was consistent with the prior year as available 
processing capacity was limited during 2015. Processing capacity 
has increased following optimisation works at the concentrator 
during the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore ore extraction 
will also increase in 2016. The ore extracted in 2014 and 2015 has 
been from the higher grade sections of the mine with an average 
copper grade of 0.97% achieved in 2015, which is above the 
average grade of the mine’s ore reserves of 0.76%. 
In 2015 copper in concentrate production rose to 3.1 kt from 
which copper cathode of 2.2 kt was produced on a tolling basis at 
the Balkhash smelter. Due to capacity limitations at the Balkhash 
smelter, 0.9 kt of copper in concentrate produced in 2015 was in 
transit to a third party at the year end which will be recognised  
on a copper cathode equivalent basis in production and sales 
volumes in 2016. 
Copper cathode production is anticipated to increase to around  
6 kt in 2016 as output from the concentrator ramps up after  
the successful completion of the optimisation works in 2015.

1 Includes volumes, revenues and operating costs prior to 1 July 2015 before the 
operation was commercially producing.
The operations were considered to have achieved commercial 
production from 1 July 2015, with all revenues and operating  
costs from that date being recorded in the income statement.
Revenues of $16 million have been recognised in the income 
statement during the second half of 2015, which includes  
$9 million from the sale of 7 koz of gold at an average realised 
price of $1,165 per ounce and $7 million from the sale of 1.4 kt of 
copper cathode at an average realised price of $5,263 per tonne. 
The gold bar and copper cathode is sold on the same terms as 
the East Region operations. Reported revenues exclude sales in 
the first half of 2015 of $12 million ($6 million copper cathode  
and $6 million gold bar) which were capitalised during the 
pre-commercial production phase.
Bozymchak recorded an EBITDA of $5 million in the income 
statement for 2015, reflecting the results for the second half of 
2015 after commercial production was achieved. In the first half 
of 2015 EBITDA from Bozymchak of $6 million was capitalised 
during the pre-commercial production phase. EBITDA in the 
second half was negatively impacted by the challenging pricing 
environment, the planned shutdown of the concentrator for 
optimisation works in the fourth quarter of 2015 and December 
sales shipments only being recognised in 2016. Cash operating 
costs, similar to the East Region, benefited from lower input  
costs for key consumables used in the mining and concentrating 
process. The weakening of the Kyrgyzstan som to the US dollar,  
from an average of 54 KGS/$ in 2014 to 68 KGS/$ in the second 
half of 2015, has also reduced local costs. 
The gross cash cost of copper cathode sold during 2015 was  
339 USc/lb. Due to the significant by-product revenues from gold 
output the mine has a competitive net cash cost of 40 USc/lb. In 
2016, with higher output following successful optimisation works, 
the gross cash costs at the operation are expected to decrease. 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS  
ON PRICES
The Group’s revenue is significantly influenced by commodity 
prices quoted on the LME and LBMA exchanges for copper, 
zinc, gold and silver. Changes in these prices have a direct 
effect on the revenues of the Group, which consequently 
impact earnings and the net cash cost of copper due to 
changes in by-product credits.
The approximate effect on the profit before finance  
items and taxation resulting from a 10% movement in the 
average realised commodity prices on the Group’s results  
is shown in the following table, assuming all other variables 
remain constant:

Sustaining
Sustaining capital expenditure totalled $3 million in 2015 relating 
to stripping works at the open pit mine. 
Expansionary
The expansionary capital spend of $6 million was below the prior 
year as the project is now complete and operational. The 2015 
expansionary capital expenditure was to complete supporting 
infrastructure and for the optimisation works at the concentrator. 
The expansionary spend was offset by $4 million of operating 
profit which was capitalised during the pre-commercial 
production phase in the first half of 2015.

processing facilities in the north of Kazakhstan is one of the 
Group’s major growth projects. Bozshakol will have an annual ore 
processing capacity of 30 MT when fully ramped up and the 
deposit has a mine life of 40 years with an average copper grade 
of 0.36%. Bozshakol is a first quartile asset on the global cost 
curve, with an estimated net cash cost of 70-90 USc/lb  
(in 2016 terms) on average for the first 10 years after the 
concentrator has been commissioned. The mine and processing 
facilities will produce 100 kt of copper cathode equivalent and 
120 koz of gold in concentrate per year on average over the first 
10 years of operations.
Significant construction progress was made during 2015, despite a 
fire in the grinding area in August, which resulted in the sulphide 
concentrator entering commissioning in December and the first 
copper concentrate was produced in February 2016. The ramp 
up of the sulphide plant to its design processing capacity of 25 MT 
of ore per annum is now ongoing. Bozshakol is an important 
project for the mining industry in Kazakhstan and will employ 
around 1,500 people when fully ramped up. All workers have 
undertaken an extensive induction programme with a strong 
focus on safe operations. Commercial levels of production are 
expected to be achieved in the second half of 2016 and full 
capacity achieved during 2017.

Mining operations including topsoil removal, road development 
and pre-production stripping at the first stage of the pit 
commenced in the second quarter of 2015. A large proportion  
of the ore extracted in 2015 was clay ore which will be stockpiled 
ahead of the commissioning of the clay plant in 2016. The removal 
of clay ore has opened two faces in the pit to facilitate access to 
sulphide ore. By the end of the year 532 kt of sulphide ore at a 
copper grade of 0.52% had been mined and stockpiled ahead  
of the ramp up of output from the sulphide concentrator  
during 2016.
The copper grade of the ore extracted was above the life of  
mine copper grade as operations in the initial years are focused 
on the higher copper grade zones of the deposit. The deposit at 
Bozshakol also contains gold, silver and molybdenum. The gold 
grade in 2015 averaged 0.31 g/t which is expected to decrease  
in 2016 but, similar to copper, will remain above the life of mine 
average during the initial years as higher grade zones are mined. 
Copper cathode equivalent production is anticipated to be 
between 45 kt and 65 kt and gold bar equivalent output of 
between 50 koz and 70 koz as output from the concentrator 
ramps up in 2016. Given the current depressed market for 
molybdenum, commissioning of the separate molybdenum  
circuit is expected to be deferred, with no production in 2016 
prior to an improvement in market conditions.
Financial Summary
$ million 2015 2014
EBITDA (excluding special items) (10) (8)
Capital expenditure 
(expansionary) 527 503
The negative EBITDA represents overhead costs incurred  
in preparing the operations prior to the commencement of 
commercial production. Commercial production from the 
sulphide concentrator is expected to occur during the second  
half of 2016 as production ramps up, following which revenues 
and operating costs will be recorded in the income statement. 
During the pre-commercial production phase, revenues and 
operating costs are capitalised and are not reported in the 
income statement. 
The first shipment of copper concentrate is expected to be 
dispatched to China-based customers in March 2016, with final 
pricing terms to be agreed pending the outcome of chemical 
assays of the material. The realised price for copper concentrate 
sales will be based on the LME price minus a deduction applied 
for TC/RCs and transport costs within China. The gross cash  
cost for Bozshakol is expressed on a unit of cathode basis, after 
applying copper recovery and TC/RC terms. The gross cash cost 
for production in 2016 will be dependent on a successful ramp  
up and is expected to be around 150-170 USc/lb, including the 
period prior to commercial levels of production.
In 2015 capital expenditure on Bozshakol, excluding capitalised 
interest on debt facilities, was $527 million. This included 
expenditure related to the completion of the sulphide 
concentrator, including the primary crusher and related 
mechanical and electrical works, installation of the overland 
conveyor system and completion of primary support facilities 
such as workshops, laboratories, administration buildings and 
transmission lines. 
At the end of 2015 around $1,880 million had been spent on the 
fully funded project. The total cost of the project is now expected 
to be $2,150 million, $50 million below previous estimates. 
Expenditure of around $270 million is expected in 2016 for  
final payments to complete the clay plant and infrastructure. As 
previously guided the project is forecast to require a maximum  
of $50 million of working capital in 2016, depending on the speed 
of the ramp up. Following the completion of the sulphide plant, 
resources have been transferred to the clay plant, which will  
be commissioned in 2016 with a capacity of 5 MT per annum.

STRATEGIC REPORT
43 Aktogay
The Aktogay project in the East of Kazakhstan is the  
Group’s second large scale open pit copper mining asset  
under construction. The deposit has a mine life of more than 
50 years with average copper grades of 0.33% (sulphide) and 
0.37% (oxide). Aktogay is competitively positioned on the global 
cost curve with an estimated net cash cost of 100-120 USc/lb  
(in 2016 terms) for the first 10 years after the concentrator  
has been commissioned. The project will produce an average  
of 90 kt of copper cathode equivalent from sulphide ore and  
15 kt of copper cathode from oxide ore per year over the first  
10 years of operations.
Significant progress was made at Aktogay with the completion  
of the SX/EW plant to process oxide ore in December 2015.  
To support the commissioning of the main sulphide plant in 2017, 
the foundations for the primary crusher and conveyor were 
completed. The external cladding of the sulphide concentrator 
building was installed ahead of the onset of cold weather so that 
construction could continue inside the building throughout the 
winter. The assembly of the mills and the installation of flotation 
cells is now ongoing. The experience gained by the projects  
team during the construction of the identical processing facility  
at Bozshakol has proved valuable. The sulphide section of the 
project remains on track to commence production in 2017.

Copper cathode production 0.4 –
Following the commencement of mining operations at Aktogay  
in the second quarter of 2015, 3,003 kt of oxide ore has been 
extracted and placed on the first three of the nine heap leach 
cells. Each of the nine heap leach cells has a capacity of 
approximately 1,000 kt of ore per cycle. Each cycle of irrigation 
lasts around four months. Mining activity ramped up during 
December 2015 and early 2016, increasing the rate at which  
oxide ore is placed on the heap leach pads. By the end of 2015 
around 870 kt of ore had been leached.
The irrigation of the heap leach cells commenced on 26 
September 2015 and on 1 December 2015 the project produced 
its first copper cathode in the SX/EW processing facility. The 
solution produced from the leaching process contained around 
1.7 kt of copper and initial copper cathode production from the 
SX/EW plant in 2015 totalled 0.4 kt.
Copper cathode production from Aktogay’s oxide operations  
is expected to ramp up swiftly to the plant’s expected 15 kt per 
annum cathode output.
Financial Summary

EBITDA (excluding special items) (3) (6)
Capital expenditure 
(expansionary) 470 364
The negative EBITDA represents overhead costs incurred  
in preparing the operations prior to the commencement of 
commercial production. Commercial production from the  
oxide plant is expected to occur during the first half of 2016  
as production ramps up to commercial levels, following which 
revenues and operating costs will be recorded in the income 
statement. In the pre-commercial production phase, revenues 
and operating costs will be set off against capital expenditure  
and will not be reported in the income statement. The gross 
operating cost for production from the oxide plant is expected 
to be 1 10-130 USc/lb over the full year, including the period prior 
to commercial levels of production. 
In 2015 capital expenditure on Aktogay, excluding capitalised 
interest on debt facilities, was $470 million. This expenditure 
included the completion of the oxide and SX/EW plant, acid 
storage and pipeline infrastructure, works at the sulphide 
concentrator, primary crusher and construction of the  
permanent camp and administrative facilities.
At the end of 2015 around $1,320 million had been spent in  
total on the project, with the total cost unchanged at around 
$2,300 million. The project is expected to require approximately 
$280 million in 2016, following an agreement with NFC to defer 
$300 million of construction costs previously scheduled in 2016 
and 2017 to 2018. Expenditure in 2016 will focus on completion  
of the sulphide plant. 
Koksay 
In 2014 the Group acquired a third major growth project, Koksay, 
which is located in southeastern Kazakhstan. The project is 
estimated to have a life of over 20 years with average annual 
production of around 80 kt of copper cathode equivalent  
along with gold, silver and molybdenum by-products.
In 2015 expenditure of $8 million was incurred on the project, 
primarily for exploratory drilling to provide initial geological, 
geotechnical and hydrogeological data on the deposit. Based  
on the drilling results a new mineral resource estimate has  
been prepared which has reduced JORC resources by applying 
more stringent criteria, principally in the inferred category. The 
revised estimate is in the region of the resources assumed in the 
acquisition case. The project is forecast to require expenditure 
of around $5 million in 2016 to continue the basic study works.

REVIEW
Basis of preparation
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, using accounting policies consistent 
with those adopted in the consolidated financial statements  
for the year ended 31 December 2015. In preparing the 
consolidated financial statements, the Group did not apply  
or adopt any standards, interpretations or amendments that  
were issued but not yet effective.
On 31 October 2014, the Group completed the sale of a number 
of its relatively mature mining and power operations, primarily 
located in the Zhezkazgan and Central Regions (the ‘Disposal 
Assets’). These operations were reclassified as assets held for  
sale and as a discontinued operation from 15 August 2014 
following independent shareholder approval. The Group’s 
investment in the Ekibastuz GRES-1 joint venture, which 
represented a separate business line of the Group, was treated  
as a discontinued operation for the period up to its disposal on  
1 April 2014. The financial review commentary is focused on  
the Group’s continuing operations.

(excluding the cost of purchased cathode) and $176 million for the 
first and second halves of 2015 respectively which benefited from 
a number of efficiency measures including a review of suppliers, 
efficiencies in consumables usage as well as lower input prices  
and the impact on local operating costs of the tenge free float 
from August 2015.
EBITDA of $5 million at Bozymchak compares to a loss of  
$4 million in the previous year as commercial production was 
achieved on 1 July 2015 with the revenue and costs recognised in  
the income statement from that date. In 2014 and the first half of  
2015 Bozymchak’s EBITDA was negative due to overhead and 
operational readiness costs incurred during pre-commercial 
production that were not capitalised. Bozymchak was in the 
pre-commercial production phase throughout the period to  
30 June 2015, during which $12 million of revenues from copper  
and gold sales and $4 million of operating profit ($6 million EBITDA) 
earned thereon was capitalised against property, plant and equipment. 
After commercial production was achieved on 1 July 2015 revenues  
of $16 million, consisting of $7 million of copper and $9 million of  
gold, were recognised in the income statement. 
The negative EBITDA from Mining Projects of $13 million 
represents costs incurred in preparing Bozshakol and  
Aktogay for commercial production which are not considered 
directly attributable to the construction of the assets and are 
therefore expensed. 
Corporate costs of $25 million fell from $30 million in the prior 
year following a reduction in discretionary spend, such as business 
travel and from a lower headcount. 
EBITDA from discontinued operations represents the results of 
the Disposal Assets up to their divestment on 31 October 2014.
Special items
Special items are non-recurring or variable in nature and do  
not impact the underlying trading of the Group. 
Special items within operating profit from continuing 
operations:
2015
Impairment charges
During 2015, impairment charges were recognised against 
property, plant and equipment of $8 million which primarily 
relates to the impairment of administrative land and buildings  
in Kazakhstan which are not in use. In addition, a $4 million 
impairment charge was recognised against mining assets for mine 
development works which are no longer expected to be utilised.
Loss on disposal of assets
During the first half of 2015, a loss on the disposal of mining assets 
of $2 million was recognised relating to assets that the Group no 
longer intends to develop.
Revenues 
The decline in commodity prices during the year along with  
lower sales volumes for zinc, silver and gold saw revenues  
from continuing operations fall by 21% to $665 million from  
$846 million in 2014. Copper revenues were impacted by a  
22% reduction in realised prices and a 6% increase in sales 
volumes, which included 5 kt of cathode purchased for onward 
sale contributing revenues of $28 million. Revenues for zinc in 
concentrate, the largest by-product, decreased by $42 million 
compared to the prior year due to a 10% reduction in realised 
prices and 21% lower volumes. Gold and silver revenues declined 
by $9 million and $32 million respectively, impacted by lower 
realised prices (3% and 17% respectively) and sales volumes  
(19% and 29% respectively).
EBITDA (excluding special items)
EBITDA has been chosen as the key measure in assessing the 
underlying trading performance of the Group. This performance 
measure removes depreciation, depletion, amortisation, MET, 
royalties, the non-cash component of the disability benefits 
obligation and those items which are non-recurring or variable  
in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading 
performance. The Directors believe that the exclusion of  
MET and royalties provides a more informed measure of the 
operational profitability given the nature of the tax as further 
explained in the ‘Taxation’ section.

1 Discontinued operations comprise the EBITDA of the Disposal Assets until 31 
October 2014 when the divestment completed. EBITDA from Ekibastuz GRES-1 
for 2014 was $nil as the gain from its disposal was treated as a special item.
The East Region’s EBITDA from continuing operations of  
$235 million was $168 million below 2014 as the fall in commodity 
prices more than offset cost efficiencies and the favourable impact 
of the tenge devaluation from August 2015. 
Compared to 2014, the East Region’s cash operating costs  
were $57 million lower in 2015 at $386 million (excluding the  
$28 million cost of cathode purchased for onward sale), reflecting 
the impact of cost reduction initiatives and the depreciation of the 
tenge from August 2015. In the first half of 2014, the East Region 
was managed as part of the mining business which included the 
Disposal Assets. The costs recorded during this period included 
only directly attributable costs and services such as smelting and 
maintenance and did not reflect the terms agreed following the 
East Region’s economic separation from the Disposal Assets. The 
cash operating costs of $237 million in the second half of 2014 are 
therefore considered more representative of the East Region as  
a stand-alone business. These costs compare to $210 million 
46 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Net finance costs
Net finance costs include: 
• Interest expense of $23 million, down from $35 million in 2014. 
• Net foreign exchange losses of $60 million compared to  
$54 million in 2014, which excluded the impact of the 
devaluation of the tenge in February 2014 which was  
treated as a special item. 
• Interest on the employee benefits obligation and unwinding  
of discounts on other provisions of $4 million compared to  
$3 million in 2014. 
• Interest income on cash deposits and short-term investments  
of $9 million compared to $10 million in 2014. 
Overall net finance costs (excluding special items) were  
$78 million compared to $82 million in 2014.
The interest expense of $23 million ($35 million in 2014) is after 
the capitalisation of interest relating to the construction of new 
mines. The total interest cost on debt amounted to $155 million 
compared to $159 million in the prior year. The decrease is 
attributed to a lower weighted average cost of borrowing,  
a reduced balance under the CDB Bozshakol/Bozymchak  
facility and the absence of $10 million in loan fees expensed on 
re-negotiation of the PXF in 2014, partially offset by the additional 
borrowings on the CDB Aktogay facility. $132 million of interest 
costs were capitalised to the construction of the mining projects 
compared to $124 million in the prior year, as additional 
borrowings for the Aktogay project were partially offset  
by interest costs on Bozymchak ceasing to be capitalised. 
The Central Bank of Kazakhstan announced in August 2015  
that the tenge would be allowed to float against the US dollar 
following which the tenge fell 80% by the year end. The decline  
in the KZT/$ exchange rate has led to net foreign exchange losses 
being recognised in the financial statements. In the prior year, the 
devaluation of the tenge that arose on the change in the managed 
trading band of the exchange rate was treated as a special item. 
As the tenge has now moved to a free float against the US dollar, 
the movement in foreign exchange in 2015 has not been treated 
as a special item.
The net exchange loss of $60 million is largely attributed to the 
depreciation of the Kyrgyz som giving rise to net exchange losses 
on Bozymchak’s intercompany US dollar debt of $52 million. This 
loss was largely offset by exchange gains arising on the translation 
of Kyrgyz som net liabilities which were recognised within equity. 
The depreciation in the tenge exchange rate following its free 
float led to net foreign exchange losses of $7 million. Included 
within the tenge net exchange loss are: 
• $65 million exchange loss which arose on the translation of US 
dollar payables relating to the Bozshakol and Aktogay projects 
within Kazakhstan based entities which have tenge functional 
currencies. As the construction contracts on which these 
exchange losses arise are US dollar based, there is no change to 
the US dollar cost of the projects. Of the $65 million exchange 
loss, $31 million has been realised on payments made in the year 
and is included within expansionary capital expenditure in the 
cash flow statement.
• Net exchange gains attributed to the translation of US dollar 
denominated net monetary assets in Kazakhstan entities, 
principally receivables and cash. 
NFC deferral benefit
In November 2015, an agreement was signed with NFC  
under which $300 million of Aktogay construction costs which 
were scheduled to be paid in 2016 and 2017 will be settled in  
the first half of 2018 with no change to the overall amount 
payable to NFC. The agreement to defer payments gave rise  
to a non-cash gain of $16 million representing the estimated 
benefit to the Group.
Impact of fire at Bozshakol
The fire which occurred in August 2015 in the grinding area  
of the Bozshakol concentrator caused damage to $7 million of 
equipment, the cost of which is recoverable against construction 
insurance. The damaged equipment has been written off to other 
operating expenses with the insurance payment recognised in 
other operating income with a net effect of nil. 
2014
Impairment charges
In 2014, an impairment review was performed on the Bozymchak 
project as a result of lower forecast copper prices for 2015, 
ongoing optimisation work delaying the ramp up of the 
concentrator and changes to the mine plan. Following the review, 
an impairment charge of $128 million was recognised. $107 million 
was charged against property, plant and equipment, $18 million 
against mining assets and $3 million against other non-current 
assets of the project. The impairment charge reduced the 
carrying value of the project to its recoverable amount of  
$100 million, determined on a discounted cash flow basis as at  
31 December 2014. The cash flow forecasts were discounted  
at a post-tax discount rate of 1 1% (pre-tax rate of 12%).
Impairment charges were also recognised within East Region 
operations against property, plant and equipment of $4 million, 
principally relating to unusable items.
Other items excluded from EBITDA (excluding 
special items) from continuing operations
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation for 2015 of $52 million 
is $10 million higher than the charge in 2014. The charge reflects 
an increase in the depletion rate from the annual review of the 
East Region operations reserves and resources carried out at the 
end of 2014 as disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts. 
In addition, as Bozymchak reached commercial production in the 
second half of 2015, its depreciation, depletion and amortisation 
charges were recognised in the income statement from  
1 July 2015. 
MET and royalties
The MET charge for the East Region of $61 million for the year 
was below the $86 million charge in the prior year, reflecting 
lower metal in ore extracted and commodity prices. 
Mining activities at Bozshakol and Aktogay commenced during  
the second half of 2015. As MET is incurred once ore is mined,  
$17 million and $3 million of MET relating to Bozshakol and Aktogay 
respectively was capitalised during pre-commercial production. 
Bozymchak pays product royalties and a social development tax 
on its invoiced sales. These costs are recognised in selling costs.  
The royalty for the current year of $1 million was incurred after 
commercial production was reached and recognised in the 
income statement.
www.kazminerals.com
STRATEGIC REPORT
47 In the prior year, excluding the $181 million special item, the 
remaining net exchange losses arose largely from the depreciation 
of the Kyrgyz som on the translation of intercompany monetary 
liabilities relating to the financing of the Bozymchak project.
The net exchange loss of $181 million excluded from net finance 
costs and treated as a special item in 2014 reflects the impact  
of the managed tenge devaluation in February 2014 and arose 
principally from the translation of tenge denominated monetary 
assets and liabilities in US dollar entities. These losses were largely 
offset by exchange gains arising on translation of tenge 
denominated net assets recognised directly within equity. 
Interest income on cash and cash equivalents and short-term 
investments fell to $9 million, reflecting lower interest earned  
on a reduced level of cash held by the Group as available funds 
were invested in the major growth projects.
Taxation
The table below shows the Group’s effective tax rate from 
continuing operations as well as the all-in effective tax rate which

royalties less the tax effect of special items and other non-recurring items, divided 
by profit before taxation which is adjusted for MET and royalties, special items and 
other non-recurring items. The all-in effective tax rate is considered to be a more 
representative tax rate on the recurring profits of the Group.
Effective tax rate 
The effective tax rate of 200% arose as a tax charge of  
$24 million was realised on pre-tax profits of $12 million. Included 
within pre-tax profits is a Bozymchak pre-tax loss of $63 million 
arising from exchange losses related to its US dollar intercompany 
debt. No tax asset was recognised on this loss principally due  
to the commodity price assumptions applied in assessing future 
recoverability and the five year statute of limitations on the use of 
tax losses in Kyrgyzstan. The unrecognised tax loss increased the 
Group’s tax charge by approximately $13 million using the Group’s 
statutory rate. Other tax items which increase the effective tax 
rate include the impact of non-deductible expenses incurred 
principally in the East Region operations, the major growth 
projects and the UK tax group which are more pronounced  
at low profitability levels, adding $10 million to the tax charge. 
In 2014, the effective tax rate of (38%) arose principally from  
the $48 million tax impact of non-deductible foreign exchange 
losses as a result of the February 2014 tenge devaluation and the 
$36 million tax impact of other non-deductible business expenses 
principally from the East Region operations.
All-in effective tax rate
The all-in effective tax rate was 1 14% compared to 63% in  
2014 with the increase attributed to the significant reduction  
in adjusted profit before tax of $158 million, while the reduction 
in MET, which is determined independently of the profitability  
of operations was limited to $24 million. Consequently, in periods 
when the copper price is at lower levels the profitability of the 
operations decreases, but the all-in effective tax rate increases,  
as the impact of MET and royalties is elevated due to its  
revenue-based nature. Whilst lower copper prices result in a 
lower absolute amount of taxes being levied, the all-in effective 
tax rate increases. Conversely, during periods of higher copper 
prices, the MET and royalties impact on the all-in effective tax 
rate decreases. 
Non-deductible items
The tax impact of non-deductible items was $10 million in  
2015 (2014: $84 million) relating principally to the East Region, 
Bozshakol and the UK. The $84 million in 2014 mainly related to 
the non-deductibility of unrealised exchange losses which arose 
from the February 2014 tenge devaluation of $48 million, with 
$36 million due to the impact of the Bozymchak impairment  
and other ongoing non-deductible business expenses.
Taxation related special items:
2015
The taxation special items relate to the tax effects on  
the $16 million NFC deferral benefit and certain other 
impairment charges. 
2014
The taxation special items relate to the deferred tax asset that 
arose on the impairment of assets at the East Region operations 
($1 million) and the current tax charge on the exchange gains on 
US dollar denominated monetary assets in Kazakhstan arising 
from the February 2014 tenge devaluation of $8 million. 
Future tax rates
Future tax rates are materially affected by the application  
of corporate income tax (“CIT”) and MET. The CIT rate  
in Kazakhstan is 20% on assessable profits whilst MET is  
revenue-based and dependent on commodity prices.

The Group’s net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations was $12 million in 2015 compared  
to a loss of $234 million in 2014. The prior year was impacted by significant foreign exchange losses arising from the February 2014 
devaluation of the tenge and the impairment charge relating to Bozymchak. The current year was impacted by a lower EBITDA 
principally from reduced commodity prices.
The Underlying Loss from continuing operations for the year was $10 million compared to a profit of $86 million in the prior year, 
primarily due to the reduction in EBITDA noted above.
There were no discontinued operations in 2015. The Underlying Loss from discontinued operations in 2014 related to the Disposal 
Assets and the disposal of Ekibastuz GRES-1.

Dividends
The policy established at the time of Listing was for the  
Company to maintain a dividend policy which took into  
account the profitability of the business and underlying growth  
in earnings of the Group, as well as its cash flows and growth 
requirements. The Directors would also ensure that dividend 
cover is prudently maintained.
In previous years, share buy-backs and special dividends have 
been used in addition to the ordinary dividend to return surplus 
funds to shareholders. Taking into consideration the Group’s 
increase in net debt during the construction and ramp up phase 
of the major growth projects, the Directors did not declare an 
interim dividend and will not recommend a final dividend for 
2015. The Board will continue to assess the Group’s financial 
position, its cash flows and growth requirements in determining 
when to resume dividend payments in the future.

Bozshakol of $21 million and Aktogay of $13 million were included within capital 
expenditure as the projects remain in the pre-commercial production phase.
4 For the year ended 31 December 2014, the $170 million outflow reflects  
the $158 million in cash transferred to the Disposal Assets on divestment  
and $12 million of costs incurred on the transaction. The Disposal Assets  
also retained $30 million of current investments on divestment.
50 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Summary of the year
Net cash flows from operating activities decreased as lower 
profitability and negative working capital were only partially  
offset by lower MET, income tax and interest payments.
Working capital
The working capital movements resulting in the $37 million 
outflow in 2015 are explained below: 
• inventory levels increased by $23 million, as a result of increased 
work in progress of copper concentrate awaiting processing  
at the Balkhash smelter; 
• trade and other receivables decreased by $74 million due to the 
winding down of trading relationships with the Disposal Assets at 
the start of 2015. A number of sales arrangements ended in late 
2014 for which amounts were outstanding from customers at  
31 December 2014, with corresponding payments due to the 
Disposal Assets; 
• prepayments and other current assets rose by $29 million as  
the Group’s operating companies accrued VAT in excess of 
refunds over the course of the year; and 
• trade and other payables and provisions decreased by $59 million 
in 2015, reflecting principally the settlement of amounts due to 
the Disposal Assets in respect of sales arrangements which 
ended in late 2014.
In the prior year there was a working capital inflow of $21 million, 
including cash flows from the Disposal Assets. Inventory levels 
increased by $10 million, mainly as a result of increased copper 
cathode goods-in-transit; trade and other receivables decreased 
by $87 million due to the timing of cash receipts and lower  
sales volumes following divestment of the Disposal Assets; 
prepayments and other current assets rose by $84 million as a 
result of an accumulation of VAT primarily within the Disposal 
Assets; and trade and other payables and provisions increased  
by $28 million in 2014, largely driven by a rise in accruals for 
services across the Group.
Interest cash flows
Interest paid during the year was $147 million, compared with 
$150 million in the prior year and is consistent with the lower 
total interest cost for the year of $155 million compared to  
$159 million in the prior year. Interest payments are made 
semi-annually in January and July under the CDB Bozshakol/
Bozymchak facilities, quarterly under the CDB Aktogay CNY 
facility and monthly under the PXF. 
Income taxes and mineral extraction tax
Income tax payments of $40 million were lower than the  
$55 million in the prior year, reflecting the lower profitability  
of the East Region operations in the current year and the  
absence of tax payments in 2015 relating to the Disposal Assets. 
At 31 December 2015 the Group’s net income tax payable was 
$1 1 million, compared to $18 million in 2014. 
MET and royalty payments of $54 million were below the  
$102 million in 2014 following lower metal in ore extracted  
as the prior period includes the MET paid by the Disposal  
Assets and due to lower commodity prices. At 31 December 
2015, the Group’s MET and royalty payable was $25 million, 
compared to $10 million in 2014. In the last quarter of 2015,  
$4 million in MET was paid following ore extracted from the 
Bozshakol and Aktogay mining activities. This payment was 
recognised within expansionary capital expenditure in the  
cash flow statement.
Free Cash Flow
The Group’s Free Cash Flow, which includes $147 million  
(2014: $150 million) of interest payments on borrowings used 
specifically for the funding of capital expenditure at the major 
growth projects was an outflow of $145 million compared to  
a $31 million outflow in 2014. Excluding interest payments, the 
operations recorded a positive Free Cash Flow of $2 million 
(2014: $1 19 million) despite the lower commodity price 
environment. The reduction in Free Cash Flow reflects  
the lower profitability in 2015 and negative working capital 
movement, only partially offset by lower sustaining capital 
expenditure, MET and income tax payments.
Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure fell to $68 million as the majority  
of the 2014 spend related to the Disposal Assets and as 
management sought to limit investment in the East Region 
operations. Certain items of investment planned for 2015  
have been deferred to 2016. Expansionary capital expenditure  
of $1,012 million was principally invested in the major growth 
projects of Bozshakol ($527 million) and Aktogay ($470 million). 
Please refer to the Operating Review for more detail on 
sustaining and expansionary capital expenditure. Total capital 
expenditure in the year was $1,080 million compared to  
$1,213 million for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
Other investing and financing cash flows
In 2015, other investing cash flows relate to the $35 million final 
instalment for the Koksay licence along with transaction taxes 
that may potentially be recovered in the future, interest received 
of $7 million (2014: $12 million) and the sale of various items of 
property, plant and equipment within the Group for proceeds  
of $7 million (2014: $7 million).
Investing cash flows in 2014 included the initial payment for the 
Koksay licence of $225 million, the cash proceeds received from 
the sale of Ekibastuz GRES-1 of $1,249 million and $170 million 
related to the Disposal Assets which consisted of $158 million  
of cash and cash equivalents transferred and $12 million of 
transaction costs on divestment. The Disposal Assets also 
retained $30 million of current investments on divestment.

STRATEGIC REPORT
51 Balance sheet
The Group’s capital employed position at 31 December 2015  
is shown below:

Equity attributable to owners of 
the Company 319 2,101 
Non-controlling interests 3  3 
Borrowings 3,504 3,092 
Capital employed 3,826 5,196 
Summary of movements
The Group’s attributable loss for the year of $12 million and the 
non-cash foreign currency translation loss of $1,773 million led  
to the fall in the equity attributable to owners of the Company. 
In 2015, there has been a significant reduction in net equity due  
to the 86% fall in the value of the tenge from 31 December 2014 
to 31 December 2015. The Group’s mining assets are largely held 
within Kazakhstan based entities which maintain tenge as their 
functional currency. At period ends, these non-monetary assets 
are consolidated and reported in US dollars at the closing 
exchange rate with the change in value arising from movements  
in the tenge exchange rate reflected in equity and not through  
the income statement. Whilst the consolidated net asset value  
of the Kazakhstan based entities has reduced for reporting 
purposes in 2015, the weaker tenge should have a positive effect 
on their underlying economic value as it reduces their local 
operating costs with revenues largely US dollar based. The 
Group’s external liabilities, principally its bank debt, are largely  
US dollar denominated and therefore its value is unaffected  
by movements in the KZT/$ exchange rate.
Net debt
Net debt consists of cash and cash equivalents, current 
investments and borrowings. A summary of the Group’s  
net debt position is shown below:
$ million 2015  2014 
Cash and cash equivalents 851 1,730 
Current investments 400 400 
Borrowings (3,504) (3,092)
Net debt (2,253) (962)
Cash and cash equivalents and current investments at 31 
December 2015 were $1,251 million, of which $224 million relates 
to drawings under the CDB Aktogay finance facility and will be 
used for the development of Aktogay. Current investments of 
$400 million (2014: $400 million) consist of bank deposits with 
initial terms of maturities of between three and 12 months held 
with institutions predominantly in the UK. 
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds 
within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds 
remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital 
purposes. The funds within the UK are held primarily with major 
European and US financial institutions and triple-‘A’ rated liquidity 
funds. At 31 December 2015, $1,225 million of cash and short-
term deposits were held in the UK and Europe and $25 million  
in Kazakhstan.
Gross borrowings increased to $3,504 million at 31 December 2015 
from $3,092 million at 31 December 2014, reflecting the draw 
down of $540 million under the CDB Aktogay US dollar and 
CNY facilities, the drawing of the $50 million CAT facility which 
was arranged in August 2015 and the $181 million of repayments 
under the CDB Bozshakol/Bozymchak facilities.
At 31 December 2015, gross borrowings (all net of amortised 
fees) consisted of $1,881 million under the CDB Bozshakol/
Bozymchak facilities, $1,228 million under the CDB Aktogay 
finance facility, $345 million under the PXF and $50 million  
under the CAT facility. The Group has $250 million undrawn  
on the CDB Aktogay facilities as at 31 December 2015.
Full details of the terms of the Group’s borrowings are  
included in note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.
Other significant matters
NFC contract agreement
On 17 November 2015, the Group reached an agreement with  
its principal construction contractor, NFC, to defer payment of 
$300 million relating to the Aktogay project. Under the revised 
terms, $300 million of construction costs which were scheduled 
to be paid in 2016 and 2017 will be settled in the first half of 2018. 
There is no change to the overall amount payable to NFC or the 
project budget of $2.3 billion. The deferral of $300 million to 
2018 provides additional liquidity during the construction and 
ramp up of Bozshakol and Aktogay.
Going concern
At current market prices, and on the basis that the current debt 
facilities remain available, the Group has adequate liquidity over 
the going concern period, even in the event of a moderate delay 
in the assumed ramp up at Bozshakol. However, in the absence  
of a material improvement in commodity prices, the Group’s  
PXF and CAT facilities’ covenants will be breached when tested 
for the period ending 31 December 2016. Based on discussions 
with its banks, the Group is confident that the banks will view 
favourably a waiver or temporary suspension request of a 
technical covenant breach, provided the Group’s debt service 
obligations are maintained, which the forecasts indicate is likely  
to be the case and that the facilities will remain available 
throughout the going concern period.
In the event of a sustained fall in commodity prices below  
current levels combined with delays in the ramp up of Bozshakol, 
mitigating actions would be required to support liquidity over the 
going concern period, which the Group believes are achievable. 
As a result the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. See note 2(a) of the 
consolidated financial statements.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Taxation
Tax strategy and risk management
The Group is subject to taxation in the UK, Kazakhstan and the 
various foreign countries in which it operates. Tax legislation of 
the jurisdictions in which the Group operates differs and is subject 
to interpretation by management and the government authorities, 
and as such, creates a risk of non-compliance with specific tax 
requirements. Whilst the Directors believe that the Group is in 
substantial compliance with tax legislation and contractual terms 
entered into that relate to tax, the absence of established case 
history and the complexity and judgemental nature of tax 
legislation in certain jurisdictions result in additional risk for the 
Group. Specific areas of interpretation include the applicability  
of stabilisation under the Group’s operating licences, including 
subsoil use contracts, the applicability of excess profits tax to  
the Group’s mining and processing operations and the structuring  
of cross border transactions, particularly in respect of the 
application of transfer pricing policies. The Group’s core 
objectives in managing and controlling its tax affairs and related 
tax risks are as follows:
• ensuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations  
in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates; and 
• structuring the business in the most efficient and transparent 
manner with the emphasis being on the maximisation  
of shareholder value.
The Group takes a responsible and transparent approach to  
the management and control of its tax affairs and related tax  
risks, and has therefore adopted a tax strategy, which has been 
approved by the Board, that is aimed at achieving the objectives, 
thereby aligning it with the Group’s long-term strategy: 
• the Group’s tax risks are assessed as part of the Group’s  
formal governance processes and are reviewed by the Chief 
Financial Officer who reports them to the Audit Committee  
on a regular basis;
• significant tax risks, implications arising from those risks and 
potential mitigating actions are considered by the Board when 
strategic decisions are being taken; 
• the tax risks of proposed transactions or new areas of business 
are fully considered before proceeding; 
• the half year and annual effective tax rate and the composition  
of the tax charge are reviewed by the Audit Committee as part 
of its remit in reviewing the half-yearly and annual reports; 
• the Group builds an equitable relationship with the tax 
authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates;
• the Group takes appropriate tax advice from reputable 
professional firms;
• where disputes arise with government authorities with regard  
to the interpretation and application of tax legislation, the Group 
is committed to addressing the matter promptly and resolving 
the matter with the relevant tax authority in an open and 
constructive manner; and 
• the Group employs professional tax managers within the 
corporate head office and the operating businesses, and  
provides ongoing technical training to them.
Total tax contribution
The Group has complied with ‘The Reports on Payments to 
Government Regulations 2014’ and has presented for the first 
time the total payments to governments, as defined by the 
regulations, which differs from the previously disclosed ‘total  
tax contribution’. Comparative information under the new 
regulations is not required and has not been presented. The  
total tax contribution for 2014 as disclosed in the 2014 Annual 
Report and Accounts, amounted to $412 million paid across  
the countries in which the Group has a presence. Direct  
taxes paid by the Group, such as corporate income taxes,  
MET, environmental taxes and employer taxes comprised  
$300 million of this total. In addition, the Group indirectly 
contributed $1 12 million in employee taxes and withholding  
taxes primarily on services, which the Group collected on behalf 
of government authorities and paid over to them. On a similar 
basis, the total tax contribution for 2015 was $179 million, below 
the $412 million in the prior year as the amounts paid in 2014 
included the total tax paid by the Disposal Assets up to their 
divestment in October 2014.

Payments to governments
The table below represents the Group’s consolidated report on payments made to governments under The Reports on Payments  
to Government Regulations 2014, which became effective for the first time for the year ended 31 December 2015. The report 
represents payments made in excess of £86,000 ($130,000) for activities related to the exploration, prospecting, discovery, 
development and extraction of minerals by project, by government type and by country, but rounded to the nearest million.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, total payments to governments under the regulations amounted to $127 million, while  
total contributions made which includes payments not covered by the regulations, amounted to $195 million and are reflected  
in the table below.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED We have reviewed our environmental reporting in 2015 and 
taken steps to more closely align it with the GRI4 reporting 
framework, which is used as a reference when reporting 
environmental impacts. Where possible, the Group intends  
to progressively align its reporting with the GRI4 framework,  
a set of sustainability reporting standards published by the Global 
Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’). GRI is an independent organisation 
established in 1997 to create common standards for sustainability 
reporting by companies and governments.
Comparative data
On 31 October 2014 the Group disposed of 12 copper mines, 
four concentrators, two smelters, two coal mines and three 
captive heat and power stations as part of the Restructuring. This 
resulted in significant reductions in the Group’s environmental 
impacts compared to the 2014 financial year, given the reduced 
size and changed activity mix. Where available, data for the 
Group’s health and safety performance and environmental 
impacts in 2014 have been provided for the continuing operations 
for comparison purposes. 
Materiality assessment
A materiality assessment of the Group’s corporate responsibility 
metrics was carried out in the second half of 2014, focusing on 
the operations that would be retained by the Group following  
the Restructuring. The assessment included engagement with 
both internal and external stakeholders. Following this review  
the matrix set out below was established to determine the  
corporate responsibility issues that are most material to the Group. 
General approach
KAZ Minerals places a high priority on its social and 
environmental responsibilities, which supports its strategy by 
helping it to maintain its licence to operate, manage reputational 
and regulatory risks, access capital, control costs, build strong 
stakeholder relationships and attract and retain talented 
employees. We seek to manage our impacts on the economy, 
environment and society across our value chain, from extraction 
and processing through to transportation, storage, marketing  
and the construction of new mining projects.
To address our health, safety and environmental (‘HSE’) 
responsibilities we have continued to strengthen the Group HSE 
function during 2015. Our aim is to embed the required culture 
within our organisation to maintain performance in the long term. 
The ultimate responsibility for oversight of the Group’s HSE 
performance rests with the Board. The General Directors of 
each of the Group’s operational units have a functional reporting 
line into the Group HSE team which in turn reports directly to 
the Chief Executive. For more information on HSE governance, 
see page 80.
We regularly review our HSE reporting processes and seek to 
make improvements where possible. From 2015 KAZ Minerals 
has adopted in full the occupational injury and disease classification 
definitions published in January 2014 by the ICMM to report its 
safety and health performance on a comparable basis to those  
of its major global mining peers. The Group has also conducted a 
roll out of EMEX, a health and safety reporting tool, to streamline 
and improve the collection of data across its operations.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Fatalities
We are disappointed to report that three fatalities occurred at 
our assets in 2015, one of which involved an employee of KAZ 
Minerals in the East Region and two involved contractors, one  
in the East Region and the second at the Aktogay project. Both  
of the East Region fatalities occurred at the Irtyshsky mine, with 
the first resulting from interaction with stationary energised 
equipment and the second from contact with moving equipment. 
At Aktogay a fall occurred during lifting of construction materials. 
Following any fatal incident, operations are suspended  
until management and the relevant authorities complete their 
initial investigations. All fatalities are subsequently thoroughly 
investigated by the Group’s Health and Safety management and 
mine management. Measures have been taken in light of these 
investigations to prevent the recurrence of the circumstances 
leading to the incidents. 
KAZ Minerals considers all fatalities to be avoidable and has a 
target of zero fatalities. A range of initiatives has been undertaken 
in recent years to reduce fatalities and progress has been made  
in 2015 towards this target. Three fatalities in 2015 compares to 
seven fatalities in the continuing operations in 2014, and 14 for  
the full Group in 2014
1
. 
The reduction in fatalities for continuing operations has occurred 
in a period in which there was a large increase in the number  
of man-hours worked, as construction activity at the major 
growth projects increased and open pit mining operations have 
commenced. The Bozymchak mine increased its processing 
activities during 2015 and mining commenced at Bozshakol and 
Aktogay. As a result, the total number of man-hours worked in 
2015 was 41 million, a 78% increase compared to the 23 million 
hours worked in 2014 in the continuing operations. The rate  
of fatal incidents per million hours worked in the continuing 
operations has reduced from 0.30 in 2014 to 0.07 in 2015. This 
compares to the ICMM average fatality rate per million hours 
worked in 2014 of 0.02.
Whilst the reduction in both the rate of fatal incidents and  
the overall number of fatalities year on year is a welcome 
development which indicates that the Group’s health and  
safety investments and initiatives are having a positive effect, 
management and the Board will not be satisfied until the  
incidence of fatalities has been reduced to zero.

Health and safety
Health and safety overview
Copper mining and processing and the construction of new 
mining projects are inherently hazardous activities. KAZ Minerals 
seeks to minimise the risk to its employees and contractors  
by ensuring that the required conditions exist for safe and 
productive work. The Group has established a health and safety 
framework to assist in both preventing incidents and in guiding 
investigations. This framework describes how the right people, 
using the right tools, working in a safe environment and following 
the correct procedures, are all required to achieve safe and 
productive work. These elements are underpinned by the 
required management systems and safety culture. ‘Safety’  
has been determined as one of the five key corporate values  
of KAZ Minerals. See page 13 for further details of the Group’s 
corporate values, which were defined in 2015.
During 2015 the Group operated four underground mines in the 
East Region of Kazakhstan and one open pit mine in Kyrgyzstan. 
These mining operations together accounted for 18 million 
man-hours (including four million man-hours by contractors),  
or 44% of the Group total hours worked in 2015. 
The construction work at the Bozshakol and Aktogay projects  
is mainly being carried out by contractors, who completed  
20 million man-hours in 2015, with KAZ Minerals employees 
accounting for one million man-hours. Construction activity  
at the major growth projects represented 49% of the Group  
total hours worked. 
The risk profile of the Group’s activities in 2015 was elevated  
as the nature of work undertaken by its employees and 
contractors at the major growth projects moved through  
a higher-risk construction phase, involving exposure to risks  
such as working at height, heavy lifting and electrical hazards. 
Open pit mining is in general a less hazardous activity compared 
to underground mining. As the construction work at the projects 
is completed and the Group’s activities transition towards open 
pit operations, the health and safety risk profile of the Group is 
expected to improve. 
The Group has developed a revised set of Health, Safety and 
Environmental Management Standards, including standards 
specific to key fatality risks, and these new standards have been 
rolled out to each of the Group’s operational and construction 
sites. Several reviews of fatality risks were carried out including 
improved internal standards for energy isolation and working at 
height, which are two activities that have been identified as high 
priority areas for improving health and safety outcomes.
A broader review was undertaken by AMC Consultants of the 
underground mining operations focusing on geotechnical risk 
management. Following the recommendations made by AMC 
Consultants, action plans have been put in place for the East 
Region operations to address the issues and risks identified. 
56 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED Recognising that copper mining and processing are resource-
intensive activities, the Group seeks to minimise its environmental 
impacts wherever possible. Compliance with local environmental 
legislation is an important part of our licence to operate. The 
Group seeks to minimise the impact of any of its activities on the 
health of local communities. Appropriate measures are taken to 
control emissions or discharges and to manage waste and water 
usage. We encourage local communities to report health risks 
through established communication channels. The nature of the 
Group’s activities following the Restructuring are now focused  
on mining and processing, removing the potential for adverse 
health impacts from the operation of smelting or power assets. 
The Bozshakol and Aktogay projects are not situated close to  
any major settlements, whilst the East Region assets and the 
Bozymchak mine in Kyrgyzstan are in closer proximity to local 
populations.  As part of its broader approach to community 
relations, the Group invests in healthcare infrastructure through 
its local community social projects.
Environmental permits are granted to all of our operations, 
setting annual limits for emissions, water use and water discharge. 
If levels exceed these limits, charges are applied in proportion  
to the amount of emissions or usage in excess of the limits.  
The Group reports the total charges paid and any material 
environmental incidents in the Corporate Responsibility section 
of its website. Individual charges and incidents above a materiality 
threshold are reported in the Annual Report and Accounts. The 
threshold is based on a qualitative assessment (scope of impact  
on the environment, employees and communities and impact  
on operations) and a financial assessment (a single emissions 
charge in excess of $100,000) of each incident. There were  
no major environmental incidents at our operations in 2015. 
However, at the Nikolayevsky complex, which forms part of the 
East Region operations, an emissions charge of $550,000 was 
levied on a seepage of process water from the tailings storage 
dam. Seepage interceptor collection drains and recovery bores 
will be used to remedy the seepage. The water discharged is  
close to the tailings facility and is not extracted for use by any other 
parties. The discharge has not contaminated local water supplies.  
An emissions charge of $230,000 was also levied at the Orlovsky 
complex. This was due to a delay in obtaining a renewed emissions 
permit for tailings storage in the Orlovsky tailings dam. The breach 
was of an administrative nature and was not related to any potential 
risk to the environment or to the safe operation of the tailings dam.
Total Recordable Cases
There were 93 Total Recordable Cases (‘TRCs’) of  
occupational injuries and diseases in 2015. This represented  
a Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (‘TRCFR’) of 2.3  
cases per million hours worked.
Recordable Injuries
There were 51 Recordable Injuries in 2015, representing a Total 
Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (‘TRIFR’) of 1.25 cases per 
million hours worked. This compares to the average TRIFR for 
ICMM members of 4.50 cases per million hours worked in 2014. 
The most common causes of injury at KAZ Minerals’ operations, 
accounting for more than 59% of Recordable Injuries, were falls, 
rock falls and injuries from falling objects, with 47% of Total 
Recordable Injuries occurring in the East Region. These injury 
categories reflect both the hazardous nature of underground 
mining operations and the increased risk faced by our contractors 
when working at height during an intensive period of construction 
activity at the major growth projects in 2015.
On 14 August 2015, a fire occurred in the grinding area of the 
concentrator building at the Bozshakol project. The fire was 
contained within the grinding area and successfully extinguished 
without injury to any person at the site.
On 8 July 2015, a disturbance occurred in the canteen facilities  
of the contractor-controlled camp at Aktogay, which resulted in  
a number of injuries to contractors. No KAZ Minerals employees 
were involved. The contractor resumed activity shortly after the 
incident with no impact on the overall timetable for the project.
Occupational health and disease
There were 42 Recordable Disease Cases across the Group in 
2015, representing a Total Recordable Disease Frequency Rate  
of 1.03 cases per million hours worked. An internal review of the 
Group’s rehabilitation and return-to-work programmes is being 
undertaken to improve performance in this area. An employee 
“wellness” programme is also being planned to improve the 
general health of employees, with the goal of reducing the impact 
of health-related issues that could affect the Group’s employees  
in the longer term.
Environment
Overview and general approach
Following the Restructuring, which completed in October 2014, 
there has been a significant reduction in many of the Group’s 
environmental impacts in 2015 compared to 2014. 
The activities undertaken by the Group are also changing as  
the transition is made from predominantly underground mining 
towards the new large scale open pit operations. This has affected 
the Group’s environmental impacts in 2015 and will continue to 
do so in future years. For example, total waste mining will be 
temporarily higher as stripping is carried out at Bozymchak, 
Bozshakol and Aktogay, whilst energy and water consumption  
will increase as the processing facilities at the major growth 
projects commence operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT
57 The Group continues to participate in the Government of 
Kazakhstan’s CO
2
 cap and trade system, launched in 2014.  
The system issues carbon quotas to entities whose annual  
CO
2
 emissions exceed 20,000 tonnes.
Copper mining and processing are energy-intensive activities and 
can result in significant emissions of both Scope 1 and Scope 2 
CO
2
. However, the Group views the potential for a transition 
towards renewable energy generation and other low carbon 
technologies to be an important element of the Group’s outlook 
on the global market for copper. The supply of copper will be 
essential for establishing a low carbon economy, due to its use  
in power transmission infrastructure, turbines, solar cells, electric 
motors and electrically powered vehicles.
As Bozshakol and Aktogay ramp up, the increase in mining and 
processing activity undertaken by the Group will result in higher 
absolute levels of CO
2
 emissions. However, the new projects 
employ the latest technology in modern, large-scale equipment 
which will significantly improve the Group’s CO
2
 emissions per 
tonne of ore processed. The projects are also located close to  
the land border between Kazakhstan and China, the largest global 
market for copper. By supplying end users in the west of China 
with copper from Kazakhstan transported using existing rail links, 
Scope 3 CO

compared to 2014. As a result of the changes to the asset base 
following the Restructuring, these emissions metrics have now 
been deemed immaterial to the Group’s environmental impact 
and will no longer be reported on. 
Water
From 2015 the Group has further aligned with the definitions 
used by GRI4 for extraction and discharge of water. Total  
water extraction was 15,340 megalitres, consisting of: (i) 6,745 
megalitres extracted from surface water sources (including rivers) 
or from municipal water supplies; (ii) 4,046 megalitres extracted 
from groundwater wells, and (iii) 4,549 megalitres obtained from 
groundwater inflows into underground mines as a natural 
consequence of mining activities. 
Energy use
Electricity and heat energy use in the Group during 2015 has 
increased overall compared to the continuing operations in 2014 
due to higher consumption at the mining projects of Bozymchak, 
Bozshakol and Aktogay. At Bozymchak, energy use has increased 
as processing operations ramped up during the year. Energy use 
has increased at Bozshakol as mining operations commenced in 
2015 for the first time, whilst at Aktogay both mining operations 
and SX/EW processing commenced in 2015. Gross Group 
electricity consumption in 2015, which includes heat energy,  
was 824 GWh, an increase of 15% compared to the continuing 
operations in 2014.
Under the GRI4 definition of total energy consumption, which 
includes electricity, heat energy and solid, liquid or gas fuel 
consumption, total Group energy consumption in 2015 (net  
of heat energy sold) was 4.6 petajoules (PJ), split as follows:
Energy consumption by use (petajoules) 
Electricity  
Heat energy
Diesel
Petrol
Coal
Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group generated 386,239 tonnes of Scope 1 CO
2
 emissions 
and 528,636 tonnes of Scope 2 emissions in 2015. Prior to the 
Restructuring, the Group operated a number of power assets, 
including three captive power stations and Ekibastuz GRES-1,  
the largest power station in Kazakhstan, in which the Group held 
a 50% interest until its sale on 1 April 2014. In 2014, Group CO
2
 
emissions amounted to 12.1 million tonnes of Scope 1 emissions 
with negligible Scope 2 emissions. As the Group no longer 
operates significant power assets it is now a net purchaser of 
power from outside sources, resulting in an increase in Scope 2 
emissions in 2015, and significantly reduced Scope 1 emissions 
compared to the Group’s emissions prior to the Restructuring. 
82% of the Scope 1 CO
2
 emissions in 2015 were due to the 
operation of an energy grid and provision of heat to the mining 
operations in the East Region using coal powered facilities. 
The mining and concentrating operations in the East Region 
accounted for 88% of the Scope 2 emissions, as power is 
purchased from external sources. Mining and processing at 
Bozshakol and Aktogay, where power is also purchased from 
external sources, accounted for 1 1% of Scope 2 emissions as 
mining operations commenced at both of these projects and  
SX/EW processing commenced at Aktogay. Scope 2 emissions  
at Bozshakol and Aktogay will increase in 2016 as mining and 
processing ramp up, in particular at the newly commissioned 
sulphide concentrator at Bozshakol.
Scope 2 emissions at Bozymchak of 3,318 tonnes, making up 1%  
of Group Scope 2 emissions, are considered low for the size of 
the asset as a large proportion of power generated in Kyrgyzstan 
is provided by hydroelectric dams which have zero carbon 
emissions, resulting in a GRI4 country factor for Kyrgyzstan  
of 0.1 1. Bozymchak emitted 10,739 tonnes of Scope 1 CO
2
  
from the use of coal and diesel on site for heating and vehicles.
58 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED The total discharge of water back into the environment was  
6,801 megalitres and took place at three locations in the East 
Region. Two of these locations are at underground mining 
operations which are situated large distances from the processing 
plants, making it uneconomic to pump the water back for re-use. 
The third discharge occurs at waste rock dumps adjacent to a 
closed open pit mine, where acidic drainage water is collected.  
In each of these locations the water is treated prior to release  
to the environment.
KAZ Minerals re-uses as much water as possible. The main re-use 
stream is from final tailings thickeners and from tailings dams. This 
re-use stream represents the majority of the total water input to 
concentrators in the East Region operations, with the only losses 
in the system due to unavoidable evaporation and water bound 
up in tailings. Mine water which would otherwise be discharged  
is re-used at Artemyevsky and Zhezkent in mining backfill plants, 
where water is required to cure concrete backfill.
Each operational site uses a combination of surface water and 
groundwater sources while seeking to use different water sources 
to those used by the local communities. At Bozshakol the main 
source of water is the nearby Satpayev canal. The canal was 
constructed in the 1950s and is fed by the Irtysh river. The canal 
was designed and built specifically for the purpose of supplying 
agriculture and industrial facilities along its route. There is an 
adequate water supply to satisfy the requirements of the project 
and all other users of the system.
The Aktogay project will extract most of the water it requires  
for both oxide ore leaching and sulphide ore processing from 
groundwater sources, which are more than adequate to supply 
the project. As with Bozshakol, the modern sulphide processing 
facilities at Aktogay will minimise water loss through evaporation 
and tailings and will recycle around 80% of process water used  
in the concentrator. The oxide facilities at Aktogay are also 
designed to re-use as much of the process water as possible.  
The only losses are due to unavoidable evaporation in the circuit.
At the Group’s Bozymchak mine, in the mountainous west  
of Kyrgyzstan, there is a plentiful supply of fresh water from 
surface sources for mining and processing activities. The same  
fast flowing water sources are also used to support the 
generation of hydroelectric power in the region. The project 
captures and recycles a high proportion of the process water  
that it uses through a dry tailings facility which produces a filter 
cake consisting of 86% solids, returning captured water back  
to the concentrator for re-use. 
Waste
The Group’s mining operations generated 14.3 MT of waste  
in 2015, consisting predominantly of waste rock from stripping 
activities and tailings from processed ore. There were also  
minor quantities of wastes from water treatment operations  
and general industrial waste. This represents an 80% reduction 
compared to total waste generation in 2014 for the full Group 
before the Restructuring of 72.8 MT. However, compared to the 
waste generated by the continuing operations in 2014, there was 
a 240% increase due to large scale pre-stripping and mining 
operations at Bozshakol and Bozymchak in 2015.
Overburden from stripping works at the Group’s assets in the 
East Region and Bozymchak, which is classified separately from 
tailings and processing waste under GRI4 guidelines, increased 
from 0.9 MT in 2014 to 4.7 MT due to stripping activity at the 
Bozymchak open pit mine, whilst Bozshakol generated 5.2 MT  
of overburden and Aktogay 0.5 MT in 2015. 
The waste recycling rate in 2015 was 5% compared to 33% for 
the continuing operations in 2014. The majority of recycling of 
waste is achieved through the use of tailings in the manufacture  
of cemented backfill. This is a requirement of the mining methods 
used at the Group’s underground mines and if tailings are not 
used it would be necessary to import sand from the external 
environment for this purpose at a higher cost. The reduction in 
the rate of recycling reflects the changes in the Group’s assets 
following the Restructuring, as a number of mature underground 
mines were disposed of which had a higher backfill requirement 
compared to the continuing operations. The reduction in the 
recycling rate in 2015 is also due to stripping activity being 
undertaken at Bozshakol, Aktogay and Bozymchak which  
are all open pit operations that do not require backfill, thereby 
temporarily increasing the amount of waste produced at the 
same time as reducing the Group’s overall recycling rate.
Whilst the removal of overburden is at an elevated level at this 
stage of the development of the Group’s assets, the ratio of 
overburden to ore mined (stripping ratio), over the life of the 
operations at the Group’s projects is very low compared to  
global averages. Bozshakol has a strip ratio of 0.7, Aktogay 0.2  
and Bozymchak 1.8. 
Tailings pose potentially high environmental risks and are a 
priority for the Group. In Kazakhstan tailings management is 
regulated by subsoil law and the Environmental Code. The  
Group currently operates four tailings facilities, which are  
subject to rigorous internal monitoring and risk assessment  
as well as regular inspections by the regulatory authorities. 
3.9 MT of tailings waste was generated at the four concentrator 
sites in the East Region and Bozymchak, compared to 2.8 MT in 
2014, an increase of 39%. The increase was due to the ramp up  
of concentrator operations at Bozymchak and higher throughput 
at the Nikolayevsky concentrator following upgrade works. 
At Bozymchak, tailings are filtered before being transported  
as a filter cake, with a moisture content of approximately 14%,  
by conveyor to the tailings storage facilities. Use of this type of 
facility was considered to be a necessary investment to minimise 
environmental risks after assessing the seismicity of the region 
and the mountainous terrain.
There was minimal tailings waste produced at the Bozshakol  
and Aktogay projects in 2015. At Aktogay production of copper 
commenced, but the oxide SX/EW process which started up  
in December 2015 does not generate tailings waste in its heap 
leaching operation. Leach solution is recycled once copper has 
been extracted and water run-off from the ore heap is collected 
and treated before being re-used in the leaching process.

STRATEGIC REPORT
59 The amount of tailings waste generated by the Group will 
increase in 2016 as the Bozshakol project ramps up. The  
tailings facility at Bozshakol is a modern design which will 
distribute tailings waste centrally in a ‘cone’ shape, allowing  
for more efficient recovery of standing water from around the 
tailings and exerting lower pressure on the walls of the tailings 
storage facility. The Aktogay project will adopt the same approach 
when it starts production from sulphide ore in 2017.
Employees
General approach
The Group seeks to attract and retain skilled staff by offering  
safe working conditions, fair remuneration in line with market 
rates of pay and social benefits packages for its employees  
and their families.
Ethics, compliance, anti-bribery and corruption
KAZ Minerals’ Board holds ultimate responsibility for managing 
our approach to ethics and compliance. The Group anti-bribery 
and corruption policy has been developed in line with the 
requirements of the UK Bribery Act and has been in force across 
all Group operations since 201 1. Employees in relevant positions, 
such as procurement and sales or those whose roles include 
interaction with the Government and regulatory bodies, receive 
training as required. The code and policy are available to 
employees on our intranet portal and as printed leaflets. 
Pay and benefits
We aim to provide fair remuneration to our employees and to 
incentivise safety and productivity. Both operational employee 
and divisional manager remuneration comprise base pay plus a 
discretionary award linked to health and safety performance. 
Divisional manager remuneration also typically includes an 
element of discretionary bonus linked to production efficiency, 
cost control and achieving environmental performance targets. 
Following the devaluation of the tenge on 20 August 2015, the 
Group has monitored closely the effect of local inflation on the 
cost of living for its employees. After allowing a suitable time 
period to elapse following the move to a free floating exchange 
rate, the Group awarded a pay increase to all of its employees  
in Kazakhstan who are remunerated in tenge to compensate  
for the increase in living costs. The award was targeted towards 
helping the employees of the Group who are most vulnerable  
to increases in basic living costs. The Group continues to monitor 
the impact of a weaker local currency on its employees and  
their families.
In accordance with local regulations in Kazakhstan, we are 
required to make payments to employees and former employees 
for illness and disability sustained at our operations. The financial 
impact of this obligation is covered in the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 135 and 136.
Equality and diversity
Our goal is to employ a skilled workforce that reflects the 
demographic of the regions in which we operate. We aim to 
develop the expertise required for our operations from our 
existing workforce, recruiting locally where possible. Our 
operations are located in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and in 2015, 
97% of the Group’s permanent employees were Kazakhstani or 
Kyrgyzstani nationals. In circumstances where specialist skills are 
required, we draw on international expertise with a view to 
transferring knowledge and best practice in the medium to long 
term. The number of expatriates at KAZ Minerals is very limited, 
and they are largely employed at our major growth projects 
working alongside local teams who will take over the management 
of operations in due course. 
Gender balance at our operations is relatively strong compared  
to the global mining industry. Women represent 27% of the  
entire workforce and 27% of senior management level. There  
is one female Director on the Board.
Training and development
Professional Development has been identified as one of the 
Group’s five core values. See page 13 of this report for more 
details of our corporate values. We are committed to ensuring 
that employees continue their professional development, with  
the aim of increasing productivity, efficiency and safety. The 
Group takes a long-term view of building capabilities and 
leadership qualities amongst its staff since these are critical  
to our growth strategy and our aim to transition over time  
to local management at all of our assets.
In 2015, the Group’s employees received on average 22 hours  
of safety-specific training, including mandatory safety training 
required by the regulator in Kazakhstan, which is 40 hours per 
year for supervisory staff and 10 hours for operational staff. 
Employees also received an average of 63 hours of additional 
training reflecting largely on-site training programmes at 
Bozshakol and Aktogay as part of the operational readiness 
campaign and ahead of mining activities commencing. All 
operational training includes a significant health and safety 
component that is not recorded separately as health and safety 
training. Topics covered in training included safe operation  
of machinery and vehicles, electrical and fire safety, labour 
protection training, physical fitness and professional development. 
We are in the process of implementing a new mentoring and 
development programme. A pilot scheme in the East Region  
was launched in 2015 with the intention to extend the programme 
across the Group in 2016. The mentoring programme focuses  
on building technical skills amongst the next generation of  
our employees with the goal of passing on vital knowledge  
and experience.
60 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED Consultation and communication
We respect the right to freedom of association and consult our 
employees and trade unions about changes to our business and 
employment conditions. All employees are entitled to join a union 
of their choice. At the year end, approximately 70% of the 
Group’s employees in Kazakhstan belonged to one of the  
three trade unions active in the mining industry in Kazakhstan.
At Bozshakol and Aktogay we have entered into collective 
agreements directly with employee representatives,  
covering over 1,000 employees recruited to date at our  
new operational sites. 
Health and safety issues are a shared priority between the Group 
and the trade unions that represent our employees. The unions 
engage actively with our sites to address the issue. In line with  
the collective bargaining agreement in place since 2014, a number 
of KAZ Minerals employees have been nominated as safety 
inspectors who report breaches they identify as part of their 
weekly inspections to the trade unions, who then discuss the 
matters with the senior management. Trade unions also play  
an important role in our employee engagement activities,  
helping us to stage sporting and cultural events for our  
employees and the employees of other local companies.
Communities
Social investment
Social responsibility is one of the core aspects of our licence  
to operate. Social provisions are included in subsoil licences  
and historically the Group has provided additional support  
to the communities in the more remote and less economically 
diverse regions of our operations. 
In 2015, Group social investment amounted to $15.2 million, 
including sponsorship, support and donations for community 
projects in the primary regions of our operations as well as 
national projects. The main social projects in the East Region 
were a new haematology centre in the town of Semey, a  
road building project in Glubokovsky district, transfer of a  
cultural centre to the local authorities and the purchase of 
medical equipment for the East Kazakhstan regional hospital  
in Ust-Kamenogorsk.
We continue to work with regional authorities in identifying 
projects that are relevant to our business while benefiting 
communities to the greatest extent possible in the long term.  
Our main focus areas are healthcare, infrastructure development, 
childcare, education and sport.
KAZ Minerals supports local procurement in order to assist 
diverse economic growth within Kazakhstan. We prioritise  
local procurement and only use imported goods and services 
where there is no acceptable locally sourced alternative.
Human rights
KAZ Minerals recognises all human rights as defined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We are committed  
to ensuring our operations do not infringe on these rights, for 
instance by providing fair, safe and secure working conditions in 
line with the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We respect the right 
to freedom of association and consult our employees and trade 
unions about changes to our business and employment conditions. 
Local communities are consulted during project development  
and any major operational changes that may affect them, and  
we respect and protect local heritage and culture. We do  
not tolerate any form of child or forced labour at any of our 
operations. We comply with local legislation with regard to 
employee age, and do not employ anyone under the age of 18.  
As required under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, KAZ Minerals  
is undertaking a review of its operations and supply chain in 2016 
and will report on the results of the review in 2017.
The Strategic Report comprising pages 2 to 61 and including

 68 Governance Framework
 84 Annual Statement on Remuneration
 86 Remuneration Report
 100  Other Statutory Information OUR CULTURE OF
GOVERNANCE
The Board is dedicated to high standards of 
corporate governance in its management of 
the Group’s affairs. It is the responsibility of  
the Board to demonstrate leadership and 
effectiveness and be accountable to its  
shareholders and other stakeholders.
Dear shareholder,
I am delighted to present this overview of the Company’s 
corporate governance framework. I am fully committed to  
good governance and I firmly believe in the benefits a culture  
of governance can bring to the Group, as it underpins our  
ability to deliver our strategy effectively.
UK Corporate Governance Code compliance
The Directors’ Report has been prepared in accordance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code which was issued in 
September 2014 by the Financial Reporting Council (the ‘Code’) 
and is available to view at www.frc.org.uk. I am pleased to report 
that, during the year, the Company complied fully with the 
provisions of the Code. The Governance Framework report set 
out on pages 68 to 83 explains in detail how the Company has 
applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the 
Code. It also provides further details of the matters which the 
Board and its committees considered during the financial year.
The Board considers the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and that it provides the necessary 
information required for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.
Board role and effectiveness
The core objective of the Board is to deliver the long-term 
success of the Company and sustained returns for shareholders. 
This requires the Board to set the Company’s strategic aims, 
oversee the necessary financial and human resource structures, 
review management performance in delivering against strategy 
and set the Company’s risk appetite. The Board ensures that  
the risk management measures and internal controls which  
are in place are appropriate and effective. The Board is aware  
of its obligations to the Company’s shareholders and other 
stakeholders and responds to their needs by transparent 
reporting and active engagement.
Changes to the Board
There were two changes to the Board during 2015. As referred 
to in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, Lord Renwick,  
who had served on the Board as an independent non-executive 
Director since December 2005, stepped down at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2015. Furthermore, 
Clinton Dines stepped down as an independent non-executive 
Director on 31 December 2015 having served on the Board  
for six years. During that time he provided valuable insight and 
assistance in building the strong partnerships in China which have 
helped the Group to deliver its strategic objectives. Please see 
page 82 of the Governance Framework report for further details.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management, including ongoing 
monitoring and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Group, in the 
course of its business activities, is exposed to financial, operational 
and compliance risks. Responsibility for risk management lies with 
the Board, with the Audit Committee having delegated authority 
for overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. More 
detailed information on the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management can be found in the Governance 
Framework report on pages 73 and 74 and the Risk  
Management Overview section on pages 23 and 24.
Corporate values
During 2015, the Group established its corporate values, 
consisting of five guiding principles by which it seeks to conduct its 
business. The principles of safety, long-term efficiency, teamwork, 
professional development and integrity were created following 
feedback from employees. The Board is committed to these 
values in building a strong internal culture, improving relationships 
with external stakeholders and delivering value for shareholders.
64 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Shareholder engagement
Engaging with shareholders is one of the key aspects of  
good corporate governance and it is vital that the views  
and perspectives of our shareholders and other stakeholders  
are taken into consideration. Throughout the year, the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, supported by the 
Group’s investor relations team, regularly meet with institutional 
shareholders and sell-side analysts. The Board also receives 
regular reports from the Head of Investor Relations on  
its activities and, in particular, on shareholder sentiment  
and feedback.
I would encourage as many shareholders as possible to attend the 
Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2016. 
After the formal meeting, my fellow Directors and I welcome the 
opportunity to discuss any comments or questions you may have 
about the Company.
Committee framework
KAZ Minerals has a structured and established corporate 
governance framework in place to support the Board’s aim  
of achieving long-term, sustainable growth for shareholders.  
As a Board, we continually review this framework to ensure  
that it remains appropriate.
The Board has four principal committees to deal with specific 
aspects of the Group’s affairs: Audit Committee; Health, Safety 
and Environment Committee; Remuneration Committee; and 
Nomination Committee. Detailed information on the roles and 
responsibilities, and the activities undertaken during the year by 
each committee is set out in the respective sections as referred 
to below.
I look forward to leading the Board through a time of delivery  
and growth for the business and maintaining our culture of  
strong corporate governance.

The non-executive Directors provide a strong independent 
element to the Board and a solid foundation for good  
corporate governance. Although all Directors are equally 
accountable under the law for the stewardship of the  
Company’s affairs, the non-executive Directors fulfil  
a vital role in corporate accountability. 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Executive Directors 2
Non-independent non-executive Director 1
Chairman 1
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The non-executive Directors have responsibility for 
constructively challenging the strategies proposed by the 
executive Directors and scrutinising the performance of 
management in achieving agreed goals and objectives. They  
also play a key role in the functioning of the Board and its 
committees. Between them, the current non-executive Directors 
have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, knowledge and 
independent judgement to undertake their roles effectively. See 
pages 66 and 67 for a description of the skills and experience  
of each non-executive Director.
Effectiveness
Composition of the Board
Effective management and good stewardship of the Group  
are led by the Board. The Board is currently comprised of  
the Chairman, two executive Directors and five non-executive 
Directors. The balance of Directors on the Board ensures that  
no individual or small group of Directors can dominate the 
decision-making process and that the interests of minority 
shareholders are protected. Biographies of all Directors  
are set out on pages 66 and 67.
It is the Company’s policy that at least half the Board, excluding 
the Chairman, should be independent non-executive Directors. 
Other than Vladimir Kim, the Board considers each of its current 
non-executive Directors to be independent in character and 
judgement. In reaching its determination of independence, the 
Board has concluded that each of Lynda Armstrong, Michael 
Lynch-Bell, John MacKenzie and Charles Watson provides 
objective challenge to management, is willing to stand up and 
defend his or her own beliefs and viewpoints in order to support 
the ultimate good of the Company and has no business or other 
interests which are likely to, or could appear to, affect their 
judgement. The Board carries out a review of the independence 
of its Directors on an annual basis. Vladimir Kim is not considered 
by the Board to be independent due to his significant shareholding

Commitment
Directors are expected to attend every Board meeting and  
every meeting of any committee of which they are a member, 
unless there are exceptional circumstances preventing their 
attendance. Scheduled Board and committee meetings are 
arranged at least a year in advance to allow Directors to  
manage other commitments.
Directors are provided with the relevant Board or committee 
papers for consideration around seven days in advance of each 
meeting via an electronic board portal. Regular agenda items  
this year included: reports on health, safety and environmental 
matters; cash forecasts; updates on Bozshakol, Aktogay and 
Bozymchak; requests for capital expenditure approval; reports on 
operational and financial performance, including cost optimisation 
measures; updates on the Group’s principal risks and risk

DIRECTORS’ REPORT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED management processes; updates on business development 
projects; corporate communications; changes in corporate 
governance; and reports received from Board committees.  
If a Director is unable to attend a meeting due to exceptional 
circumstances, he or she still receives the papers in advance of  
the meeting and has the opportunity to discuss with the relevant 
chair or the Company Secretary any matters he or she wishes to 
raise and to follow up on the decisions taken at the meeting. The 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Company Secretary are always 
available to discuss issues relating to meetings or other matters 
with the Directors. Reasons for non-attendance are generally 
prior business or personal commitments that cannot be  
re-arranged or illness.
The number of scheduled Board meetings which each Director 
was eligible to attend, and the number of meetings attended 
during 2015, is shown below:

on 1 March 2015.

of the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2015.
Vladimir Kim missed one Board meeting due to a conflict in 
schedules. He provided any comments to the Chairman or 
Company Secretary on matters to be discussed in advance  
of the meeting he missed.
In addition to the six scheduled meetings of the Board during  
the year, one further meeting was held which focused solely  
on a review of the Group’s strategy and associated principal risks.
Development
On appointment, all new Directors receive a comprehensive and 
structured induction, tailored to their individual requirements. 
The induction programme, which is arranged by the Company 
Secretary, includes visits to the Group’s businesses and meetings 
with senior managers and external advisers, as appropriate. The 
programme is designed to facilitate their understanding of the 
Group, the key drivers of business performance, the role of  
the Board and its committees, and the Company’s corporate 
governance practices and procedures, as well as providing  
them with appropriate training and guidance as to their duties, 
responsibilities and liabilities as a director of a public limited 
company listed on the London Stock Exchange, Hong Kong  
Stock Exchange and Kazakhstan Stock Exchange.
To assist Directors in the performance of their duties, there are 
procedures in place to provide them with appropriate and timely 
information, including receiving information between meetings 
regarding Group business development and financial 
performance. This enables the Directors to discharge their duties 
effectively on strategic, financial, operational, compliance and 
governance issues.
Where appropriate, additional training and updates on particular 
issues are provided. During the year, the Board received briefings 
on changes to the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Rules and 
Transparency Rules, amendments to the Companies Act 2006 
and the Company’s proposed approach to compliance with the 
requirement in the UK Corporate Governance Code to make a 
long-term viability statement in its Annual Report and Accounts.
All Directors are provided with the opportunity for, and 
encouraged to attend, training to ensure they are kept up  
to date on relevant legal and financial developments or changes  
in best practice. Typical training for Directors includes attendance 
at seminars, forums, conferences and working groups as well  
as receiving updates from relevant bodies or external advisers  
or specialists on various legal, regulatory and corporate 
governance matters.
The Board receives regular reports on shareholder sentiment 
from the Head of Investor Relations to ensure the Board as a 
whole remains informed of the current views of shareholders.  
All non-executive Directors can attend shareholder meetings  
and analyst presentations and shareholders may meet informally 
with all Directors at the Annual General Meeting.
Information and support
The Company Secretary, through the Chairman, is responsible  
for advising the Board on all governance matters and for ensuring 
that Board procedures are followed, applicable rules and 
regulations are complied with and that due account is taken  
of relevant codes of best practice. The Company Secretary is  
also responsible for ensuring communication flows between the  
Board and its committees, and between senior management and 
non-executive Directors. All Directors have access to the advice 
of the Company Secretary and, in appropriate circumstances,  
may obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board as a whole. The 
Company Secretary is Stephen Hodges, who joined the Group  
in 2007 as Deputy Company Secretary and was appointed to  
his current position in May 2014. Stephen Hodges is an Associate 
of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators  
and is secretary to all of the Board committees, except the Audit 
Committee. The secretary to the Audit Committee is Susanna 
Freeman, Deputy Company Secretary.
Performance evaluation
As reported in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, in  
line with the Company’s policy and in compliance with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, a full Board 
performance evaluation process of the Board and its committees, 
facilitated by an independent external consultant, was carried  
out during the year. An externally facilitated annual performance 
evaluation of the Board and its committees is carried out every 
three years, with internal annual performance evaluations carried 
out for the intervening years. The previous externally facilitated 
annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees 
was conducted in 2012.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 71 The externally facilitated annual performance evaluation 
conducted in 2015 was carried out by Independent Audit Limited, 
who has no other connection with the Company. The process 
was structured in order to assist in identifying potential areas of 
opportunity for the Board and its committees to improve their 
performance. Tailored questionnaires on the performance of the 
Board, its committees and individual Directors were completed 
by all Directors (excluding John MacKenzie, who was appointed  
to the Board on 1 March 2015, and Lord Renwick, who stepped 
down from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting on 7 May 2015), and Independent Audit Limited attended 
a Board meeting to conduct a Board observation exercise.
The questionnaire on the performance of the Board focused on:
• approach to strategy and risk evaluation;
• leadership and accountability;
• composition and capability;
• organisational behaviour and culture;
• understanding of business drivers and monitoring  
of performance;
• risk management and internal control; and
• effectiveness of Board meetings.
Based on the responses received to the questionnaires and the 
results from the Board observation exercise, Independent Audit 
Limited prepared a thorough report which was presented to the 
Board at its meeting in October 2015. The overall conclusion  
was that the Board and its committees were operating effectively.  
A small number of potential improvement areas were identified 
and, where appropriate, are being incorporated into the Board 
and committee processes.
During the year, the Chairman held a number of meetings with 
non-executive Directors without executive Directors being 
present. The Senior Independent Director also led the non-
executive Directors in evaluating the performance of the 
Chairman. Following the evaluation, the Board remains  
satisfied that the Chairman continues to be able to fulfil  
all of the commitments required of the role.
Re-election
Directors newly appointed by the Board are required to submit 
themselves for election by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting following their appointment. In accordance with best 
practice and the UK Corporate Governance Code, all current 
Directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Vladimir Kim (non-executive Director) and Eduard Ogay (former 
executive Director of the Company) are deemed to be acting in 
concert with each other by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. 
Together, they are taken to constitute a ‘Concert Party’ for the 
purposes of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. Under  
the Listing Rules, a concert party is classed as a ‘controlling 
shareholder’ of the Company. This means that the independent 
non-executive Directors of the Company must be elected  
or re-elected by a majority of votes cast by all shareholders. 
Therefore, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the 
resolutions for the re-election of the independent non-executive 
Directors will be taken on a poll and passed only if a majority  
of votes cast by independent shareholders (which excludes the 
Concert Party), in addition to a majority of the votes cast by all 
shareholders, are in favour.
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
have or could have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or 
may conflict with the interests of the Company. The Company’s 
Articles of Association give the Directors authority to approve 
such situations and there is no breach of duty by a Director if the 
relevant situation has been authorised in advance. In addition, a 
Director has a duty to disclose to the Board any transaction or 
arrangement under consideration by the Company in which he  
or she has a personal interest.
The Board has a procedure for authorising conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest. Under this procedure, Directors are required 
to declare all directorships or other appointments outside the 
Group which could give rise to a conflict or potential conflict  
of interest. In considering each conflict or potential conflict of 
interest declared by a Director, only independent Directors  
will be able to authorise the conflict. They may also decide  
not to authorise the conflict or to authorise it subject to certain 
appropriate limits or conditions. In taking these decisions the 
independent Directors must act in a way they consider to  
be in good faith and most likely to promote the success of the 
Company. The Company Secretary minutes the consideration  
of any conflict or potential conflict of interest that is raised  
and authorisations granted and maintains a register of conflicts  
of interest.
In addition to notifying the Company Secretary of any new, actual 
or potential conflict of interest that may arise, a Director must 
also notify the Company Secretary if there are any changes in 
circumstances that may affect any existing authorisation. Even 
when authorisation is given, a Director continues to have a duty 
to promote the success of the Company.
72 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED Furthermore, the Company’s Articles of Association include 
provisions relating to the treatment of third-party confidential 
information and the circumstances in which a Director should 
absent himself or herself from Board meetings and/or refrain 
from reviewing Board papers where that Director is conflicted,  
in order to protect him or her from a breach of duty. These 
provisions will only apply where the circumstance giving rise to 
the potential conflict of interest has previously been authorised  
by the Directors.
UK Bribery Act 2010 (the ‘Bribery Act’)
The Bribery Act established criminal offences for bribing another 
person, receiving a bribe, bribing foreign officials and failure by 
commercial organisations to prevent bribery. In response to this 
legislation, in 201 1 the Group implemented a Group Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Compliance Programme (the ‘Programme’) to 
assist in the prevention of the involvement of individuals or Group 
entities in unlawful activities. The Board has a clear stance on 
bribery and corruption and attaches the utmost importance  
to the Programme in clarifying the standards expected of all 
employees of the Group wherever it conducts business.
The Programme includes a clear statement on anti-bribery and 
corruption, which is fully supported by the Board, by the use of: 
corruption risk assessments across the Group; clear and practical 
policies and procedures; due diligence of business partners; 
training; and monitoring and assurance by external advisers, as 
well as by the internal audit team. As part of the Programme,  
a number of Group policies were established including an 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Code, a Facilitation Payments  
Policy, a Gifts and Hospitality Policy, a Third Party Due Diligence 
Compliance Programme, a Conflicts of Interest Policy and a 
Speak-Up Policy. Furthermore, to supplement the existing Group 
policies, additional Group policies have been established including 
a lobbying policy, a policy on dealing with public officials, a policy 
on sponsorship and a policy on charitable contributions.
Since 2012, the Company has engaged an external consultant, 
GoodCorporation, on an annual basis to perform an independent 
review of the adequacy of the Programme in meeting the 
requirements of the Bribery Act. The annual reviews in 2012, 
2013 and 2014 concluded that many of the important key 
compliance milestones had been accomplished and a number  
of important positive changes had been made to procedures 
within the Group and provided recommendations for further 
improvement, which the Group has sought to implement.
In light of the change to the Group’s business profile following the 
Restructuring in 2014, it has undertaken a review of the current 
Programme, including all policies and procedures, to ensure that  
it remains adequate in meeting the requirements of the Bribery 
Act. Following this review a number of actions have been taken  
to enhance and further embed the Programme, including 
re-conducting risk assessments across the Group’s major  
business units to identify those areas of the business and those 
employees in positions which are at most exposure to bribery 
and corruption and reviewing the current training programme  
to ensure that the content remains appropriate and that there  
is a clear plan for the training of all Group employees. 
GoodCorporation assisted with the development of a robust 
training programme, tailored to the Kazakhstan environment  
and the requirements of the Group, and training has been given 
to priority staff. It is planned that all staff, even those employees 
that are deemed to be low risk, will be trained during 2016.
Related party transactions policy
Following completion of the Restructuring in 2014, the Group 
implemented a policy on concluding transactions with the 
Kazakhmys group due to Vladimir Kim’s substantial shareholdings 
in both the KAZ Minerals Group and the Kazakhmys group. The 
policy is to remind all KAZ Minerals employees of their obligations 
under the Listing Rules that all arrangements, contracts and 
transactions between any KAZ Minerals Group company and  
any Kazakhmys group company must be carried out on an arm’s 
length basis and on normal commercial terms. The Related Party 
Transactions Policy was reviewed and updated during the year 
and the processes followed have been monitored and 
improvements made where required.
Competition policy
A competition policy was launched following completion of  
the Restructuring. The policy applies to any dealings between  
the KAZ Minerals Group and the Kazakhmys group and their 
employees as the two groups are competitors. The aim of the 
policy is to prevent anti-competitive behaviour. Prior approval  
is required internally within the KAZ Minerals Group before any 
Group company enters into any arrangement with a Kazakhmys 
group company.
Accountability
The Board considers the Annual Report and Accounts, taken  
as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the necessary information required for shareholders to assess  
the Company’s position and performance, business model  
and strategy, and that the business continues to operate as  
a going concern.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and  
extent of any significant risks the Group is willing to take in  
order to achieve its strategic objectives and maintain sound  
risk management and internal control systems to ensure that  
an appropriate culture is embedded throughout the Group. The 
Board has established a Group-wide system of risk management 
and internal control which identifies and enables management and 
the Board to evaluate and manage the Group’s principal risks with 
a view to safeguarding the Group’s stakeholders. This system is 
bespoke to the Company’s particular needs and the risks to which 
it is exposed and is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk. 
Due to the limitations inherent in any system of internal control, 
this system provides robust, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control is regularly reviewed by the Board.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 73 The Board confirms that throughout the year ended  
31 December 2015 and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report and Accounts, there have been rigorous processes in 
place to identify, evaluate and manage the principal risks faced by 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity in accordance with the 
Guidance on Risk Management and Internal Control published by 
the Financial Reporting Council.
To assist in the identification and management of the Group’s 
principal risks, the Board has established a risk management 
framework, developed a system of regular reports from 
management and reserved specific key matters for its decision. 
The Board has authorised the Audit Committee to oversee the 
risk management framework and the effectiveness of the Group’s 
financial reporting, internal control and assurance systems.
At each of its meetings the Board is presented with an update  
for its consideration on the Group’s principal risks together  
with a risk map, highlighting any changes made since the previous 
update and the reasons for any changes. Each committee that 
reports regularly to the Board provides an update on the status 
of risks considered within its remit. Bi-annually, the Group’s risk 
management framework is reviewed by the Board, together with 
the process for identifying and assessing risks and a detailed 
analysis of the risks identified in the previous six months.
All of the Group’s internal control and corporate governance 
policies and procedures are contained in a single document 
entitled ‘Group Policy Guidelines on Corporate Governance’  
with the aim of ensuring there is a good and clear awareness  
of the policies and procedures and their content amongst 
senior management.
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control  
which have operated throughout the year are:
• monitoring by the Board of a comprehensive reporting system, 
including monthly results, periodic short-term forecasts, annual 
budgets and medium-term plans;
• well-defined procedures for assessment, approval, control  
and monitoring of major capital projects, including acquisitions 
and disposals;
• an established methodology for ranking the level of risk in  
each of the Group’s business operations and the principal  
risks associated therewith;
• implementation of appropriate strategies to deal with principal 
risks, including careful internal monitoring and ensuring that 
external specialists are consulted where necessary;
• a centrally coordinated internal audit programme to verify that 
policies and internal control procedures are being correctly 
implemented and to identify any risks at an early stage;
• financial, treasury, operating, compliance and administrative 
policies and procedures which incorporate statements of 
required behaviour;
• ongoing review of safety, operating and financial performance  
of the Group’s businesses;
• regular reports to the Board and Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee on health, safety and environmental matters;
• reviewing the Speak-Up policy and monitoring the operation  
of the whistleblowing facilities in place to allow staff to raise 
concerns about possible legal, regulatory, financial reporting  
or any other improprieties;
• regular reports to the Audit Committee on the adequacy  
and effectiveness of internal control;
• regular reports to the Projects Assurance Committee on 
progress against targets of the Group’s major growth projects  
at Bozshakol and Aktogay; and
• a remuneration policy for executives which motivates them 
appropriately, without encouraging excessive risk-taking.
The Board, in conjunction with management, continually reviews 
and develops the internal control environment. No significant 
internal control failings were identified during the year. Where 
any gaps are identified, processes are put in place to address them 
and these are continually monitored.
It is Group policy that all acquired businesses are brought within 
the Group’s system of internal control as soon as practicable and 
in any event within 12 months of acquisition.
The Group’s approach to risk management, the risks identified 
and how it profiles these risks is set out in the Risk Management 
Overview and Principal Risks on pages 23 to 34.
Internal audit
Internal audit advises management on the extent to which 
systems of internal control are adequate and effective to manage 
business risk, safeguard the Group’s resources, and ensure 
compliance with the Group’s policies and legal and regulatory 
requirements as well as advising on ways in which areas of risk  
can be addressed. It provides objective assurance on risk and 
controls to senior management, the Audit Committee and the 
Board. Internal audit’s work is focused on the Group’s principal risks 
and the Head of Internal Audit and the Group Risk Manager work 
together when considering the internal audits to be performed. The 
mandate and programme of work of the internal audit department 
is considered and approved by the Audit Committee. Based on  
the approved internal audit plan, a number of internal audits took 
place across the Group’s operations and functions to facilitate 
improvement of the Group’s internal controls and findings were 
reported to relevant operational management. Internal audit follows 
up on the implementation of recommendations and reports on 
progress to senior management and to the Audit Committee.
The Head of Internal Audit reports regularly to the chair of the 
Audit Committee and attends each Audit Committee meeting  
to present the internal control findings from the internal audits 
performed. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses the 
effectiveness of internal audits on an annual basis with the  
Head of Internal Audit and the chair of the Audit Committee  
is responsible for reviewing the remuneration of the Head  
of Internal Audit.
Modern Slavery Act 2015
The Board recognises the importance of the provisions of the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Directors aim to ensure that 
slavery and human trafficking have no part in the Group’s supply 
chain. The Group has always been vigilant about employee 
welfare and aims to be transparent in its practices. 
74 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The Board endeavours to ensure good communication with all its 
shareholders and maintains an active dialogue with its key financial 
audiences including institutional shareholders, sell-side analysts, 
private individuals and potential new shareholders. The Head  
of Investor Relations is in communication with shareholders  
on a day-to-day basis and the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer are closely involved in planned investor relations activities 
at key times throughout the year. The Board is provided with 
shareholder and broader market feedback from the Head of 
Investor Relations at each Board meeting.
The executive Directors are available, through the Head of 
Investor Relations, to discuss the concerns of major shareholders 
at any time and the Chairman is available to discuss governance 
and strategy with them. Non-executive Directors make themselves 
available to attend meetings with shareholders when requested, 
in order to develop an understanding of their views. The 
Company responds as necessary to requests it receives  
from individual shareholders on a wide range of issues.
There is regular contact with key institutional shareholders, 
external financing providers and sell-side analysts to discuss the 
strategy, financial performance and investment activities of the 
Group. Meetings with management are also supplemented by 
visits to the Group’s operations, which are well attended. During 
2015, executive Directors and senior management held meetings 
with institutional investors in the United Kingdom, continental 
Europe and the United States of America and attended 
conferences in these locations, providing a comprehensive 
dialogue with shareholders.
During 2015, the Company issued quarterly production updates 
in January, April, July and October and interim management 
statements in April and October. These, together with copies  
of institutional analyst presentations each half year, the Group’s 
preliminary and half-yearly results and all announcements issued 
to the London Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange  
(in English and in Chinese), are available on the Company’s 
website (www.kazminerals.com).
Annual General Meetings
The Notice of Annual General Meeting is circulated to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days prior to such meeting and  
it is Company policy not to combine resolutions. All shareholders 
are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting where there  
is an opportunity for individual shareholders to question the 
Chairman and, through him, the chairs of the principal Board 
committees. After the Annual General Meeting, shareholders  
can meet informally with the Directors.
At the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman provides a  
brief summary of the Company’s activities for the previous  
year to shareholders. All resolutions at the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting were voted on by way of a poll. The procedure for voting 
on a poll follows best practice and allows the Company to count 
all votes rather than just those of the shareholders attending  
the meeting.
As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code, all 
resolutions proposed at the 2015 Annual General Meeting were 
voted separately and the voting results, which included all votes 
cast for, against and those withheld, together with all proxies 
lodged prior to the meeting, were announced to the London 
Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange and made 
available on the Company’s website as soon as practicable  
after the meeting. As in previous years, the Form of Proxy  
clearly advised that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and  
is not used in calculating the votes for or against a resolution.
Board committees
The four principal committees of the Board are: Audit; Health, 
Safety and Environment; Nomination; and Remuneration. Board 
committee members are appointed by the Board upon the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which reviews 
the composition of each committee regularly. The committee 
memberships are spread between the independent non-
executive Directors, drawing on each of their relevant skills  
and experience.
Committee members are expected to attend each committee 
meeting, unless there are exceptional circumstances which 
prevent them from doing so. Only members of the committees 
are entitled to attend their meetings, but others may be invited  
to attend.
The terms of reference of each committee are reviewed  
annually and are available to view on the Company’s website 
(www.kazminerals.com) and can be obtained on request from  
the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered office.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 75 AUDIT COMMITTEE
Dear shareholder,
I am chair of the Audit Committee and have extensive 
experience in the metals and mining sector, having spent  
38 years with Ernst & Young developing and later leading  
its global mining and energy practices, providing me with 
recent and relevant financial experience.
The other members of the Committee are Charles Watson 
who has been a member since 201 1 and John MacKenzie, 
who joined the Committee on 1 January 2016. Clinton Dines 
was also a member of the Committee throughout the year 
until he stepped down from the Board on 31 December 
2015. I would like to thank Clinton on behalf of the 
Committee for his valuable contribution and for sharing 
the experience he gained during his career in several senior 
management positions in the global resources sector. I would 
like to welcome John as a member of the Committee who, 
with more than 23 years’ experience as a senior mining 
executive, brings extensive operational knowledge of the 
copper mining industry to the Committee’s deliberations.
During 2015, the Committee reviewed the Group’s financial 
results, including significant financial reporting estimates and 
judgements, as well as the financial disclosures in the interim 
management statements, monitored the Group’s system of 
internal control and management of the Group’s risks and 
oversaw the relationship with the external auditor and with 
the internal audit function. This year, the Committee also 
considered the process through which the Company would 
make its first long-term viability statement in the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
In my role as chair of the Committee I meet regularly  
with our external auditor, KPMG, outside the normal 
meeting schedule and with various senior managers  
both in the UK and Kazakhstan to further understand  
the way in which the Group operates, the risks it faces  
and its internal control framework.
I would like to acknowledge the Projects Assurance 
Committee which assists the Committee in engaging 
independent consultants to perform operational and  
financial assessments of the Group’s major growth projects 
at Bozshakol and Aktogay in order to identify activities that 
are critical to the successful delivery of the projects as well  
as any issues and risks that could prevent such delivery.
Michael Lynch-Bell
Chair, Audit Committee
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee reports to the Board on its assessment 
of effective governance in financial reporting, internal control  
and assurance processes and on the procedures in place for  
the identification and management of risk.
The current members of the Committee are:
Michael Lynch-Bell, Chair  
John MacKenzie 
Charles Watson
The primary responsibilities of the Committee are set out on the 
following page. Whilst the Committee has very specific duties set 
out in its terms of reference, it serves a much greater purpose in 
reassuring shareholders that their interests are properly protected 
in respect of the Company’s financial management and reporting. 
The Committee regularly reports to the Board on matters 
discussed at its meetings. The Board has delegated responsibility  
to the Committee for reviewing the Company’s procedures and 
system of internal control in relation to risk management, with a 
focus on the methodology used by management. It also oversees 
the internal and external audit processes which report to it.
The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, Chief Financial 
Officer, Company Secretary, Head of Internal Audit and the 
external auditor are normally invited to attend Committee 
meetings. At the end of each meeting the Committee meets 
separately with both the external auditor and Head of Internal 
Audit, without management being present, to discuss any matters 
relating to its remit and any issues arising from external and 
internal audits.
External auditor
Following a formal, competitive tender process for the provision 
of external audit services conducted in 2012, the Board approved 
the Committee’s recommendation to appoint KPMG Audit Plc  
as external auditor of the Group. In 2014, KPMG Audit Plc 
formally changed the entity which conducts the Company’s  
audit to KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) and KPMG continues to be  
the Company’s external auditor.

AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES
76 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED The appointment of KPMG is kept under annual review and the 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit 
process during the year. Consideration was given to performance, 
objectivity, independence, resource and relevant experience of 
the external auditor and following discussion of improvement 
opportunities identified, the Committee recommended to the 
Board the re-appointment of KPMG as the Company’s external 
auditor. The Group continues to benefit from the insight and 
knowledge that the external auditor has of its business processes 
and controls and therefore the Board has approved resolutions  
to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting,  
to re-appoint KPMG as the Company’s external auditor and  
to authorise the Directors to set KPMG’s remuneration.
Mr Daboo is currently the lead audit engagement partner but  
his five year rotation period will be complete at the end of the 
2016 financial year and his successor will be identified during the 
course of the year. In accordance with regulations on tendering 
audit contracts at least every 10 years, it is the current intention 
of the Committee that the external audit is put out to tender  
by 2022 at the latest, subject to any further regulatory change.
Attendance at Audit Committee meetings
During 2015, there were six scheduled meetings of the Audit 
Committee, including two meetings which were convened  
to discuss one item of business only, the financial disclosures  
in the interim management statements, with each member 
attending as shown below:

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 77 Policy on the provision of non-audit services
The Committee’s policy on the use of the external auditor for 
non-audit services includes the identification of non-audit services 
which may be provided and those prohibited, as well as a process 
through which other non-audit services may be approved.
Any project or engagement with the external auditor in excess  
of £20,000, that is not included in the list of those non-audit 
services which may be provided by the external auditor, must  
be approved in advance by the Committee or a sub-committee 
of any two members. Any services up to a limit of £20,000  
must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer.
Any new engagement with the external auditor for non-audit 
services in excess of £100,000 must be approved in advance  
by the Chief Financial Officer and the Committee chair or a 
sub-committee of any two members, with any non-audit services 
up to a limit of £100,000 being approved by the Chief Financial 
Officer. In addition, any non-audit services in excess of £100,000 
must be subject to a competitive tender process other than in 
respect of certain types of services.
The policy requires that non-audit services of the external auditor 
will only be used where the Group benefits in a cost-effective 
manner and the external auditor maintains the necessary degree 
of independence and objectivity. Details of all non-audit services 
are reported to the Committee. The policy is kept under review 
and is amended from time to time as necessary.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor for audit  
and non-audit services for the year ended 31 December 2015  
and information on the nature of non-audit fees appear in note  
10 to the consolidated financial statements on page 127.
Projects Assurance Committee
The Projects Assurance Committee procures third-party, 
independent operational and financial assessments of the Group’s 
major growth projects at Bozshakol and Aktogay which this year, 
as in previous years, included site visits.
The Projects Assurance Committee currently comprises Charles 
Watson (chair), Oleg Novachuk, Lynda Armstrong and John 
MacKenzie and it met four times during 2015. The significant 
issues the Projects Assurance Committee considered during  
2015 related to monitoring the health, safety and environmental 
performance during the construction phase of the projects, 
reviewing the performance of the contractors against the 
respective project’s schedule and approved budget, assessing  
the health, safety and environmental procedures and process  
to be put in place and overall operational readiness, including the 
permitting process, and receiving details of the cause of the fire 
incident at Bozshakol, the initial assessment of the fire damage and 
mitigating actions to be taken and revised schedule to completion 
of construction. The Projects Assurance Committee also received

78 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED Significant judgements considered by the Audit Committee
The Committee considered, amongst other matters, a number of significant judgements in relation to the financial reporting of the 
Group, including:
Significant issue Committee action
Going concern and viability statement
It is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2015. In reaching this conclusion, management took  
into account the financial position of the Group and its forecast cash  
flows and made certain assumptions and judgements as set out in the  
basis of preparation note to the financial statements on page 115 and  
in the Strategic Report on page 52.
This Annual Report and Accounts also includes, for the first time, a 
long-term viability statement in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Management considered the Group’s long-term 
viability statement, in addition to and together with the going concern 
statement, which is set out on page 101.
The Committee considered and approved the underlying 
assumptions used in the preparation of the long-term 
viability statement, together with the going concern 
assumption. After reviewing papers prepared by 
management and taking into account the external auditor’s 
review of the papers and their assumptions, the Committee 
concluded that it was appropriate to prepare the accounts 
on a going concern basis. The Committee considered the 
long-term viability statement and going concern statement 
and approved management’s disclosures.
Impairments – Group
At 30 June 2015, the Group’s net asset value was above its market 
capitalisation and in response management undertook impairment 
indicator reviews on certain of the Group’s cash generating units. 
Following the review, no impairments were required.
At 31 December 2015, the decline in the copper price was considered an 
impairment indicator for the Group’s cash generating units. Accordingly, 
impairment reviews were performed on the cash generating units. 
Following the impairment reviews, no impairments were required.
The Committee considered papers setting out the results 
of the impairment reviews and management’s assessment 
and assumptions. Having received input from the external 
auditor and challenged the appropriateness of key 
assumptions used by management in the discounted  
cash flow models and evaluated the sensitivity of the 
outcomes of the reviews, the Committee agreed with 
management’s assessment and disclosures.
Impairments – KAZ Minerals PLC
An impairment review of the investments held on the Company’s 
stand-alone balance sheet at 31 December 2015 was performed,  
as the significant reduction in the Company’s share price during the 
second half of the year was an impairment indicator. Following the  
review, KAZ Minerals PLC recognised an impairment charge on its 
stand-alone balance sheet. 
The Committee considered papers setting out the results 
of the impairment review and management’s assessment 
and assumptions. Having received input from the external 
auditor and challenged the appropriateness of key 
assumptions used by management in the discounted cash 
flow models and evaluated the sensitivity of the outcomes 
of the reviews, the Committee agreed with management’s 
assessment and disclosures.
Impact of the tenge free float on goods and service contracts in Kazakhstan
The Group’s Kazakhstan entities have entered into various contracts  
for goods and services, including construction contracts for the major 
projects, which are settled in tenge but are indexed to the US dollar. 
These indexation clauses have been determined to be embedded 
derivatives that are closely related to the underlying contracts and  
have not been accounted for separately. This results in liabilities  
arising under these contracts being accounted for as though they  
were denominated in US dollars.
Having discussed and reviewed management’s papers,  
the Committee concurred with the accounting treatment.  
Consideration and assessment of tax matters of the Group
Owing to the evolving nature of tax legislation and its application in 
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, management is required to make judgements 
and estimates in relation to tax risks, the outcomes of which can be less 
predictable than in other jurisdictions. Management has determined its 
best estimates for taxes payable and the likelihood and timing of taxes 
receivable, and accounted therefor accordingly. 
The Committee considered papers prepared by 
management and, taking into account the external  
auditor’s review of the papers and their assumptions,  
and having considered the tax development updates 
presented, concluded that taxes payable and receivable 
have been appropriately measured and disclosed.
Commercial production at Bozymchak
The Bozymchak mine commenced production in 2014 following which  
it was considered to be in the “pre-commercial production” stage, with 
revenues and operating costs capitalised to fixed assets. Management 
assessed the current status of the mine and processing plant, its 
performance to date and the optimisation plans scheduled for later  
in 2015 and determined that Bozymchak had achieved commercial 
production on 1 July 2015. 
The Committee considered papers prepared by 
management and, taking into account the external  
auditor’s review of the papers and their assumptions, 
concluded that the judgement adopted and applied in 
identifying achievement of commercial production at 
Bozymchak was appropriate.

Dear shareholder,
I chair the Health, Safety and Environment Committee.  
I have over 30 years of experience in the extractives 
industry. The other members of the Committee are Lynda 
Armstrong, Simon Heale and John MacKenzie, who joined 
the Committee on 1 March 2015 following his appointment 
as an independent non-executive Director. Clinton Dines 
was also a member of the Committee during the year until 
his resignation from the Board on 31 December 2015. I 
would like to thank Clinton on behalf of the Committee  
for his valuable insight and assistance in working to improve 
the Group’s health and safety performance and would like  
to welcome John as a member of the Committee who has 
extensive international operating experience in the metals 
and mining sector.
Following completion of the Restructuring in October 2014, 
the Committee undertook a review of its future role and 
direction to ensure it was positioned to meet its remit in  
an effective manner. This resulted in a number of changes  
to the format of the Committee meetings.
During 2015, the Committee reviewed and evaluated 
reports on the implementation and effectiveness of a 
number of health, safety and environmental policies and 
procedures. The Committee also addressed leadership 
behaviour and cultural change issues during its meetings.  
Our Health, Safety and Environment team led by the Group 
Health and Safety Director has performed safety and 
environmental reviews at the operations in the East Region 
as well as working with the health and safety departments at 
Bozshakol and Aktogay as they move from the construction 
phase through to operations. The team has expert health 
and safety experience gained from working within the mining 
industry and has initiated important improvements to the 
processes in place.
In 2015, the Committee visited Bozshakol and Aktogay 
where we met with locally based staff and contractors to 
understand better the risks faced by employees, contractors, 
the environment and the Group facilities.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 81 Responsibilities
The current members of the Committee are:
Simon Heale, Chairman 
Lynda Armstrong 
Michael Lynch-Bell
The Committee is primarily responsible for leading the  
process for Board and committee appointments and for  
keeping under review the balance of skills, experience, 
independence, knowledge and general diversity on the  
Board to ensure the balance and composition of the  
Board and its committees remains appropriate.
The Committee, which provides a rigorous, formal and 
transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors  
to the Board, generally consults with external consultants and 
advisers on prospective Board appointments. The Committee 
keeps under review the planned and progressive refreshing of  
the Board and its committees. Under its recruitment process,  
the Committee prepares a description of the specific experience 
and skills needed for an appointment, considers candidates put 
forward by external consultants, and recommends to the Board 
the appointment of any new Directors after having met short-
listed candidates. It also supervises and puts in place succession 
planning for non-executive Directors and certain senior managers 
and, where appropriate, makes recommendations to the Board 
on Directors’ conflicts of interest for authorisation.
Governance
The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Company and, 
whilst he is not deemed to be independent, the majority of the 
members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
Directors in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. If a matter were to concern the Chairman, then 
he would leave the meeting and Michael Lynch-Bell would instead 
take the chair. The other significant commitments of the Chairman

Diversity
The Group takes account of diversity when recruiting, including 
when considering Board appointments. However, whilst we see 
significant benefit to our business in having a Board drawn from  
a diverse range of backgrounds, which brings the required 
expertise, cultural diversity and different perspectives to Board 
discussions, we do not believe this is achieved through simple 
quotas, whether it be gender or otherwise, and will continue  
to appoint candidates based on merit and relevant experience  
in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Dear shareholder,
I am chairman of the Nomination Committee, a position 
which I assumed following my appointment as Chairman  
of the Company in May 2013. The other members of the 
Committee are Lynda Armstrong and Michael Lynch-Bell.
During 2015, the Committee secured the appointment of  
an independent non-executive Director, John MacKenzie,  
and recommended to the Board changes to the composition 
of the Board committees. We are delighted that John has 
joined the Board.
Following Lord Renwick stepping down as an independent 
non-executive Director of the Company, chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and member of the Nomination 
Committee with effect from the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting on 7 May 2015, the Committee reviewed 
the composition of the Board committees. 
After noting the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code on the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee, it was agreed to recommend to the Board  
the appointment of Lynda Armstrong, member of the 
Remuneration Committee, as chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and the appointment of Michael Lynch-Bell as

conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2015.
Following Clinton Dines stepping down as an independent 
non-executive Director of the Company on 31 December 
2015 and having assessed the balance of skills, experience  
and knowledge on the Audit Committee, it was agreed  
to recommend to the Board the appointment of John

NOMINATION COMMITTEE
82 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED The Board recognises the need to create conditions that foster 
talent and encourage all employees to achieve their full career 
potential in the Group. As part of the Group’s overall approach  
to human resource management it encourages employee diversity 
and aims to ensure that KAZ Minerals’ future senior leadership 
team reflects the demographics of the countries in which it 
operates and the general employee base.
The Board consists of Directors with a wide range of skills and 
business experience drawn from a number of industries, which  
is critical for bringing both the expertise required and to enable 
different perspectives to be brought to Board discussions. 
Furthermore, the Board comprises a range of nationalities, 
which brings cultural diversity as well as different geographical 
experiences and viewpoints. The combination of these factors 
means that the Board benefits from a diverse range of 
competencies, perspectives and thoughts, which provides  
a dynamic environment for decision making.
Role of the Nomination Committee
Key roles and responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:
• regularly reviewing the structure, size and composition  
(including skills, experience, independence, knowledge and 
general diversity) of the Board and making recommendations  
to the Board with regard to any changes;
• overseeing succession planning for Directors and certain senior 
managers, taking into account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company, and the skills and expertise that will be 
needed on the Board in the future;
• before any appointment is made by the Board, evaluating the 
balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and 
general diversity on the Board and preparing a description  
of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment;
• responsibility for identifying and nominating, for  
the approval of the Board, candidates to fill Board vacancies  
as and when they arise;
• keeping under review Directors’ existing and any new conflicts 
of interest and making recommendations as to whether a conflict 
should be authorised;
• reviewing the results of the Board performance evaluation

Activities in 2015
At its meetings in 2015, the Committee considered, amongst 
other matters:
• the appointment of John MacKenzie as an independent non-
executive Director and a member of the Health, Safety and 
Environment Committee following extensive research into 
potential candidates;
• Lord Renwick and Clinton Dines stepping down as Directors  
of the Company;
• the appointment of Lynda Armstrong as chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and as a member of the  
Nomination Committee, Michael Lynch-Bell as a member  
of the Remuneration Committee and John MacKenzie as  
a member of the Audit Committee;
• in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
recommended to the Board the election of Andrew Southam 
and John MacKenzie and re-election of all other Directors by 
shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting having due 
regard to the performance and ability of each Director to 
continue to contribute to the Board and its committees;
• the time commitment required by non-executive Directors  
to fulfil their duties; and
• its terms of reference and the results of the performance 
evaluation of the Committee.
Recruitment process
For the recruitment of John MacKenzie, Spencer Stuart,  
who specialise in the recruitment of high calibre executive and 
non-executive candidates and have no other connection with  
the Company, were engaged to ensure the widest possible pool 
of candidates was available to choose from. A formal, rigorous 
and transparent search process was put in place with a candidate 
profile and position specification prepared, including time 
commitment expected and experience required. Interviews  
were then conducted by the Chairman, the other members  
of the Committee and the Chief Executive. John MacKenzie was 
then recommended by the Committee to the Board for approval 
on the basis that he fully met the criteria required, including 
having sufficient time to meet the requirements of the role.
The key stages of the recruitment process are set out below.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 83 REMUNERATION
REPORT
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present my first 
Directors' Remuneration Report as chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. The 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report sets  
out details of the remuneration policy for executive and non-
executive Directors, describes how the remuneration policy  
is implemented and discloses the amounts paid relating to the 
year ended 31 December 2015.
The report includes an Annual Report on Remuneration  
(pages 86 to 95) which describes how the remuneration  
policy was implemented for the year ended 31 December 2015 
and how we intend to apply the policy for 2016. The Annual 
Report on Remuneration together with this annual statement  
will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting.
To maximise clarity and transparency, for reference, we have  
also republished our Remuneration Policy Report in an abridged 
form (pages 96 to 99). Our remuneration policy received binding 
shareholder approval at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. The 
Committee is satisfied that the policy remains appropriate and  
fit for purpose and intends that it will cover a three year period  
to the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
Objectives of the Committee
The Committee’s objective is to design a remuneration 
framework which promotes the long-term success of the 
Company. It focuses executives on delivery of the Group’s 
strategic and business objectives, while relating reward to 
performance in the context of appropriate risk and safety 
management. Aligning the interests of executive Directors  
and senior managers with those of shareholders will help  
build a sustainable performance culture. 
The Group is focused on safely delivering its major growth 
projects, optimising its existing assets and taking advantage  
of natural resource opportunities principally in the Central Asia 
region. The Committee believes that achievement against these 
objectives will deliver strong long-term financial performance  
and shareholder value on a sustainable basis. Therefore, in 
determining the levels of executive reward, the Committee 
continues to place emphasis on ensuring a strong and demonstrable 
link between actual remuneration received and the achievement 
of KAZ Minerals’ strategic and business objectives.
Remuneration structure
In order to provide a straightforward and transparent 
remuneration structure, the remuneration of executive Directors 
is made up of base salary, pension (other than for the Chief 
Executive), plus some benefits-in-kind and, subject to stretching 
performance conditions, cash awarded under an annual bonus 
plan and shares awarded under a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).
Incentive pay is subject to withholding and recovery provisions. 
For executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive (who is  
a major shareholder in the Company), part of any annual bonus 
payment is required to be invested in the Company’s shares  
and held for a period of time. We operate a post-vesting holding 
period for LTIP shares and significant share ownership guidelines 
apply. These features enhance the alignment of interest between 
executive Directors and shareholders and contribute to an 
appropriate level of risk mitigation.
Remuneration for 2016
During 2015, the Committee reviewed overall levels of pay  
and the operation of the incentive arrangements to ensure they 
remain appropriate in light of the current business strategy and 
the interests of shareholders. The key points in relation to how 
we are implementing our policy for 2016 are as follows:
• salaries will not be increased from 2015 levels;
• the Chief Executive will continue to not receive any  
pension provision;
• maximum bonus opportunity will continue to be 150% of  
salary for the executive Directors (lower than the normal  
limit allowed for within our remuneration policy); and
• LTIP award levels for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer will be 150% of salary and 125% of salary, respectively, 
(lower than the normal limit allowed for within our 
remuneration policy).
The incentive opportunity of the Chief Executive was reduced 
significantly for 2014 and further for 2015 in order to reflect  
the reduction in size and scale of the Group following the 
Restructuring in 2014. The Chief Executive’s incentive 
opportunity will be maintained at the reduced level for 2016.
84 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT ANNUAL STATEMENT ON REMUNERATION Furthermore, the Committee reviewed a number of aspects  
of executive Director remuneration to ensure they continue  
to be aligned with the Group’s strategy, support the Group’s 
business objectives and motivate beneficiaries. The main purpose  
of the review was to better align the annual bonus plan with  
the Group’s key business focus of delivery of the Group’s major 
growth projects at Bozshakol and Aktogay, and operational and 
financial performance, including cost optimisation. From 2016,  
the number of discrete elements of the annual bonus plan will  
be reduced from three to two:
• operational and financial performance, which will include  
a number of key business performance measures, including  
cost optimisation; and
• strategic developments, which will incorporate project delivery.
The operational and financial performance element will  
represent 70% of the maximum bonus potential and the  
strategic developments element will represent 30% of the 
maximum bonus potential.
2015 performance and reward
Despite the challenging market conditions, the executive 
management team was able to deliver solid operational 
performance with copper cathode production in line with 
external guidance supported by good silver, zinc and gold 
by-product production. The net cash cost of copper was lower 
than forecast due to management's success in cost optimisation 
and strong silver by-product production. Financial performance 
was affected by lower commodity prices, with EBITDA (excluding 
special items) below forecast as the lower costs in 2015 were not 
sufficient to offset the impact of reduced metals prices. Group 
Free Cash Flow was marginally ahead of forecast. Bozshakol 
commenced commissioning in December 2015, with the 
production of first copper concentrate in February 2016. 
Pre-production mining operations commenced at Aktogay oxide 
in June 2015, with first copper cathode produced on 1 December 
2015. The construction of the clay plant at Bozshakol and the 
sulphide plant at Aktogay are progressing well and on schedule 
and on budget. There was considerable improvement in the 
safety performance during the year with a number of initiatives 
rolled out across the Group. However, although there had been  
a reduction in fatalities for a sixth consecutive year, there is still 
progress to be made and the Committee has therefore applied a 
scale back to resulting bonuses. The overall level of performance 
achieved resulted in annual bonus awards of 67% of maximum 
potential for both Oleg Novachuk and Andrew Southam.
It is expected that the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan awards, 
measuring performance from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 
2015 and 1 June 2013 to 31 May 2016 (combined 41 month 
performance period) will lapse on 1 June 2016 on failing to 
achieve the required total shareholder return target.

64 Corporate Governance Overview Annual Report on Remuneration
This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with 
Part 3 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at 
the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2016.
Putting our remuneration policy into practice
KAZ Minerals’ approach towards executive performance,  
reward and benefits supports and drives its strategy and  
business objectives and reinforces its values in the context  
of appropriate risk management.
The Committee seeks to ensure that the Company’s 
remuneration policies and practices:
• provide a strong and demonstrable link between incentives  
and the Group’s strategy and business objectives;
• facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of high 
calibre executives with the appropriate skills to implement  
the Group’s strategy and business objectives;
• set a performance-biased framework for remuneration which  
is consistent with the Group’s scale and unique circumstances, 
and which enables executive Directors and certain senior 
managers to share in the long-term success of the Group, 
without delivering excessive benefits or encouraging  
short-term measures or excessive risk-taking; and
• are aligned to shareholders’ interests.
The strategy for executive Director remuneration is to provide  
a balanced package with a high proportion of total remuneration 
being awarded through performance-related elements.
The current intention is that the approved remuneration policy 
will operate in its present form until at least the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting. However, the Committee has reviewed the 
policy and made some changes to how it will be implemented  
for 2016 to ensure the principles above continue to effectively 
underpin its operation. How the policy will be implemented  
for 2016 is described below, along with details of the changes.
For clarity, the key parts of the Remuneration Policy Report  
that was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting have been appended to this report on pages 96 to 99.
DIRECTED
BY STRATEGY
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2016 
Salary
The base salaries for Oleg Novachuk and Andrew Southam  
with effect from 1 January 2016 will not be increased from 2015 
levels and will remain at £856,000 and £410,000, respectively.  
For context, no increases were made to executive Directors’ 
base salaries in any of the financial years from 2012 to 2015.
Pension and benefits
The Company does not provide pension benefits on behalf of 
Oleg Novachuk. The absence of any pension provision is taken 
into account when setting his base salary and other elements  
of remuneration. Andrew Southam receives Company pension 
contributions and/or a cash allowance with a total value of up  
to 10% of base salary.
Benefits include health insurance and, where appropriate,  
car and driver, and relocation assistance, all in line with 
entitlements provided for executives in similar positions  
in comparable companies.
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity remains at 150%  
of salary for both Oleg Novachuk (following a reduction  
from 200% of salary in respect of 2014 and henceforth) and 
Andrew Southam. The target bonus is set at 75% of salary for 
both Oleg Novachuk and Andrew Southam. The Committee  
will continue to review the maximum bonus level to ensure  
it remains appropriate.
Following the Restructuring that took place in 2014, the 
Committee took the opportunity during 2015 to review the 
measures and targets for the annual bonus plan. As a result,  
some changes have been made for 2016 to ensure that the 
measures and targets used more closely align with the business 
strategy and with shareholders’ interests post-Restructuring.  
In addition, the changes are intended to enhance simplicity  
and to promote greater clarity for investors.
86 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT REMUNERATION REPORT For 2016, in line with the Company's key strategic priorities, the 
annual bonus plan will seek to incentivise the achievement of:  
(i) improvement in safety performance through improved 
processes; (ii) improvement in operational performance through 
volume and cost of production measures; (iii) financial profitability 
through EBITDA (excluding special items) and Free Cash Flow; 
and (iv) strategic developments. The structure of the bonus will 
be weighted such that 70% will be based on operational and 
financial measures and 30% based on strategic developments.  
A summary of the structure is provided in the table below:
Measure Weighting
Operational/financial
Group EBITDA 25%
Free Cash Flow 5%
Own copper concentrate production 20%
Gross cash cost of copper 20%
Sub-total 70%
Strategic developments
Satisfaction of various milestones set in relation to 
the development of the Bozshakol and Aktogay 
projects and other actions taken to assist in meeting 
the Company's strategic objectives 30%
Sub-total 30%
Total 100%
Total will be scaled back in the event that the Committee 
considers that there has been insufficient improvement in  
safety over the prior year
For each element, 0% is payable at threshold rising to  
50% payable at target and 100% payable at stretch.
Specific targets will not be disclosed in advance as they would  
give a clear indication of the Group’s business objectives which 
are commercially sensitive. Performance against specific targets 
will be disclosed when they cease to be commercially sensitive.
For executive Directors other than Oleg Novachuk, bonus 
payments are conditional upon an undertaking to invest at least 
one third of the bonus earned, after payment of income tax and 
national insurance, in the Company’s shares and to retain those 
shares for a minimum period of two years.
To take account of any serious problems that the Company  
may become aware of in the years after awards have been made, 
awards under the annual bonus plan will be subject to withholding 
and recovery provisions. Under these provisions, the Committee 
has discretion in exceptional circumstances to determine that 
where there has been continuity of executive responsibility 
(between initiation of a serious adverse event and its emergence 
as a problem), the serious adverse event may result in an amount 
of the original bonus paid being withheld or recovered. Such 
circumstances may include a material restatement of the  
Group’s financial statements, the discovery of endemic  
problems in financial or operational reporting, or where, as  
a result of financial and operational losses, a material breach  
of regulatory guidelines has occurred or is likely to occur.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 87 Long-term incentives
Following a review of incentive pay potential during the year,  
LTIP award levels for 2016 will remain at 150% of salary for  
Oleg Novachuk (following a reduction to this level from 200%  
of salary in respect of awards made in 2015 and henceforth)  
and 125% of salary for Andrew Southam. The value of  
the award will be based on a five day average share price  
commencing immediately after the announcement of the  
Group’s preliminary results. The Committee will continue  
to review the award level to ensure it remains appropriate.
The awards will continue to be granted as nil-cost options. The 
number of shares that vest will continue to be dependent on 
KAZ Minerals’ Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
compared to a comparator group of UK and international  
mining companies. If KAZ Minerals’ TSR is ranked median  
or above, an award will vest as follows:
TSR ranking of KAZ Minerals Vesting percentage
Upper quartile ranking 100%
Between median and upper 
quartile ranking
Straight line vesting between 30% 
and 100% based on ranking plus 
interpolation between rankings
Median ranking 30%
Below median ranking 0%
Awards are split into two sub-awards each with three year vesting 
periods. This will not have any impact on the expected value of 
the awards, but will help to mitigate the impact that the cyclical 
nature of the copper industry has on KAZ Minerals’ share price.
For awards to be granted in 2016 the performance period  
for the sub-awards will be:
• sub-award 1: 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018; and
• sub-award 2: 1 June 2016 to 31 May 2019.
As the performance period of the first sub-award commences 
prior to the date of grant and that of the second sub-award 
commences after the date of grant, the performance period  
for the entire award will be 41 months.
In addition, a holding period applies such that any awards vesting 
are required to be held by the executive Director for a period  
of two years from the vesting date.
The averaging period for calculating TSR will be three months 
leading up to the start and the end of the performance period  
of each sub-award. Under this phased approach KAZ Minerals’ 
TSR for a period of six months at the start and the end of the 
performance period of the entire award will have an impact on 
the performance outturn. This phased approach is designed to 
increase the number of months the share price has an impact on 
the performance target and to reduce the impact of the volatility 
of KAZ Minerals’ share price on the vesting of awards, whilst not 
materially changing the average vesting level over the medium 
term (and hence not increasing the expected value of awards).
The comparator group applicable for awards to be granted  
in 2016 will comprise:
Anglo American plc Antofagasta plc
BHP Billiton plc Boliden AB
First Quantum Minerals Ltd Freeport-McMoran Copper 
& Gold Inc
Fresnillo plc Glencore plc
KGHM Polska Miedz S.A. Lundin Mining Corporation
Rio Tinto plc Southern Copper Corporation
Teck Resources Ltd ‘B’ Vedanta Resources plc
In the event of one or more constituents undergoing a takeover, 
merger, dissolution, variation in capital or any other event  
that would materially affect the calculation of a ranking, the 
Committee shall determine how this should be reflected in  
the ranking calculation. 
In the event of a change of control, awards will normally vest  
on a pro-rata basis by reference to the length of time since  
the award was granted, and only if the performance conditions 
can effectively be regarded as having been satisfied at that time, 
although the Committee may decide not to pro-rate an award  
if it is inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.
Withholding and recovery provisions operate for LTIP awards 
granted from 2015 and henceforth along similar lines as for the 
annual bonus plan, as described above.
Executive share option plan (ESOP)
The ESOP is an HMRC approved discretionary company share 
option plan that provides for the grant of market value options up 
to a value of £30,000 to executive Directors and certain selected 
UK-based senior executives. Options will normally vest at least 
three years from the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions and the participant being a Director or 
employee of KAZ Minerals at that time.
Options granted to executive Directors and senior management 
under the ESOP will count towards the individual limits under  
the LTIP and will normally be subject to the same performance 
conditions and periods as awards granted under the LTIP.
No executive Director currently participates in the ESOP.

Service contracts
Oleg Novachuk has a service contract dated 26 September 2005 
which is terminable by the Company or by the executive Director 
on three months’ notice and Andrew Southam has a service 
contract dated 18 May 2013, when he became Chief Financial 
Officer, which is terminable by the Company on 12 months’ notice 
or by the executive Director on six months’ notice. The Company 
reserves the right on termination to make phased payments 
which are paid in monthly instalments and subject to mitigation 
through a legal obligation on the part of the departing executive 
Director to seek new employment.
Chairman and other non-executive Directors’ remuneration
The fees paid to the non-executive Directors for chairing and 
being members of committees and of the Senior Independent 
Director were reviewed in August 2013 and decreased, with  
the changes taking effect from 1 September 2013. These changes 
resulted in the total fees payable to non-executive Directors 
being reduced by around 4% per annum. Non-executive Director 
fees were further reviewed during 2015 and it was determined 
that fees would not be increased for 2016. The fee structure  
(per annum) from 1 January 2016 remains as follows:
• Non-executive Director base fee: £84,000
• Senior Independent Director: £12,000
• Chairs of the Audit and HSE Committees: £15,000
• Chair of the Projects Assurance Committee: £12,000
• Chair of the Remuneration Committee: £8,000
• Member of the HSE Committee: £9,000
• Member of the Audit Committee: £7,500
• Member of the Projects Assurance Committee: £6,000
• Member of the Remuneration Committee: £4,000
The non-executive Chairman’s fee was set at £300,000 per 
annum on his appointment on 17 May 2013. The fee was, at his 
request, reduced to £275,000 per annum from 1 April 2014. The 
fee may be varied during the remainder of the three year period 
that the remuneration policy operates to ensure it continues to 
appropriately recognise the requirements of the role.
In addition to the fee of £84,000 he receives as a non-executive 
Director, Vladimir Kim receives an advisory fee of £370,000 per 
annum for assisting and supporting the Company in its dealings 
with the Government and regional authorities in Kazakhstan.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 89 Executive Directors’ annual bonus awards (performance  
period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015)
For 2015, the annual bonus plan comprised the following three 
discrete elements, with the first two elements each representing 
25% of maximum bonus potential and the third element 
representing 50% of maximum bonus potential:
• operational performance;
• financial performance; and
• strategic developments (including development of the major 
growth projects and objectives relating to restructuring of  
the core business).
The maximum bonus potential for Oleg Novachuk and  
Andrew Southam for 2015 was 150% of salary.
The Committee assessed each discrete element of the annual 
bonus plan separately as part of an overall balanced scorecard  
of measures. Within each element the Committee considered  
a number of sub-elements and formed a rounded assessment  
of the performance of executive Directors at the end of the year.
Awards were also subject to a safety override enabling them  
to be scaled back to reflect the Group’s safety performance.
Performance assessment for 2015 
Despite the challenging market conditions, the executive 
management team was able to deliver solid operational 
performance with copper cathode production in line with 
external guidance supported by good silver, zinc and gold 
by-product production. The net cash cost of copper was lower 
than forecast due to management's success in cost optimisation 
and strong silver by-product production. The Committee 
assessed this to warrant 17% out of the maximum 25% 
available. Financial performance was affected by lower commodity 
prices, with EBITDA (excluding special items) below forecast as 
the lower costs in 2015 were not sufficient to offset the impact  
of reduced metals prices. Group Free Cash Flow was marginally 
ahead of forecast. The Committee assessed this to warrant  
12% out of the maximum 25% available. Bozshakol commenced 
commissioning in December 2015, with the production of first 
copper concentrate in February 2016. Pre-production mining 
operations commenced at Aktogay oxide in June 2015, with  
first copper cathode produced on 1 December 2015. The 
construction of the clay plant at Bozshakol and the sulphide  
plant at Aktogay are progressing well and are on schedule and  
on budget. The Committee assessed this to warrant 38% out  
of the maximum 50% available. The Committee's assessment 
above includes the result of a scale back across each of the  
three elements to reflect safety performance.
The overall level of performance achieved resulted in annual 
bonus awards of 67% of maximum potential for both Oleg 
Novachuk and Andrew Southam. The Committee is satisfied  
that this level of bonus is appropriate given the performance 
achieved across this scorecard and the safety assessment. The 
Committee has not disclosed details of the 2015 targets as they 
are felt to be commercially sensitive, but will do so when they

(performance period 1 June 2012 to 31 May 2015 and  
1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015)
Awards granted to executive Directors under the LTIP on  
4 April 2012 (with performance measured partly over the  
period 1 June 2012 to 31 May 2015) and on 5 April 2013 (with 
performance measured partly over the period 1 January 2013 to 
31 December 2015) were subject to a relative TSR performance 
condition with TSR measured against a bespoke group of global 
mining companies over a three year period, consistent with the 
approach and vesting schedule described on page 88.
For the sub-award measured over the period 1 June 2012 to 
31 May 2015, the Company was ranked below median ranking. 
This sub-award has therefore lapsed in full having failed to reach 
the threshold median positioning. 
For the sub-award measured over the period 1 January 2013  
to 31 December 2015, the Company was ranked below median 
ranking. This sub-award has therefore lapsed in full having failed  
to reach the threshold median positioning.
The sub-award measured over the period 1 June 2013 to  
31 May 2016 is also expected not to reach the threshold  
median positioning and is also expected to lapse in full.
LTIP awards granted in the year
During 2015, awards were made to Oleg Novachuk and Andrew Southam at 150% of salary and 125% of salary, respectively. The face 
value of the awards was based on a five day average share price commencing immediately after the announcement of the Group’s 
preliminary results of 243.98 pence. The awards were made on 6 March 2015 on the following basis:
Executive Director Type of award
Basis of award 
granted
Share price at 
date of grant
Number of shares 
awarded
Face value 
of award 
£000
% of face value

Oleg Novachuk Nil-cost option 150% of salary 225.60p 526,272 1,284 30
Andrew Southam Nil-cost option 125% of salary 225.60p 210,058 513 30
The awards were made subject to a TSR performance condition which requires the Company to deliver a median ranking (30% vests) 
rising on a straight-line basis to an upper quartile TSR ranking (100% vests) relative to a peer group of mining companies. The awards 
were split into two sub-awards measured over two separate performance periods, i.e. 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 and  
1 June 2015 to 31 May 2018. The averaging period for calculating TSR will be three months leading up to the start and the end of  
the performance period of each sub-award.

Percentage change in remuneration levels
The following table shows the movement in the salary, benefits 
and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current 
and previous financial year compared to that for the average UK 
employee. The Committee has chosen this comparator as it feels 
that it provides a more appropriate reflection of the earnings of 
the average worker than the movement in the Group’s total wage 
bill, which is distorted by movements in the number of employees 
and variations in wage practices in Kazakhstan. For the benefits 
and bonus per employee, this is based on those employees eligible 
to participate in such schemes.

3 The closing market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2015 was 102.25p and the range for the year was 73p to 270p.
4 Of the ordinary shares beneficially owned by Andrew Southam at 31 December 2015, 2,315 ordinary shares relate to the partnership shares purchased and held

Executive Directors are required to build up a holding of ordinary shares in the Company worth at least 200% of salary within a five 
year period from their date of appointment. As set out in the table above, Oleg Novachuk has met and exceeded the shareholding 
requirement and Andrew Southam has currently met 17% of the shareholding requirement, although he has five years from his date  
of appointment on 1 November 2014 to achieve the shareholding requirement.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 93 Dilution of share capital
The Company’s share-based incentive plans currently operate 
with market purchase shares that are held in an Employee Benefit 
Trust. Therefore, there is no dilution of existing shareholders on 
the vesting of awards. In the event of the Company deciding to 
use shares held in treasury, such shares will count towards the 
limits on the number of new shares which may be issued under 
the rules of the relevant share-based incentive plan pursuant  
to institutional shareholder guidelines.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Employee Benefit Trust has been established to acquire 
ordinary shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, 
from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares 
arising on the exercise of awards under the Group’s share-based 
incentive plans. The trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust have 
informed the Company that their intention is to abstain from 
voting in respect of the KAZ Minerals shares held in the trust.
As at 31 December 2015, 21 1,405 shares were held by  
the Employee Benefit Trust to hedge outstanding awards  
of 3,349,578. This means that the trust holds 6% of  
outstanding awards. 
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee is primarily responsible for determining and 
recommending to the Board the framework for executive 
remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board,  
the remuneration of executive Directors and certain  
senior managers.
The Committee’s full terms of reference are available to view  
on the Company’s website (www.kazminerals.com). The 
Committee’s principal responsibilities are summarised below:
• determining and agreeing with the Board the framework for 
executive remuneration that ensures executive Directors and 
certain senior managers are provided with appropriate incentives 
to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded in a fair 
and responsible manner for their individual contribution towards 
the success of the Company;
• ensuring that the remuneration policy is appropriate and 
consistent with effective risk management;
• within the agreed framework, setting and determining the total 
individual remuneration arrangements for executive Directors 
and certain senior managers, giving due regard to individual  
and Company performance, and remuneration trends across  
the Group;
• approving the design of, and determining the targets for,  
any performance-related plans and the total annual payments 
made under such plans to executive Directors and certain  
senior managers;
• determining any share incentive plan performance targets; and
• determining the terms of employment and remuneration of  
each executive Director and certain senior managers, including 
recruitment and termination arrangements.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee during 2015 were Lord 
Renwick, Lynda Armstrong, Simon Heale, Michael Lynch-Bell  
and Charles Watson. Lord Renwick stepped down as a Director 
and chair of the Committee at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting on 7 May 2015 at which point Lynda Armstrong 
took over as chair of the Committee. The Chief Executive is 
normally invited to attend meetings to provide information and 
advice to the Committee to enable it to make informed decisions. 
He is, however, specifically excluded from any matter concerning 
his own remuneration. Representatives of New Bridge Street,  
the Committee’s retained adviser, also attend meetings by 
invitation. The Company Secretary attends meetings as  
secretary to the Committee.
Attendance at Remuneration Committee meetings

Committee activities
During the year, the Committee considered, amongst  
other matters, the following:
• reviewed current trends in remuneration practice  
and institutional investors’ current guidelines on  
executive compensation;
• reviewed Annual General Meeting outcome and feedback  
from institutional shareholders and shareholder bodies, giving 
consideration to the implications for future remuneration policy 
and its implementation;
• set, reviewed and agreed to approve individual remuneration 
arrangements for executive Directors and certain senior managers;
• performed an oversight role on the remuneration of certain 
senior managers immediately below Board level;
• reviewed the performance elements of the annual bonus  
plan for 2016;
• assessed the level of achievement against objectives under  
the annual bonus plan and LTIP;
• considered and approved plan design, performance measures 
and targets to be used under the LTIP;
• reviewed the list of comparator companies for the LTIP;
• reviewed and approved the Directors’ Remuneration  
Report; and
• reviewed the Committee’s performance and its terms  
of reference.
94 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Priorities for 2016
For the coming year, it is anticipated that the Committee  
will focus on the following areas:
• supporting the Group’s strategy and business objectives;
• ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements;
• reviewing and assessing the ongoing appropriateness of  
current executive remuneration plan design and targets;
• ongoing training of Committee members;
• ensuring that remuneration arrangements continue to promote 
the long-term success of the Company, and to reward Company 
performance, with a focus on maintaining the link between 
performance and reward, whilst maintaining a prudent  
approach to cost and the risk to the business; and
• reviewing the competitiveness and effectiveness of the  
external adviser.
Management of risk in remuneration arrangements
The Committee periodically commissions a detailed assessment 
of the risk environment surrounding the Company’s current 
remuneration arrangements for executive Directors and certain 
senior managers. The latest assessment determined that whilst 
remuneration arrangements were broadly compatible with the 
Company’s risk policies and systems, a number of areas could  
be considered further, including keeping under review the 
performance condition of the LTIP. Overall, the Committee 
remains satisfied that the remuneration policy is aligned with  
the long-term needs of the business and that incentive quantum, 
structure and objectives do not encourage short-term measures 
or excessive risk-taking.
The Committee draws upon the relevant experience and 
knowledge of its members to ensure that it benefits from the 
positions they hold at the Company. These include the fact that 
Simon Heale is Chairman of the Company, Michael Lynch-Bell  
is chair of the Audit Committee and Charles Watson is chair of  
the Health, Safety and Environment Committee and the Projects 
Assurance Committee. The Chief Executive, who attends 
Committee meetings by invitation, also provides a link to the 
Executive Committee. The leveraging of such experience and 
knowledge enables the Committee to have an oversight of risk 
factors that may be relevant to remuneration arrangements and 
target setting specifically.
External adviser
The Committee has authority to obtain the advice of external 
independent remuneration consultants. It is solely responsible  
for their appointment, retention and termination and for approval 
of the basis of their fees and other terms. During 2015, the 
Committee received advice on executive compensation, 
performance-related pay schemes and equity-based incentive 
schemes from New Bridge Street, a trading name of Aon Hewitt 
Limited (part of the Aon plc group). New Bridge Street also 
provides advice to the Company on remuneration matters for 
senior employees including benchmarking of remuneration and 
equity-based incentives and on remuneration matters relating to 
non-executive Directors. No other company within the Aon plc 
group provides other services to the Company. The terms of 
engagement between the Committee and New Bridge Street are 
available on request. The total fees paid to New Bridge Street in 
respect of its services during the year were £58,131. New Bridge 
Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group 
Code of Conduct. The Committee regularly reviews the external 
adviser relationship and is comfortable that New Bridge Street’s 
advice remains objective and independent.
Statement of shareholder voting
At the Annual General Meeting held on 7 May 2015, the advisory 
vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration received the 
following votes from shareholders:
Annual Report on Remuneration
Votes for 275,144,668 97%
Votes against 8,495,470 3%
Total votes cast 283,640,138 100%
Votes withheld 1,439,257
Shareholder engagement
When reviewing the remuneration framework of executive 
Directors and certain senior managers, during 2015 the 
Committee took into account the views and guidance expressed 
by institutional shareholders and shareholder bodies. In addition, 
the Committee considered feedback forthcoming at the Annual 
General Meeting held on 7 May 2015, along with other feedback 
received during the year, as part of the annual review of the 
implementation of remuneration policy.
Audit requirements
The Group’s auditor, KPMG LLP, has audited the information 
contained in the tables headed Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
LTIP awards granted in the year, Executive Directors’ interests in 
the Long Term Incentive Plan, Remuneration of other senior 
managers, Non-executive Directors’ fees and expenses, and 
Directors’ interests in ordinary shares.

Key parts of the Policy Report that was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting have been included again in  
this report for the purposes of clarity and transparency. The original Policy Report, approved at the 2014 Annual General Meeting,  
can be found on pages 76 to 81 in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts on the Company’s website (www.kazminerals.com).
The remuneration policy table has been annotated to additionally include details of how the policy will be implemented in 2016.

Purpose and 
link to strategy
To attract and maintain high calibre executives taking account of 
market levels at the date of appointment and on subsequent review
Provide market competitive benefits to help 
recruit and retain high calibre executives
Operation Reviewed annually, effective 1 January
Any increases take account of:
• Company and individual performance
• Skill set and experience of the executive
• External indicators such as inflation and market conditions
• Remuneration levels of Group employees, particularly 
in the UK
Where no pension provision is provided an adjustment will

• Car and driver
• Relocation assistance
• All employee share schemes
• Travel and related expenses
Additional benefits such as pension and life 
assurance may be provided from time to

the payment of any additional benefits is 
appropriate and in line with market practice 
when determining whether and at what level 
they are paid 
2016: There is no current plan to provide any 
pension benefits to the Chief Executive
Maximum No prescribed maximum annual increase
Salary reviews take account of Company  
and individual performance 
The Committee is guided by the general increase for the broader 
employee population, particularly in the UK, but on occasions may 
need to recognise, for example, development in role, change in 
responsibility and/or specific retention issues as well as the market 
context
The Committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new hire at a 
discount to the market level initially, with a series of planned increases 
implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the 
desired positioning, subject to individual performance

year period from their date of appointment. The relevant salary  
is the salary at the date of appointment and the market value is 
measured at the current date.
Executive Directors are required (where permitted from a 
technical perspective) to hold shares arising from an LTIP award 
for a period of five years from the date of grant, with only those 
shares required to cover a tax liability on exercise of an LTIP 
award permitted to be sold.
Recruitment and appointment policy
The remuneration package for a new executive Director will  
be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. The 
Committee may offer, in addition, certain cash or share-based 
elements for the sole purpose of buying out existing awards.  
Any such payments would be based solely on remuneration 
relinquished when leaving the former employer and would be 
used for the specific purpose of recruiting an executive Director 
key to the operation of the Company. These payments would  
not exceed what is felt to be a fair estimate of remuneration  
lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect  
(as far as possible) the nature and time horizons attaching to  
that remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time 
of appointment.
In the case of an internal executive appointment, any variable  
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed 
to pay out according to its existing terms, adjusted as relevant  
to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other 
ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment 
will continue.
The Committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new  
hire at a discount to the market level initially, with a series of 
planned increases implemented over the following few years  
to bring the salary to the desired positioning, subject to  
individual performance.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses  
as appropriate. In addition, the Committee may agree to provide 
tax equalisation for any new appointment.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive 
Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance  
with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time. 
Service contracts
Service contracts normally continue until the executive Director’s 
agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties  
agree. The Company’s policy is that executive Directors will  
be employed on a contract that can be terminated by the 
Company on giving no more than one year’s notice, with the 
executive Director required to give up to six months’ notice  
of termination. The Committee will, consistent with best practice 
and in the interests of the Company and its shareholders, seek  
to minimise termination payments.
A Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice 
and without any further payment or compensation, except for 
sums earned up to the date of termination, on the occurrence  
of certain events, such as gross misconduct. The circumstances  
of the termination (taking into account the individual’s 
performance) are taken into account by the Committee when 
determining amounts payable as a result of termination. The 
Committee’s normal policy on termination is to make phased 
compensatory payments and to stop or reduce such payments  
to former executive Directors where they receive remuneration 
from other employment during the notice period (where this is 
consistent with local employment legislation and market practice).
Any share-based entitlements granted under the Company’s 
share plans will be determined on the basis of the relevant  
plan rules.
Provision Summary terms
Notice period Up to 12 months
Termination 
payment
Base salary plus benefits. Payments will normally 
be paid monthly and be subject to mitigation 
(where this is consistent with local employment 
legislation and market practice)
Remuneration 
entitlements
A pro-rata bonus may also become payable  
for the period of active service along with, under 
the rules, vesting of outstanding share awards  
(in certain circumstances). In all cases 
performance targets will apply
Chairman and other non-executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment
The Chairman and other non-executive Directors do not have 
service contracts, but each has a letter of appointment with the 
Company. Each letter of appointment provides for a one month 
notice period other than for the Chairman, who has a three 
month notice period. Non-executive Directors are normally 
appointed for two consecutive three-year terms, with any third 
term of three years being subject to rigorous review and taking 
into account the need to progressively refresh the Board.
Chairman’s fee
The fee for the Chairman is determined by the Committee,  
with the Chairman abstaining from any discussion or decision  
on his fee, and reflects the commitment, demands and 
responsibility of the role. The fee is paid monthly in cash  
inclusive of all committee roles and is not performance-related  
or pensionable. Limited benefits relating to travel, accommodation 
and meals for the Chairman and his spouse may also be payable  
in certain circumstances.

determining the fee level and structure
Fees are paid monthly in cash. Non-executive 
Directors do not participate in any of the 
Company’s incentive arrangements or receive 
any pension provision
The non-executive Directors receive a base 
fee, with additional fees payable for chairing 
and being a member of the Company’s key 
committees and for performing the Senior 
Independent Director role. In addition to  
his base fee, Vladimir Kim receives an advisory 
payment for the vital role he plays in terms  
of the Company’s relationship with the 
Government and regional authorities  
in Kazakhstan
The fee levels are reviewed on a periodic basis, 
with reference to the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the role and market levels in 
companies of comparable size and complexity

Directors’ indemnity and insurance
KAZ Minerals maintains liability insurance for its Directors and 
Officers. The Company has also granted indemnities to each

are uncapped in amount, in relation to certain losses and liabilities 
which they may incur to third parties in the course of acting as a 
Director (or Officer or Company Secretary as the case may be) 
of the Company or any of its associated companies. Neither the 
indemnity nor insurance cover provides cover in the event that a 
Director (or Officer or Company Secretary as the case may be)  
is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
The indemnity is categorised as a ‘qualifying third-party indemnity’ 
for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 and will continue  
in force for the benefit of Directors (or Officers or Company 
Secretary as the case may be) on an ongoing basis.

certain other named subsidiaries.
The terms of a pre-export finance debt facility dated 20 
December 2012, as amended and restated on 29 October 2014,

of the Company: (i) a lender under the facility shall not be obliged 
to fund a loan; and (ii) if a body of lenders representing more  
than two-thirds of the amount of the facility so require, the 
parties shall enter into negotiations for a period of not more  
than 30 days with a view to agreeing alternative terms for 
continuing the facility. If no alternative basis has been agreed 
during such period then the lenders may cancel the commitments 
of the lenders to lend the facility and declare all outstanding

parties shall enter into negotiations for a period of not more  
than 30 days with a view to agreeing alternative terms for

agreed during such period then the lender(s) may cancel  
the commitments of the lender(s) to lend the facility and  
declare all outstanding amounts due and payable.
Going concern
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future 
(which is for this purpose a period of at least 12 months from  
the date of approval of these financial statements). Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Articles of Association
The following description summarises certain provisions of the 
Company’s Articles of Association and applicable English law 
concerning companies (the Companies Act 2006). This summary 
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company’s Articles 
of Association and the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s 
Articles of Association may only be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
www.kazminerals.com 101 Audit information
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of  
this Directors’ Report confirm that so far as they each are  
aware, there is no relevant audit information (being information 
needed by the auditors in connection with preparing their audit 
report), of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and each 
Director has taken all steps that he ought to have reasonably 
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
Auditors
Having reviewed the independence, objectivity and performance 
of the auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to  
the Board that the existing auditors, KPMG, be re-appointed. 
Ordinary resolutions re-appointing them as auditors and 
authorising the Directors to set their remuneration will  
be proposed at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect  
of the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company  
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of  
the Group and parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with  
IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Group and parent company 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and  
the parent company will continue in business.
Rights attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company are 
defined in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
Voting rights
Members may attend any general meeting of the Company.  
On a show of hands every member (or his/her representative) 
who is present in person or by proxy has one vote on each 
resolution and on a poll every member (or his/her representative) 
who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote on each 
resolution for each share of which he/she is the holder.
As a result of changes introduced by the Companies Act 2006 to 
allow multiple proxies appointed by a single member to vote on a 
show of hands, all substantive resolutions at general meetings will 
normally be put to a poll vote. Employees who participate in the 
Company’s Share Incentive Plans (SIP) and hold shares in the SIP 
trusts, provide directions to the trustee to vote on their behalf  
by way of a form of direction. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on voting rights.
Dividend rights
Shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare dividends  
but the amount of the dividend may not exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. 
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares other  
than certain restrictions as set out in the Company’s Articles  
of Association. Transfers of uncertificated shares must be  
carried out using CREST and the Board can refuse a transfer  
of an uncertificated share in accordance with the regulations 
governing the operation of CREST.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer  
of shares.
Powers of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for the management of the 
business of the Company and may exercise all powers of  
the Company subject to applicable legislation and regulation  
and the Company’s Articles of Association.
Appointment and retirement of Directors
The Board shall have the power at any time to appoint any person 
who is willing to act as a Director, so long as the total number  
of Directors shall not exceed the maximum number prescribed 
in the Articles. Any Director so appointed shall retire at the  
next Annual General Meeting following such appointment. Each 
Director shall retire at the Annual General Meeting held in the 
third calendar year following the year in which he/she was elected 
or last re-elected by the Company. A Director who retires at an 
Annual General Meeting (whether by rotation or otherwise) may, 
if willing to act, be re-appointed.

financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are

of the Company and the undertakings included in the

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of KAZ Minerals  
PLC for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages  
1 10 to 163. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s loss for the year  
then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance in IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We summarise below the risks of material misstatement that  
had the greatest effect on our audit, our key audit procedures  
to address those risks and our findings from those procedures  
in order that the Company’s members as a body may better 
understand the process by which we arrived at our audit opinion. 
Our findings are the result of procedures undertaken in the 
context of and solely for the purpose of our statutory audit 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole and consequently 
are incidental to that opinion, and we do not express discrete 
opinions on separate elements of the financial statements.
Following the sale of a large part of the Group’s business 
comprising relatively mature mining and power operations 
primarily located in the Zhezkazgan and Central Regions of 
Kazakhstan on 31 October 2014, the risks relating to these 
operations are no longer relevant to our audit in 2015. 
Disclosure relating to going concern Risk rating: á
Refer to page 1 15 (note 2(a) – Basis of preparation – Going 
concern), page 52 – Financial Review and page 79 – Audit 
Committee Report
• The risk The Group’s cash flow projections have been impacted 
by low prices for the Group’s products, especially copper, and  
are characterised by capital expenditure and interest relating to 
its major growth projects exceeding its operating cash inflows. 
The Group is therefore dependent on its existing cash resources  
and available borrowing facilities to fund this expenditure until 
the first of these projects, Bozshakol, delivers sufficient positive 
cash flow to service its debt. 
Note 2(a) to the financial statements explains how the Directors 
have formed a judgement that use of the going concern basis is 
appropriate in preparing the financial statements. The Directors 
have considered the Group’s forecast cash flows over the period 
ending 31 March 2017 and have concluded that the range of 
possible outcomes they have considered in arriving at this 
judgement does not give rise to a material uncertainty casting 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. In particular, the Directors have concluded that (1) the 
Group’s borrowing facilities will all remain available throughout 
that period because it will be able to secure waivers of covenants 
on facilities totaling approximately $300 million when tested at  
31 December 2016 which otherwise are forecasted as likely to  
be breached (“the Covenants”) and (2) the Group will be able  
to raise additional finance and/or restructure its existing debt  
if necessary. 
The combination of (1) the current low prices for the Group’s 
production, (2) the dependence on cash flows from the 
Bozshakol project which is only now beginning to ramp-up 
production and (3) the forecast likely breach of the Covenants 
where there is a risk that repayment of the amounts outstanding 
would be required if a waiver could not be obtained, constitute 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern. As this assessment involves 
consideration of future events, many of which are outside the 
control of the Group, there is a risk that the Directors’ judgement 
is inappropriate and that there is a material uncertainty, in which 
case additional disclosures would have been required.
The significance of this risk has increased since the prior  
year because of (1) the lower price outlook for the Group’s 
products over the forthcoming year and (2) the date at which 
covenants are forecast to be breached has come into the going 
concern period.
• Our response Our audit procedures included challenging the 
appropriateness of key assumptions in the cash flow projections 
(including commodity prices, production costs, inflation, foreign 
exchange, production volumes, committed capital expenditure 
and the availability of borrowing facilities) based on historical 
production information and internal mine plans, together with 
market and other externally available information. We tested  
the mathematical accuracy of the projections. We evaluated  
the sensitivity of the projected available cash by considering 
downside scenarios against a set of reasonably plausible  
changes to the key assumptions. We recalculated the  
forecast covenant calculations. 
We read the terms of the Group’s borrowing facilities focusing  
on any terms that could result in those facilities not being available 
throughout the period to 31 March 2017. With regard to the 
plans to obtain a waiver of the debt covenants which otherwise 
would be breached when tested at 31 December 2016, we 
examined evidence of discussions held to date with the providers 
of the relevant facilities and assessed the likelihood that a waiver 
would be granted. With regard to the plans to raise additional 
finance and/or restructure its existing debt if necessary, we 
examined evidence of discussions held to date with potential 
providers of finance and assessed the likelihood that additional 
finance could be raised.
We considered the appropriateness of the relevant disclosure.
Finally to supplement this and to ensure that the matter had 
received appropriate attention from the Board, we sought and 
received written representations from the Directors that their 
plans to obtain a waiver of covenants and to raise further finance  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
www.kazminerals.com 107
and/or restructure the existing debt, if necessary, as described  
in note 2(a) to the financial statements are feasible.
• Our findings We found that the Group’s going concern 
assessment and the key assumptions used therein to be  
balanced. We found the Directors’ plans to negotiate a waiver  
of covenants and, if necessary, for raising additional finance and/
or restructuring the existing debt to be feasible and therefore 
that their judgement that there is no material uncertainty to be 
disclosed to be balanced and the disclosure in note 2(a) to  
the financial statements to be proportionate.
Impairment of Bozymchak Risk rating: á
Refer to page 1 18 (note 3 – significant accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty – Impairment of assets)
• The risk In the prior year, the Group recorded a significant 
impairment on the Bozymchak asset in Kyrgyzstan to write it 
down to its estimated recoverable amount, being its fair value  
less costs of disposal. Having identified the fall in copper and  
gold prices throughout 2015 and the reduction in short and 
medium term price expectations as an impairment trigger, the 
recoverability of the Bozymchak asset is considered to be a risk.
The significance of this risk has increased since the prior year  
due to (1) the significant impairment recorded in 2014 and (2)  
the further reduction in medium term copper and gold price 
expectations, notwithstanding the significant depreciation of  
the Kyrgyz som during the year reducing the carrying value  
of the assets under review and the cost base of the operations.
• Our response Our audit procedures included testing the control 
designed and applied by the Group to ensure that its impairment 
analysis was appropriately undertaken and reviewed. We 
considered the fair value less costs of disposal for Bozymchak 
which the Group derived, as is common in the industry, on a 
discounted cash flow basis. We challenged the appropriateness 
of key assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows 
(including commodity prices, production costs, inflation, foreign 
exchange, production volume, capital expenditure, discount 
rates, interpretation of the tax regime, life of assets and ore 
reserves) based on historical production information and internal 
mine plans, together with market and other externally available 
information. We used our valuation specialist to assess the 
discount rates used. We tested the mathematical accuracy of the 
discounted cash flow models. We evaluated the sensitivity of the 
outcomes by considering downside scenarios against reasonable 
plausible changes to the key assumptions, primarily the impact  
of lower copper prices, a higher discount rate, and alternative 
interpretations of the direct and indirect tax regimes.
• Our findings We found that the valuation used to support the 
Group’s conclusion is within a range of acceptable outcomes  
but that it is based on somewhat optimistic assumptions as  
future copper prices will need to be in the upper part of our 
assessed acceptable range to support the current carrying value. 
Impairment of the East Region  
and growth project assets Risk rating: â
Refer to page 1 18 (note 3 – significant accounting judgements  
and key sources of estimation uncertainty – Impairment of assets)
• The risk Having identified the fall in product prices throughout 
2015 and the reduction in short and medium term price 
expectations as an impairment trigger, the recoverability  
of the East Region assets and the Bozshakol and Aktogay 
development projects is considered to be a risk.
• The significance of this risk has reduced since the prior year due 
to the significant depreciation of the Kazakhstan tenge reducing 
the carrying value of the assets under review. At 31 December 
2014, the net asset value of the Group exceeded its market 
capitalisation by $0.3 billion whereas at 31 December 2015 
market capitalisation exceeded the net asset value by $0.4 billion. 
• Our response We assessed the Group’s impairment analysis  
for the East Region assets and the Bozshakol and Aktogay 
development projects in the context of the significant headroom 
identified. With respect to the audit procedures over the 
control, key assumptions, discount rates and mathematical 
accuracy of the models, we performed the same procedures  
as set out in the Bozymchak risk response. We evaluated the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessments by 
considering reasonable possible downside scenarios.
• Our findings We found that the Group’s impairment reviews  
over the East Region and growth project assets were, based  
on a balanced set of assumptions. We found that the fair value 
less costs of disposal for the development projects exceeded  
net book value by more than it did in 2014, indicating that  
the reduced product price expectations had less of an impact 
than the devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. We found that 
reasonable downside sensitivities applied to the outcome of  
each impairment assessment did not result in the net book  
value exceeding fair value less costs of disposal. 
Bribery and corruption Risk rating: ßà
• The risk The Group’s business involves mining activities  
in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Transparency International’s 
Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 indicates that corruption 
risks remain significant in both countries. In addition, companies 
in the mining sector are inherently at higher risk from corruption 
due to the significant level of government regulation and their 
procurement profile. This could result in material losses to  
the Group and material improper payments not being 
appropriately disclosed.
• Our response Our audit procedures included considering  
the Group’s policies and procedures to prevent the risk of 
corruption. We evaluated the tone set by the Board and by 
senior management. We evaluated the Group’s policies and 
procedures and tested controls over the selection of suppliers 
and the process over acknowledging acceptance of services/
equipment provided by suppliers. We tested samples of 
payments made to suppliers and considered any transactions 
which we considered unusual in the context of the Group’s 
operations. We considered dealings with government agencies 
with a view to identifying indicators of corruption. Where we 
identified individual transactions that at face value appeared  
as though they might have been outside the normal course  
of business, we enquired about these transactions from senior 
operational management and executive management. We 
corroborated explanations given by investigating the nature  
of the transactions and evaluating the business rationale for  
the transactions, taking account of our experience in the mining 
and other industries in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. We discussed  
our findings with senior operational management, the Audit 
Committee and the Board. We also enquired as to whether  
they had knowledge of any improper payments. We involved 
our own forensic accounting specialists to assist with the design  108 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
of our procedures and we remained alert to indications of  
the existence of bribery and corruption throughout our 
performance of other audit procedures.
• Our findings We did not identify any instances of improper 
payments or indications of bribery or corruption. 
In reaching our audit opinion on the financial statements we took 
into account the findings that we describe above and those for other, 
lower risk areas. Overall the findings from across the whole audit  
are that the financial statements have been prepared on the basis  
of appropriate accounting policies, reflect balanced judgements and 
estimates (2014 audit finding: balanced), and provide proportionate 
disclosure (2014 audit finding: proportionate). Having assessed these 
findings, evaluated uncorrected misstatements in the context of 
materiality and considered the qualitative aspects of the financial 
statements as a whole, we have not modified our opinion on the 
financial statements.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope  
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole  
has reduced in line with the reduction in the Group’s total  
assets due largely to the devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge  
and was set at $25 million (2014: $29 million) and was, as last year, 
determined with reference to a benchmark of Group total assets. 
This materiality measure represents 0.6% (2014: 0.5%) of the 
benchmark. We consider Group total assets to be the most 
appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure 
following the sale of the Disposal Assets and the focus on the 
Group’s major growth projects.
We report to the Audit Committee: (i) corrected identified 
misstatements exceeding $25 million (2014: $29 million),  
(ii) uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding  
$1.25 million (2014: $1.30 million) for income statement  
items, and (iii) other identified misstatements that warrant 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were carried out at four 
reporting components located in the Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan 
(all of which are individually significant reporting components)  
and eight reporting components in the United Kingdom (of which 
three represent an individually significant reporting component). 
This represents a reduction of one reporting unit since last year 
due to the disposal described above. Audits for Group reporting 
purposes covered 99% of revenue (2014: 98%); 99% of the total 
of the profits and losses that make up the net profit before 
taxation (2014: 100% of loss before tax); and 97% of total  
assets (2014: 99%). 
The audits of the eight components located in the United 
Kingdom were performed by the Group audit team. Detailed 
audit instructions were sent to the KPMG member firm carrying 
out the audits of the reporting components in Kazakhstan and 
Kyrgyzstan. These instructions covered the significant audit  
areas that should be covered by these audits (which included  
the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above) and 
set out the information required to be reported to the Group 
audit team. The Group audit team visited all the Kazakhstan  
and Kyrgyzstan component teams on three (2014: six) separate 
occasions during the year for oversight of the planning and 
performance of the audits in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and to 
attend meetings with key management personnel in Kazakhstan. 
The audits undertaken at the reporting components of the 
Group were largely performed to local materiality levels as the 
majority of components also prepare local statutory accounts. 
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the key 
reporting components were all performed to materiality levels 
set by, or agreed with, the Group audit team. These materiality 
levels were set individually for each component and ranged from 
$0.6 million to $20 million (2014: $1.5 million to $26 million).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Year ended 31 December 2015 
 
 www.kazminerals.com 115 
1. Corporate information 
KAZ Minerals PLC (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The Company’s registered office  
is 6th Floor, Cardinal Place, 100 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL, United Kingdom. The Group comprises the Company and its 
consolidated divisions as set out below. The Restructuring which completed on 31 October 2014 resulted in the divestment of a number 
of the Group’s relatively mature mining and power operations, primarily located in the Zhezkazgan and Central Regions (the ‘Disposal 
Assets’). On completion, the Company, which was previously known as Kazakhmys PLC, changed its name to KAZ Minerals PLC. 
Following the Restructuring, the Group consists of the East Region operations, Bozymchak and the Mining Projects – which consists  
of Aktogay, Bozshakol and Koksay before the commissioning of the respective concentrators. Once commissioned they will be disclosed 
as individual operating segments when managed separately from Mining Projects.

2. Basis of preparation 
The financial statements set out on 110 to 163 have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with IFRSs as adopted by the  
EU. The Company has taken the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not published the Company’s income 
statement and related notes. 
(a) Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to impact its future growth and operating performance, are set out in  
the Operating Review on pages 38 to 44 The financial performance and position of the Group, its cash flows and available debt facilities 
are described in the Financial Review on pages 45 to 54. In addition, note 31 commencing on page 140 sets out the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital structure, liquidity position and financial risks arising from exposures to commodity prices, 
interest rates, foreign exchange and counterparties. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities and working capital funds. The Board monitors 
the net debt level of the Group taking into consideration the expected outlook of the Group’s financial position, cash flows and future 
capital commitments. The Group adopts a prudent approach in managing its liquidity risk, reflecting the volatility in commodity prices. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group’s net debt was $2,253 million with total debt of $3,504 million and gross liquid funds of  
$1,251 million and total undrawn committed facilities of $250 million. 
At 31 December 2015, the gross debt of $3,504 million consisted of: 
• $1,881 million of the CDB-Bozshakol and Bozymchak facilities which amortises over the period to 2025; 
• $1,228 million of the $1.5 billion loan facility with CDB, which matures over 15 years in 2028; 
• the amended PXF facility, which was fully drawn at $345 million, whose principal repayments will amortise over a three year  
period until final maturity in December 2018; and 
• $50 million under the revolving credit facility provided by CAT. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In making the assessment that the Group is  
a going concern the Board has considered the Group’s cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 March 2017, which reflect the significant 
liquidity on hand at 31 December 2015, including cash and investments of $1,251 million and undrawn committed borrowing facilities  
of $250 million, and the significant capital expenditure planned. The Board has identified the successful ramp up of production at 
Bozshakol and realised commodity prices as the most sensitive variables to expected cash flows. 
At current market commodity prices and on the basis that the current borrowing facilities remain available, the Board considers that  
the Group has adequate liquidity over the going concern period, even in the event of a moderate delay in the assumed ramp up of 
production at Bozshakol. (The Group’s PXF facility and CAT facility are subject to financial covenants in particular the net debt to 
EBITDA covenant which is suspended until 1 July 2016. In the absence of a material improvement in commodity prices from current 
levels this covenant will be breached when tested for the period ending 31 December 2016. Based on discussions with its banks, the 
Board is confident that the banks will view favourably a waiver or temporary suspension request of a technical covenant breach, provided 
the Group’s debt service obligations are maintained, which the forecasts indicate is likely to be the case. This conclusion is supported by 
the short term nature of the breach as well as the quality of the Group’s assets, in particular the Bozshakol and Aktogay mines which  
have long operational lives and provide large scale output at first quartile cash costs. The Board’s analysis therefore assumes that the 
existing debt facilities continue throughout the going concern assessment period.) 
However, in the event of a sustained fall in commodity prices below current levels, combined with delay in the ramp up of Bozshakol, 
mitigating actions would be required to secure liquidity over the going concern period, which could include obtaining additional debt 
financing and the postponement of certain capital expenditure, both of which the Board believes could be achieved. 
Accordingly the Board is satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements.

2. Basis of preparation continued 
(b) Basis of accounting 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which  
have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars ($) and all financial information  
has been rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million) except where otherwise indicated. 
(c) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the Group’s financial 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to  
direct those activities of an enterprise that most significantly affect the returns the Group earns from its involvement with the enterprise. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred out of the Group. When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured 
to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for 
the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed  
of the related assets or liabilities. This treatment may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
recycled through the income statement. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.  
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment. 
The Company treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Company. For purchases from 
non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. 
Refer to note 36(m) for a list of all the Company’s subsidiaries. 
(d) Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued  
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union (EU), and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006. 
(e) Adoption of standards and interpretations 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group did not apply new standards. The Group has not early adopted any 
standards, interpretations or amendments that were issued but are not yet effective. 
(f) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has not applied the following relevant standards and interpretations. The 
Group’s adoption of these standards and interpretations is dependent on the date they become effective for application in the EU: 
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’: the IASB effective date is 1 January 2018 however, the standard has yet to be endorsed by the EU. Based 
on the nature of the Group’s financial assets, the adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the financial 
position or performance of the Group. 
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’: the standard was issued in 2014 with an IASB effective date of 1 January 2018. The 
standard has yet to be endorsed by the EU. The Group has reviewed its major contracts and identified the accounting relating to 
provisional prices as the key area of potential impact arising from IFRS 15 on its financial position and reporting of performance. There 
remains uncertainty over the accounting for provisionally priced contracts, which affects almost all of the Group’s sales contracts under 
the new standard. The mining industry is currently consulting with the IASB on this matter. The new disclosure requirements, subject 
to their endorsement by the EU, will be included in the Group’s 2018 financial statements. 
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’: the standard was issued in January 2016 with an IASB effective date of 1 January 2019. The standard has yet to be 
endorsed by the EU. The standard changes how leases will be recognised, measured, presented and disclosed by lessees. The Group 
will be assessing the impact of IFRS 16 on its financial position and reporting of performance to determine the impact thereof, if any. 
Under these new requirements, certain leases, where material, may be recognised on the balance sheet. 
• Improvements to IFRSs: There are a number of amendments to certain standards following the 2014 annual improvements project 
which have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The impact of any changes to the consolidated financial statements is not expected to  
be significant.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(g) Devaluation of the tenge 
On 20 August 2015, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced that the tenge would trade freely and no longer be subject to 
management within a stated range. Following this announcement, the tenge ended the year at 339.47 tenge per US dollar which  
has resulted in the recognition of exchange gains and losses through the income statement, arising mostly on US dollar denominated 
monetary assets and liabilities held by the Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional currency is the tenge. These exchange 
gains and losses have not been recognised as special items as following the free float of the currency, tenge exchange movements are  
no longer considered one-off in nature. 
The fall in value of the tenge has also resulted in a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $1,773 million recognised within equity, primarily 
due to the translation on consolidation of the Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional currency is the tenge. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses identified as special items in the comparatives were not restated as these arose from managed 
devaluations before the free float and were considered as one-off and non-operational in nature. 
On 11 February 2014, the National Bank of Kazakhstan widened the trading band of the tenge to around 185 KZT to the US dollar, 
resulting in a managed devaluation of approximately 19%. This devaluation had the following impact on the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2014: 
• net finance costs of $207 million from continuing operations included net foreign exchange losses of $181 million which arose from 
the retranslation of tenge denominated monetary assets and liabilities, particularly on intercompany loans, within the Group’s UK 
subsidiaries which had a US dollar functional currency. The net foreign exchange loss that arose from the managed devaluation of  
the tenge was non-operational and treated as a special item; 
• the profit for the year from discontinued operations included a net foreign exchange gain of $24 million which arose from the tenge 
devaluation and was treated as a special item; and 
• non-cash foreign exchange loss of $430 million recognised within equity, primarily due to the retranslation on consolidation of the 
Group’s Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional currency is the tenge, which mainly arose at the time of the devaluation. 
(h)  Comparative information 
Where a change in the presentation format of the consolidated financial statements has been made during the year, comparative  
figures have been restated accordingly. Figures may have been restated to conform with the current basis of understanding. 
3. Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the course of preparing these financial statements, the Directors make necessary judgements, estimates and assumptions about the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgements are based on the Directors’ best 
knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the consolidated financial statements. 
Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions applied are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions  
to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the 
period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
(a) Critical accounting judgements 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), which the 
Directors believe are likely to have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. 
Achievement of commercial production 
Once a mine and concentrator reach the operating levels intended by management, capitalisation of development costs including 
borrowing costs ceases and depreciation of capitalised costs begins with the revenues and operational costs being recorded in the  
income statement and not capitalised to the balance sheet. Significant judgement is required to determine when certain of the Group’s 
assets reach this level including completion of a reasonable period of commissioning; consistent achievement of operating results at a  
pre-determined level of expected capacity and indications exist that this level will continue; mineral recoveries are at or approaching 
expected levels; and the transfer of the project from the development personnel to operational personnel. For the Bozymchak 
operation, commercial production was deemed to have been reached on 1 July 2015. In making this assessment, the Directors 
considered the available capacity of the plant ahead of its planned November 2015 optimisation works and the consistent through 
put of ore and plant recovery rates over a period demonstrating its ability to operate within the available parameters. Revenues and 
production costs were recognised in the income statement with the commencement of depreciation of its asset base from that date.

(a) Critical accounting judgements continued 
Prior periods 
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
On 15 August 2014, the Group’s independent shareholders approved the sale of the Disposal Assets, within the previous Kazakhmys 
Mining and Kazakhmys Power segments. The Directors believed it was highly probable that the disposal would complete within 12 
months following independent shareholder approval. As a result, the Disposal Assets were classified as assets held for sale at 15 August 
2014, and reflected as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement for the period ended 31 October 2014, when the 
sale completed. On the date of classification, the Disposal Assets were remeasured to the fair value less costs to sell of nil, resulting in a 
charge of $1.6 billion being recognised. 
Determination of excess profits taxation (‘EPT’) – Discontinued operations 
In 2011, the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan ruled that Kazakhmys LLC should not have been an EPT payer in the periods up to and 
including 2008. Kazakhmys LLC subsequently submitted a claim for $108 million to the Ministry of Finance. During 2012, $60 million  
had been reimbursed by set-off against the 2012 tax year income tax and MET liabilities and was recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements as a special item. The remaining $48 million of the $108 million claim was challenged by the Ministry of Finance, who believed 
that this amount related to periods beyond the Kazakhstan statute of limitations. 
In 2013, the Ministry of Finance continued its legal action over the $48 million claim, with their appeal reaching the Supreme Court.  
In October 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Kazakhmys LLC confirming Kazakhmys LLC’s right to receive the $48 million 
($39 million at year end exchange rates) of the past EPT payments. Due to the ongoing uncertainty following a legal appeal by the tax 
authorities against the Supreme Court’s decision, no credit was recognised for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
Due to actions taken by the tax authorities during 2014, management continued to believe that sufficient uncertainty remained over  
the recoverability of this amount such that no credit was recognised in the Disposal Assets financial statements as at 31 October 2014, 
the date of disposal. 
(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below. 
Impairment of assets 
The Directors review the carrying value of the Group’s assets to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment such that  
the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of whether an indicator of impairment has arisen requires 
considerable judgement, taking account of future operational and financial plans, commodity prices, sales demand and the competitive 
environment. Where such indicators exist, the carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit is compared with the recoverable 
amount of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value and value-in-use, which is determined on the basis of discounted future 
cash flows. 
This involves management estimates of commodity prices, market demand and supply, future operating costs, economic and regulatory 
climates, capital expenditure requirements, long-term mine plans and other factors. 
Any subsequent changes to cash flows due to changes in the factors listed above could impact the carrying value of the assets. 
An impairment review was performed across the Group’s principal cash generating units (‘CGUs’) as a result of the lower short and 
medium term commodity prices which were deemed to be indicators of impairment. The depreciation of the tenge from August 
reduced the carrying value of the Group’s CGUs in US dollar terms and decreased future operating cost expectations. No impairment 
was identified at any of the Group’s Kazakhstan CGUs. At Bozymchak the successful completion of the optimisation works, together  
with the favourable impact of a weaker Kyrgyz som on future operating cost expectations and the resulting reduction in the carrying 
value of its assets, in US dollar terms, offset the negative impacts of lower short and medium term prices, such that no impairment was 
recognised at 31 December 2015. 
At 31 December 2014, Bozymchak recognised a $128 million impairment charge following the identification of a number of impairment 
indicators. In determining the fair value less costs to sell of the Bozymchak project, the Directors made estimates of the future cash flows 
to be generated by this project with the key variables being copper and gold price assumptions, the mine economics such as copper 
grades, capital expenditure to complete the project and its commissioning date for commercial production (see note 6). 
Determination of ore reserves and useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
Reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining properties.  
In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including  
quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity  
prices and exchange rates. 
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by competent persons as defined  
in accordance with the JORC Code. A review of the Group’s reserves and resources is undertaken on an annual basis by an  
independent competent person. 
   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
www.kazminerals.com 119
 
 www.kazminerals.com 119 
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral reserves are taken into account where there is a high degree of 
confidence of economic extraction (proven and probable mineral reserves). Since the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves 
change from period to period, and as additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may 
change from period to period. Changes in reported reserves may affect the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number  
of ways, including the following: 
• asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows; 
• depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged in the income statement may change where such charges are determined by  
the unit of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change; 
• decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations 
about the timing or cost of these activities; and 
• the carrying value of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of tax benefits. 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may 
change significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production 
costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may ultimately result in reserves being revised. 
For property, plant and equipment depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, the appropriateness of the asset’s 
useful economic life is reviewed at least annually and any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. 
Taxes 
The Directors make estimates in relation to the measurement and recognition of various taxes levied on the Group, which are both 
payable and recoverable. The estimation applies particularly to corporate income taxes, transfer pricing, non-deductible items and 
outcomes of tax disputes that would affect recognition of tax liabilities. Estimation over the recognition and measurement also applies  
to taxes which are recoverable by the Group, principally VAT paid, and relate to the estimated timing of its recovery. The tax obligations 
and receivables, upon audit by the tax authorities at a future date, may differ as a result of differing interpretations. These interpretations 
may impact estimates over the expected timing and quantum of taxes payable and recoverable. 
4. Segment information 
Information provided to the Group’s Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of segmental 
performance is prepared in accordance with the management and operational structure of the Group. For management and  
operational purposes, the Group is organised into three separate businesses as shown below, according to the nature of their  
operations, end products and services rendered. Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance  
with IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’. 
The Group’s operating segments are: 
East Region operations 
The East Region is managed as one operating segment which contains the entity Vostoktsvetmet LLC (‘VCM’), whose principal activity  
is the mining and processing of copper and other metals which are produced as by-products and located in Kazakhstan, and the 
associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK. 
Bozymchak 
The Bozymchak gold-copper mine and concentrator located in Kyrgyzstan and the associated international sales and marketing activities 
managed out of the UK. The Bozymchak operation achieved commercial production on 1 July 2015 with its revenues and costs being 
recorded in the income statement from that date. 
Mining Projects 
The Group’s project companies, whose responsibility is the development of the Group’s major growth projects (Aktogay, Bozshakol  
and Koksay). Once the respective concentrators are commissioned, the projects will be separated into individual operating segments  
as these will be managed separately from Mining Projects. 
Managing and measuring operating segments 
The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA (excluding special items), which is defined as profit before interest, 
taxation, depreciation, depletion, amortisation, the non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation, mineral extraction tax and 
royalties, as adjusted for special items. Special items are those items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not 
impact the underlying trading performance of the business (see note 7). 
The Group’s Treasury department monitors finance income and finance costs at the Group level on a net basis rather than on a  
gross basis at an operating segment level. 
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by product. Segmental information relating  
to employees is provided in note 8.

1 During the pre-commercial production stage of the mining projects, revenues and operating costs are typically capitalised to property, plant and equipment in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy.  
2 MET and royalties have been excluded from the key financial indicator of EBITDA. The Directors believe that MET and royalties are a substitute for a tax on profits, hence  
its exclusion provides a more informed measure of the operational performance of the Group. The MET incurred at Bozshakol and Aktogay (oxide) during the pre-
commercial production stage of $17 million and $3 million respectively has been capitalised to property, plant and equipment. 
3 The non-cash component of the Group’s disability benefits obligation has been excluded from EBITDA, a key financial indicator, as EBITDA is a proxy for cash earnings  
from current trading performance. The non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation is determined as the actuarial remeasurement charge recognised in the 
income statement less the actual cash payments disbursed during the period in respect of the disability benefits obligation. 
4 For the year ended 31 December 2014, discontinued operations comprised the results of the Disposal Assets for the period up to 31 October 2014, the date on which  
they were sold, and the gain on disposal of the Group’s investment in Ekibastuz GRES-1. 
5 On 31 October 2014 the Group divested the Disposal Assets recognising a loss on disposal of $2,273 million (see note 30(a)). In addition, on 1 April 2014 the Group 
completed the sale of the Group’s investment in Ekibastuz GRES-1 joint venture and Kaz Hydro recognising a gain on disposal of $207 million (see note 30(b)).

For the year ended 31 December 2015, the net other operating income included the following items: 
NFC deferral benefit 
In November 2015, the Group signed an agreement with NFC under which $300 million of Aktogay construction costs which were 
scheduled to be paid in 2016 and 2017 will be settled in the first half of 2018 with no change to the overall amount payable to NFC.  
The agreement to defer payments gave rise to a non-cash gain of $16 million representing the estimated benefit to the Group. 
Impact of fire at Bozshakol 
The fire which occurred in August 2015 in the grinding area of the Bozshakol concentrator caused damage to $7 million of equipment, 
the cost of which is recoverable against construction insurance. The damaged equipment has been written-off to other operating 
expenses with the insurance payment recognised in other operating income with a net effect of nil.

The table above relates to continuing operations only. 
Year ended 31 December 2015 
(a) East Region operations – impairment charges  
An impairment of $8 million has been recognised against administrative land and buildings in Kazakhstan, retained in the Restructuring, 
which are no longer in use. 
In addition, a charge of $4 million has been recognised against mine development works which are not expected to be utilised. 
Year ended 31 December 2014 
(a) Mining Projects – impairment charges 
The Bozymchak project was subject to an impairment review following the identification of impairment indicators in 2014 which  
were lower assumed copper prices for 2015, delayed ramp up of the concentrator due to planned optimisation work and changes to  
the mine plan. Following the review, the Group recognised a total impairment of $128 million. The impairment charge was recognised 
as $107 million against property, plant and equipment, $18 million against mining assets and $3 million against other non-current assets 
of the Bozymchak project. The impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the Bozymchak project to its recoverable amount  
of $100 million, determined as its fair value less cost to sell on a discounted cash flow basis, as at 31 December 2014. The cash flow 
forecasts were discounted at a post-tax discount rate of 11% (pre-tax rate of 12%).

1 In 2014 the UK current income tax benefit of $6 million excluded a tax charge of $10 million relating to transactions with the Disposal Assets undertaken during the year 
which was included within the income tax expense of the discontinued operations. 
A reconciliation of the income tax expense applicable to the accounting profit/(loss) before tax at the statutory income tax rate to  
the income tax expense at the effective income tax rate for continuing operations is as follows: 
 
$ million 2015 2014

1 For 2015, the UK statutory rate for January to March 2015 was 21.0% and for April to December 2015 is 20.0%, giving a weighted average full year rate of 20.25%. For  
2014, the UK statutory rate for January to March 2014 was 23.0% and for April to December 2014 was 21.0%, giving a weighted average full year rate of 21.5%. 
Corporate income tax (‘CIT’) is calculated at 20.25% (2014: 21.5%) of the assessable profit for the year for the Company and its UK 
subsidiaries, 20.0% for the operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan (2014: 20.0%) and 10.0% for the Group’s Kyrgyzstan based subsidiary 
(2014: 10.0%). 
Effective tax rate 
Tax charges are affected by the mix of profits and tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The marginally lower CIT rate  
in Kazakhstan and CIT rate in Kyrgyzstan lowers the Group’s overall effective tax rate below the current UK statutory corporate  
tax rate. The impact of unrecognised tax losses and non-deductible items, including impairment losses, increases the Group’s overall 
effective tax rate. 
The following factors impact the effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2015: 
Unrecognised tax losses 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on tax losses primarily at Bozymchak, given the five year statute of limitations and as  
it remains uncertain whether it will have sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these losses. 
Other non-deductible expenses 
Non-deductible items comprise various expenses incurred at the East Region operations and the mining projects relating mainly to  
social community investments and contributions, which are not deductible in Kazakhstan, impairment charges and provisions recognised 
against various assets. The 2014 non-deductible expenses included the $13 million tax impact of the impairment charges recognised  
at Bozymchak and other non-deductible expenses of $23 million arising in East Region operations, Mining Projects, Bozymchak and  
in the UK.

Details of the Group’s tax losses arising in the jurisdictions in which it operates are as follows: 
(i) Kyrgyzstan 
At 31 December 2015 KAZ Minerals Bozymchak LLC had accumulated tax losses which remained unrecognised. These losses can  
be utilised against future taxable profits within the statute of limitations period, which for tax losses is currently five years. The previous 
impairments attributed to Bozymchak indicate that utilisation of these losses may extend beyond the five year period and therefore  
they were not recognised. 
(ii) United Kingdom 
Certain companies in the UK have tax losses that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits in these companies. 
There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses. Where there is sufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise in these 
companies against which the losses can be offset, deferred tax assets are recognised.

(d) Unrecognised deferred tax liability 
The gross temporary differences in respect of the undistributed reserves of the Group’s subsidiaries, as shown in their statutory accounts 
prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, are as follows: 
$ million 2015 2014
Undistributed reserves of subsidiaries 3,903 3,919 
The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of the distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls 
them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
13. Earnings per share 
(a) Basic and diluted EPS 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the (loss)/profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding during the year. Purchases of the Company’s shares by the Employee Benefit Trust and 
by the Company under the share buy-back programme are held in treasury and treated as own shares.

(b) EPS based on Underlying Profit 
The Group’s Underlying Profit is the net profit for the year excluding special items and their resultant tax and non-controlling interest 
effects, as shown in the table below. EPS based on Underlying Profit is calculated by dividing Underlying Profit by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding during the year. The Directors believe EPS based on Underlying Profit provides 
a more consistent measure for comparing the underlying trading performance of the Group. 
The following table shows the reconciliation from the reported profit to Underlying Profit and the share data used to determine the

CDB-Bozshakol and Bozymchak facilities 
On 29 December 2014, the Group signed an amendment to the $2.7 billion China Development Bank (‘CDB’)/Samruk-Kazyna finance 
facilities, which resulted in the facilities becoming bilateral with the CDB and a lowering of the interest rate from US$ LIBOR plus 4.80% 
to US$ LIBOR plus 4.50%. An arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in 
January 2016. The amount outstanding on the previous facility at the time of the amendment was $2.1 billion. The restructuring of  
the facilities with Samruk-Kazyna and the CDB completed in March 2015. All other material terms of the facilities remain unchanged. 
As at 31 December 2015, $1.9 billion (2014: $2.1 billion) was drawn under the facility agreements. Arrangement fees with an  
amortised cost as at 31 December 2015 of $24 million (2014: $30 million), have been netted off against these borrowings in  
accordance with IAS 39. 
CDB-Aktogay finance facility 
At 31 December 2015, the Group had fully drawn down the CNY 1.0 billion facility at $153 million (2014: CNY 697 million;  
$112 million). In order to protect the Group from currency risks arising on the CNY denominated debt, the Group has entered into 
CNY/US$ cross currency swaps. This derivative instrument provides a hedge against any movement in the CNY exchange rate against 
the US dollar and also swaps the interest basis from a CNY interest rate into a US$ LIBOR interest basis. The fair value of the swap  
at 31 December 2015, included within payables, is $10 million (2014: $3 million). 
At 31 December 2015, $1.1 billion (2014: $580 million) was drawn down under the US $1.3 billion facility. Arrangement fees with  
an amortised cost of $15 million (2014: $10 million) have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39. 
The US dollar facility accrues interest at US$, LIBOR plus 4.20% and the RMB facility accrues interest at the applicable benchmark lending 
rate published by the People’s Bank of China (“PBoC”). The funds are available to draw down over a three and a half year period 
commencing from 31 December 2012 and mature 15 years from the date of the first draw down. KAZ Minerals PLC acts as guarantor 
of the loans. At 31 December 2015, $250 million was available to be drawn under the US dollar facility (2014: $798 million). 
Pre-export finance facility (‘PXF’) 
On 29 October 2014, the Group signed an amendment to its PXF debt facility. The amended facility restated the PXF facility signed  
in December 2012. At signing, commitments from the syndicate of lending banks totalled $334 million and a net payment of  
$166 million was paid to exiting banks. On 5 December 2014, the facility was increased to $349 million by means of an accordion  
feature which allowed existing lenders to increase their commitments, or new lenders to join, until 31 December 2015. 
Under the facility, principal repayments amortise in equal monthly instalments over a three year period commencing from January 2016 
until final maturity on 31 December 2018. The margin payable on the amended facility is variable, ranging from 3.0% to 4.5% above  
US$ LIBOR, dependent on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA which will be tested semi-annually. KAZ Minerals PLC, Vostoktsvetmet LLC 
and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited act as guarantors of the loan. The amended facility resulted in certain changes to the covenant package 
including the suspension of the net debt to EBITDA ratio covenant, until 1 July 2016, and changes to the balance sheet gearing covenants 
to make these more aligned to the Group’s projected financial profile until completion of the Bozshakol major growth project. 
At 31 December 2015, $345 million (2014: $344 million) was drawn under the facility. Arrangement fees with an amortised cost as  
at 31 December 2015 of $4 million (2014: $5 million), have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39. The 
amendments signed in October 2014 were considered significant, such that $10 million of previously unamortised costs were expensed 
in full in the prior year. 
Revolving credit facility 
On 14 August 2015, the Group entered into a new $50 million revolving credit facility provided by Caterpillar Financial Services (UK) 
Limited, a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. The CAT Facility is available for three years from the date of signing, following which the facility  
is repayable in four equal quarterly instalments. An interest rate of US$ LIBOR plus 4.25% is payable on amounts outstanding under  
the CAT Facility. The financial covenants on the CAT Facility are identical to those applicable to the Group’s existing PXF. At  
31 December 2015 the facility was fully drawn.

(a) Site restoration and clean up 
The costs of decommissioning and reclamation of mines and processing facilities within the Group are based on the amounts included  
in the Group’s contracts for subsoil use. The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated costs to decommission and 
reclaim the mines at the dates of depletion of each of the deposits. The present value of the provision has been calculated using the 
following discount rates: Kazakhstan 8.8% (2014: 8.0%) per year and Kyrgyzstan 10.3% (2014: 9.8%). The liability becomes payable at  
the end of the useful life of each mine which ranges from one to 48 years. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential 
changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives, and the levels of discount and inflation rates. 
(b) Payments for licences for mining assets 
In accordance with its contracts for subsoil use, the Group is liable to repay the costs of geological information provided by the 
Government of Kazakhstan for licensed deposits. The total amount payable by the Group is discounted to its present value using  
a discount rate of 8.8% (2014: 8.0%). The uncertainties include estimating the amount of the payments and their timing.

30. Discontinued operations 
For the year ended 31 December 2014, discontinued operations comprised the results of the Disposal Assets for the period up to  
31 October 2014 (including the loss on disposal), the date on which it was sold, and the gain on the disposal of the Group’s investments 
in Ekibastuz GRES-1 and Kaz Hydro. There were no discontinued operations in the year ended 31 December 2015. 
(a) Disposal Assets 
Following the independent shareholders’ approval on 15 August 2014, the Board concluded that the Disposal Assets were available for 
immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups and its sale 
was ‘highly probable’. Accordingly, the Disposal Assets were classified as assets held for sale and shown within discontinued operations 
from that date. 
On reclassification to assets held for sale, the Group recognised a charge of $1.6 billion from the remeasurement of these assets to fair 
value less costs to sell of nil. Upon completion, a further charge of $648 million (including $1 million relating to non-controlling interests) 
was recognised arising from the recycling to the income statement of the cumulative foreign exchange losses previously recognised in 
equity of $690 million and a credit of $42 million in relation to the recycling of other reserves. The Group recognised a total loss on 
disposal of $2.3 billion for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
On completion of the Restructuring, the Group transferred $158 million of cash and cash equivalents, and incurred $12 million  
of transaction costs totalling $170 million. In addition, the Group also transferred $30 million in short-term liquid investments. 
(b) Ekibastuz GRES-1 
On 5 December 2013, the Board accepted an offer from Samruk-Energo, an investment vehicle of the Government of Kazakhstan,  
for the sale of the Group’s 50% joint venture in Ekibastuz GRES-1 and the Group’s investment in Kaz Hydro for $1,249 million, after 
transaction costs of $2 million and an additional $49 million being the cost of acquiring the remaining shares held in Kaz Hydro. The  
offer was approved by shareholders on 7 January 2014 with completion dependent on certain conditions precedent. The sale completed 
on 1 April 2014, with the Group recognising a profit on disposal of $207 million after the recycling to the income statement of the 
cumulative foreign exchange losses previously recognised in equity of $24 million.

31. Financial risk management 
The financial information disclosed in the tables represents continuing operations only. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and 
commodity price risk. These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Group’s 
Treasury department in close cooperation with the Group’s business divisions under oversight of a Treasury Committee, which is chaired 
by the Chief Financial Officer. The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the monitoring of financial risks, management of 
the Group’s cash resources, debt funding programmes and capital structure, approval of treasury counterparties and relevant transaction 
limits, and oversight of all significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group. The Treasury department operates as a service centre 
to the business divisions of the Group and not as a profit centre. 
A Group Treasury Policy has been approved by the Board and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial markets 
and the financial exposures facing the Group. The Treasury Policy covers specific areas of financial risk management, in particular, liquidity 
risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk. The Group’s Treasury Committee and the Group’s 
Internal Audit department monitor compliance with the Treasury Policy on a regular basis. 
The Group’s Treasury department prepares monthly treasury reports for senior management which monitor all major financial 
exposures and treasury activities undertaken by the Group. In addition, a treasury report is prepared for each Board meeting which 
includes a summary of the credit markets and their impact on the implementation of the Group’s strategy, progress on the Group’s 
financing initiatives and the significant financial exposures faced by the Group. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivatives used  
for risk management purposes. The Group’s borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instruments are controlled and managed 
centrally by the Group’s Treasury department. Liquidity retained within Kazakhstan is only held for working capital purposes. 
The Group’s accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 35(w). 
(a) Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management 
The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest 
rates and exchange rates. The Group’s philosophy is generally not to hedge its core revenue streams. In periods of significant market 
volatility or uncertainty, the Group may use derivative instruments as a means of reducing volatility and any negative impact on its 
operating cash flows. Limits on the size and type of any derivative hedge transaction are laid down by the Board and subject to  
strict internal controls.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities by categories are as follows: 
 
$ million Notes 2015  2014
  
Loans and receivables

 17,20,21,22  1,276   2,299 
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

24,26,27  (3,727)  (3,507)
1 Loans and receivables comprise long-term deposits within long-term bank deposits (see note 17), trade and other receivables, current investments and cash and cash equivalents. 
2 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise borrowings, provision for cash payments (payments for licences) and trade and other payables (excluding payments 
received in advance, other taxes payable and MET and royalties payable that are not regarded as financial instruments). 
(c) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by a Group company in currencies  
other than that company’s functional currency. The functional currency of the Kazakh entities within the Group is the Kazakhstan tenge, 
the Bozymchak project in Kyrgyzstan is the Kyrgyz som and KAZ Minerals Services Limited UK sterling. The Company, the Group’s main 
financing and holding companies and also the Group’s sales entities have a US dollar functional currency. The functional currency of  
the Group’s intermediary project financing companies used for funding the Kazakhstan based development projects is the tenge. The 
currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar, the CNY and the Rouble. Exchange gains and losses arise 
principally from bank deposits, trade and other receivables, certain intercompany funding balances that exist within the Group and trade 
and other payables. 
The Central Bank of Kazakhstan ended its management of the KZT/US$ exchange rate within a stated trading range in August 2015 
allowing the tenge to become a freely floating currency. As a result of this, any volatility in the tenge will result in volatility in the Group’s 
earnings and net assets. 
Where possible, the Group attempts to conduct its business, maintains its monetary assets and seeks to source corporate debt capital  
in US dollars so as to minimise its exposure to other currencies. The Group retains surplus cash balances in US dollars for capital 
expenditure, acquisitions and returns to shareholders. Working capital balances are maintained in a mix of US dollars and local currencies 
depending on the short-term requirements of the business. Whilst there is a strong correlation between many mining input costs and  
the US dollar, a significant portion of the mining business’ operating costs are denominated in local currencies, particularly the Kazakhstan 
tenge. Rates of exchange for these currencies relative to the US dollar could fluctuate significantly and may materially impact the 
profitability of the underlying operations and the net assets of the Group. 
The Group generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk. From time to time, 
acquisitions and capital investments may expose the Group to movements in other currencies and the Group will consider hedging  
such exposures on a case-by-case basis. 
To protect the Group from currency risks arising on the CDB Aktogay CNY denominated debt, the Group has entered into a  
CNY/US$ cross currency swap. This derivative instrument provides a hedge against any movement in the CNY exchange rate against  
the US dollar and also swaps the interest basis from a CNY interest rate into a US$ LIBOR interest basis. 
(i) Foreign currency exposure by company profile 
The analysis in the table below of the net monetary assets and liabilities (including intercompany amounts) indicates the Group ’s exposure  
to currencies other than the functional currency of a company. These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may g ive rise to 
net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement. As at 31 December 2015 and 2014 these exposures were as follo ws:

(iii) Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of foreign currencies has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities  
at 31 December 2015. This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in 
exchange rates over the course of a period of time. In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. A 10% 
strengthening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have decreased profit after tax by the amounts 
shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on  
the same basis for 2015: 
 Impact on profit
 
$ million 2015 2014
KZT  8  (161)
KGS  (20) (37)
UK sterling  10  11 
CNY  (16) (11)
A 10% weakening of the US dollar against the above currencies at 31 December would have had an equal but opposite effect on  
the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. 
(d) Commodity price risk 
The Group’s mining revenues and earnings are directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of the commodities it produces. The 
Group’s principal commodities (copper, zinc, gold and silver) are priced via reference to global metal exchanges, upon which pricing is 
derived from global demand and supply and influenced by macroeconomic considerations and financial investment cash flows. The pricing 
of the Group’s principal commodities may also include a pre-determined margin or discount depending on the terms of sales contracts. 
Commodity prices, particularly those derived from global metal exchanges, may fluctuate significantly and may have a material impact on 
the Group’s financial results. 
Management closely monitors the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on the business and uses conservative pricing assumptions 
and sensitivity analysis for its forecasting and investment appraisals. 
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities  
at 31 December 2015. This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement  
in commodity prices over the course of a period of time. In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. A  
10% increase/(decrease) in commodity prices after the period end would have no impact on (loss)/profit after tax (2014: $nil). This 
analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular costs, remain constant and was performed on the same basis as 2014. 
(e) Interest rate risk 
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates primarily 
impact borrowings by changing their future cash flows (floating rate debt) or their fair value (fixed rate debt) and deposits. The Group’s 
interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest. In some circumstances, an element of fixed 
rate funding may be considered appropriate. A limited amount of fixed rate hedging using interest rate swaps may be undertaken during 
periods where the Group’s exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant, or in periods when interest rates  
are perceived to be below long-term historical levels. At 31 December 2015, the Group had outstanding interest rate swaps on the  
CDB Aktogay facility of $10 million (2014: $3 million).  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and MET and royalties payable that are not regarded as financial instruments. 
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate (such as LIBOR). Interest on financial 
instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. 
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of interest rates has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at  
31 December 2015. This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in 
interest rates or outstanding borrowings over the course of a period of time. In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables 
remain constant. The effect on profit after tax of a 1% movement in US$ LIBOR rates, based on the year-end net debt position and  
with all other variables held constant, is estimated to be $25 million (2014: $16 million). 
(f) Credit risk 
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets 
and commitments due from third parties. The Group has adopted policies and procedures to control and monitor the distribution of 
these exposures to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties. The maximum exposure with respect  
to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet. 
Credit risk relating to trade receivables 
Given the number and geographical spread of the Group’s ultimate customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk  
is believed to be limited in respect of trade receivables. The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise  
this exposure. 
Customer credit risk is managed by each division but is subject to Group oversight to ensure that each division’s customer credit risk 
management system operates in a prudent and responsible manner. Credit evaluations are performed for all major customers and  
credit limits are established based on internal or external rating criteria. The credit quality of the Group’s significant customers is 
monitored on an ongoing basis, and receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality. 
Letters of credit are obtained where customer credit quality is not considered strong enough for open credit.

(f) Credit risk continued 
Credit risk relating to trade receivables continued 
Within East Region operations, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers.  
Sales to Chinese customers are predominantly made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title  
of the goods. For all sales made to Chinese customers without letters of credit cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title  
of the goods. 
Debtor balances from European and Chinese customers are subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments.  
The Group is therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are  
not considered material in the context of the Group’s overall revenues. 
East Region operations also provide certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its 
contractual obligations under its subsoil licences. For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, full provision is recognised 
in light of past payment history. 
As at 31 December 2015, 10 (2014: 10) customers accounted for 97% (2014: 86%) of the trade and other receivables balance of  
East Region operations. By 23 February 2016, 84% (23 February 2015: 100 %) of year-end balances due from these customers had  
been received in full.

Credit risk related to financial instruments 
Credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, comprising principally cash and cash equivalents, current investments and 
derivative financial instruments arises from the potential default of counterparties. Credit risk arising from balances with banks and 
financial institutions is managed by the Group’s Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy. The Group’s 
cash management policies emphasise security and liquidity ahead of investment return. Investments of cash and deposits are made only 
with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. Exposures are measured 
against maximum credit limits assigned to each approved counterparty to ensure credit risk is effectively managed. The limits are set  
to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure. 
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds remaining 
in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes. The Group must maintain a level of cash and deposits in Kazakhstan  
with local branches of international financial institutions and well established local Kazakhstan banks. The surplus funds in the UK are  
held primarily with major European and US financial institutions with minimum ratings of Standard & Poor’s ‘A-’ and Moody’s ‘A3’  
and ‘AAA’ rated liquidity funds. These limits are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and 
updated accordingly.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non-performance of the counterparties to derivative  
financial instruments.

(g) Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources 
through the use of liquid cash investments and debt facilities of varying maturities. Management regularly reviews the funding 
requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments. 
The Group’s policy is to centralise debt and surplus cash balances to the maximum extent possible.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values: 
• Cash and cash equivalents, current investments and trade and other receivables approximate their carrying amounts largely due to  
the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
• Trade and other payables approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. They  
are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy. 
• Provisions for cash payments are discounted to their present value using the expected cash flows for the project and applicable 
discount rate for individual country and are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
• The fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar maturities. 
They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy. 
(i) Capital management 
The over-riding objectives of the Group’s capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern 
through the commodity cycle, to maximise returns to shareholders (either through dividends or share buy-backs) and benefits to  
other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the Group’s cost of capital. 
At 31 December 2015, total capital employed (which comprises equity holders’ funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings)  
of the Group amounted to $3,826 million, compared to $5,196 million at 31 December 2014. Total capital employed is the measure  
of capital that is used by the Directors in managing capital. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group is in a net debt position of $2,253 million (2014: $962 million). 
The Group does not have a target debt/equity ratio, but has determined a maximum debt capacity based on a ratio of long-term 
‘normalised’ EBITDA which the Board believes establishes a sustainable level of gearing through the commodity cycle. This ratio is 
reviewed in conjunction with market conditions and prevailing commodity prices in order to ensure an efficient capital structure  
that is balanced against the risks of carrying excessive leverage. 
The Group manages net debt to ensure that it does not exceed two times ‘normalised’ EBITDA through the commodity cycle with 
flexibility to allow for up to 2.5 times during periods of major capital investment, where ‘normalised’ EBITDA excludes special items.  
In the medium term, following the Restructuring and during the development and ramp up of the Group’s major projects, when a  
higher net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected, the Group has suspended this internal ratio. Included within the debt facilities are financial 
covenants related to maximum borrowing levels of the Group (determined by reference to net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity 
ratios), minimum tangible net worth of individual Group entities and consolidated gross assets to gross liabilities ratios, for which 
compliance certificates are produced. All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval  
of the financial statements. As discussed in note 2 (a) to the consolidated financial statements and in the viability statement, the Group  
is currently in negotiations with the PXF banks over possible amendments to the terms of these loans as certain covenants may be  
in breach in late 2016.

32. Commitments and contingencies 
(a) Legal claims 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints. The Directors believe that the ultimate liability,  
if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations 
of the Group. As of 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration, 
which may crystallise a financial loss for the Group. 
(b) Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan taxation contingencies 
(i) Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation 
The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities and the timing of recovery of tax refunds. 
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying 
interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively. The Directors’ interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the 
transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of the tax authorities. As a result, the tax authorities may challenge 
transactions and the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties and fines or refused refunds, which could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial performance or position. 
(ii) Tax audits 
Historical tax years relating to various companies within the Group remain open for inspection during a future tax audit. Consequently, 
the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change. 
The tax authorities in Kazakhstan are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in 
respect of all taxes, except for excess profits tax. In respect of excess profits tax, they are able to raise additional tax assessments for  
five years after the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract. In Kyrgyzstan, tax authorities are able to raise additional  
tax assessments for a period of six years after the end of the relevant tax period.  
(iii) Transfer pricing 
The Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation provides clarity on various aspects of transfer pricing, including the use of LME and LBMA 
prices as the basis of market prices, quotation periods to be used for the sale and purchase of traded commodities and the acceptability 
of discounts with reference to LME/LBMA prices when transacting in traded commodities. Notwithstanding these amendments, the 
Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors’ best estimate of the probable cash payments that 
will be required to settle any residual transfer pricing exposures based on the Directors’ interpretation of the transfer pricing legislation 
and the prevailing status of discussions with the tax authorities. The risk remains that the tax authorities may take a different position  
with regard to the interpretation of the transfer pricing legislation, and amendments thereof, and the outcome of discussions with the 
Kazakhstan tax authorities may be materially different from the Directors’ expectations. 
(iv) Possible additional tax liabilities 
The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and  
any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax  
liabilities will arise. However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing 
position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law (inclusive of corporate income taxes, value added tax  
and subsoil use legislation). 
The resulting effect of any positions taken by the tax authorities that differ from those of the Directors is that additional tax liabilities  
may arise or the timing of refunds due may take longer than expected. However, due to the range of uncertainties described above  
in assessing any potential additional tax liabilities and the timing of refunds, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate the financial 
effect in terms of the amount of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group 
may be liable. 
(c) Environmental contingencies 
Environmental regulations, including emissions legislation, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are continually evolving. The outcome of 
environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated at present. As obligations 
are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. The Directors believe that there are no 
significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, however they recognise 
that the environmental regulators in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of 
environmental legislation. The resulting effect is that additional environmental liabilities may arise, however, due to the range of 
uncertainties, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate any further potential exposures. 
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits  
(see note 26), is based upon the estimation of the Group’s specialists. Where events occur that change the level of estimated future  
costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly. 
(d) Use of subsoil and exploration rights 
In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Investments and Development (the ‘Ministry’) granting 
exploration and production rights to third party bodies. Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal 
must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence. These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group 
does not satisfy its contractual obligations.

In the Kyrgyz Republic, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources of the  
Kyrgyz Republic (the ‘competent body’) granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies. Subsoil and exploration  
rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.  
These rights may be terminated by the competent body if the Company does not satisfy its contractual obligations. 
(e) Capital expenditure commitments 
The Group has capital expenditure commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as well as commitments under its 
mining subsoil agreements. Committed expenditure under the subsoil agreements typically relates to investments in community-related 
projects, and includes investments in social sphere assets, infrastructure and public utilities. The total commitments for property, plant  
and equipment as at 31 December 2015 amounted to $634 million (2014: $150 million). 
(f) Operating lease commitments 
The operating lease expense for the year was $2 million (2014: $5 million). At 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Group had the

2 Purchases from related parties include $28 million of cathode produced by Kazakhmys LLC (part of the Disposal Assets). 
(i) Cuprum Holding and the Disposal Assets 
Following the completion of the sale of the Disposal Assets to Cuprum Holding (a company owned by Vladimir Kim, a Director of  
the Company, and Eduard Ogay, a former Director of the Company) on 31 October 2014, Cuprum Holding and its subsidiaries are 
considered related parties of the Group. The transactions mainly consist of transitional and longer-term services provided under two 
Framework Service Agreements between KAZ Minerals and Cuprum Holding. The Framework Service Agreements cover certain 
functions such as smelting and refining. 
For the 10 months until 31 October 2014, the date the Disposal Assets were sold, the Group paid $2.4 million in remuneration to  
key management personnel of the Disposal Assets. These individuals were previously considered to be key management personnel  
of the Group prior to the completion of the Restructuring. 
(ii) Companies under trust management agreements 
The Group, through the Disposal Assets operated a number of companies under trust management agreements with local and  
state authorities. The activities included heating distribution systems and road maintenance. The purpose of these agreements  
was to provide public and social services without any material financial benefit for the Group. 
(iii)  Other 
Transactions with other companies primarily relate to the provision of goods and services, on an arm’s length basis, with companies 
whose boards or shareholders include members of senior management from the Group’s subsidiaries. 
(b) Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties 
Prices for related party transactions are determined by the parties on an ongoing basis depending on the nature of the transaction.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

34. Share-based payment plans 
The Company’s share-based payment plans consist of a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), an Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) and  
a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP). The total expense for the year ended 31 December 2015 arising from these plans was $3 million 
(2014: $5 million). The total number of shares outstanding under these schemes as at 31 December 2015 was 3,214,305 (2014: 
3,653,331). The total number of shares exercisable under these schemes as at 31 December 2015 was 190,643 (2014: 258,580). 
These plans are discretionary benefits offered by the Company for the benefit of its employees. The main purpose is to increase  
the interest of the employees in KAZ Minerals’ long-term business goals and performance through share ownership. They represent 
incentives for employees’ future performance and commitment to be aligned to the goals of the Group. The shares issued under  
these plans are dilutive ordinary shares. For any future awards, the Company may issue new shares rather than purchase the shares  
in the open market through the Employee Benefit Trust. 
35. Summary of significant accounting policies 
The following significant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. These 
accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group. 
(a) Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling  
at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at  
the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are taken to the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
The functional currency of the Company, the Group’s main financing and holding companies and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited is the US 
dollar ($) as the majority of the operating activities are conducted in US dollars. The functional currency of the Group’s Kazakh entities 
and the UK based project finance companies is the Kazakhstan tenge (KZT), with the Bozymchak project being the Kyrgyz som (KGS).  
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated into US dollars, at average rates of exchange. Balance sheet items  
are translated into US dollars at period end exchange rates. Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to a separate  
component of equity. All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise. 
The following foreign exchange rates against the US dollar have been used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:

UK pounds sterling 0.68 0.65 0.64 0.61 
(b) Business combinations 
The Group applies the purchase method to account for business combinations. On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase 
consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (identifiable net assets) on the basis of fair values  
at the date of acquisition. Those mining rights, mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the 
assessment of fair values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights, for which in the Directors’ opinion, values 
cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised. 
The consideration transferred (cost of acquisition) is the aggregate of: (a) the fair values at the date of exchange, of assets transferred, 
liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group; and (b) the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from  
a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in the income statement. 
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets, the difference is 
treated as purchased goodwill. 
If the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the Group 
reassesses whether it has correctly identified and measured the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional  
assets or liabilities that are identified in that review. If that excess remains after reassessment, the Group recognises the resulting gain  
in the income statement on the acquisition date. 
When a subsidiary is acquired in a number of stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest  
in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the income statement. 
Similar procedures are applied in accounting for the purchases of interests in associates and joint ventures. Any goodwill arising on such 
purchases is included within the carrying amount of the investment in the associate, but not thereafter amortised. Any excess of the 
Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the investment  
is included in the income statement in the period of the purchase.

(c) Intangible assets 
(i) Non-mining intangible assets 
Non-mining intangible assets relate largely to software purchases, which are acquired by the Group and which have finite useful lives,  
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price plus any directly attributable costs 
of preparing the asset for intended use. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value which can be 
measured reliably as at the date of acquisition. 
(ii) Amortisation 
Amortisation of intangible assets, which have expected useful lives of three to 10 years, is computed under the straight-line method  
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
(d) Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Initial measurement 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of an item of  
property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition  
for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion  
of production overheads. 
Costs which are necessarily incurred and revenues earned whilst commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable  
of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised. For mining and processing facility assets, capable of operating  
in the manner intended by management requires judgement based on the facts and circumstances of the operation and is considered  
to be when these assets have reached commercial levels of production. Commercial production represents production in reasonable 
commercial quantities and refers to the level of output and not profit or loss and is generally considered to have been achieved when the 
operation is consistently operating at over 60% of its intended capacity for a continuous and sustained period of around three months. 
(ii) Depreciation 
The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has due regard 
to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which 
the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, plant and equipment, with annual 
reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 
the individual asset or on a unit of production basis depending on the type of asset. 
The unit of production method is the ratio of commodity production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves 
over the life of the mine (using proven and probable mineral reserves as determined by the Australasian Code for Reporting of 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 2012 (‘JORC Code’) on an annual basis) based on the estimated 
economically recoverable reserves to which they relate. Changes in estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are accounted 
for prospectively. 
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are ready for use within the business. Freehold land is not depreciated. 
The expected useful lives are as follows: 
• Buildings  15-40 years 
• Plant and equipment 4-25 years 
• Other   3-15 years 
(iii) Construction in progress 
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the  
cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category. 
Construction in progress is not depreciated. 
(iv) Repairs and maintenance 
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, is capitalised 
with the carrying amount of the replaced component being written off. Repairs and maintenance expenditure is capitalised if additional 
future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income 
statement as incurred. 
(v) Leased assets 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and not transferred to the Group 
are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis  
over the period of the lease.

(e) Mining assets 
(i) Mineral licences and properties 
Costs of acquiring mineral licences and properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.  
Costs associated with a start-up period for significant developments are capitalised during the commissioning period (development 
expenditure) where the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period. Mineral licences and properties 
are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method. 
(ii) Mine development costs 
Mine development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves or mineral-bearing ore deposits and to provide facilities  
for extracting, lifting and storing minerals. Such costs are, upon commencement of production, amortised over the remaining life of  
the mine using a unit of production method. 
(iii) Mine stripping costs 
Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement  
of production. Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method. 
The cost of removal of the waste material during a mine’s production phase is deferred if the stripping activity permits an increase in the 
output of the mine in future periods through providing access to additional sources of reserves that will be produced in future periods. 
Capitalised stripping costs are amortised in a systematic manner over the reserves that directly benefit from the specific stripping activity. 
(iv) Exploration and evaluation costs 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest once the legal right to explore has been acquired, other than  
that acquired through a purchase transaction, is carried forward as an asset, within mining assets, provided that one of the following 
conditions is met: 
• such costs are expected to be recouped through successful exploration and development of the area of interest or, alternatively,  
by its sale; 
• exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment  
of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to the area  
are continuing. 
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written off. Administrative and general 
expenses relating to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed as incurred. 
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a purchase transaction are recognised as assets at their cost, or fair  
value if purchased as part of a business combination. Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are  
carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met. 
Exploration and evaluation assets attributable to producing interests are amortised over the remaining life of the mine on a unit  
of production basis. 
(f) Impairment 
The carrying values of mining assets, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure and property, plant and equipment are assessed 
for impairment when indicators of such impairment exist. If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount is calculated. 
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the  
income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount to its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses related to continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent  
with the function of the impaired asset. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may  
no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. 
(i) Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the  
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate  
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, the recoverable amount  
is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group’s cash generating units are the smallest identifiable 
groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
(ii) Reversals of impairment 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to  
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset 
in prior years. Such reversals are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in relation to goodwill are not 
reversed for subsequent increases in the recoverable amount.

35. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
(g) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business  
in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost is determined on the following bases: 
• Raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis; and 
• Work in progress and finished goods are valued at the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation,  
labour and overheads based on normal operating capacity. The cost of work in progress and finished goods is based on the weighted 
average cost method. 
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred  
to completion and disposal. 
(h) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables do not generally carry any interest and are normally stated at their nominal value less any impairment. 
Impairment losses on trade receivables are recognised within an allowance account unless the Group considers that no recovery of  
the amount is possible, in which case the carrying value of the asset is reduced directly. 
(i) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits held on call or with maturities less than three months 
at inception and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant 
risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. 
(j) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the assets or disposal 
groups are available for immediate sale in their present condition. The Group must be committed to the sale which should be expected 
to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification. 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale are carried at the lower of the carrying amount prior to being classified as held for 
sale, and the fair value less costs to sell. A non-current asset is not depreciated while classified as held for sale. A non-current asset held 
for sale is presented separately in the balance sheet. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented 
separately as one line in the assets and liabilities sections on the face of the balance sheet. 
An asset or business is considered to be a discontinued operation if it has been sold or is classified as held for sale and is part of a single 
co-ordinated plan to dispose of either a separate major line of business or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to sale. Once  
an operation has been identified as discontinued, its net profit is presented separately from continuing operations. Comparative 
information is reclassified so that the net profit of the prior period is also presented separately. 
(k) Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After  
initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
(l) Employee benefits 
(i) Long-term employee benefits 
The Group’s entities located in Kazakhstan remit contributions to defined contribution pension plans on behalf of its employees. 
Contributions to be paid by the Group are withheld from employees’ salaries and are recognised as part of the salary expense in  
the income statement as incurred. 
The Group’s defined benefit plans, including the death and disability plans for current and former employees, are accounted for  
in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits (Revised)’, such that the plan liabilities and assets are measured by actuarial valuations  
using the projected unit credit method. 
The future benefit that employees have earned is discounted to determine the present value. The discount rate is determined by 
reference to the US Treasury bond rate adjusted for country specific inflation and risk. The treasury bond used approximates  
the average maturity profile of the Group’s benefit obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified independent actuary  
on a rotational basis. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity  
in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise for defined benefit plans not considered to be other long-term 
employee benefits. In respect of other long-term employee benefit plans, namely the Group’s disability benefits obligation, all actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. The expense in relation to all long-term 
employee benefits is charged to the income statement so as to match the cost of providing these benefits to the period of service  
of the employees.

(ii) Share-based payments 
Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled 
transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share awards with  
market-related vesting conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo method and the fair value at the grant date is expensed  
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point  
the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested. No adjustment is made to the fair value after  
the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. 
(m) Own shares 
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired either by the Employee Benefits Trust for the purposes of the Group’s employee share-
based payment plans or by the Company as part of any share buy-back programmes are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. 
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity. 
(n) Trust activities 
Assets held in trust or in a fiduciary capacity are not treated as assets of the Group and, accordingly, are not included in the consolidated 
financial statements. Transactions entered into with these trust activities are expensed in the consolidated financial statements. 
(o) Social responsibility costs 
The Group contributes towards social programmes for the benefit of the local community at large. The Group’s contributions towards 
these programmes are expensed to the income statement at the point when the Group is committed to the expenditure. 
(p) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. If the effect  
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate  
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.  
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
(i) Site restoration costs 
Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration, and for environmental 
rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation  
of disturbed areas) in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted where 
material and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs. Over time, the discounted provision is increased for the change  
in present value based on the discount rates that reflect current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. At the time of 
establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over the remaining 
life of the mine to which it relates using a unit of production method. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost 
estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Any change in restoration costs or assumptions will be recognised as additions or charges 
to the corresponding asset and provision when they occur. For permanently closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
(ii) Payments for licences 
In accordance with the terms of subsoil use contracts, provision is made for future licence payments when the Group has a  
present obligation to repay the costs of geological information provided for licensed deposits. The amount payable is discounted  
to its present value. 
(iii) Other 
Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be  
an outflow of resources and for which the amount can be reliably estimated. 
(q) Revenue 
Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties during the year. Revenue is measured at the fair value  
of consideration receivable, and excludes any applicable sales tax. MET is included within cost of sales. 
All revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can  
be reliably measured. Revenue associated with the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title and any insurance risk has passed to the customer and the 
goods have been delivered in accordance with the contractual delivery terms or when any services have been provided. 
Almost all sales agreements for copper cathodes, copper rods and copper and zinc concentrate are provisionally priced (i.e. the selling 
price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a quotation period, typically the average price either for the month or the month 
following delivery to the customer), based on the LME market price for the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract. Such  
a provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is not required to be separated from the underlying host contact, being the  
sale of the commodity. At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal sales are marked-to-market using forward prices, with 
adjustments (both gains and losses) being recorded in revenue in the income statement and in trade receivables or trade payables in  
the balance sheet.

35. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
(r) Finance income 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, 
calculated in accordance with the effective interest rate method. 
(s) Finance costs 
Finance costs comprise interest on borrowings which are not capitalised under the borrowing costs policy (see 35(t) below), the 
unwinding of interest cost on provisions and foreign exchange losses. 
(t) Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are 
capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are considered substantially ready for their 
intended use, i.e. when they are capable of commercial production. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the 
amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from money 
borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and 
deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the 
amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the year. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred using the effective interest 
rate method. 
Borrowing costs that represent avoidable costs not related to the financing arrangements of the development projects and are therefore 
not directly attributable to the construction of these respective assets are expensed in the period as incurred. These borrowing costs 
generally arise where the funds are drawn down under the Group’s financing facilities, whether specific or general, which are in excess  
of the near term cash flow requirements of the development projects for which the financing is intended, and the funds are drawn down 
ahead of any contractual obligation to do so. 
(u) Income tax 
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent  
that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Excess profits tax is treated as 
income tax and forms part of the income tax expense. 
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences 
are not provided for: 
• those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of  
the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that  
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or 
the liability is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities  
and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
(v) Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders. Dividends receivable are recognised 
when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. 
(w) Financial instruments 
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instrument. 
(i) Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective  
hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
When financial assets are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus directly 
attributable transaction costs. Any gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised in the income statement. 
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short-term investments, trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables,  
quoted and unquoted investments and derivative financial instruments.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
www.kazminerals.com 155
 
 www.kazminerals.com 155 
The Group’s most significant financial assets, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables  
are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. These are typically  
loans and receivables created by the Group in providing money to a debtor. 
Subsequent measurement 
After initial measurement, loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method 
(‘EIR’). Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the income statement. Allowance for impairment is estimated on  
a case-by-case basis. 
Derecognition 
A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset. This occurs when  
the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets  
is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment 
as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event 
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
(ii) Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of  
its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable  
transaction costs. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings, financial guarantee contracts  
and derivative financial instruments. 
The Group’s most significant financial liabilities, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and borrowings. 
Subsequent measurement 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method after initial recognition. Gains 
and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the EIR amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of 
the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement. 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and 
the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. 
(iii) Derivative financial instruments 
Where the Group enters into derivative contracts that are not hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IAS 39, these are 
carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in finance income or finance costs in the income statement. 
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract 
that significantly modifies the cash flows that would have been expected. 
(iv) Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is an enforceable legal right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabi lities simultaneously. 
(v) Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to quoted 
market prices, without any deduction for transaction costs. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is 
determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions, reference 
to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. 
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured is provided in note 31(h).

Year ended 31 December 2015 
158 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
36. Company financial statements continued 
(d) Company accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The KAZ Minerals PLC parent company balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and related notes  
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006. The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis. The financial statements have been prepared on a  
going concern basis. 
The functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency adopted is US dollars. 
Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements (refer to notes 2 and 35) 
except for the additional accounting policy relating to non-current investments set out below. There were no changes to the accounting 
policies during the year. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues  
and expenses during the period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, 
following implementation of these standards, actual results may differ from those estimates. 
Non-current investments 
Non-current investments are held at cost. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists,  
the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

(i) KAZ Minerals Investments Limited 
As a result of a decline in the short and medium term commodity price expectations, the value of the Group’s underlying assets has  
fallen such that the carrying values of these investments are above their currently estimated fair value less costs to sell. The determination 
of the fair value less costs to sell is subject to the key sources of estimation uncertainty as disclosed in note 3(b). Consequently, an 
impairment charge of $1,552 million has been recognised. Following the impairment, the updated carrying value is supported by a  
range of internal valuations that have been prepared using a discounted cash flow model using assumptions relating to short, medium  
and long-term pricing and other assumptions based on the Group’s expectations of the assets. The internal valuation range is outside the 
range of recent analyst valuations as these applied discounts for perceptions relating to project execution risk on delivery of the Group’s 
major projects and near term liquidity risks. The Group believes that these discounts are excessive given the status and low cost profile  
of the projects. On removal of the applied discount factors, the carrying value of the investments, following the impairment, falls within 
the range of the adjusted analyst values. 
Any positive changes in the amount or timing of estimated future cash flows or in the discount rate such that the fair value of the 
Company’s investments increases, consideration will be given to whether the previously recognised impairments should be reversed. 
In 2014, following the divestment of the Disposal Assets and the subsequent loss on disposal of $2.3 billion recognised by the Group,  
the Company impaired its investment in KAZ Minerals Investments Limited, the intermediary owner of the company that ultimately 
owned the Disposal Assets, by $3,301 million. The impairment charge arose as the holding company of the Disposal Assets sold the 
respective companies for nil proceeds. 
(ii) KAZ Minerals Services Limited 
In 2015, an additional investment of $1 million (2014: $2 million) relating to capital contributions made by the Company to  
KAZ Minerals Services Limited was recognised in respect of the share awards issued by the Company on behalf of employees  
of KAZ Minerals Services Limited. 
(iii) KAZ Minerals Finance PLC 
During 2015, the Company waived $100 million of the intercompany loan receivable due from KAZ Minerals Finance PLC as  
a capital contribution to KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (2014: $150 million).

(iv) Other companies 
The Company holds its interests in other subsidiaries in the Group either directly or via intermediate holding companies for those 
businesses in Central Asia. 
(f) Company intercompany loan 
The intercompany loan receivable comprises $50 million due from KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (2014: $169 million) and $16 million 
(2014: $15 million) from KAZ Minerals Sales Limited and has been advanced by the Company for general corporate purposes. This 
balance is repayable on demand and accrues interest at US$ LIBOR minus 10 bps. As at 31 December 2015, interest receivable of  
$3 million (2014: $3 million) had accrued on this loan balance and is included within intercompany receivables (note 36(g)).

At 31 December 2014, group tax relief was due from KAZ Minerals Sales Limited of $11 million as all UK Group companies are 
considered part of a tax group for corporation tax purposes. The Company was in a loss-making position for tax purposes and  
therefore in a net receivable position.

(i) Capital reserve 
The capital reserve is a non-distributable reserve created when the shares issued pursuant to the share exchange agreements prior to  
the Company’s listing were recorded at fair value. To the extent the Company received dividends from Kazakhmys LLC’s profits created 
in the period prior to the share exchange, the capital reserve was realised through a transfer to distributable retained earnings. Prior  
to the divestment of the Disposal Assets, the Company recognised an impairment charge of $3.3 billion against the carrying value of  
its investments (see note 36(e)) and utilised the capital reserve, which related to Kazakhmys LLC and arose pursuant to the share 
exchange arrangements, to reflect part of the impairment. 
(ii) Capital redemption reserve 
As a result of the share buy-back programme undertaken in 2008 and the re-purchase of KAZ Minerals PLC shares received from  
the ENRC disposal in 2013, transfers were made from share capital to the capital redemption reserve based on the nominal value  
of the shares cancelled. 
(iii) Treasury shares 
The treasury shares reserve represents the cost of the Company’s shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy the  
share options awarded under the Company’s share-based payment schemes.

(k) Company financial risk management 
The Company, as a holding company, has limited exposure to foreign exchange, credit and interest rate risks and these are shown below. 
The Company has no exposure to commodity, liquidity or price risks. 
(i) Foreign exchange risk 
The Company has transactional currency exposures principally arising from transactions relating to corporate costs which are 
denominated in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency, being the US dollar. Corporate costs are primarily 
denominated in UK sterling. The Company generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign  
currency risk. 
(ii) Credit risk 
Credit risk for the Company relates to cash and cash equivalents. Balances within intercompany loans and trade and other  
receivables mostly relate to amounts owed by Group undertakings resulting in reduced credit risk for these balances. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at  
31 December was: 
$ million 2015 2014 
Intercompany loans  66  184 
Trade and other receivables  3  14 
Cash and cash equivalents  1  – 
  70  198 
The exposure to credit risk for intercompany loans and trade and other receivables at 31 December 2015 and 2014 by geographic  
areas was all European. 
(iii) Interest rate risk 
The Company has limited balances subject to interest rate risk. The exposure of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities to

(iv) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Company’s financial instruments that are carried  
in the financial statements:

  (31) (31)  91  91 
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, 
trade and other payables and intercompany loans and payables approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term 
maturities of these instruments. 
(v) Capital management 
The over-riding objectives of the Company’s capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern 
through the commodity cycle, to maximise returns to shareholders (either through dividends or share buy-backs) and benefits to  
other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the Company’s cost of capital (see note 31(i)). 
(l) Company related party disclosures 
(i) Transactions with related parties 
Transactions with related parties comprise interest received from KAZ Minerals Finance PLC of $0.1 million (2014: $0.1 million)  
and management fees to KAZ Minerals Services Limited for services provided on behalf of the Company during the year under a 
management service agreement of $21 million (2014: $52 million). 
The amounts outstanding from subsidiary companies are provided in notes 36(f) and 36(g). 
The intercompany payables amount of $99 million is due to KAZ Minerals Services Limited for management fees discussed above  
and other services (2014: $105 million). The balance is payable on demand and is interest free. 
The Company did not receive any dividends from KAZ Minerals Sales Limited (2014: $50 million) during the year. 
An additional investment of $1 million relating to capital contributions was made to KAZ Minerals Services Limited during 2015  
(2014: $2 million) (see note 36(e)). 
As explained in note 36(e), in 2015 the Company waived its right to receive repayment of $100 million of the outstanding  
intercompany loan receivable due from KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (2014: $150 million). 
(ii) Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties 
Prices for related party transactions are determined by the parties on an ongoing basis depending on the nature of the transaction.

(n) Guarantees 
The Company is the guarantor for the following: 
• as explained in note 24, the Company, together with Vostoktsvetmet LLC and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited, is a guarantor of  
the $349 million PXF debt facility signed in October 2014; 
• the Company was the guarantor of the loan facilities signed between KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna under the 
CDB/Samruk-Kazyna financing line. Following an amendment which was signed on 20 December 2014, the CDB/Samruk-Kazyna 
financing facilities became bilateral between KAZ Minerals and CDB, with no further guarantees to Samruk-Kazyna. The amendment 
became effective in March 2015 such that at 31 December 2015 the Company was then a guarantor of the loan facilities with the 
CDB only. As at 31 December 2015, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had signed loan facilities amounting to $1.9 billion which were fully 
drawn at that date; 
• in 2014 the Company was also party to a several but not joint guarantee to CDB under the loan facilities between CDB and  
Samruk-Kazyna which is capped at $1.7 billion of principal plus 8.5% of any interest and other duly payable costs and expenses.  
A right of set-off existed under the loan facilities between Samruk-Kazyna and KAZ Minerals Finance PLC in the event of any 
payment being made by the Company to CDB under this guarantee. Following an amendment which was signed on 20 December 
2014, the CDB/Samruk-Kazyna financing facilities became bilateral between KAZ Minerals and CDB and no further guarantees were 
given to Samruk-Kazyna. The amendment became effective in March 2015 and therefore at 31 December 2015 the joint and several 
guarantee no longer existed; 
• as explained in note 24, the Company is a guarantor of the CDB Aktogay finance facilities totalling $1.5 billion for the Aktogay  
project signed in December 2011 with CDB; 
• the $50 million CAT revolving credit facility signed in August 2015; and 
• the operating lease on the Company’s head office in London.

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES 
Year ended 31 December 2015 
 
 www.kazminerals.com 171 
Ore reserves and mineral resources estimation methods  
The Republic of Kazakhstan inherited the classification system and estimation methods for minerals established by the Former  
Soviet Union (‘FSU’). Updated “Regulations for the Classification of Non-ferrous Metals Reserves” became law in Kazakhstan in 2006.  
In practice, this means that the statements of resources and reserves developed by KAZ Minerals PLC (and the mining plans to which  
they relate) must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry for Investment and Development, for 
which adherence to the standardised national system of resource and reserve estimation is mandatory. 
Mineral deposits are classified according to their degree of geological complexity into one of three deposit categories (for copper 
deposits), which determine the density of exploration sampling and the proportions and classifications of GKZ (State Commission on 
Mineral Reserves) reserves that must be estimated. As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of “Conditions  
for Estimation of Reserves” is prepared by a Kazakhstan licensed design institute and submitted for approval to the State. The Conditions 
for each deposit specify the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations which may 
apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present difficulties. 
Resources and reserves have traditionally been estimated by KAZ Minerals, according to the FSU’s “Classification and Estimation Methods 
for Reserves”. It is apparent that there is a growing trend towards greater flexibility and discussion between state authorities and mining 
companies with respect to resource estimation methods. This has been reflected in the increased use of computers and associated 
software by KAZ Minerals in order to maintain records about reserves at the operating mines and using databases linked to modelling 
software to assist in exploration and preliminary resource estimation. DMT Consulting Ltd (‘DMT’) recognises that this is an important 
step towards achieving verifiable and internally consistent resource and reserve estimates. 
For the operating mines in the East Region and Kyrgyzstan, DMT has reviewed the reserves statements of KAZ Minerals and has 
presented them in accordance with the criteria required to meet JORC standards. “Guidelines on the Alignment of Kazakh minerals 
reporting standards and the CRIRSCO Template” were published during 2015 as a joint initiative of the Committee for Mineral Reserves 
International Reporting Standards (‘CRIRSCO’) and the Kazakh Committee of Geology and Subsoil Use and State Reserves Committee. 
The guidelines have been used to align categories of reserves (A, B, C1 and C2) with appropriate Mineral Resource categories (Measured, 
Indicated and Inferred). The JORC Competent Person, however, remains responsible for any estimate that is reported.  
Mineral Resources, by definition, must have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. In general, therefore, the total active 
balance reserve, where no unresolvable problems are foreseen, is considered as the Mineral Resource. Balanced reserves in categories  
B and C1 are assigned to the Measured Mineral Resource category and the C2 category is assigned to the Indicated Mineral Resource 
category. Ore Reserves in Proved and Probable categories are then converted from the Resources, after consideration of mining plans 
and after the application of appropriate modifying factors for loss and dilution. Legal approval for the exploitation of a particular reserve 
block is also taken into consideration. 
For KAZ Minerals’ major development projects at Aktogay, Bozshakol and Koksay, DMT has based the assessment of Mineral Resources 
and Ore Reserves on estimates derived from computer modelling that are estimated in accordance with the guidelines of JORC, typically 
by external consultants. The JORC Code specifies that a Pre-feasibility Study is the minimum level of engineering design required before  
a Mineral Resource can be converted to an Ore Reserve. Each of these projects is being developed following international best practice, 
which includes the creation of a computerised geological model linked to an electronic database. GKZ estimates of tonnage and metal 
content will continue to be undertaken to comply with national Kazakh requirements. DMT, however, believes that these projects will  
be best understood by potential investors if the resources and reserves are reported along conventional international lines from the 
outset, using the JORC Code. 
DMT’s visit to KAZ Minerals’ Almaty office for this year’s audit took place in November 2015. Mine production data for the operating 
assets has therefore been based on actual figures until October 2015 and then based on forecasts to arrive at end-of-year results. 
The assessment of Inferred Resources for KAZ Minerals is incomplete. The mines do not keep records of “prognosticated reserves”  
(as defined in Kazakhstan), categories P1, P2 and P3 under GKZ, which may include material that could be considered equivalent to 
 JORC category of Inferred Resources. Inferred Resources are shown in the tabulations for Aktogay, Bozshakol and Koksay where model 
based estimates have been used and Inferred Resources have been categorised as such by a Competent Person under the JORC Code.  
All Ore Reserves quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution and refer to estimates of tonnes and  
contained metal grades at the point of delivery to the processing plant. Mineral Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution  
and are inclusive of Ore Reserves. All figures in reserves and resources are in dry metric tonnes and are dated as at 31 December 2015.

   174 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONTINUED 
Year ended 31 December 2015 
174 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
Revision of ore reserves and mineral resources statement to 31 December 2015 
DMT Consulting Ltd (‘DMT’ or the ‘Consultant’) has undertaken a review of the estimate of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 
prepared by KAZ Minerals PLC (the ‘Company’), as the basis for the preparation of a statement of Mineral Resources and Ore  
Reserves for the Company as at 31 December 2015. Tabulations of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, comparisons with the 
previous annual statement and short technical descriptions are provided for the Company’s copper and gold assets. 
DMT’s technical understanding of the mines and projects held by KAZ Minerals is largely based on the Competent Person’s Reports  
that IMC (prior to changing name to DMT) prepared for the Company in 2005, for the London listing, and again in 2010, for the Hong 
Kong listing. Additional technical site visits have been made since 2010 when IMC/DMT considered them necessary, either to look at  
new assets or where material changes have taken place e.g. new exploration drilling. As part of the 2015 review, DMT consultants  
visited the underground operation at Orlovsky and the new open pit mine at Aktogay. Technical familiarity with the Company’s mines 
and projects is a critical aspect of the annual review, in support of what is primarily a desktop exercise. 
The annual review of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, carried out by DMT, is predominantly focused on mine reserve reports, 
depletion through production, analysis of Company plans, new exploration results, new technical reports and other changes affecting  
the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.  
The Statement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves is restated in accordance with the criteria of the 2012 version of the  
‘Australasian Code for Reporting Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves’, published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the 
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and collaborating institutions (the ‘JORC Code’).  
The consideration of Mineral Resources is based on the JORC definition which says that a “Mineral Resource is an occurrence of  
minerals in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction”. In converting Mineral 
Resources to Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code, DMT considers a number of “Modifying Factors”. Consequently, the 
Code defines an Ore Reserve as “the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting 
materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried 
out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction could reasonably be justified.” 
The term “economically mineable” has no fixed definition in the JORC Code, and short-term fluctuations in factors such as metal prices 
or operating expenditure do not warrant the re-classification from Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources. If, however, the changes are 
expected to be long term or permanent in nature, then such re-classification is required. 
For the sake of clarity in this report, references to the JORC categories “Ore Reserve” and “Mineral Resource” are capitalised. The  
non-capitalised term “reserve” refers to the Kazakh use of the word which can, depending on the context, be synonymous with both 
JORC terms “Ore Reserve” and “Mineral Resource”. 
DMT is satisfied, from the audit undertaken, that the recently revised estimates of resources and reserves prepared by the Company  
for the East Region and Kyrgyz operating mines are in accordance with the classification system required by law in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan and that, correspondingly, the estimates have a consistent basis for expressing the degree of confidence for stating quantities 
of exploitable minerals at specific grades of metal content. On the basis of the estimates supplied by the Company, DMT has applied  
the same technical criteria as used in the 2010 audit, for preparation of the restatement of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources as  
at 31 December 2015, in accordance with the reporting criteria of the JORC Code. 
Guidelines for the alignment of Russian minerals reporting standards and the JORC Code were published in 2010 and these have been 
applied in the preparation of the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statement for the East Region and Kyrgyz operating mines. This is 
considered appropriate as all of the mineral deposits currently being mined by KAZ Minerals were explored during the Soviet era and 
reserves approved during that era are still referenced. The aim of the guidelines is to provide a standard reporting terminology for use  
in disclosure of the assets of mining companies to stock markets.

Unsolicited telephone calls and correspondence
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about 
the Company. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ 
who target US or UK shareholders, offering to sell them what 
often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares. These 
operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’ and the 
‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely persuasive. If 
shareholders receive any unsolicited investment advice, they  
can check if the person or organisation is properly authorised  
by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) at www.fca.org.uk/
register and the matter may be reported to the FCA by using  
the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams or by 
calling 0800 1 1 1 6768 (UK) or +44 20 7066 1000 (international).

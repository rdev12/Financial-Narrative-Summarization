FROM A ONE  
PRODUCT COMPANY 
TO A BROAD 
TECHNOLOGIES 
GROUP
Symphony is an international company, reaching  
every corner of the globe. We have a growing  
number of distributors giving us a presence in  
nearly 100 countries worldwide.
OVERVIEW
d 2w is a masterbatch system which, when 
included in the manufacturing stage turns 
ordinary plastic at the end of its useful life 
into a material with a different molecular 
structure. At that stage it is no longer a 
plastic and has become a material which  
is inherently biodegradable in the open 
environment in the same way as a leaf.

OVERVIEW
d 2t is a suite of technologies that provide 
anti-counterfeiting performance. They offer 
the ability to determine the authenticity  
of your plastic packaging and other plastic 
products through a unique and sophisticated 
tracer system. d
2t complements Symphony’s 
portable d 2Dectector device.
See page 11
OVERVIEW
The d 2Detector is a portable XRF (X-ray) 
device that allows customers, and the 
authorities in countries with relevant 
legislation, to determine in less than 60 
seconds whether or not a plastic product 
contains d
2w, d 2p or d 2t additives as 
specified, and whether it contains any 
undesirable substances.

Chairman’s statement
Nirj Deva, DL, FRSA, MEP
I am pleased to report a 63% reduction in the 
operating loss from £0.73 million in 2013 to  
£0.27 million in 2014. The loss in 2013 included  
£0.57 million of non-recurring expenditure  
(2014: £nil). Cash used in operations reduced  
by 88% to just £0.10 million in 2014 from  
£0.81 million in 2013.
IDENTIFYING 
GROWTH
OPPORTUNITY
The balance sheet was strengthened in the 
final quarter after an equity placing raised 
£1.58 million in November 2014.
Group revenues reduced by 12% from £7.19 
million in 2013 to £6.35 million in 2014. 
Revenues are mainly derived from d
2w 
masterbatch sales, and these had been 
affected by timing issues in a number of 
markets. As previously reported, legislative 
momentum in favour of d
2w type products 
continues in several countries. Whilst there 
have been delays in implementation and 
enforcement of the legislation in certain 
jurisdictions, our local distributors have 
recently noticed material progress in this 
area. However, the Board remains cautious 
over the timing of sales in these locations.
Oxo-biodegradables are now seriously 
debated in the world’s largest markets 
including the European Union where they 
are trying to resolve the problems of waste 
minimisation and reducing plastic litter. The 
need for change is more apparent than 
before and oxo-biodegradables are in the 
right space at the right time. We were 
pleased that in March 2015, Symphony’s Chief 
Executive, Michael Laurier, was a speaker at 
the International Conference on the marine 
environment at the United Nations.
We remain optimistic about our product 
positioning and are particularly pleased 
with certain external recognitions thereof, 
such as the recent award to Symphony of 
the prestigious ABNT Eco-Label. ABNT is 
accredited by INMETRO for certification of 
products, and INMETRO is a member of the 
International Accreditation Forum. The 
criteria for awarding an Eco-Label are to 
preserve environment quality and minimise 
pollution caused by production, use and 
disposal of products and services.
Significant development work was 
undertaken during the year for both of our 
two main technologies, such costs totalling 
£0.41 million in the year (2013: £0.55 million). 
In addition, a new high-tech R&D facility was 
opened in May 2014 by our local mayor at 
our Head Office in Borehamwood, UK. We 
choose to make these significant investments 
in R&D as we see potential future demand 
for a broadened technology range.
Our d
2p “designed to protect” range has now 
increased to six product lines encompassing 
many different formulations including 
anti-microbial, odour adsorbing and insect 
repellent. Trials continue in many countries 
on end-products including toys, cutting 
boards, water pipes, tooth brushes,  
bags-for-life and gloves amongst many 
others. Some of these developments are with 
global multi-billion pound organisations. 
Trials and evaluations for both d
2w and d 2p 
products can take many years, especially 
with larger organisations. These are 
sometimes complex processes involving 
many departments and many personnel 
within the end-user including purchasing, 
marketing, technical, and product 
development. We have a large pipeline 
which ages from over two years to current 
covering many types of organisation in 
countries throughout our whole global 
distribution network, with a number of trials 
close to decision time.

Key Opportunities
 > Global business in nearly 100 countries.
 > In a multi-billion dollar market – 300 million 
tonnes of polymer produced annually.
 > Market set to grow at 4.4% per annum

 > Anti-microbials predicted to be one of the 
fastest growing sectors.
 > Increasing legislation in favour of  
oxo-biodegradable plastic. 
 > Huge potential in developing economies 
particularly Asia-pacific and Africa.
 > Continuing investment in R&D.
However, due to the number of complexities 
involved in the final decision, whilst the 
projects are progressing well, the Board 
again remains cautious on timing of any 
sales from such trials and evaluations.
In December 2014 Shaun Robinson was 
appointed to the Board of Symphony, and 
we are already grateful for his contribution 
to date. The Board is also pleased to have 
such strong commitment and support from 
Somerston Capital who participated in the 
placing in November 2014. This commitment 
to the business was reciprocated by Michael 
Laurier, with his purchase of an additional 
750,000 shares at the time of the placing. 
With Shaun Robinson as a Board Director, 
the Directors’ have a beneficial interest in 
24.9% of the Company’s ordinary shares 
(2013: 19.5%).
I would like to thank the Board, the staff, and 
our Distributors for all their work in 2014, 
and we look forward to 2015 with confidence.

Chief Executive’s review
Michael Laurier
Much has been achieved in 2014 in the further 
development of our technologies, and product 
range. New IP formulations have been created, and 
major trials following signed agreements continue 
with some of the world’s largest companies.
The commercial objectives have been clearly 
defined within each project and trial. The 
potential value, if only some of these trials 
succeed, is considerable. As a result, we 
have continued to invest resources into 
each project.
Commercially for d
2w, we have seen several 
countries either taking steps to enforce 
legislation or to pass new legislation in favour 
of oxo-biodegradable plastic technology. 
This is an unknown process so it has been 
difficult to predict timing or value, and as 
such, no material financial effect occurred 
in the year under review.
For d
2p, there is strong commercial interest 
to buy our technology, and small orders are 
now starting to be placed. We have continued 
to develop and process new formulations, 
conduct trials, and seek regulatory approvals 
in the countries and products that require 
these approvals. The d
2p development has 
been significant since our formulations have 
expanded beyond polymer master-batch 
into active powders and liquids. 
The Group’s pre-tax loss for the year reduced 
to £0.39 million from £0.78 million in 2013. 
Within these losses, R&D expenditure of 
£0.41 million (2013: £0.55 million) was 
expensed in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Trading results
Group revenue decreased by 12% to £6.35 
million (2013: £7.19 million), but Group gross 
profit margins increased slightly to 49.8% 
from 49.3% in 2013. The contribution from 
gross profit was £3.16 million (2013:  
£3.55 million). 
Recurring administrative expenses 
decreased by 8% to £3.26 million (2013: 
£3.53 million) due to the effect of savings 
implemented during 2013. Non-recurring 
administrative expense of £0.57 million 
were incurred in 2013 but there were no 
non-recurring items in 2014.
Including non-recurring items, the Group 
made an operating loss of £0.27 million in 
2014 compared to an operating loss of 
£0.73 million in 2013. This resulted in loss 
before tax of £0.39 million in 2014 (2013: 
loss £0.78 million). 
Excluding non-recurring items, the Group 
made an EBITDA loss of £0.14 million in 2014 
(2013: loss £0.01 million) with an operating 
loss of £0.27 million (2013: loss £0.16 million).
The Group reports a loss for the year of 
£0.31 million (2013: loss £0.71 million) with 
basic loss per share of 0.23 pence (2013: 
loss per share 0.55 pence). 
Development costs of £0.26 million were 
capitalised in 2014 (2013: £0.12 million), and 
the net book value of capitalised development 
costs at the end of the year amounted  
to £1.13 million. Further development 
expenditure of £0.41 million (2013: £0.55 
million) was expensed directly to the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Capitalised development costs represent 
8% of expenses as detailed above. Within 
the total amount of £1.13 million capitalised 
to date less amortisation and impairment, 
£0.16 million relates to d
2w products which 
have been developed and are being sold, 
while the balance of £0.97 million, relates to 
further environmental plastic applications 
still in development and where we believe 
significant revenues will be generated in the 
foreseeable future. 
The Group’s primary selling currency is the 
US Dollar. The Group self-hedges where 
possible by purchasing in US Dollars and has 
banking facilities in place in order to secure 
rates going forward. As at 31 December 
2014 the Group had a net balance of US 
Dollar assets totalling $0.64 million (2013: 
$0.56 million).

evaluations. As stated above, there have 
been some orders to date, the volumes so 
far being small as expected. The new d 2p 
bag4life, medical products, toys, food and 
non-food containers, and industrial 
packaging applications, are all areas where 
we expect substantial sales activity in the 
medium term. 
I am confident that our strategy will continue 
to work in a world that needs both of our 
main technologies d
2w and d 2p. Plastic 
pollution, health and food protection are, 
and will remain important concerns in 
today’s society.

Recycling Technologies division (Symphony 
Recycling Limited or “SRT”). Within SEL 
there are two operating segments; “Plastics 
Sales” which generate and maintain revenues 
relating to plastic additives, masterbatches 
and finished products, and “Plastics R&D” 
which includes all new product development 
and research expenditure.
Plastics Sales, which represent all Group 
sales, generated an EBITDA profit £0.49 
million (2013: £0.78 million). Plastics R&D 
incurred an EBITDA loss of £0.41 million 
(2013: £0.55 million).
SRT has no revenues to date and incurred 
expenditure of £0.22 million in the year, 
resulting in an EBITDA loss of the same 
amount (2013 expenditure and EBITDA loss: 
£0.81 million). As previously stated, the Board’s 
strategy is to commercialise SRT. We have 
reduced costs and are still investigating 
areas where this can be achieved.
Cash flow
The Group used cash of £0.10 million from 
operations (2013: cash used £0.81 million). 
The Group has a £1 million trade finance 
facility with HSBC Bank plc of which £0.15 
million was drawn down as at 31 December 
2014 (2013: £0.58 million). The invoice-finance 
facility increased in line with receivables.  
In addition to these facilities, the Group had 
borrowed a further £0.65 million through 
unsecured loans. These loans were repaid  
in January 2015.
The Group had net cash in the bank of 
£0.59 million at the year-end (2013: £0.03 
million), plus trade receivables of £1.27 
million (2013: £1.16 million) and continues  
to work comfortably within its facilities.
Outlook
A positive trend clearly shows a strategy that 
is working across several key business drivers. 
The first being new legislation in support of 
oxo-biodegradable technology like d
2w. The 
second is the enforcement and widening of 
the scope of existing legislation. The third is 
a gentle domino effect from the legislation 
together with a growing momentum of 
companies that want to upgrade their 
sustainability credentials without supply 
disruption or increased cost.
The Group has seen an increase in d
2w 
activity in the current year where there is 
legislation in place and indications of a 
strengthening position later in the year.
There is a similar positive trend for the 
growing range of d
2p products. Many of  
our global distributors have shown serious 
interest by requesting trials and product

w controlled‑life technology
Plastic is lightweight, flexible, strong, durable, heat 
sealable, impervious to moisture, recyclable, reusable, but 
whether by intent or accident, some plastic will always 
find its way into the environment on land and sea.
ADDING OUR 
TECHNOLOGY
TO PLASTICS
PLASTIC IS FANTASTIC
Plastic is an amazing invention. There is 
nothing like it for protecting our food and 
other goods from damage and contamination 
and for carrying them home from the shops. 
It is waterproof, strong and flexible, can be 
adapted for a variety of products and is  
not expensive.
Every year 300 million tonnes of plastic 
polymer are produced globally. Unfortunately 
much of it ends up as litter either in landfill 
(if it can be collected) or causing a visual 
intrusion, blocking water courses, polluting 
the oceans and endangering wildlife. The very 
property that makes plastic fantastic, namely 
its durability, is also the reason that it is such 
an environmental nuisance after its useful 
life. Old-fashioned plastic can last for decades.
d 2w INNOVATIVE PLASTIC IS THE ANSWER  
TO PLASTIC WASTE IN THE ENVIRONMENT
What do we do with all the plastic waste 
that cannot realistically be collected?  
d 2w is the answer to plastic waste that 
escapes collection and ends up in the open 
environment. Unlike ordinary plastic the  
life of a product made with d
2w can be 
pre-determined at manufacture, typically 
six months for a bread bag and 18 months 
for a lightweight shopper bag.
At the end of the useful life the plastic will 
degrade in the presence of oxygen until  
it is no longer a plastic and has become  
a material that will biodegrade in the  
open environment, eventually being 
bio-assimilated in the same way as a leaf – 
only quicker and leaving no toxic residues.

plastic additive to be

d 2w plastic can be made in existing polymer 
factories using existing machinery and 
workforce at little or no extra cost.
CAN BE RECYCLED WITH  
CONVENTIONAL PLASTIC
Better still, if it gets collected it can be 
recycled with conventional plastic, a fact 
confirmed by Roediger Laboratories, in May 
2012 who concluded that plastic products 
made with d
2w can be recycled without any 
significant detriment to the newly formed 
recycled product.
THE CARBON VALUE
Studies have demonstrated that one of  
the benefits of d 2w oxo-biodegradable 
technology is that the carbon content of  
the plastic is ultimately shared with living 
organisms in the environment. Studies  
have also shown that the carbon based 
organic materials developed by the 
degradation mechanism are biodegradable 
and therefore absorbed by living organisms 
in the soil. (Biodegradation Tests of  
Oxo-biodegradable Polyolefins by Means  
of Single Microbial Species, University of  
Pisa 2009). 
This is not the case with conventional plastic 
that holds the carbon for many decades  
nor (vegetable-based) hydro-degradable 
plastics that release the carbon rapidly as 
CO
2 gas.
d 2w has been tested for food-contact safety 
according to the requirements of the 
European Union Directive 2002/72/EC, and 
the Food and Drug Administration Code of 
the United States, Chapter 21. Furthermore 
a study carried out by Intertek in 2012 into 
the life cycle of shopping bags concluded 
that the environmental credentials of bags 
made with oxo-biodegradable plastic 
technology were ahead of bio-based and 
conventional plastic bags.
Many countries are committed to using 
plastic products because at the present time 
there is nothing as low cost, flexible and 
efficient to replace them. Oxo-biodegradable 
plastic offers a sensible solution to plastic 
waste in the environment, a fact recognised 
by the United Arab Emirates who along with 
eight other countries have made this 
technology mandatory. They knew they 
could not collect all the plastic for recycling, 
so they decided to do something about it.
All of this adds up to substantial positive  
PR for customers, being a practical 
demonstration of their concern for 
environment and their commitment  
to sustainability.
With millions of tonnes of plastic used 
around the world, there is an urgent need to 
deal with the issues of disposal and pollution.

decking and greenhouse film. It is also used 
in clothing and sportswear, wet suits, lab 
coats, face masks, trainers and ski boots  
as well as garbage sacks and long-life 
carrier bags.
The active ingredient in d
2p (am) is registered 
for use as an anti-microbial with the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and 
notified under the EU’s biocidal products 
Regulation (BPR-EU-no. 428/2012).
d

p ANTI-BACTERIAL
d 2p has been tested again over 50 common 
organisms including dangerous bacteria 
such as MRSA, E.coli, Salmonella, Listeria, 
Pseudomonas and Aspergillus Niger. There  
is almost no limit to the number of uses for 
d
2p anti-bacterial. In fact, anything that is 
made of plastic or has a plastic coating could 
have d 2p incorporated at manufacture.
This technology will inhibit the growth of 
bacteria in calculators, sports clothing,  
food processing equipment and a host  
of other applications.
d

p ANTI-BACTERIAL NATURAL
d 2p natural is a unique direct food-contact, 
broad spectrum anti-bacterial with action 
against Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
bacteria. It is based on natural oil extracts 
from plants, dried and powdered.
Symphony has developed suitable 
masterbatch applications for Polyolefins, 
Styrenics, Polyamides, PVC, Polycarbonate 
and Polyesters and it can be used in both 
food and non-food applications to fight 
healthcare and food industry infections.
d

p ODOUR ADSORBER
A relative newcomer to the d 2p range of 
additives, our odour adsorber can be used 
in powder form or incorporated into plastic 
masterbatch. The product can also be used 
in packaging in a sachet.
It inhibits the development of odour in 
plastic products and packaging and is 
suitable for conversion by all plastic 
processing technologies.
The active ingredient used in our odour 
adsorber is a naturally occurring substance 
recognised as a food additive by both EFSA 
and the US FDA, and therefore the product 
can be incorporated into food packaging.
Our Ethylene Adsorber (EA) can prevent 
spoilage of perishable fruit, vegetables  
and flowers.
d

p INSECTICIDE
Insecticidal plastic masterbatches are used 
to control pests in agriculture, horticulture, 
forestry, home and golf course applications. 
It can be formulated with a variety of 
insecticides into numerous products and 
flexible plastic films including banana bags 
and long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets. 
d

p ANTI-FOULING
Anti-fouling is used to control and reduce the 
growth of fouling organisms on vessels and 
other structures based in water. These fouling 
organisms can include barnacles and mussels. 
The growth of these organisms on the hull of 
a vessel minimises its operating efficiency 
and harms the environment through higher 
fuel consumption and emissions.
The active ingredient in Symphony’s 
anti-fouling product has been approved by 
the European Commission for use in coating 
formulations under the Biocidal Products 
Regulation (BPR) “Product 21”.

Maltex in Poland manufacture a range 
of baby products made with Symphony’s 
d 2p anti-bacterial additive, which is 
added to the plastic during manufacture 
to create a surface hostile to bacteria, 
and give extra protection.
These innovative products are produced 
in Poland and include anti-bacterial 
chamber pots, toilet trainer seats, bath 
tubs, bath seats and nappy pails in white, 
pink and blue. What’s more, they are 
already winning fans among parents in

parenting magazine “Mamo to ja” (Mom, 
it’s me) and beating competing products 
from well-known manufacturers.

Strategic Report
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW
The primary business activities of the Group are the development and supply of environmental plastic products to a 
global market, and the development of waste to value projects. The Group also supplies other flexible polythene and 
related products.
A review of the business is given in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 04 and 05 together with the Chief Executive’s 
Review on pages 06 and 07. Future developments are summarised in the Outlook section of the Chief Executive’s 
Review on page 07.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Directors have monitored the progress of the overall Group strategy by reference to certain financial and 
non-financial key performance indicators.
Key performance indicator 2014 2013 Method of calculation
Sales d 2w (£’000) 6,352 7,190 Sales revenue solely of d 2w additives and products.
Gross profit margin (%) 50% 49% The ratio of gross profit to sales.
Number of distributors 77 76 The number of distribution agreements signed.
These are discussed within the Chairman’s Statement and the Trading Results section of the Chief Executive’s Review.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Directors have identified and continually monitor the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group. These may 
change over time as new risks emerge and others cease to be of concern. The principal risks of the Group are 
detailed below.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
The Group sells products in many countries and so generates revenues in US Dollars and Euros. Foreign exchange 
rates fluctuate and, as such, assets created in foreign currencies are liable to constant revaluations into their Sterling 
equivalent. The Group mitigates this risk by purchasing, where practicable, in currencies to match revenues. The 
Group also has exchange facilities with its bank to use as and when appropriate.
COMPETITION RISK
The Group faces competition from suppliers of similar products which could affect revenues and/or gross margins. 
The Group mitigates this risk by employing a large number of distributors globally who can concentrate on any 
competition issues within their market, and also by differentiating the Group’s products by branding and  
marketing activities.
RAW MATERIAL PRICING AND AVAILABILITY
The Group uses commodity and speciality materials in the make-up of its products. There is a risk of price volatility 
and material availability. The Group mitigates this risk by using more than one supplier of its products and continually 
researching separate supply alternatives for the materials used.

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report and the audited 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended  
31 December 2014. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The trading results for the year and the Group’s financial 
position at the end of the year are shown in the attached 
financial statements.
The loss for the year after taxation amounted to 
£305,000 (2013: loss £707,000).
The Directors have not recommended a dividend.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group is involved in the research and development 
of environmental plastic products, and waste to  
value systems.
THE DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS
The Directors who served during the year and their 
interests in the shares of the Company are shown in  
the Remuneration Report.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report, the Directors’ Report, and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs). The parent Company’s own financial statements 
continue to be prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable laws). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit 
or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 > make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether applicable IFRSs or UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that: 
 > so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
 > the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to 
have taken as Directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
GOING CONCERN
Management have prepared a cash flow forecast for the 
ensuing twelve months from the approval of the 
financial statements where a forecast increase in sales 
will lead to increased cash through the use of the invoice 
discounting facility. Operating results for the start of 2015 
have been in line with these forecasts. The Group has 
continued to make significant investment into new 
product development and anticipates sales growth from 
the launch of some of these products in the forthcoming 
year. Having reviewed the cash flow forecasts and the 
available headroom within existing facilities the 
Directors believe that the Group has sufficient cash 
resources to meet debt obligations as they fall due. For 
these reasons, the Directors are of the opinion that it is 
appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing these financial statements.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Group is committed to developing and adhering to 
high standards of corporate governance. As an AIM 
listed company, Symphony Environmental Technologies 
plc is not required to and does not apply the UK 
Corporate Governance Code as issued by the UK’s 
Listing Authority, however, it seeks to follow the principles 
of good governance as far as management believes it is 
practical for a Group of its size, nature and circumstances.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES
The Group’s financial risk management policies are 
detailed in note 3 to the financial statements.
AUDITOR
A resolution to appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as 
auditor for the ensuing year will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.

Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts
1 General information
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc (“the Company”) and subsidiaries (together “the Group”) develop and 
supply environmental plastic additives and products, and develop waste to value systems.
The Company, a public limited company, is the Group’s ultimate parent Company. It is incorporated and domiciled in 
England (Company number 3676824). The address of its registered office is 6 Elstree Gate, Elstree Way, 
Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, WD6 1JD, England. The Company’s shares are listed on the AIM market of the London 
Stock Exchange and as a level 1 ADR in New York.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and also as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
The accounting policies have remained unchanged from the previous year. 
Going concern
Management have prepared a cash flow forecast for the ensuing twelve months from the approval of the financial 
statements where a forecast increase in sales will lead to increased cash through the use of the invoice discounting 
facility. Operating results for the start of 2015 have been in line with these forecasts. The Group has continued to 
make significant investment into new product development and anticipates sales growth from the launch of some of 
these products in the forthcoming year. Having reviewed the cash flow forecasts and the available headroom within 
existing facilities the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet debt obligations as they 
fall due. For these reasons, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Business combinations completed prior to date of transition to IFRS
The Group has not restated business combinations which took place prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
Accordingly, the classification of the combination remains unchanged from that used under UK GAAP. The assets 
and liabilities are recognised at date of transition, and are measured using their United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (GAAP) carrying amount.
Business combinations exemption
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiary undertakings. 
The acquisition of Symphony Environmental Limited (formerly Symphony Plastics Limited) on 9 December 1999 was 
accounted for under merger accounting under UK GAAP and has been treated in this manner under IFRS as the 
business combination exemption has been adopted in these Annual Report and Accounts. The merger accounting 
method requires assets and liabilities to not be adjusted to fair value and the results of the subsidiary to be included 
as if it had always been part of the Group. Therefore, the results of the Group include both the results pre and 
post-acquisition. 
Segment reporting 
The segmental profile for the Group has been adjusted to show a fairer position for the revenue generating side of 
the Plastics business and separately, the investments in Plastics R&D. There are currently three operating segments.
“Plastics Sales” generate and maintain revenues relating to plastic additives, masterbatches and finished products. 
“Plastics R&D” includes all new product development and research expenditure.
The “Recycling Technologies” segment includes all activities involved in the development of tyre and rubber 
recycling systems.
Each of the operating segments is managed separately as each of these service lines requires different technologies 
and other resources as well as marketing approaches. All inter-segments transfers are carried out at arm’s length prices.
The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting under IFRS 8 are the same as those used in its 
financial statements. Corporate assets which are not directly attributable to the business activities of any operating 
segment are not allocated to a segment.
Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods presented. IFRS 8 only requires 
disclosure of segment information.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc

Revenue
Degradable and non-degradable goods, and associated products (plastics segment) 
Revenue is stated at the fair value of the consideration receivable and excludes VAT and trade discounts.
The Group’s revenue is from sale of goods. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following 
conditions have been satisfied:
a) ownership of the significant risks and rewards has been transferred to the buyer. This may be based upon 
shipment or delivery depending upon specific contractual terms, whereby the Group relies on INCOTERMs (a 
series of pre-defined commercial terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce) to assess this;
b) the amount of revenue can be measured effectively whereby the Group sells goods after receipt of  
confirmed orders;
c) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and
d) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Non-recurring items
Expenditure is classified as non-recurring where the cost is considered to be material, one-off, and will not continue 
in future.
Intangible assets
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period in 
which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
 – completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
 – the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
 – the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
 – the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there 
is a market for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, 
the asset will be used in generating such benefits;
 – there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 
intangible asset; and
 – the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, 
produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The nature of 
the Group’s activities in the field of development work renders some internally generated intangible assets unable to 
meet the above criteria at present.
Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset and is shown within administrative expenses and is included 
at the following rate:
Plastic masterbatches and other additives – 15 years straight line. 
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development 
costs have been met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may 
be subject to future technical problems at the time of recognition. Judgements are based on the information 
available at each balance sheet date.
Trademarks
Trademarks represent the cost of registration and are carried at cost less amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful 
economic life of that asset as follows:
Trademarks  – 10 years straight line.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful 
economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery – 20% reducing balance.
Fixtures and fittings – 25% reducing balance.
Fixtures and fittings Elstree Gate – 10% straight line.
Motor vehicles – 20% reducing balance.
Office equipment – 25% straight line.
The residual value and useful economic lives are reconsidered annually.
Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and 
some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for 
impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less 
costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. All assets are subsequently 
reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow 
moving items. Cost is determined on the basis of purchase value on a first-in first-out basis.
Leased assets
In accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17, the economic ownership of a leased asset is 
transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the 
leased asset. The related asset is recognised at the time of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset 
or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments plus incidental payments, if any, to be borne by the 
lessee. A corresponding amount is recognised as a finance leasing liability. The interest element of leasing payments 
represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to profit or loss over the period 
of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to profit or loss 
on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group. The pension costs charged against profits are the contributions payable to the 
scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally 
provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Tax losses 
available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as 
deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable 
income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their 
respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in profit or loss, except 
where they either relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred 
tax is also charged or credited directly to equity, or where they relate to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income the deferred tax change is recognised in other comprehensive income. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW

Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Financial assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial 
assets. Financial assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on 
the purpose for which they were acquired.
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. 
The Group currently has the following financial assets:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are categorised as loans and receivables. Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Trade receivables are measured subsequent 
to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change 
in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in profit or loss.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-
down is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted using the original effective interest rate. 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do 
not qualify for inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets 
are the equity investments in Symphony Bin Hilal LLC, American Plastic Technologies LLC and Oxobioplast Inc.
The equity investments in Symphony Bin Hilal LLC, American Plastic Technologies LLC and Oxobioplast Inc. are 
measured at cost less any impairment charges, as their fair values cannot currently be estimated reliably. Impairment 
charges are recognised in profit or loss. 
An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at each balance sheet date.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the 
financial asset is transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is transferred if the 
contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual 
rights to receive the cash flows of the asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or 
more recipients. A financial asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition if the Group transfers substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
Finance lease receivables
Goods sold under finance leases are recognised as a sale on date of the finance lease agreement or if later, when 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the lessee. The capital element of 
future lessee obligations is included in assets in the statement of financial position.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are credited to profit and loss over the periods of the leases and 
represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals receivable under operating leases are credited to profit and loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables, bank overdraft, bank loans and other loans. 
These are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc

continued
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair values net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges are charged to profit and loss, where applicable, on an accruals basis using the effective interest 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in 
which they arose.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
Equity-settled share-based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 
are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair 
values. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of the instrument granted are 
determined using the Black-Scholes model. This fair value is appraised at the grant date. The fair value is charged to 
profit and loss between the date of issue and the date the share options vest with a corresponding credit taken to equity.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
 – “Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares;
 – “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity 
shares, net of expenses of the share issue; and
 – “Retained earnings” represents non distributed reserves.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations 
to existing standards have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policy for the first 
period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and 
interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other 
new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2015)
The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety with the 
replacement standard to be effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2015. IFRS 9 is the first part of Phase 1 
of this project. The main phases are:
Phase 1: Classification and Measurement.
Phase 2: Impairment methodology.
Phase 3: Hedge accounting.
In addition, a separate project is dealing with derecognition. Management have yet to assess the impact that this 
amendment is likely to have on the financial statements of the Group. However, they do not expect to implement the 
amendments until all chapters of the IAS 39 replacement have been published and they can comprehensively assess 
the impact of all changes.
IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (effective from 1 January 2017)
IFRS 15 presents new requirements for the recognition of revenue, replacing IAS 18 “Revenue”, IAS 11 “Construction 
Contracts”, and several revenue-related interpretations. The new standard establishes a control-based revenue 
recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing IFRSs, 
including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund 
rights, supplier repurchase options, and other common complexities. IFRS 15 is effective for reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Management consider that IFRS 15 will have no material impact upon these 
consolidated financial statements.
The Group’s management have yet to assess the impact of these new standards. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW

Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk to ensure financial liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to 
invest cash assets safely and profitability. Short-term flexibility is achieved through trade finance arrangements and 
overdrafts.
Having reviewed the maturity of financial liabilities and the forecast cash flows for the forthcoming twelve month 
period, the Directors believe that sufficient cash will be generated from trading operations to meet debt obligations 
as they fall due.

Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk where possible, but this is offset by the availability of 
trade finance arrangements which are transaction specific to meet liquidity needs and so have variable interest  
rate terms. 
Sensitivities have been looked at in the range of an absolute rate increase of 5% or a decrease of 1% which enable an 
objective calculation to be made depending on any interest rate changes in the future. Any rate changes would be 
outside the control of the Company.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value of financial assets at the balance sheet date, 
summarised as follows:
2014 
£’000
2013 
£’000
Loans and receivables:
Trade receivables 1,274 1,162
Finance lease receivables 12 25
Cash and cash equivalents 938 130
2,224 1,317
The credit risk associated with the cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from trade receivables. The seven 
largest customer balances at the end of the year make up 68% (2013: 68%) of the above trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history,  
third-party credit references and use of credit insurance. These limits are reviewed regularly.
The maturity of overdue debts is set out in note 16. During the period debts totalling £70,836 (2013: £15,000) were 
written off. The amount written off of £70,836 had been provided for in previous years (2013: £nil).
Capital requirements
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are monitored regularly to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity and its 
exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated. Management consider the capital of the Group comprises the share capital 
and interest bearing loans and borrowings as detailed in note 25. The Company satisfies the Companies Act 2006 
requirement to hold £50,000 issued and authorised share capital. The rule that 25% must be paid up is also satisfied, 
by reference to note 18. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc

4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although these 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately 
differ from those actions.
In preparing these accounts the following areas were considered to involve significant judgements and estimates:
Capitalisation of development costs
Judgements and estimates relating to the capitalisation of development costs are detailed in note 2.
Recoverability of capitalised development cost
Judgements and estimates relating to capitalised development costs are detailed in note 12.
 
Share option judgements
Judgements and estimates relating to share-based payment charges are detailed in note 18.
Going concern
Judgements and estimates relating to going concern are detailed in note 2.
Bad debts
Provisions for bad debts are shown in note 16. Bad debt provisions are made when there is objective evidence of 
impairment. Where there is no provision then it is due to adequate credit insurance being in place, or cash has been 
received since the end of the year, or adequate information exists to support the recoverability of the debt.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
Judgements and estimates relating to a deferred tax asset are detailed in note 9a.

No tax arises on the loss for the year.
The tax assessed for the year is different from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 21% (2013: 23%).  
The change in the rate of standard corporation tax is due to the rates being changed by UK Government legislation. 
The differences in tax assessed against the standard rate of corporation tax are explained as follows:

Deferred income tax asset brought forward 1,142 1,216

Deferred income tax asset carried forward 1,142 1,142
The deferred tax asset relates to tax losses. There are tax losses of approximately £13,400,000 (2013: £13,300,000).
Of these tax losses, a £nil deferred tax adjustment has been recognised in this year’s accounts (2013: negative 
£74,000) resulting in a total asset recognised of £1,142,000 (2013: £1,142,000). There is a total potential tax asset of 
£2,680,000 using a rate of 20%, being the corporation tax rate UK Parliament has currently set.
 
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on sensitising management forecasts to estimate the future 
taxable profits against which the losses will be relieved. Judgements have been made in respect to profitability 
going forward based upon current sales leads and market receptiveness to anticipated product launches. Other key 
estimates relate to foreign exchange rates. 
10 Loss per share and dividends
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on 
the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed conversion of all dilutive 
options and warrants.
Reconciliations of the loss and weighted average numbers of shares used in the calculations are set out below:
Basic and diluted 2014 2013
Loss attributable to equity holders of the Company £(305,000) £(707,000)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 130,255,952 128,010,884
Basic loss per share (0.23) pence (0.55) pence

Total of weighted average shares together with dilutive effect of weighted options 130,255,952 128,010,884

No dividends were paid for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: £nil). The effect of options in 2014 and 2013  
are anti-dilutive.
23,126,500 options were outstanding at the end of the year which may become dilutive in future years. 
The loss before non-recurring items is £305,000 (2013: £137,000) and the basic and diluted loss per share using  
the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 130,255,952 (2013: 128,010,884) is 0.23 pence (2013: loss  
0.55 pence).

The Group relies on the continued development of its product range and in so doing is maintaining satisfactory 
goals in fulfilling its strategy (see Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review). After taking this into account 
together with the considerations of liquidity risk, see note 3, the Directors do not believe that there are any indicators 
of impairment other than detailed below.
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the policy set out in note 2. In capitalising these costs, 
judgements are made relating to ongoing feasibility and commerciality of products and systems being developed. In 
making these judgements, cash flow forecasts are used and these include significant estimates in respect to sales 
forecasts and future foreign exchange rates. 
During 2014 there have been no impairments of intangible assets. In 2013 the Group recognised an impairment charge 
of £494,000 against an individual asset within the Recycling Tech Division comprised of capitalised development 
costs. Following a strategic decision taken by the Directors to look to complete the development of the product 
outside of the Group, it was determined that the asset should be fully impaired.

The Company holds 30% of the ordinary share capital of Symphony Bin Hilal Plastics LLC, a company incorporated 
in the United Arab Emirates. The Directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the Directors do not have 
significant influence because they have no financial or management control. A full impairment had been made 
against this in 2012 due to limited availability of financial information.
The Company holds 30% of Tyre Recycling Technologies Limited, a company registered in England and Wales. The 
company is dormant.
The Company holds 10% of the ordinary share capital of American Plastic Technologies plc, a company incorporated 
in the United States of America. The Directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the Directors do not 
have significant influence because they have no financial or management control. The investment in American 
Plastics Technologies plc is measured at cost less impairment charges as the fair value cannot be estimated readily. 
The cost of this investment was £nil.
The Company holds c.5% of the ordinary share capital of Oxobioplast Inc., a company incorporated in the United

The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. There 
is a provision of £117,000 for the impairment of receivables (2013: £270,000). The maximum credit risk exposure at 
the balance sheet date equates to the carrying value of trade receivables. Further disclosures are set out in note 3.
Included in trade receivables at 31 December 2014 are debtors which are past due but where no provision has been 
made as there has not been a change in the credit worthiness of these debtors and the amounts are considered 
recoverable. As of 31 December 2014 trade receivables of £137,000 (2013: £27,000) were past due and not impaired. 
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:
2014

More than three months but less than six months 121 11
More than six months but not more than one year 16 16

Due to the different markets that the Group operates in, trade terms vary from cash on shipment of goods to 
payment under letter of credit due 150 days from shipment.
Trade receivables are secured against the facilities provided by the Group’s bankers.
Lease agreements in which the other party, as lessee, is to be regarded as the economic owner of the leased assets 
give rise to accounts receivable in the amount of the discounted future lease payments. These receivables amounted 
to £12,000 as of 31 December 2014 (2013: £25,000).
The receivables under finance leases for 2014 are as follows:

The leases, which relate to d 2Detectors, are typically cancellable after the first six months and run for a period of two 
years. The contracts include an option to purchase the leased equipment at any time between the initial six month 
period and the full term of two years. The purchase price lies between 33% and 75% of the gross investment at the 
inception of the lease, resulting from the timing the option to purchase is exercised.

25 Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
 – to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
 – to provide an adequate return to shareholders
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt 
is calculated as total borrowings as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position less cash and cash 
equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position plus  
net debt.
The Group’s goal in capital management is to maintain an optimal gearing ratio, this has changed from 2013 where 
the goal was to maintain a capital-to-overall financing ratio of 1:1 to 1:3. The gearing ratio has been restated for 2013. 
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions 
and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group 
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell 
assets to reduce debt.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were as follows: 
2014 
£’000
2013 
£’000
Total borrowings 1,153 1,342
Cash and cash equivalents (938) (130)
Net debt 215 1,212
Total equity 3,716 2,429
Borrowings 1,153 1,342
Overall financing 4,869 3,771
Gearing ratio 4% 32%
The ratio-decrease during 2014 is due to both the increase in equity, being new shares issued during the year, which 
resulted in the high cash and cash equivalents balance at the year end. The Group will endeavour to optimise the 
ratio depending on the position of the Group and its general requirements. 
26 Capital commitments
The Group had capital commitments totalling £nil at the end of the year (2013: £nil).

Notes to the Company Balance Sheet
27 Principal accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP).
Fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful 
economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery – 20% reducing balance.
Motor vehicles – 20% reducing balance.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset have passed to the Company, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are 
depreciated over their useful lives. The capital elements of future obligations under the leases and hire purchase 
contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the 
leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.
Pension costs
Company pensions are operated within the Group pension scheme. The Group operates a defined contribution 
pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group. The annual 
contributions payable in respect to the Company are charged to the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a 
right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exception: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the 
extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which 
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
 
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating profit.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less amounts written off.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after 
deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of the financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar 
debt instrument, those financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented  
as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on the 
outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then 
this is classified as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct 
to equity. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW

Equity-settled share-based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 
are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair 
values. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values are determined by reference to 
the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes 
the impact of non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is charged to the profit and loss account between the 
date of issue and the date the share options vest with a corresponding credit taken to shareholders’ funds.

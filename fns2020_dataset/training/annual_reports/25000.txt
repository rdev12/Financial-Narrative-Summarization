Having completed our first full year as a 
listed business, we are pleased to report 
that 2016 marked another year of progress 
for your company:
 n Profitability improved despite 
geopolitical events.
 n Major capital investments were made to 
support future growth in the UK roofing 
and brick businesses.
 n Future financing costs reduced due to 
the arrangement of new debt facilities.
 n Continued strong cash generation allowed 
further debt reduction.
 n Risk has significantly reduced with the closure 
of the UK pension scheme.
We therefore look forward to the future with 
optimism from the good foundations laid in 2016.

03 Chairman’s Statement
“I continue to believe 
that the Group is well 
prepared to benefit from 
the continuing demand 
for new housing.”
I am pleased to report another good 
set of results, which once again 
demonstrate the strength of the 
Group’s business model and the 
strategy outlined last year. 
The Group is a family of brands of building 
products with a diversified range of clay 
and concrete products. We are a leading 
manufacturer of clay bricks and concrete 
products with operations in both the UK 
and the US.
The UK Referendum on EU membership 
added some uncertainty to the UK market 
during the year, but we continue to believe 
firmly in the fundamentals which exist 
in that market and have maintained 
our strategy.
In 2016, the UK brick business 
experienced a marginal increase in 
volumes over the full year after lower 
first half volumes, primarily as a result 
of industry‑wide destocking within the 
builders’ merchant and distributor supply 
chain. This muted start to UK brick sales 
helped to emphasise the significant 
progress made in our concrete businesses 
whilst the strong performance of our US 
operations, partially due to the mild 
weather at the beginning of 2016, further 
demonstrated that we are much more 
than a UK brick manufacturer.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 The market and our strategy
Housing market fundamentals in both 
of our key geographies remain positive, 
and I continue to believe that the Group 
is well prepared to benefit from the 
continuing demand for new housing. 
During 2016, the Group has continued 
its strategy of growth through investment 
and product innovation, together with 
expansion of its existing product portfolios, 
which have been at the heart of its 
success over many years. 
The construction of our new brick plant 
in Leicestershire continues at pace and 
is expected to be commissioned in the 
second half of 2017 , whilst our new roof tile 
manufacturing plant at Leighton Buzzard 
became operational in the second half of 
2016 in line with our plans.
Our strategy is discussed in more detail 
on pages 1 1 to 17 .
Our results
Revenue for the year ending 31 December 
2016 was £435 million and the profit after 
taxation for the year was £90 million with 
EPS of 22.3 pence. Our adjusted results 
saw an adjusted EBITDA of £1 12 million.
We have proposed a final dividend of 
5.3 pence per share, which is in line with 
our dividend policy of distributing 40 to 
50% of our adjusted profit after tax over 
a business cycle.
Board, corporate 
governance and our 
employees
I am proud of the great strides we made 
during 2016 in establishing robust 
governance arrangements within the 
Group. In February 2016, we appointed 
Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella to the 
Board. Both joined the Board’s 
Remuneration Committee, Audit 
Committee and Nomination Committee, 
and Lynn became Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. In January 2017 , 
Justin Read also joined our Board as a 
Non‑ Executive Director. I am delighted to 
welcome all three to the Board. Together 
they bring a wealth of experience that will 
be of great benefit to Ibstock as we 
continue to develop our business.
The addition of two new Non‑ Executive 
Directors is just one area in which we 
have progressed along our corporate 
governance journey in 2016. I am pleased 
to present a significantly increased level 
of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code for 2016, as described 
more fully on pages 40 to 46.
Our business is run by an extremely 
experienced management team – Wayne 
Sheppard, Chief Executive Officer and 
Kevin Sims, Chief Financial Officer, have 
a combined experience of over 50 years 
within the Building Products market. 
The performance of the business, and our 
continued success, even during uncertain 
times, is down to the hard work of all of 
our employees across the Group. I wish to 
thank all of our colleagues for their excellent 
work over this period.

Outlook
Looking back, the past year proved to 
be one of considerable change with the 
Referendum on European Union (“EU”) 
membership in the UK and Presidential 
Election in the US. Our businesses 
navigated these uncertainties very 
effectively and I am confident that they 
will continue to do so as the full impacts 
of these major geopolitical events unfold 
over the next few years. 
Forecasts for our key markets both in 
UK and US remain positive and we have 
invested in the UK to improve efficiency 
and meet increased demand. The 
fundamentals supporting demand for our 
products in UK remain unchanged and 
indeed the current government continues 
to demonstrate its commitment to delivering 
increased home building. In the US we 
have sufficient capacity to accommodate 
forecast increases in our key markets. 
Following the debt refinancing and UK 
pension closure projects combined with 
positive market fundamentals and the 
strength and depth of our management 
teams, I remain confident that Ibstock 
will continue to deliver from the strong 
foundations laid in 2016 and I look to 
the future with confidence.

05 The Group continues to hold the market-leading position 
within the UK market for clay bricks, together with leading 
market positions in UK concrete products and in the US 
regions within which the Group operates.
Our clay and concrete products are 
integral components to construction 
activity, particularly housing 
construction and Repairs, 
Maintenance and Improvement 
(“RMI”). Demand for our products 
is directly affected by developments 
in the construction markets in which 
we operate, as well as the general 
level of construction activity. Several 
macroeconomic factors influence 
the levels and growth of construction 
activity, including demographic 
trends, the state of the housing 
market, mortgage availability, 
mortgage interest rates, and changes 
in household income, inflation and 
Government policy.
The Group continues to hold the market-
leading position within the UK market for 
clay bricks, together with leading market 
positions in UK concrete products and in 
the US regions within which the Group 
operates. In the UK, the three largest 
brick manufacturers accounted for 
approximately 90% of brick production in 
2016. Our US operations are a regional 
leader in the clay products markets of the 
North East and Mid West where a number 
of regional and national manufacturers 
also operate. Conversely, many of the 
UK concrete markets which the Group 
operates in are fragmented. 
During 2016, the UK’s Referendum on EU 
membership has clearly impacted these 
macroeconomic factors and, to an extent, 
the uncertainty as a result of the vote 
outcome remains. The US Presidential 
Election in November 2016 has similarly 
impacted the macroeconomic environment 
across the US and globally.
United Kingdom
Total Great Britain construction output 
is estimated at £136.6 billion in 2016 
(a 1.6% increase compared to 2015). 
The Construction Products Association 
estimates Great Britain construction output 
growth of 0.8% in 2017 and 0.8% in 2018 
as activity is expected to increase in the 
construction sector, but remain flat in 
private housing and fall back in certain 
other construction sectors including office, 
retail and factory construction.
United Kingdom housing 
construction, recent trends 
and developments
The UK housing market has been 
structurally undersupplied for a number of 
years, with housing starts below household 
formations. The UK Government 
commissioned the Barker Review in 2003 
which suggested the shortage of housing 
in the UK at that time was approximately 
450,000 houses.
The UK Government’s white paper 
“Fixing our broken housing market” in 
February 2017 reiterates the consensus 
that we need from 225,000, to 275,000 
or more, new homes in England each year 
to keep up with population growth and 
tackle the years of housing under-supply. 
With an estimated 80% of new homes 
using bricks within their construction, 
increases in new housing volumes will 
directly impact the demand for our 
brick products. 
UK Repairs, Maintenance and 
Improvement (“RMI”) market, 
trends and developments
Total private residential RMI output in Great 
Britain in 2016 was worth approximately 
£17 .4 billion and is forecast to remain flat in 
2017 and reduce slightly in 2018 (Source: 
Construction Products Association). 
Historically, the RMI market has been more 
stable than housing starts. RMI remains 
primarily driven by gross domestic product, 
employment, consumer confidence and 
the level of housing transactions (with 
individuals renovating homes prior to a 
sale, or modifying them after purchase). 
Current underbuilding supports the 
RMI market. 
United States
The Company’s primary markets in the 
US are the North East and Mid West.
Housing starts in Glen-Gery’s primary 
markets fell sharply (approximately 68%) 
from a peak in 2005 through to 2009. 
Residential starts then increased with 
support from improvements in the 
economy and growth in employment. 
Housing starts in Glen-Gery’s primary US 
markets are forecast to increase by 4.7% 
in 2017 , whilst the US is expected to see 
residential housing starts increase by 8.7% 
and 3.0% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
Non-residential construction starts in 
Glen-Gery’s primary markets are expected 
to be 1.3% higher in 2016, with growth of 
6.9% and 6.8% forecast for 2017 and 
2018, respectively.

Brexit
The UK Referendum on EU 
membership, which took place on 
23 June 2016, saw British citizens 
vote to leave the EU – the British exit 
(or “Brexit”). The Referendum disturbed 
global markets, including currencies, 
causing the British pound to fall to its 
lowest level in decades.
In the weeks immediately leading up to 
the Referendum, a slight reduction in 
UK clay sales volumes was experienced, 
however, we saw volumes return quickly 
to normal seasonal levels. In the 
immediate aftermath of the vote, 
markets reacted by marking down 
many sectors including housebuilding 
and associated building material 
supply sectors. 
The Group has formulated a Brexit 
Committee to monitor developments 
and has devised contingency plans 
across its UK businesses to manage 
capacity and enable us to balance 
production with sales volumes, 
as necessary.
The next phase of the Brexit process 
is the UK triggering Article 50 of the 
Lisbon Treaty which, based on 
statements by UK Prime Minister 
Theresa May, would see the UK 
leave the EU before the summer of 
2019 depending on exact 
negotiation timelines.
Management continues to recognise 
the uncertainties associated with the 
ongoing Brexit process and has 
introduced a specific principal risk.

2016 performance
Even though the year was marked by 
unpredictable market conditions, the 
Group made good headway in 2016. 
Revenue increased by 5%

 to £435 million 
and adjusted EBITDA increased to 
£1 12 million (2015: £107 million). Despite 
the uncertainty arising from events such 
as the UK’s EU Referendum and the US 
Presidential Election, the Group has 
delivered a result ahead of the prior year. 
We have improved our safety record, we’ve 
made excellent progress with our major 
projects, successfully implemented new 
IT systems in the US and put alternative 
pension arrangements in place in the 
UK, which will reduce the variability of 
the Scheme. 
1 – All movements compare to the 12-month 
trading result for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
A reconciliation to statutory results is included in Note 3 
to the Group consolidated financial statements.
UK segment
Our UK segment experienced unforeseen 
market conditions during 2016. Whilst the 
new housing developer market showed 
further growth in 2016, destocking by 
builders’ merchants held back brick sales 
volumes in the first half. Furthermore, in the 
weeks approaching the EU Referendum, 
we saw a slow down in sales across each of 
our UK businesses. However, within a month 
of the EU Referendum, sales volumes for 
all our UK businesses were comparable to 
the prior year and during the remaining 
summer months, volumes continued to 
track in line with the prior year before 
accelerating as the year drew to a close. 
We announced in March that destocking 
was experienced within our UK brick 
business as merchant demand and supply 
rebalanced at new higher activity levels. 
As brick availability returned to normal 
levels, as industry production recovered 
from the financial crisis, merchant stockists 
were able to service their customers whilst 
keeping lower inventory levels and the

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Chief Executive’s Statement Our five key strengths
 Market leader
Our market-leading businesses will 
enable us to benefit from the expected 
growth in demand in the UK and our 
regional markets within the US.
 Scale
We have 28 clay and 15 concrete plants 
throughout the UK and US manufacturing 
over 500 varieties of bricks coupled with 
ownership of valuable long-term 
clay reserves.
 n 43 manufacturing sites; 33 UK 
sites and 10 US sites.
 n Over 150 million tonnes of 
clay reserves.
 n Realisable production capacity 
of 1.2 billion bricks per annum.
  Long-standing 
customer relationships
Many of our long-standing customer 
relationships have lasted over 40 years. 
Our customer focus is based on quality, 
service and consistency and our 
service-led ethos is one of the key drivers 
in the growth in our market share in 
bricks over the past 10 years.
 Growing capacity
In the UK, demand for building products 
is anticipated to increase due to 
Government support for new house-
building, increasing household formations 
and population growth. We are investing 
in the latest technology to increase 
capacity and to meet the growing 
market demands.
 n Ibstock Brick’s Chesterton plant was 
built in 2013 to consolidate production 
from two previous sites and increased 
site capacity by approximately 67% 
per annum.
 n The new Leicester plant, due to be 
commissioned in the second half of 
2017 , is expected to add capacity of 
100 million bricks per annum. 
  Highly experienced 
management team 
Our management team has extensive 
experience in the building products 
market and our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer have combined 
experience of over 40 years at Ibstock. 
Why invest in Ibstock?
resultant destocking increased brick 
supply to the market. Brick volumes in the 
first half of the year were slightly below the 
prior year, although they recovered in the 
second half to give a full year slightly 
ahead of 2015. 
Within our concrete businesses, which 
serve both the new build and Repair, 
Maintenance and Improvement (“RMI”) 
markets, we saw both volumes and 
margins above those of the prior year. 
Sales growth came from both the Supreme 
and Forticrete businesses with Supreme 
benefiting from healthy demand for its 
products in the domestic landscaping 
RMI sector, whilst Forticrete continued to 
grow its sales principally into the new 
build housing sector.
US segment
The Glen-Gery operations within the US 
delivered another year of progress. The 
year began positively, as the unusually mild 
winter weather experienced in our key 
regions during the first quarter of 2016 
enabled an early start to the building year. 
As the strong first half volume growth 
flattened off as the year progressed, we 
saw a slower autumn period and, as we 
moved into the final months of the year, 
weather patterns returned to their normal 
seasonal trends. The US Presidential 
Election also impacted demand levels 
and we saw lower sales volumes as the 
election date approached. As a result, 
the year finished in line with our prior 
expectations. Our US operations benefited 
from foreign exchange movements, which 
increased revenue by £10.9 million and 
adjusted EBITDA by £1.5 million in 2016 
compared to 2015.
Overall, 2016 was a year of strong 
progress for our US business with a good 
first half and a second half similar to that 
of the prior year. As the US new home 
market continues to recover, the housing 
mix continues to favour single family 
dwellings, as compared to the higher 
volumes of multi-family homes that were 
built during the difficult recession years. 
This switch favours brick demand. 
Additionally, Glen-Gery’s exposure to the 
non-residential construction market has 
served it well – with good activity levels and 
some significant projects completed in the 
retail and educational sectors during the 
year. We also saw the first signs of 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

09 rationalisation within the US brick market, 
with the announcement in August of the 
creation of Meridian Brick – a North 
American Bricks joint venture between two 
of our competitors, Boral and Forterra.
Strategy and investment 
I remain confident that our strategy is 
appropriate and that it provides the right 
basis for the Group to navigate through 
current uncertain market conditions and 
achieve longer-term growth. We continue to 
implement our strategy of investing in our 
core markets to improve productivity and 
quality, and to increase capacity, where 
required. We also continue to investigate 
range-expanding acquisition opportunities. 
I am incredibly excited by the developments 
the Company is currently progressing. In 
particular, during the year, we made good 
progress with the two major capital projects 
announced at the time of our IPO. 
We commissioned our new roof tile line at 
Leighton Buzzard in the fourth quarter and 
introduced the first of our new innovative 
roof tiles to the market. Capacity utilisation 
within the roofing market has reached very 
high levels and our new roof tile plant adds 
c.5% capacity to the UK market. The 
launch of the second tile format from this 
range is scheduled for early 2017 . To date, 
the market reception of the new product 
has been excellent and its use in some 
early housing projects can be seen on 
page 26 as customers begin trialling the 
products with a view to making 
reservations for 2017 project builds. 
In UK brick, our new 100 million per annum 
capacity brick factory in Leicestershire 
continues to progress well and is expected 
to be commissioned in the second half of 
2017 as planned. Significant interest in brick 
supplies from the new factory has already 
been received from both housebuilders 
and merchants. The scale of our new 
factory, which will become the most 
efficient brick factory in UK, together with 
its construction progress since last year, 
can be seen on page 15.
Our KPI of Return on capital employed for 
the year reduced marginally as we invested 
in these major projects in advance of 
returns being delivered. 
Towards the end of 2016, we began a 
project to remodel our Midlands blue brick 
factory at Cannock in Staffordshire with the 
introduction of a new state of the art kiln. 
Delivery of this project will improve both 
energy consumption and quality 
performance, but most importantly will 
increase our capacity in this geography 
by c.30%. Additionally, the results of our 
previous investments in walling and cast 
stone capacity at Forticrete enabled 
volumes to grow during 2016. 
Customer service and 
Information Technology
The investments, noted above, are all 
aimed at improving the service we provide 
to our customers – meeting their needs 
through increased capacity, introducing 
innovative new products and enhancing 
existing product ranges. Additionally, we 
believe that Information Technology is a 
key component to customer service and we 
implemented a new ERP system into our US 
Glen-Gery business during the year. The 
transition to this system went exceedingly 
well and as it develops, we will enhance 
management information and offer even 
further improved customer service. 
Our KPI for customer service (Net Promoter 
Score) declined by 2%pt. Analysis shows 
that customers marked us down due to 
extended delivery times for roof tiles and 
soft mud bricks at certain points in 2016. 
As discussed earlier, we have two major 
capital projects underway to improve our 
performance in these key areas of our 
product portfolio. 
Our people
In order to roll-out our strategy, it is critical 
that we have appropriately skilled people 
and develop them to the best of their 
abilities. We continue to invest in our 
people; providing over 7 ,500 training days; 
often promoting our people into new roles 
with 23% of recruitment from internal 
candidates; and seeing our UK brick 
apprenticeship scheme grow to 40 
apprentices this year as we look to the 
next generation of our workforce and 
the skills they will need. 
We have made excellent progress with 
our safety record in 2016. Whilst the only 
acceptable target is zero accidents, our 
employee Lost Time Accidents (“LTAs”) 
have reduced from 21 incidents in 2015 
to 16 in 2016 – a 24% reduction. However, 
our satisfaction with the good improvement 
is only marred by an increase in contractor 
accidents on our sites during the year.
In the UK, we consulted with employees 
regarding the closure of the Ibstock defined 
benefit pension scheme with members 
principally in Ibstock Brick and Forticrete. 
Our employees’ understanding and 
commitment was evidenced by the 
constructive consultation process 
recognising the Group’s need to move to 
more sustainable pension arrangements. 
Overall summary
We enter 2017 with brick industry statistics 
recording a return to volume growth after a 
slower first half in 2016 for the market, and 
industry stock levels declining. In the UK, 
our developer customers are looking to 
increase their activity in 2017 and we 
expect to see normalised demand from 
our merchant customers now that their 
stock levels have returned to balance. 
In the US, with the Presidential Election 
now behind us, forecasters expect our 
markets to continue to grow in the year 
ahead and we expect to see a continued 
steady improvement in our markets as 
the US economy settles. 
The Group’s key strength lies in our 
committed and experienced employees 
and our ability to deliver strong cash flows. 
We therefore look forward to the future 
with optimism from the good foundations 
laid in 2016.

19 The Group is a leading manufacturer of building products 
with a diversified range of clay and concrete products, 
and operations in the UK and the US. 
How we create value
The Directors believe that the Group’s 
market-leading businesses place it in a 
strong position to benefit from the expected 
demand growth in the UK and in its 
regional markets in the US.
Extraction
Clay and shale used in our brick production 
process is sourced from clay pits that the 
Group operates on land that it owns or 
leases under long-term agreements in the 
vicinity of its brick manufacturing plants in 
the UK and the US.
Procurement
The Group is a major customer for a 
number of key suppliers, which allows 
us to be efficient in our purchasing and 
transportation. Additionally, for the Group’s 
concrete products, the main raw materials 
are bulky in nature and are locally sourced.
Product design
The Group continually seeks to improve 
the quality of its existing products and also 
introduce new products through innovation 
and investment in new technology. Its new 
product development programme works 
closely with customers and external sales 
to identify opportunities for new products.
Manufacturing process
The Group has the largest brick production 
capacity in the UK and has a strategic 
footprint across the UK and in the US markets 
in which it operates. We also have the most 
modern and innovative roof tile, and concrete 
fence post manufacturing facilities.
Technical support
As a manufacturer we stand out by 
employing five architects and a Computer 
Aided Design office to assist specifiers and 
customers in their designs and efficient 
use of our products.
Customer service
Ibstock plc sells its products to a diverse 
group of customers in the construction 
industry. Each business has its own sales 
team that is aligned by customer group 
and region in order to focus on key 
decision-makers and customers. This is 
monitored through extensive and regular 
customer satisfaction surveys.
Distribution
The Group’s 43 principal manufacturing 
plants across the UK and US are 
strategically located close to main 
transportation links to facilitate distribution. 
In the UK, the Group offers an industry-
leading next business day sample service 
which helps specifiers and customers to 
choose the right products for their projects.
Outputs
Shareholders
The Directors recognise the importance 
of rewarding our shareholders for their 
continued investment in the future of the 
Group. We view the risks to our dividend 
as intrinsically linked to the principal risks 
and uncertainties noted on pages 34 to 36, 
primarily those impacting the wider 
macroeconomic environment and the 
cyclical nature of the industry for building 
products. It is our objective to set out a 
clear dividend policy to enable 
stakeholders to assess both the case for 
investment and stewardship in holding the 
Board to account. Our dividend policy is 
set out in the Financial review on page 31.
Employees
The Group employs a large number of 
people across its operations and as 
described in the Resources and 
relationships section on pages 22 to 25, 
the development and progression of our 
employees is seen as key to the Group’s 
long-term success. The Directors believe 
that the employee share ownership 
encouraged by the Share Incentive and 
Save As You Earn programmes, together 
with the improved corporate governance 
they are able to demonstrate this year, are 
two of the ways in which the value flowing 
to the employee shareholders is increased.
Customers
The Group sells its clay and concrete 
products to a diverse group of customers 
in the construction industry in the UK and 
US. Builders’ merchants, housebuilders, 
specialist brick distributors, and contractors 
and installers are the five main customer 
groups for the Group’s clay and concrete 
products in the UK. In the US, clay 
products sold to distributors constituted 
the majority of sales for the year, with the 
remainder sold to housebuilders, 
contractors and developers. These 
customers are not always the same as 
the individuals and organisations that 
are making the buying decisions for the 
Group’s products. In many cases, the 
preference of the end users or their 
specifier dictates the choice of product 
rather than the intermediary that actually 
purchases the product from the Group.
Communities
The Group interacts directly with the 
communities within which we operate. 
Our Resources and relationships section 
on pages 22 to 25, together with the 
Group’s Environmental report, set out a 
number of examples of this interaction as 
the Group aims to be a “good neighbour” 
and contribute to those communities. 
Ibstock is a member of “Business in 
the Community”.

is one of the key drivers in the growth 
in our market share in bricks over 
the past 10 years and many of our 
long-standing customer relationships 
have lasted over 40 years.
Growing capacity We are investing 
in the latest technology to increase 
capacity and to meet the growing 
market demands.

through our people.
Our people, customers, shareholders

who are essential to our business 
model. Additionally, our lenders, 
pension schemes, suppliers, 
government and other regulatory 
bodies have an important relationship 
with the Group.
People
Safe working environment
It is a strategic priority to focus on safety 
in the workplace and Health and Safety 
(“H&S”) is at the core of our operations. 
The Group employs over 2,500 people 
across the UK and US and it is the 
Group’s objective to provide a safe 
working environment for all our employees 
and the contractors at Ibstock sites. 
As a large employer in both the EU and 
the US, the Group must comply with 
the European Framework Directive on 
Safety and the Health at Work and the 
Occupational Health & Safety Act, 
respectively. These guarantee minimum 
safety and health requirements, and under 
such laws and regulations, employers 
typically must establish the conditions and 
the management of work in a manner that 
effectively prevents dangers to all workers.
Interpretation of the legislative requirements 
is further supported in the UK by Approved 
Codes of Practice. These documents are 
used to help define Group policies and 
procedures for all employees. The Group 
has training programmes in place to ensure 
all employees are competent to carry out 
their duties and an auditing protocol is in 
place to ensure policies and procedures 
are effective and adhered to. A dedicated 
team of health and safety professionals 
support the operational employees in all 
aspects of Health and Safety management 
and leadership. 
During the year, the UK H&S team 
underwent external training to enhance 
their existing H&S audit skills, which has 
led to an updated audit protocol being 
developed. This protocol will ensure greater 
focus throughout the year on H&S and 
enable continuous improvement to be 
monitored though its links to our Safety 
Management System. 
The Board continues to carefully monitor 
the Group’s performance against our Lost 
Time Accidents KPI, and this focus has 
played a part in reducing this KPI measure 
over recent years. 
Recognition and development
Our people lie at the heart of the Group’s 
operations and as such we are committed 
to developing an environment where every 
employee can thrive and give their very 
best each and every day. Our continual 
investment in their training and development 
contributes to a highly engaged workforce 
with the skills and experience necessary 
to deliver the Group’s business objectives 
both now and into the future. In 2016, 
over 7 ,500 days of training were provided 
to the Group’s employees and we deliver 
a comprehensive development programme 
covering a range of topics from operational 
skills improvement through to modular and 
structured Leadership Programmes to 
support our succession plans. Over 20% 
of vacancies were filled from internal 
promotions ensuring our people are able to 
fulfil their career aspirations and we retain 
their in-depth-skills and knowledge of our 
customers and operations, which is one of 
the key reasons for our continued success. 
Delivering continuous improvement is the 
core of our operations, constantly looking 
for more efficient ways of doing things and 
embracing technology wherever possible. 
Equality and diversity
We recognise the unique contribution of 
each and every person that we employ 
and aspire to provide a workplace where 
everyone can thrive. All job applicants, 
employees and other workers (such as 
agency staff and consultants) will be 
treated with dignity and respect regardless 
of their age, disability, gender reassignment, 
marital or civil partner status, race, colour, 
nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion 
or belief, sex or sexual orientation.

Resources and relationships As the Ibstock Brick University (“IBU”) 
approaches its 20th year it can look to 
an alumnus of almost 500 employees 
and customers who have undergone 
its extensive five day training into the 
manufacture, uses and sales of brick. 
Originally, it was created to ensure that 
all new Ibstock personnel met the high 
standards of product knowledge and 
expertise that has always been at the 
heart of the Ibstock approach to 
customers and specifiers. 
The training is unique in the industry, 
its scope covers a detailed understanding 
of the different types of clay brick 
manufacturing techniques, the technical 
properties of bricks, the use of special 
shaped bricks along with a thorough 
understanding of the build process as 
well as technical drawings, site issues 
and much more!
Such has been the popularity and high 
regard of the training offered by Ibstock 
that many of its customers have sent their 
key personnel on the course, so much 
so that training places are now booked 
12 months ahead!
Running in parallel to the IBU is the 
Ibstock Customer Service University 
(“ICSU”). Over the past 16 years this 
has provided in-depth and detailed 
training in the use and application of 
Ibstock products especially tailored to 
the needs of the customer service team. 
Split into three levels, these intensive 
three-day courses have made a major 
contribution to Ibstock’s industry-wide 
reputation for customer service and care.
The Ibstock Brick University
We believe that by providing a harmonious 
working environment all employees 
should be able to maximise their potential 
and contribute to our success.
Where an employee becomes disabled, 
subsequent to joining the Group, all efforts 
are made to enable that employee to 
continue in their current job. However if, 
due to the specific circumstances, it is 
not possible for an employee to continue 
in their current role, every effort will be 
made to provide retraining for alternative 
employment within the Group or elsewhere.
We are committed to identifying and 
eliminating discriminatory practices, 
procedures and attitudes and we expect 
all employees, officers, consultants, 
contractors, casual workers and agency 
workers to support our commitment and 
assist in all possible ways to prevent 
discrimination.

23 we continue to deliver for our customers. 
The revised survey will also be implemented 
across all of the Group companies to 
ensure we are measuring engagement 
consistently across the Group and also 
facilitate comparison across the entities 
within the Ibstock family. 
A variety of methods are used to engage 
with employees, including factory and team 
meetings; departmental briefings; and 
in-house publications. The Group will use 
one or more of these channels to brief 
employees on the Group’s performance 
and the financial and economic factors 
affecting the Group’s performance. 
In particular, the Group operates a 
Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) share scheme, 
which is open to eligible employees, where 
employees are encouraged to save a fixed 
monthly sum for a period of three years. 
There has been a great level of participation 
from Ibstock employees, with 46% of 
eligible staff choosing to enrol in the 
2015/16 SAYE scheme.
Innovation
The Group continually seeks to improve 
the quality of its existing products and 
processes, as well as to introduce new 
products through innovation and 
investments in new technology. The 
Group’s innovation efforts are primarily 
pursued at each of the Group’s four 
primary operating businesses.
In 2016, within Ibstock Brick we added 
40 new bricks to our range resulting in close 
to £10 million sales. The UK brick range is 
already the most extensive in the market and 
our innovative focus to expand the colour, 
size and texture options available, as well as 
entering new markets, continues to ensure 
that our range remains market leading. 
Further examples of innovative products 
and concepts developed during 2016, 
include: the Supreme “Scorpion clip” 
anti-theft device within our fencing range; 
the “Perfect Outlet” marketing concept 
where working with our builders’ merchant 
customers we offer an approach which 
helps us sell more together; and our market 
changing new roof tile within Forticrete 
(showcased on pages 16 and 17). 
Furthermore, at Group level, innovation is 
pursued through collaborative projects 
among the businesses.
High quality combined with efficient and 
innovative manufacturing has always been 
central to the popularity and continued 
growth of the Group’s products. In 2012, 
it was recognised that to develop a future 
focused workforce ready to meet the ever 
increasing technical expertise and skills 
needed to manufacture the Group’s 
products, then the apprenticeship scheme 
would need to be redeveloped to create 
a pool of engineering and technical 
specialists. And who in future would 
help drive forward innovation and 
manufacturing excellence. 
In a mixture of both classroom and 
practical learning, graduates of the 
apprenticeship scheme achieve 
externally recognised academic and 
vocational qualifications. 
Now in its fourth year, the Apprentice 
of the Year scheme is an opportunity 
to celebrate exceptional performance. 
This year’s award went to Jack Travers, 
a technical apprentice at Ibstock Bricks’ 
Throckley factory.
Apprentice of the Year 2016
Apprenticeships
At some point in time all employees will 
retire and over the last 20 years the Group 
has run a highly successful apprentice 
programme. Since 2012 we have 
enhanced this programme through central 
co-ordination and standardisation of the 
programme to ensure all apprentices are 
trained to a consistent standard, including 
specific sign off within the organisation in 
addition to that of the training provider. This 
focus ensures that we mitigate the risk of 
an ageing workforce and harness the skills 
and experience of these people so that when 
they retire their replacement is fully trained 
and competent to take over their role.
Employee engagement 
Customer satisfaction begins and ends 
with the relationship they have with our 
employees and delighting our customers 
can only be delivered through highly 
competent, engaged and diligent people. 
Key to our success is retaining employees 
who build long-term relationships with our 
customers and we are proud that our 
employee retention levels are high. In 2016, 
our retention rate was 92% and, when 
combined with our service profile, 
demonstrates a sustainable organisation 
where people feel valued and believe we 
are a good employer. 
Ibstock Brick, the largest operating 
company within the Group, has run 
employee opinion surveys for the last 
18 years. Consistently our response rates

Responsible business
As the laws governing business dealings 
become ever more complex we need to 
ensure the judgements and decisions we 
make are taken with both the knowledge 
and application of the highest ethical 
principles. During 2015, we updated and 
re-issued our Code of Business Conduct 
and Anti-Bribery and Corruption policies 
to continue to ensure that we operate in 
an open, fair and honest manner in all of 
our business dealings. We have also 
implemented our Trade Associations Policy 
to help support employees in their dealings 
with fellow employees, customers, 
suppliers, regulators and colleagues in 
competing businesses. We believe that 
these sound, ethical principles will help us 
to act at all times with honesty and 
integrity, constantly striving to operate in 
the best interests of our business. This will 
help ensure that Ibstock plc continues to 
maintain and enhance its excellent 
reputation as a Group that everyone can 
trust and wants to do business with.
The Group is aware of its obligations under 
the Human Rights Act and seeks to act 
accordingly in all aspects of its operations. 
Additionally, during the year, the Group has 
prepared its Modern Slavery policy for 
communication to its employees and 
suppliers. This sets out the Group’s zero 
tolerance approach to this international 
crime. In our aim to be transparent about 
the steps and preventative measures 
implemented to tackle modern slavery, our 
statement regarding Modern Slavery will be 
published in 2017 on the Group’s website.
Also in 2017 , our tax strategy will be 
disclosed in accordance with new 
Government requirements and published 
on the Group’s website. Working with our 
advisers and building upon the internal 
taxation strategy and governance policy 
already in place, management is developing 
this document to provide details of the 
Group’s approach to the management of 
tax risk and its attitude to tax planning.
Environment and 
engagement 
The Group, like any successful business, 
must be conscious of the impacts its 
operations have on the environment and 
the communities in which it operates. The 
Group recognises its responsibilities as a 
manufacturer to reduce the environmental 
impact of its activities. Ibstock is committed 
to introducing environmental management 
systems and all of our UK businesses are 
now accredited with ISO 14001 – the 
International Environmental Management 
standard. In addition to this, we continue to 
invest in energy efficiency, CO
2 reduction, 
the generation of electricity from landfill gas 
and the recycling of raw materials, such as 
process water, to minimise waste and cost.

and EUETS verified emissions have been used. 
Emission sources falling outside the Group’s 
operational control and other Scope 3 emissions 
have not been collated and reported.
The Group has used CO2 per tonne of production as 
its intensity ratio as this is the most appropriate and 
relevant factor associated with our activities and 
should provide an appropriate basis on which to 
compare trends over time.

reported in the 2015 Annual Report & Accounts 
(0.21) following recalculation following external

In addition to the Greenhouse Gas 
Emission figures, set out in the table above, 
the Group also utilises a number of other 
key measures in assessing the 
effectiveness of its environmental policies. 
These are set out within our Environmental 
report, which we issued as a full Group for 
the first time in May 2016.

Water is essential in our manufacturing 
processes and we are committed to 
reducing our dependence on our use of 
Mains water, which has a far higher carbon 
footprint that non-Mains water. We carefully 
monitor the usage of water by source and 
report our performance in this area within 
our Environmental report. 
Landfill is a finite resource and becoming 
increasingly scarce. As a Group, we wish 
to move towards “Zero waste to landfill” 
and we follow an established hierarchy 
for waste management, monitoring the 
amount of waste to landfill per tonne of 
production as we aim to achieve this. 
The Group is proud of its long history of 
being part of the local communities in which 
it operates. Each of the companies within 
the Ibstock family provides financial support, 
and is actively engaged in, these 
communities. This involvement ranges 
from financial support for community 
projects to stakeholder engagement 
relating to quarry extensions. Our 
Environmental report sets out several case 
studies from across the Group illustrating 
how we have engaged with local 
communities. Ibstock plc is a member 
of “Business in the Community”.

The UK businesses represented 79% of 
the Group’s revenue in 2016 and performed 
well, with revenue increasing by 2%.
In the year ending 31 December 2016, 
the UK segment earned revenue of £344 
million, which was 2% higher than in the 
prior 12-month period. 
UK clay
The clay element of our UK segment saw 
static revenue year-on-year of £254 million, 
although this result obscures the strong 
performance of the Ibstock business in the 
second half of the year.
The first half performance was subdued 
as merchants and distributors destocked 
to align the amount of inventory held to 
sustainable long-term levels. This 
destocking phenomenon continued into 
2016 for longer than was originally 
anticipated, but is now believed to have 
ended. Destocking more than offset the 
strong first half activity levels within the new 
build housing sector, which saw volumes 
increase year on year as growth in 
housebuilding continued in 2016, 
supporting our volumes.
Despite these fluctuations in demand, 
the UK industry saw production and sales 
levels broadly balanced with production 
volumes reducing over the full year, again 
demonstrating the rational nature of the 
industry as a whole. 
UK concrete
The Forticrete and Supreme concrete 
products businesses had strong 
performances in 2016. Revenue within our 
concrete businesses increased 9% from 
£83 million to £91 million.
We saw a healthy level of demand for our 
products in the domestic landscaping RMI 
sector, as well as increased concrete 
product sales into the new build housing 
sector. The key driver for revenue growth 
in our Supreme business was fencing 
volume and price increases.
We also experienced continued sales of 
our roofing products against a backdrop 
of raising demand for concrete roof tiles 
across the UK market. This market is 
operating at close to capacity in some 
product areas. The new tile line at Leighton 
Buzzard will add new capacity to the 
market in 2017 with the introduction of 
new tile profiles which represent the next 
generation of tile design. 
Adjusted EBITDA
The adjusted EBITDA increased 4% year 
on year for the UK segment at £103 million. 
We benefited from favourable energy costs 
compared to the prior year, which offset 
some of the profitability reduction resulting 
from the changing sales mix.

Business review Other key achievements
Within our Forticrete business, 
commissioning of the new tile line took 
place in the second half of the year. This 
will establish the company as a full range 
supplier to the new build housing sector 
and add c.5% capacity to the UK roof 
tile market. 
At Ibstock in Leicestershire the 
construction of our new soft mud brick 
manufacturing plant continues apace. This 
is a major capital project which will add 
c. 100 million to our current brick capacity. 
The factory has been designed to produce 
a wide range of soft mud bricks which are 
increasingly popular with housebuilders 
and which represent the bulk of the bricks 
currently imported into the UK from 
continental Europe.
We have also invested at our Lodge Lane 
facilities in the West Midlands through the 
replacement of the kiln at that site, which 
represents a major capital project, and we 
continue to invest in the efficiency of our 
concrete plants across the UK.

The US business represented 21% of the 
Group’s revenue in 2016 and saw continued 
growth during the year with revenue 
increasing by 4% to $122 million.
Unusually mild winter weather in the US 
gave Glen-Gery a strong start to the year, 
which was maintained, albeit at a lower 
growth rate in the second half. The revenue 
increase of 4% was driven by this first half 
performance as the growth flattened off in 
the second half. 
Despite growth forecasts for 2016, our 
markets are broadly flat with Glen-Gery’s 
performance being driven by price 
increases and sector mix. 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA in the US has increased 
to $17 million (a 40% improvement) in the 
year to 31 December 2016 reflecting higher 
average prices which include the benefit of 
a more favourable product mix. 
Profitability improvement also reflects a 
renewed focus on generating brand 
preference on unique and proprietary 
product offerings. These efforts were 
positively impacted by a new Glen-Gery 
brand positioning, highlighting the Ibstock 
Group affiliation that was introduced in a 
national advertising campaign in leading 
architecture and design publications. 
Other key achievements
The development of advertisements with 
supporting project case studies enabled 
an increased preference within commercial 
design communities. In 2016, these efforts 
were evidenced by Glen-Gery winning 
eight BIA architectural awards and one 
international BDA award.
With continued support from our 
independent distributor and Group owned 
masonry supply yards, Glen-Gery secured 
new, high-profile national accounts in the 
retail, restaurant and hospitality sectors 
that should positively impact 2017 
performance.
We also successfully implemented a new 
ERP system into our US segment’s 
operations during the first half of the year.

Financial review United Kingdom
Revenue of clay and concrete products in 
the UK, which represents 79% of Group 
revenue, increased by 2.3% in 2016. The 
growth in revenue in 2016 was largely 
driven by our concrete businesses, as 
discussed below. 
UK clay product revenue remained level 
in 2016 at £253.6 million (2015: £253.3 
million) – an increase of 0. 1%, following a 
strong improvement in sales volumes in the 
second half of the year after somewhat 
suppressed sales activity at the start of 
2016 resulting from merchant destocking 
and uncertainties in the lead up to the EU 
Referendum. 
Concrete revenue of £90.6 million in 2016 
(12 months ended 31 December 2015: 
£83.0 million) showed an increase of 9.2%. 
The positive start to the year across our 
concrete businesses, reported within our 
interim results, continued during the 
remainder of 2016. In the UK, adjusted 
EBITDA increased by 4.0% £103.0 million 
in 2016 from £99.0 million in the year 
ending 31 December 2015. The sales mix 
in clay accounted for this with strong 
growth in the New Housing sector partially 
offset by reduced demand from our RMI 
customers. 
United States
Revenue in the US increased by 18.3% 
to £90.5 million in the year ended 
31 December 2016 compared to £76.5 
million in 2015. Exchange rate movements 
assisted this increase, with the growth 
representing 4. 1% in constant currency 
reflecting sales price increases in our key 
sales channels during 2016. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 59.6% to 
£12.8 million (2015: £8.0 million) as the 
strong start was tempered in the second 
half of 2016. As the year drew to a close, 
we saw some projects deferred to 2017 
as our customers sought to assess the 
impact of the new US administration. 
The increase represents 40% in constant 
currency terms with £1.5 million of the 
increase arising as a result of foreign 
exchange differences.
Cash flow and net debt
Cash generated from operations during the 
year ended 31 December 2016, excluding 
the impact of the exceptional operating 
items, is shown in the Table 1, below.
A net working capital balance at 
31 December 2016 of £46. 1 million (defined 
as inventory, debtors, creditors and 
provisions) compared with £48.0 million at 
31 December 2015, with an improvement 
in trade working capital balances due to 
improved constant currency inventory turn. 
Our net interest charge reduced in 2016 
to £3. 1 million, primarily due the non-
recurrence of the one-off costs resulting 
from the renegotiation of our debt 
arrangements. Our interest charges 
included a net non-cash credit element of 
£1.4 million related to the discounting of 
liabilities. The interest cost relating to our 
debt facilities entered into last year, are in 
line with management’s expectations. 
Net debt (term loan less cash) of 
£132.8 million at the year-end, compared 
to £144.7 million at 31 December 2015, 
was also in line with management 
expectations. During 2016, £15.0 million 
was repaid against the senior facility of 
£200 million taken on at the time of the IPO 
in October 2015. Interest on this five-year 
term loan is payable at LIBOR plus a 
margin of between 125bps and 250bps 
– the margin dependent on the Group’s 
leverage ratio. This averaged 175bps plus 
LIBOR in 2016. The Group also has a 
committed revolving credit facility (“RCF”) 
of £40 million.

29 The Group is subject to two financial 
covenants. At 31 December 2016, there 
was significant headroom on both 
requirements. See Table 2, right.
In March 2017 , the Group successfully 
refinanced its debt arrangements, to agree 
a £250 million RCF with six major banks at 
improved interest terms. The newly agreed 
debt arrangements contain covenant 
requirements in line with those of the 
old debt.
Exchange rates
The Group is exposed to movements in 
exchange rates when translating the results 
of the US operations from US Dollars to UK 
Sterling. Sterling depreciated against the 
Dollar during 2016. As noted above, the 
impact of this was a £1.5 million benefit to 
adjusted EBITDA in 2016.
Corporate overheads
As the Group makes a full transition to 
a listed business, we are experiencing 
greater stability in the central overhead 
costs incurred. Incremental “plc costs” 
of £3.4 million were incurred in 2016, 
increasing the total from £0.7 million to 
£4. 1 million, including share-based 
payment expenses of £1.9 million. The 
increase in 2016 primarily reflects a full 
12-months of costs in 2016, compared to 
a little over two months in the prior year 
following our listing in late October 2015. 
We anticipate a similar level of cost in 2017 .
The following commentary relates to our 
statutory performance for the period.
Exceptional items
In line with our accounting policy for 
exceptional items, we have excluded 
certain items from our adjusted results. 
The non-cash pension curtailment gain 
arising on the closure of the Group’s UK 
defined benefit pension scheme, 
discussed below, along with associated 
costs, has been classified as exceptional 
in the current year.
In 2015, the impacts of acquiring the 
operating entities in February 2015, which 
resulted in negative goodwill of £1 15.7 
million (restated), together with acquisition 
related expenses (£10.4 million), were 
classified as exceptional. Additionally, IPO 
costs totalling £13.7 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2015 were similarly 
classified as exceptional. 
As management has a newly defined 
programme of surplus property disposals, 
we have taken the decision to include the 
gain upon disposal in our adjusted 
measures in the current year since we 
expect similar items to recur regularly in 
future years. These represent a gain of 
£0.6 million in 2016. 
The loss on disposal and asset 
impairments of £1.4 million in the prior 
period was recorded as an exceptional 
item. Exceptional items are analysed in 
Note 5 to the Group consolidated 
financial statements.
Finance costs
Finance costs of £4.4 million were 
incurred in the year ending 31 December 
2016, significantly below the level of the 
comparative period. Finance costs for 
the period ended 31 December 2015 of 
£69.4 million are as a result of the 
acquisition of the operating entities from 
CRH in February 2015, along with the 
subsequent refinancing at the time of 
the IPO. 
Taxation
The Group’s taxation charge was £20.5 
million in the year ending 31 December 
2016, resulting in an effective tax rate of 
18.5%. This was lower than the standard 
rate of UK taxation of 20.0% due to the 
reducing deferred taxation rate applied.
In 2015, the Group recognised a tax credit 
of £7 .7 million (restated) on Group pre-tax 
profits of £86.3 million (restated). Negative 
goodwill (restated), other exceptional items 
and the impact of future tax rate changes 
on the deferred tax provision in 2015 all 
had a significant impact on the effective 
tax rate.
Earnings per share
The statutory basic EPS was 22.3 pence 
in 2016. The movement in statutory basic 
EPS in 2015 is distorted by the significant 
exceptional non-trading items occurring 
during 2015, as described in table 3 above.
Our adjusted EPS metric removes the 
impact of exceptional non-trading items, 
as described above. Additionally, the fair 
value uplifts resulting from our acquisition 
accounting have been removed from the 
adjusted EPS calculation along with 
non-cash interest impacts. The changes 
to our measure for 2016 are described in 
Note 1 1 to the Group consolidated financial 
statements. The adjusted EPS figures have 
been included to provide a clearer guide as 
to the underlying earnings performance of 
the Group.

Financial review continued Dividend
A final dividend of 5.3 pence per share 
(2015: 4.4 pence) is being recommended 
for payment on 9 June 2017 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
12 May 2017 . 
This is in addition to our interim dividend 
paid in September 2016 of 2.4 pence per 
share and is line with our dividend policy, 
which is based on a pay-out ratio of 
40-50% of adjusted profit after taxation 
over a business cycle. 
Pensions
During 2016, the Group operated a defined 
benefit scheme in the UK, which closed 
to new members in 201 1, together with a 
number of defined contribution schemes. 
At 31 December 2016, the defined benefit 
scheme was in an actuarial accounting 
deficit position of £28.7 million following 
minimum funding requirement liability 
recognition of £14.2 million (2015: 
£8.0 million restricted to £0.3 million) 
against pension liabilities at the year-end 
date of £698 million (2015: £551 million). 
The increase in liabilities principally 
resulted from the movement in corporate 
bond yields during the year offset by the 
curtailment gain, whilst asset levels 
increased to £684 million (2015: £559 
million) due to positive asset returns. 
In August 2016, the Group announced its 
intention to conduct a consultation with 
the UK defined benefit scheme members, 
regarding a proposal to close the scheme 
to future accrual for all active members. 
The scheme’s active members all 
consented to this change in December 
2016 and, from 1 February 2017 , have 
joined the UK defined contribution scheme. 
This decision has resulted in costs 
associated with the closure of £1.6 million, 
which are classified as exceptional in our 
2016 results. Upon closure, a non-cash 
curtailment gain of £30.3 million has also 
been recognised and treated as 
exceptional. 
Within our US segment, certain 
employees are members of two multi-
employer post-employment schemes. 
At 31 December 2016, a liability of 
£9.4 million (2015: £8.0 million) has been 
recognised in relation to these schemes, 
with a large element of the increase 
resulting from the movement in exchange 
rates in the year.
Further details are provided in Note 21 to 
the Group consolidated financial 
statements. 
Prior period adjustment
During 2016 management identified a 
misstatement related to information 
presented within the 2015 Annual Report & 
Accounts. The restatement resulted in the 
recognition of an additional deferred 
taxation liability at the date of acquisition 
and a corresponding reduction in negative 
goodwill. As a result, the comparative 
amounts for the prior period have been 
restated within the financial statements. 
Further detail is set out in Note 1 to the 
Group consolidated financial statements.
Subsequent events
Along with the proposed dividend, the 
Group refinanced its debt arrangements in 
March 2017 (as described in Note 34 to the 
Group consolidated financial statements) to 
a £250 million RCF replacing the facilities in 
place at 31 December 2016. There have 
been no further events subsequent to 
31 December 2016, which management 
believe require adjustment or disclosure.
Going concern and longer-
term viability
The Group continues to meet its day to 
day working capital and other funding 
requirements through a combination of 
long-term funding and cash deposits. As 
noted, above, the Group’s banking facilities 
are a five-year £250 million RCF replacing 
the five-year £200 million loan and a 
£40 million committed RCF (undrawn at 
31 December 2016). 
Additionally, as noted in our Viability 
Statement on page 37 , the Directors have 
performed a comprehensive assessment 
of the Group’s viability as a business over 
a longer period and concluded that the 
Group reasonably expects to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over that three-year timeframe. 
Risks and uncertainties 
The Board continually assesses and 
monitors the key risks impacting our 
business. Whilst the list is not intended to 
be exhaustive, and some risks are outside 
of the Group’s control, the principal risks 
and uncertainties that could have a material 
impact on the Group’s performance are set 
out in detail in our Risk management report 
on pages 34 to 36.

31 Risk arises from the operations of, 
and strategic decisions taken by, 
every business and our approach to 
risk management is not to eliminate 
risk entirely, but rather provide the 
structural means to identify, prioritise 
and manage the risks involved in our 
activities. The Board of Directors is 
ultimately responsible for the Group’s 
risk management processes and 
internal control systems.
The Board has considered the nature and 
extent of risks it is willing to take in pursuit 
of the Group’s strategic objectives. It has 
assessed the Group’s risk appetite, which 
is set to balance opportunities for business 
development and growth in areas of 
potentially higher risk, whilst maintaining 
our reputation and high levels of customer 
satisfaction.
In considering the Group’s appetite for risk, 
this is set depending upon the particular 
risk associated to our Group strategy:
 n Safety – there is a zero tolerance for 
health and safety related risks or 
non-compliance with related legislation 
and statutory requirements;
 n Invest – the criteria for investment 
allocates the Group’s resources in a 
manner consistent with the Group’s 
strategy and planned internal rates of 
return; and
 n Innovate – whilst delivering activity 
aimed at introducing innovative products, 
the Group accepts short-term margin 
dilution, but aims for market-leading 
operating margins and returns on capital. 
The Group’s risk management process 
includes both top-down and bottom-up 
elements to the identification, evaluation 
and management of risks. 
As noted in our 2015 Annual Report & 
Accounts, the Audit Committee had 
commissioned a third party review of the 
Group’s internal control processes. This 
independent “health-check” of the Group’s 
risk management was completed during 
the first half of 2016 and concluded that the 
Group’s internal control framework was fit 
for purpose. The exercise helped establish 
a base line of internal controls and 
subsequently RSM LLP were appointed 
as the Group’s outsourced Internal Audit 
provider to deliver a programme of internal 
audits to continue to monitor the processes 
and controls in operation. 
The outsourced provider designed an 
independent programme of audits, which 
was approved by the Audit Committee, 
and commenced these audits in the 
second half of the year, supplementing the 
Group’s own operational audit activities. 
Risk matrices are maintained and reviewed 
by each subsidiary entity within the Group. 
These matrices are the result of input and 
challenge undertaken by the senior 
managers within the entity and the Group’s 
Executive Directors, and are refreshed at 
least once per annum. At a Group level, 
the Board reviews these matrices and the 
analysis of potential exposures which exist 
within them. Risks are continually evaluated 
using consistent measurement criteria. 
During the year, the Audit Committee 
approved a Group Risk Committee 
comprising senior managers from across 
the Group. The Committee participated 
in a risk workshop facilitated by the 
Group’s outsourced Internal Auditor, and 
considered the risk matrices prepared; 
ranked the identified risks at a Group level; 
and determined the extent of Group-wide 
mitigating actions currently being 
undertaken. 
Following the Risk Committee’s meeting, 
a Group risk assessment was formulated 
and validated by the Executive Directors 
prior to approval by the Board. This formed 
a key component of the Directors’ robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group – including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. These 
are set out in the table on pages 34 to 36.
The Audit Committee supports the Board 
in monitoring the risk exposures and is 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of our risk management and internal 
control systems. During 2016, no 
significant failings or weaknesses in the 
Group’s internal controls were found.
The Audit Committee is assisted in 
evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of our risk strategies and 
the internal controls implemented by 
management by the Group’s outsourced 
Internal Audit function. 
The structure of our Group risk management 
process is illustrated opposite.
The Group’s risk management process includes both 
top-down and bottom-up elements to the identification, 
evaluation and management of risks.

Risk management Risk management 
framework
To effectively manage risk, operational 
level controls are embedded across 
the Group and form a key part of day 
to day processes. 
During 2016, a key component of the 
Directors’ assessment of the risk was 
management’s review of the risk matrices 
prepared by each subsidiary entity, which 
were monitored in conjunction with the 
Group’s outsourced Internal Audit function.
The Board maintained its ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s control 
monitoring and provided direction to 
management in its assessment of 
Group-wide risk. 
Managing risk
The Group uses a heatmap to provide a 
visual, holistic view of the risk environment 
and assist in the management of risks. 
The heatmap gives the Directors’ 
assessment of the gross risk together 
with the residual risk following mitigation 
and reduction of the risk through the 
internal control actions established by 
the Group.

Description Mitigation
1 – Economic conditions   
The Group’s business could be materially impacted by changes in the 
macroeconomic environment in the UK and the US.
Specifically, demand for the Group’s products is strongly correlated with 
residential construction and renovation activities and non-residential 
construction, together with the supply chain’s attitude to stock levels, 
which are cyclical.
The Group analyses construction statistics for the past five years and, 
using independent forecasts of construction statistics, forecasts future 
demand with the aim of anticipating market movements. 
The Group has historically flexed capacity and its cost base where possible 
during economic downturns to allow more of the Group’s manufacturing 
plants to remain open and viable, maintaining skills, development and 
training. The Group believes that this maintained employee morale and 
high levels of customer service through the last economic downturn. It also 
allows the Group to respond more rapidly to increases in demand and 
keep customers satisfied.
The Group’s RMI and specification product ranges diversify end-use 
exposure and provide greater resilience in light of changing market 
demand in any of its end-use markets.
2 – Government action and policy  
The Group has an exposure to both UK or US political developments. 
Material reductions in Government spending, or changes in Government 
policy, could have a material effect on demand for the Group’s products – 
reducing sales and affecting the Group’s financial results.
The Group analyses construction statistics for the past five years and, 
using independent forecasts of construction statistics, forecasts demand 
for the next five years with the aim of anticipating market movements. 
The change in climate post 2015’s UK General Election and Autumn 
Budget are favourable to housing, as well as recent changes to developing 
brownfield land and the 200,000 affordable homes the Government is 
targeting to be built by 2020. These measures, in addition to the National 
Planning Policy Framework (“NPPF”) and Help to Buy scheme, show the 
Government’s current commitment to house building. The UK 
Government’s white paper “Fixing our broken housing market” of February 
2017 is also supportive of housing. However, the Group recognises the risk 
which can result from political changes or economic uncertainty.
RMI and new housing demands are, to a certain extent, counter-cyclical 
to each other, providing some balance to the portfolio of offerings for 
the Group.
3 –  Government regulation and standards relating to the 
manufacture and use of building products
  
The Group’s production, manufacturing and distribution activities are 
subject to health and safety risks.
The Group is subject to environmental, health and safety laws and 
regulations and these may change. These laws and regulations could 
cause the Group to make modifications to how it manufactures and prices 
its products. They could also require that the Group make significant 
capital investments or otherwise increase its costs or could result in 
liabilities.
Failure of the Group to comply with the relevant regulations could result in 
the Group being liable to fines or a suspension of operations, which would 
impact the Group’s financial results.
The health and wellbeing of our employees is fundamental to our 
business. We have stringent Health and Safety policies and monitor 
compliance regularly. 
We have also invested considerable resources in employee training across 
our manufacturing processes. We have invested heavily in safe systems 
and facilities to protect our employees.
The Group actively monitors for any legislative changes which it may need 
to comply with.

Risk management continued Description Mitigation
4 – Customer relationships and reputation  
The Group receives a significant portion of its revenue from key customers 
and the loss of any such customer could result in a significant loss of 
revenue and cash flow. Further, the Group does not have long-term 
contracts with its customers and the Group’s revenue could be reduced 
if its customers switch some or all of their business with the Group to 
other suppliers.
The Group has a service-led ethos with many top customer relationships 
lasting over 40 years. The Group’s customer focus is supported by a 
commitment to quality, service and consistency.
The Group’s sales and production teams are highly integrated to ensure 
that production aligns with customers’ needs. Sales teams receive in-depth 
technical training and are assisted by a design support service team as well 
as targeted marketing materials to assist with specification and selection. 
All four of the Group’s primary businesses have their own sales teams 
aligned by customer group and region in order to focus on key decision-
makers and customers. Key account management is supervised at a senior 
level where long-term relationships benefit from the continuity of senior 
management who have the ability to liaise across the Group’s businesses.
The Group has a broad spread of customers and no single customer 
comprises more than 10% of the total Group revenue.
5 – Business disruption  
A material disruption at one of the Group’s manufacturing facilities or 
quarries, or at one of the Group’s suppliers’ facilities, could prevent the 
Group from meeting customer demand.
The Group depends on efficient and uninterrupted operations of its 
information and communication technology, and any disruption to or 
interruptions in these operations could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s operations and financial performance.
Additionally, the Group is exposed to the impact of unexpected or 
prolonged periods of bad weather, which could adversely affect 
construction activity and, as a result, demand for the Group’s products. 
The Group has the ability to transfer some of its production across its 
network of plants and is able to engage subcontractors to reduce the 
impact of certain production disruptions. 
In relation to supplier disruption or failure, further third party suppliers have 
been identified who can maintain service in the event of a disruption.
In relation to IT, a major incident action plan has been developed and the 
Group maintains data backups and a comprehensive disaster recovery 
plan (see also Risk 11, overleaf).
Although weather conditions are completely beyond the Group’s control, 
in both the UK and US in 2016 adverse weather did not impact on trading 
in the context of the full year. Management do not underestimate the 
potential impact that future prolonged periods of bad weather could have. 
The Group’s wide geographical spread allows it to manage its production 
facilities to mitigate the impact of such disruption. 
6 – Recruitment and retention of key personnel  
The Group is dependent on qualified personnel in key positions and 
employees having special technical knowledge and skills. Any loss of 
such personnel without timely replacement could significantly disrupt 
business operations.
We ensure that we recognise the changing labour markets, and packages 
for key and senior staff remain competitive.
The Group believes that it is essential to protect and develop the 
management team, where appropriate ensuring that the team is structured 
in a way which best takes advantage of the available skills and robustly 
identifies the team and structure for the future. Extensive succession plans 
are in place, which is key to ensuring a managed transfer of roles and 
responsibilities.
Apprenticeship schemes are in operation with a yearly intake across the 
business (engineering and technical based). High potential individuals are 
identified with development plans formulated. External recruits are brought 
in where any skill gaps are identified and to enhance the talent pool.
7 – Input prices  
The Group’s business may be affected by volatility in extraction expenses 
and raw material costs. Risks exist around our ability to pass on increased 
costs through price increases to our customers.
The Group’s business may also be affected by volatility in energy costs 
or disruptions in energy supplies.
Significant changes in the cost or availability of transportation could affect 
the Group’s results.
Significant input costs are under constant review, with continuous 
monitoring of raw material costs, energy prices and haulage expenses, 
with the aim of achieving the best possible prices and assuring stability 
of supply.
As competitors of the Group are likely to experience similar levels of input 
price increases, we aim to have appropriate pricing policies to remain 
competitive within our markets and pass on significant increases in input 
costs to our customers wherever possible.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
35 Description Mitigation
8 – Product quality   
The nature of the Group’s business may expose it to warranty claims and 
to claims for product liability, construction defects, project delay, property 
damage, personal injury and other damages. Any damage to the Group’s 
brands, including through actual or alleged issues with its products, could 
harm our business, reputation and the Group’s financial results.
The Group operates comprehensive quality control procedures across 
its sites. 
The Group’s Technical teams carry out regular testing of all of our 
products to provide full technical data on our product range. 
9 – Financial risk management   
In addition to the input cost risks outlined above, the Group is subject to 
the following other financial risks:
 n Foreign exchange risk – As the Group has operations in the UK and 
the US, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the Group’s 
results. 
 n Credit risk – Through its customers, the Group is exposed to a 
counterparty risk that accounts receivable will not be settled leading to 
a financial loss to the Group.
 n Liquidity risk – Insufficient funds could result in the Group being unable 
to fund its operations. 
 n Interest rate risk – Movements in interest rates could adversely impact 
the Group and result in higher financing payments to service debt. 
 n Foreign exchange risk – The Group undertakes limited foreign 
exchange transactions, with the UK and US businesses selling 
domestically with largely local input costs. Some capex requires foreign 
exchange purchases and management considers foreign exchange 
hedging strategies where significant exposures may arise.
 n Credit risk – Customer credit risk is managed by each subsidiary subject 
to the Group’s policy relating to customer credit risk management. The 
Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer 
credit limits. The credit limits are set for each customer based on the 
creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business 
activity. These limits are initially determined when the customer account 
is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter. 
 n Liquidity risk – The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding 
and facilities in place to meet any foreseeable peak in borrowing 
requirements and liabilities when they become due. In March 2017 , the 
Group entered into new facilities of £250 million.
 n Interest rate risk – The Group finances its operations through a mixture 
of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group’s bank borrowings, 
other facilities and deposits are in Sterling and at floating rates. No interest 
rate derivative contracts have been entered into at the period end.
10 – Pension obligations  
The Group has obligations to its employees relating to retirement and other 
obligations and any changes in assumptions or in interest rate levels could 
have adverse effects on its financial position.
The Company plays an active role in the pension scheme – nominating up 
to half of the Trustees and the Group Chief Financial Officer attends and 
chairs Trustee meetings. The defined benefit scheme was closed to future 
accrual following consultation with members. The Pension Trustees and 
their external advisers, as well as the internal pensions team, have 
significant expertise in the area and provide oversight. Following the 
closure, our agreed Statement of Investment Principles, operated to 
provide appropriate security and achieve an appropriate balance 
between risk and return, is under review. 
1 1 – Cyber security new risk
Recent high-profile attacks on companies across a number of industry 
sectors have highlighted the damage that can now be caused by hackers 
and cyber terrorists. As a result, and as the Group continues to evolve, 
operational risks such as cyber security risk have increased in focus. 
Such IT security risks have the ability to significantly disrupt the Group’s 
business, resulting in financial loss.
The Group does not operate in a high risk sector, yet the Group is 
committed to ensure that its network, applications and data are protected. 
During the year, the Group has completed a review using an external cyber 
security programme framework, which provides coverage across the key 
areas of cyber security and aligns with industry standards. 
12 – Brexit new risk
The UK Referendum on EU membership in June 2016 introduced a 
degree of uncertainty and may give rise to longer-term macroeconomic 
changes, which as outlined in Risk 1, could reduce demand for the 
Group’s products. 
The Group established a Brexit Committee shortly after the Referendum 
result was announced. As part of this, management has developed 
contingency plans to mitigate risks arising from macroeconomic changes 
which may result. The Group has limited exposure to foreign currency risk 
and as a result the recent devaluation of Sterling has had minimal impact.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Risk management continued Viability Statement
Background
The Directors, have undertaken a 
comprehensive assessment of the Group’s 
viability as a business – rigorously 
assessing its markets, the strength of its 
business model and the potential risks that 
could impact its ongoing success. This 
process involved carefully reviewing and 
assessing extensive evidence, from both 
internal and external sources, to evaluate 
the prospects for the Group over a 
long-term horizon. 
Assessment
The Directors’ assessment of the longer-
term viability of the business, as part of the 
year-end review for the preparation of this 
Annual Report & Accounts, has assessed 
the business model, strategy, market 
conditions, business planning, risks and 
the liquidity and solvency of the Group.
The Group has a strong position in the 
markets in which it operates, as noted on 
pages 6 and 7 , and its strategy (see pages 
1 1 to 17) is aimed at continuing to 
strengthen its position in those markets 
and create value for its shareholders. 
The Group’s global operations (see pages 
26 and 27) exposes it to a number of risks 
and the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties are noted on pages 34 to 36. 
The Directors continually review those risks 
and determine the appropriate controls 
and further actions. They have further 
reviewed the impact within the context 
of the Group’s viability. The Group has 
limited exposure to interest rate risk and 
foreign exchange rate risk as described 
on page 36. 
Lookout period
In determining the lookout period to 
assess the prospects of the Group, the 
Directors decided that three years was 
the appropriate period over which to 
assess longer-term viability. The nature of 
the building products industry is that it is 
particularly sensitive to the level of 
economic activity, which is influenced by 
factors outside of the Group’s control, 
such as demographic trends, the state of 
the housing market, mortgage availability, 
mortgage interest rates and changes in 
household income, inflation and 
Government policy. Based on the evidence 
available, the Directors believe that it is 
reasonable to expect continued growth, 
and consider that a three-year period 
provides the most appropriate horizon 
over which to assess viability. The Directors 
have also considered the financing the 
Group has in place, which is agreed for 
a period in excess of the lookout period 
used. Following the facilities’ refinancing 
subsequent to the year-end, described in 
Note 34 to the Group consolidated 
financial statements, refinancing is 
therefore not considered a significant 
factor in this current assessment, but is 
monitored on a continuous basis. 
Stress testing
During the challenging market conditions of 
the recent past, the Group performed well, 
remaining cash positive and implementing 
a number of mitigating actions that allowed 
it to remain viable. These mitigating actions 
remain available to the Directors today.
The budget has been stress tested 
against a severe and prolonged reduction 
in demand for its products, on the basis 
of reduced house building activity and 
therefore reduced volume of product sold, 
as well as a benign environment of 
prolonged price stagnation on sales. 
These scenarios reflect the previous 
challenging market conditions of the 
2008/09 downturn, a period over which 
UK construction output fell 13% (Source: 
Office of National Statistics, Construction 
Products Association) with sharp 
reductions also in the US market. These 
scenarios have been modelled alongside 
input cost inflation outside of the Group’s 
control, notably for energy costs. 
Assumptions
In determining the viability of the Group, the 
Board made the following assumptions:
 n The economic climate in the 
geographies in which the Group 
operates remains in line with a broad 
consensus of external forecasts;
 n There is no material change in the legal 
and regulatory frameworks with which 
the Group complies;
 n There are no material changes in 
construction methods used in the 
markets in which the Group operates;
 n The Group’s risk mitigation strategies 
continue to be effective; and
 n The Group’s past record of successfully 
mitigating significant construction 
industry declines can be replicated.
Conclusion
In summary, the Directors reasonably 
expect, based on the evidence available, 
that the Group will continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of their assessment.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
39 Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Statement 
to our shareholders for our first full year as a listed company.
Your Board manages the Company in a transparent, open and 
honest manner, which we achieve by maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance. The Board is ultimately responsible to 
shareholders for all our activities: for delivering our strategy and 
financial performance in the long-term interests of the Company, 
for efficiently using our resources and having regard to social, 
environmental and ethical matters. The Board approves the 
Group’s governance framework with the Board Committees 
contributing their specialist focus to key areas such as 
remuneration policy, internal controls and risk management and 
succession planning. It is the Board’s intention to continue to work 
towards full compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Governance Code”). Due to the relatively short period of time 
between Admission and the year-end, last year’s Annual Report & 
Accounts identified a number of areas where the Company was 
not fully compliant with the Governance Code. With the significant 
progress made in the months following Admission and the 
excellent strides that have been made during the year, I am 
pleased to report that, with one exception, the Company was in 
compliance with the principles of the Governance Code at the 
year-end. That one exception was in relation to Board balance, 
which is discussed later in the Statement. Justin Read was 
appointed to the Board on 1 January 2017 , at which time the 
Board achieved full compliance with the principles of the 
Governance Code.
While other sections of the Annual Report & Accounts cover our 
financial and operational achievements during the period, this 
section describes the effective leadership of the Board and how 
it endeavours to promote the highest standards of corporate 
governance throughout the Group.
My responsibility as Chairman is to ensure that the Board operates 
effectively and efficiently and that it upholds the high standards of 
corporate governance required for the long-term success of the 
Group. I believe the achievement of good governance is based on 
the appropriate level of oversight, good communication, a focus 
on the management of risks, a commitment to transparency and 
ensuring a culture of continuous improvement in standards and 
performance across the business.
The Board regularly reviews its level of oversight and the 
monitoring of risks over a variety of areas including strategy, 
acquisitions and disposals, capital expenditure on new projects, 
finance, people and sustainability matters. It will continue to adapt 
to meet the evolving needs of the Group. The Board aims to 
ensure that good governance extends beyond the Boardroom 
and is continually borne in mind in the successful delivery of the 
Group’s strategic priorities over both the short and long term.
Jamie Pike 
Non-Executive Chairman

Corporate Governance Statement Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 
The purpose of the Governance Code is to facilitate effective, 
entrepreneurial and prudent management that can deliver the 
long-term success of the Company. The main principles of the 
Governance Code set out standards of practice for the Board in 
relation to leadership, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration 
and its relations with shareholders. 
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. We have made significant progress since Admission 
and, as at the date of this Annual Report & Accounts, the Company 
complies (and intends to continue to comply) with the Governance 
Code. As explained in last year’s Annual Report & Accounts, there 
were a number provisions of the Governance Code with which 
the Company was not fully compliant in the months following 
Admission. Details relevant to our 2016 financial year are provided 
opposite, together with an explanation of the action we have 
taken to achieve compliance as at the date of this Annual 
Report & Accounts.
This Statement, together with the Committee reports and the 
Directors’ Report, explains key features of the Company’s 
governance structure and compliance with the version of the 
Governance Code published in September 2014 by the Financial 
Reporting Council. This Statement also includes items required by 
the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules (“DTR”). A copy of the Governance Code is available on the 
Financial Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk. 
The Company has been applying the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016 since its financial year-end and will report on 
compliance in next year’s Annual Report & Accounts.
The Listing Rules require that we state how the “Main Principles” 
set out in the Governance Code have been applied. The required 
detail, in line with the specific provisions of the Governance Code, 
is set out in this Corporate Governance Statement.
Share Dealing Code
The Company has adopted a code of securities dealings in relation 
to the Ordinary Shares. The code applies to the Directors, Persons 
Discharging Managerial Responsibilities and relevant employees of 
the Group.
Relationship with 
shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of creating a clear flow 
of communication with all shareholders, particularly with regard 
to business developments and financial results. The Board aims 
to communicate on a regular basis and at present the Company 
utilises news releases, investor presentations and Company 
publications and will expand communication channels 
as appropriate.
Governance 
Code 
provision Description Comments
B.1.2 Except for 
smaller 
companies at 
least half the 
board, 
excluding the 
chairman, 
should 
comprise 
non-executive 
directors 
determined by 
the board to be 
independent.
The Governance Code recommends that, 
in the case of a FTSE 350 company, at 
least half the Board of Directors, excluding 
the Chairman, should comprise Non-
Executive Directors determined by the 
Board to be independent for the purposes 
of the Governance Code. 
At the beginning of 2016 the Board 
comprised six members, including the 
Non-Executive Chairman, who was 
independent on appointment, the Senior 
Independent Director, two Executive 
Directors and two Non-Executive 
Directors, Michel Plantevin and Matthias 
Boyer Chammard, who are not 
considered to be independent for the 
purposes of the Governance Code as a 
result of being nominated to the Board by 
Diamond (BC) S.à r.l. During the year 
Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella were 
appointed as Non-Executive Directors and 
Justin Read was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director on 1 January 
2017 . All are considered to be independent 
for the purposes of the Governance Code 
and, therefore, the Company has been in 
compliance since 1 January 2017 .
For a short period of time at the beginning of 2016 the composition of 
the committees were not fully compliant with the Governance Code 
provisions B.2.1 (Nomination Committee), C.3.1 (Audit Committee) and 
D.2.1 (Remuneration Committee). This was remedied in February 2016 
with the appointment of Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella to the Board 
and its committees.
The executives hold regular meetings with analysts and 
shareholders at appropriate times during the year and relevant 
feedback from those meetings is provided to the Board.
Jonathan Nicholls is the Senior Independent Director (“SID”). 
Jonathan is available to shareholders throughout the year if they 
have concerns that contact through the normal channels of the 
Chairman or other Executive Directors have failed to resolve or for 
which such channels of communication are inappropriate.
The SID has communicated with the major shareholder, Diamond 
(BC) S.à r.l., on a regular basis through their representatives on the 
Board of Directors.
All shareholders are invited to the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting (the “AGM”), at which they will have the opportunity to 
meet and put questions to the Board. Details of the resolutions to 
be proposed at the AGM to be held on 24 May 2017 at 2:00 p.m. 
at Citigate Dewe Rogerson, 3 London Wall Buildings, London Wall, 
London EC2M 5SY, can be found in the Notice of Meeting. The 
Notice of Meeting, together with explanatory notes on the 
resolutions to be proposed and full details of the deadlines for 
appointing proxies, is contained in a circular which will be 
circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
AGM, together with this Annual Report & Accounts. This 
document will also be available on the Ibstock plc website 
(www.ibstockplc.com/investors). Results of voting at the AGM will 
be announced to the London Stock Exchange and will be 
published on our website at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.

41 Leadership
Board composition
The Governance Code recommends that the board of directors 
of a UK premium listed company includes an appropriate 
combination of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, with 
independent Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
comprising at least half the board. We are now compliant. As at 
31 December 2016, the Board comprised a Non-Executive 
Chairman, three independent Non-Executive Directors, two 
non-independent Non-Executive Directors and two Executive 
Directors. The Board regards Jonathan Nicholls, Tracey Graham 
and Lynn Minella as independent for the purposes of the 
Governance Code. In January 2017 , Justin Read was appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director, and is regarded by the Board as 
independent for the purposes of the Governance Code. 
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors and 
observer by the Controlling Shareholder
On 22 October 2015, the Company entered into a Relationship 
Agreement with Diamond (BC) S.à r.l. (the “Controlling 
Shareholder”), under the terms of which the Controlling 
Shareholder has a right to nominate for appointment two Directors 
(each a “Shareholder Director”) to the Board of the Company whilst 
its and its associates’ shareholding in the Company is 25% or 
more; and to nominate for appointment one Shareholder Director 
to the Board of the Company whilst its and its associates’ 
shareholding in the Company is 10% or more. If the Controlling 
Shareholder’s shareholding in the Company is reduced to less 
than 25%, but is 10% or more and two Shareholder Directors are 
appointed to the Board of the Company, the Controlling Shareholder 
will, if requested by the Board, procure that one of its nominated 
Directors resigns from the Board. If the Controlling Shareholder 
and its associates’ shareholding in the Company is reduced to less 
than 10%, the Controlling Shareholder will, if requested by the 
Board, procure that all of its remaining nominated Directors resign 
from the Board. In addition, for as long as the Controlling 
Shareholder and its associates’ shareholding in the Company is 
10% or more, the Controlling Shareholder shall also be entitled to 
appoint one Shareholder Director as a member of the Nomination 
Committee and, if invited by the Chairman of the relevant committee 
to send a Shareholder Director as an observer to meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
The Board confirms that, during the year, and as at the date of 
this report:
 n the Company has complied with the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement;
 n so far as the Company is aware, the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by the Controlling Shareholder and its associates; and
 n so far as the Company is aware, the procurement obligation 
included in the Relationship Agreement has been complied with 
by the Controlling Shareholder.
Board responsibilities and procedures
The following is a high level summary of the principal decisions 
that are specifically reserved for the Board:
 n Responsibility for the overall management of the Group, 
including monitoring the Group’s operating and financial 
performance.
 n Approval of the Group’s long-term objectives, values, standards, 
commercial strategy and annual budgets. 
 n Approval of the annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any subsequent material changes to them.
 n Making changes to the Group’s capital, legal and corporate 
structure, including reduction, consolidation, sub-division or 
conversion of share capital. 
 n Approval of the half-yearly report, trading updates, the 
preliminary announcement of the final results and the Annual 
Report & Accounts.
 n Approval of the dividend policy and declaration of any interim

mutual understanding of objectives.
Matters not specifically reserved for the Board, including the day 
to day management of the Group, are delegated to the Executive 
Directors. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors 
receive appropriate and timely information. 
Board Committees
As envisaged by the Governance Code, the Board has established 
three principal Committees of the Board: an Audit Committee; a 
Nomination Committee; and a Remuneration Committee. Each 
Committee has formally delegated duties and responsibilities set 
out in its written Terms of Reference. If the need should arise, the 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
42
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance Statement continued Board may establish additional committees, to consider specific 
issues, as appropriate. In line with each of the Committees’ terms 
of reference, only members of the relevant Committee have the 
right to attend and vote at its meetings. Committee meetings are 
also attended by the Company Secretary, who acts as the secretary 
to each of the Committees. When appropriate, Directors who are 
not members of the relevant Committee, including Executive 
Directors, may be invited to attend all or any part of any Committee 
meeting. The matters reserved for the Board and the terms of 
reference for each of the Board Committees are available on the 
Company’s corporate website, at www.ibstockplc.com/investors. 
Details of each of the Board Committees and their activities during 
the year are set out in the separate Committee Reports on pages 
38 and 39, which are incorporated into the Corporate Governance 
Statement by reference. The Chairman of each Committee reports 
the outcome of the meetings to the Board. Details of Committee 
memberships are included in the Directors’ biographies on pages 
38 and 39.
Decision-making and Directors’ conflicts 
of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
have or may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, 
unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. This includes 
potential conflicts that may arise when a Director takes up a 
position with another company. The Company’s Articles of 
Association, which are in line with the Companies Act 2006, allow 
the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise 
and to impose limits or conditions, as appropriate, when giving any 
authorisation. Any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of 
interest is only effective if it is agreed without the conflicted Directors 
voting or without their votes being counted. In making such a 
decision, the Directors must act in a way they consider in good 
faith will be most likely to promote the success of the Company.
The Company has established a procedure for the appropriate 
authorisation to be sought prior to the appointment of any new 
Director, or prior to a new conflict arising and for the regular review 
of actual or potential conflicts of interest. An Interests Register 
records any authorised conflicts/potential conflicts and will be 
reviewed by the Board on a regular basis to ensure that the 
procedure is working effectively. During the year, and as at the 
date of this report, no conflicts were reported to the Board.
Board induction and development
On appointment, Non-Executive Directors, who are expected to 
provide a time commitment to the Company of at least 25 days 
a year and to recognise the need for availability in the event of a 
crisis, are provided with a detailed induction programme. The 
induction programme is tailored to suit the needs of individual 
Directors and covers the provision of information on the Company’s 
operations, including social, ethical and environmental matters, the 
Group’s principal risks and internal controls in place to manage 
those risks, meetings with senior management and tours of the 
Group’s main properties. 
Directors may, at the Company’s expense, take independent 
professional advice and are encouraged to continually update 
their professional skills and knowledge of the business. Senior 
managers and external advisers present to the Board during the 
year on a range of subjects and the Directors also individually 
attend seminars or conferences associated with their expertise. 
The Chairman reviews the level and nature of training undertaken 
by the Directors at least annually.
Effectiveness
Division of responsibilities 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer
For the Board to remain effective, the Governance Code requires 
a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer. These positions are held by Jamie Pike as 
Chairman and Wayne Sheppard as Chief Executive Officer. The 
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer are set out and are available to view on the 
Company’s corporate website at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.
The Chairman reports to the Board and is the guardian of the 
Board’s decision-making processes. He is responsible for 
leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness on all 
aspects of its role. The Chairman also promotes a culture of 
openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of 
Non-Executive Directors, in particular, and ensuring constructive 
relations between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The 
Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information and that there is effective 
communication with shareholders.
The Chief Executive Officer, assisted by senior management, is 
responsible for proposing and developing the Company’s strategy 
and commercial objectives for consideration by the Board, and for 
implementing the decisions of the Board into the day to day 
functions of the business.
The Chief Financial Officer
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the financial reporting 
and management of the Group. In addition to the finance, audit, tax 
and treasury functions, he is also jointly responsible with the Chief 
Executive Officer for the Group’s M&A strategy and investor relations. 
The Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is available for shareholders to 
voice any concerns which may not be appropriate for discussion 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 
or Chief Financial Officer. The Senior Independent Director also 
leads the Chairman’s appraisal, serves as an intermediary for the 
other Directors with the Chairman as necessary and acts as a 
sounding board for the Chairman as required.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
43 Non-Executive Directors
At the date of this Report, independent Non-Executive Directors 
comprise 50% of the Board, excluding the Chairman. The Board 
believes that these Non-Executive Directors, Jonathan Nicholls, 
Tracey Graham, Lynn Minella and Justin Read, possess strong 
independent character and judgement and bring a wide range 
of business experience both in areas related to and areas 
complementary to the activities of the Group. 
Michel Plantevin and Matthias Boyer Chammard are Non-Executive 
Directors appointed by Diamond (BC) S.à r.l., pursuant to the 
Relationship Agreement, and are not considered to be independent.
The Non-Executive Directors scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor 
the reporting of performance. They also satisfy themselves on the 
integrity of financial information and that financial controls and 
systems of risk management are robust and defensible. They are 
responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration of 
executive directors and have a prime role in appointing and, 
where necessary, removing executive directors, and in 
succession planning.
Directors’ insurance cover and indemnity
The Company maintains, at its expense, a Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance policy to afford an indemnity in certain 
circumstances for the benefit of Group personnel including, as 
recommended by the Governance Code, the Directors. This 
insurance policy does not provide cover where the Director or 
Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
The Company has also provided an indemnity for its Directors to 
the extent permitted by the law in respect of liabilities incurred as 
a result of their office. The indemnity would not provide any 
coverage to the extent that a Director is proved to have acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Board evaluation
This year, in compliance with the Governance Code, the 
performance evaluation was conducted by external facilitator, 
David Mensley of EquityCommunications Limited. Neither 
Mr Mensley nor EquityCommunications Limited has any other 
connection to the Company. 
The performance evaluation process was undertaken in late 
autumn 2016. Having agreed a schedule of matters for appraisal, 
EquityCommunications Limited prepared a questionnaire which 
included questions about Board administration, the role of the 
Chairman, strategy, risk oversight, succession planning and the 
Board Committee structure. The questionnaire was completed by 
all Board members and also the Company Secretary. A report on 
the outcome of the evaluation exercise was prepared by 
EquityCommunications Limited and was presented to the Board 
at its December 2016 meeting.
The evaluation was undertaken before the Board had completed 
its first full financial year of post IPO operations, and 
EquityCommunications Limited commented on how well and quickly 
following IPO the Board had assembled into a remarkably well 
bonded team with strong leadership both of the Board and the 
Group. The report was positive about the performance of the Board, 
its main Committees and individual Directors. This early externally 
facilitated evaluation will serve as a good benchmark for the future.
The early adoption of an external review did highlight some areas 
where it was too soon to make strong judgements about certain 
Board processes. Whilst not raised as an area of weakness in the 
exercise undertaken this year, we propose to follow through the 
suggestion made by EquityCommunications Limited that our next 
Board evaluation focuses in even greater depth on our risk 
management processes, which by then will have completed a 
full cycle of operations.
As a result of recommendations made in the Board evaluation 
report, the Board has agreed to enhance its approach to strategy 
planning and to continue to focus on succession planning, both 
at Board level and in key businesses in the Group.
The Chairman has met with each of the independent Non-
Executive Directors in the absence of the Executive Directors. 
Overall, the Board considered the performance of each Director 
to be effective and concluded that the Board and its Committees 
continue to provide effective leadership and exert the required 
levels of governance and control and that each Director continues 
to contribute effectively and demonstrate commitment to his or her 
role. The Board will continue to review its procedures, effectiveness 
and development in the year ahead.
The Senior Independent Director has met with the independent 
Non-Executive Directors, in the absence of the Chairman, to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance, taking into account the 
views of Executive Directors. The review concluded that the 
Chairman’s performance continued to be effective and that he 
demonstrates commitment to the role.
Development and advice
The Directors of all Group companies, as well as the Board, have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. 
Independent external legal and professional advice can also be taken 
when necessary to do so. Furthermore, each Committee of the 
Board has access to sufficient and tailored resources to carry out its 
duties. A personalised induction and subsequent training programme 
is provided to new members of the Board and its Committees.
Meetings and attendance
The Board has met on eight occasions during the year and 
expects to meet approximately eight times each year going 
forward. It may meet at other times as required or otherwise at the 
request of one or more of the Directors. Where urgent decisions 
are required between meetings on matters specifically reserved 
for the Board, there is a process in place to facilitate discussion 
and decision-making. The Directors regularly communicate and 
exchange information irrespective of the timing of meetings.
The number of meetings of the Board and its Committees and the 
attendance by the Directors during the year is disclosed in the 
following table:

This table only shows those Committee meetings which each 
Director attended as a member of the Committee, rather than as 
an invitee. Where “n/a” appears in the table the Director listed is not 
a member of that Committee. Directors receive relevant papers in 
advance of meetings and any Director not able to attend has the 
opportunity to raise any issues and provide comments to the 
Board or relevant committee chairman in advance of the meeting. 
Directors do not participate in meetings when matters relating to 
them are discussed. 
The Board aims to hold at least two Board meetings each year at 
Group business locations, both in the UK and the US, to enable 
Board members to gain a deeper understanding of the business. 
This also provides senior managers from across the Group with 
the opportunity to present to the Board as well as to meet the 
Directors at more informal occasions. During 2016 the Board held

45 External directorships
Any external appointments or other significant commitments of 
the Directors require the prior approval of the Board. The external 
commitments of the Board are set out in their biographies on 
pages 38 and 39. The Board is content with the level of external 
directorships held by the Chairman and the independent 
Non-Executive Directors, as these do not impact on the time 
that any Director devotes to the Company. Furthermore, the Board 
believes that this external experience only enhances the capability 
of the Board. 
Jamie Pike’s external commitments are currently unchanged 
since last year, but he has indicated that he will step down as 
Chairman and as a Director of Tyman PLC at that Company’s 
AGM in May 2017 . 
Wayne Sheppard is Principal of the Construction Products 
Association, and a Director of the Brick Development Association.
Accountability
Internal controls
The Board remains responsible for the effectiveness of internal 
control and risk management and keeps the systems under 
regular review. 
The Board as a whole discuss, challenge and give approval on the 
Annual Report & Accounts. Details of the internal controls of the 
Company (including a description of the main features of its internal 
control and risk management arrangements in relation to the 
financial reporting process) and the manner in which the Board 
assess the effectiveness of these controls are set out as part of 
the Audit Committee Report on pages 52 to 57 . 
The Group’s internal control is based on assessment of risk and a 
framework of control procedures to manage risks and to monitor 
compliance with procedures. The internal control systems are 
designed to meet the Group’s particular needs and the risks to 
which it is exposed and, by their nature, can provide only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material loss to the 
Group or material misstatement in the financial accounts.
The Group has an ongoing process for the identification, evaluation 
and management of significant business risks, which has been in 
place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of 
this Annual Report & Accounts. The Board has during the period 
identified and evaluated the key risks and has ensured that 
effective controls and procedures are in place to manage these 
risks (see pages 32 to 36).
The Executive Directors meet regularly with representatives from 
the businesses to address financial, human resource, legal, risk 
management and other control issues.
In relation to the Board’s responsibility to approve the financial 
statements the Board sets out its Directors’ Responsibility 
Statement at the end of this section. The Board also retains its 
responsibility to approve the annual budget. Monitoring of the 
annual budget, following approval, is carried out through regular 
updates against budget circulated as part of the Chief Financial 
Officer’s report to the Board. In addition, the Board reviews all 
significant capital expenditure requests separately, after a general 
approval for the quantum of the capital expenditure budget has 
been granted. Measures such as these maintain adequate levels 
of control and scrutiny over the budget and capital expenditure at 
Board level. The Board recognises that its Committees are 
generally only empowered to make recommendations to the 
Board for their approval, unless a specific authorisation to approve 
certain matters is granted. To facilitate information flows, a verbal 
update is given by the Chairman of the relevant Committee in the 
subsequent Board meeting following a Committee meeting.
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management and internal control during 
the year, in accordance with the FRC’s guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting. Details of the review can be found in the Audit 
Committee report on page 52 to 57 .
Fair, balanced and understandable – a matter 
for the whole Board
As part of its considerations as to whether the 2016 Annual Report 
& Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable, and provide 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy, the Board 
takes into account the following:
 n the Chairman and Chief Executive provide input to and agree on 
the overall messages and tone of the Annual Report & Accounts 
at an early stage;
 n individual sections of the Annual Report & Accounts are drafted 
by appropriate senior management with regular review meetings 
to ensure consistency of the whole document;
 n detailed reviews of appropriate draft sections of the Annual 
Report & Accounts are undertaken by the Executive Directors;
 n a final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee and the auditors 
on a timely basis to allow sufficient consideration and is 
discussed with the Chief Financial Officer and senior 
management prior to consideration by the Board; and
 n the Chief Financial Officer, in his February 2017 Board paper, 
included a checklist of areas that the Board should take into 
account in considering the fairness, consistency and balance of 
the final draft of the Annual Report & Accounts including whether 
the Board considers that there are any omissions in information.
The statement of Going Concern and the Viability Statement 
appear on pages 75 and 37 , respectively.

Corporate Governance Statement continued Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report & 
Accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards), including FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and 
applicable law. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the Annual Report & Accounts unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
 n select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 n make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
 n state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and 
 n prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group consolidated financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard No. 1 requires Directors to: 
 n properly select and apply accounting policies;
 n present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 n provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
 n make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and to disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the Annual Report & Accounts, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. 
Directors’ Responsibility Statement 
The Directors who were in office as at 31 December 2016 and 
whose names and functions are given on pages 38 and 39 
confirm that to the best of their knowledge: 
 n the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Group and Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 n the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
This Responsibility Statement was approved by the Board of 
Directors on 7 March 2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

49 Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present to you the report of the Nomination 
Committee (the “Committee”) for the year ended 31 December 
2016.
2016 key achievements
 n We supported the Board with the appointment of three 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Tracey Graham and 
Lynn Minella joined the Board in February 2016 and Justin Read 
was appointed on 1 January 2017 .
 n We reviewed the training requirements of the Board and agreed 
upon a suitable regime. Going forward, the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary will identify broader areas of training for the 
Board as a whole and the Chairman will discuss and agree the 
training requirements with individual Directors.
 n We conducted an in-depth review of the Group’s succession 
plan and considered the talent available below the Board level. 
The Committee’s review concluded that the Company has 
robust succession planning arrangements in place.
 n We reviewed the size, structure and composition of the Board 
and worked towards compliance with the provisions of the 
Governance Code. Egon Zehnder, the external search firm, 
which has no other connection to the Company, worked with 
me to devise a long list of candidates for each of the three Board 
appointments. Short lists were then compiled and the 
Committee, together with the Executive Directors, met with the 
candidates, following which the Committee was able to 
formulate its recommendation to the Board. Compliance with 
the Governance Code was achieved on 1 January 2017 with 
the appointment of Justin Read. 
 n We considered the time commitment required from the 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee concluded, through 
discussions with the Chairman and the Board and Committee 
evaluation process, that the Non-Executive Directors had 
committed sufficient time to fulfil their duties and that their 
performance continued to be effective.
 n We reviewed the Independence of Non-Executive Directors 
and formed the conclusion that the independent Non-Executive 
Directors named on pages 38 and 39 continue to be regarded 
as independent.
Members of the Committee as at the date 
of this report:
 n Jamie Pike (Chairman)
 n Tracey Graham
 n Lynn Minella
 n Jonathan Nicholls
 n Michel Plantevin
 n Justin Read
Please see pages 38 and 39 for detailed biographies.
Areas of focus in 2017
 n Continue to develop and monitor succession plans for both the 
Board and senior management.
 n Development of the Diversity Policy.
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are as follows:
 n Develop and maintain a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for making recommendations to the Board on 
appointments and on the structure, size and composition of 
the Board; 
 n Succession planning for Directors and other senior managers;
 n Evaluate the balance of skills, diversity, knowledge and 
experience of the Board;
 n Prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for 
a particular appointment and lead the recruitment process;
 n Identify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, candidates 
to fill Board and senior management vacancies as and when 
they arise;

Nomination Committee Report Succession planning
The composition of the Board is constantly under review with 
the aim of ensuring that it has the depth and breadth of skills to 
discharge its responsibilities effectively. The Committee, through 
its review of succession planning, applies a similar approach to 
the layer of management that sits immediately below the Board.
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Board is well 
balanced and appropriate for the needs of the business and 
the achievement of its strategy, comprising Directors who are 
appropriately experienced and are independent of character and 
judgement. Before recommending new candidates to the Board, 
the Nomination Committee takes account of the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity of psychological type, 
educational and professional background and gender. However, 
all Board appointments will always be made on merit. Additional 
information is included in the Corporate Governance Statement 
on page 42.
Ensuring the Directors’ independence and 
commitment to their roles
In making recommendations to the Board on Non-Executive 
Director appointments, the Nomination Committee specifically 
considers the expected time commitment of the proposed 
Non-Executive Director and other commitments they already have. 
Agreement of the Board is also required before a Director may 
accept any additional commitments to ensure possible conflicts of 
interest are identified and that they will continue to have sufficient 
time available to devote to the Company. Any other conflicts of 
interest are also considered at each Board meeting.
Re-election of Directors
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly by the 
Nomination Committee to ensure there is an effective balance of 
skills, experience and knowledge.
In accordance with the Governance Code, all Directors wishing to 
continue in office will retire and offer themselves for re-election by 
shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
Corporate Governance
During the year, the Committee and reviewed the Terms of 
Reference. The Terms of Reference can be found on our website 
at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.
Diversity
The Board fully supports the aims, objectives and 
recommendations outlined in the Hampton-Alexander Review 
which is focused on ensuring talented women succeed by 
removing barriers to their success, and continuing to drive forward 
the momentum of the Davies Review – “Women on Boards”. We 
are aware of the need to achieve an appropriate balance of women 
on our Board and in senior positions throughout the Group. We do 
not consider that it is in the best interests of the Company, or its 
shareholders, to set prescriptive targets for gender on the Board 
and we will continue to make appointments based on merit, 
against objective criteria to ensure we appoint the best individual 
for each role. 
Approximately 22% of the Board are female, as at the date of this 
Report, and 12.5% of a population of senior managers are female. 
Additional information regarding the gender split across the Group 
can be found on page 23 of the Strategic report.
Board and Committee effectiveness
The Committee arranged an annual performance evaluation to be 
undertaken of the effectiveness of the Board, each Committee of 
the Board and of the contribution of each Director. 
The evaluation of the Board and its Committees was conducted 
by EquityCommunications Limited, an external facilitator, in the 
late autumn 2016. The process took the form of a questionnaire 
completed by all members of the Board and the Company 
Secretary. A report on the outcome of the evaluation of the 
Committee’s effectiveness was prepared by 
EquityCommunications Limited and was presented to the Board 
and its Committees in December 2016. The conclusion drawn 
from the review was that the Committee had operated effectively.

51 Dear Shareholder,
Welcome to the Report of the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) 
for the Group’s first full year of trading since Admission. 
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the 
Board on the Group’s financial reporting, internal control and risk 
management systems and the independence and effectiveness 
of the external auditors. The Committee provides independent 
monitoring, guidance and challenge to Executive Management 
in these areas. Through this process the Committee’s aim is to 
ensure high standards of corporate and regulatory reporting, 
an appropriate control environment, risk management and 
compliance. The Committee believes that excellence in these 
areas enhances the effectiveness and reduces the risks to the 
business and protects the interests of the shareholders as regards 
the integrity of published financial information by the Group and 
the effectiveness of the external audit.
The Committee is appointed by the Board. The Committee will 
continue to keep its activities under review to ensure that it 
complies with any changes in the regulatory environment. 
I shall be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any 
questions shareholders may have regarding the work of the 
Committee.
2016 key achievements
 n Following a competitive tender process the Committee 
commissioned RSM Risk Assurance Services LLP (“RSM”) to 
conduct a “health-check” of current Internal Audit arrangements 
and the wider control environment and acted upon the 
recommendations. 
 n Satisfied with the performance of RSM in conducting the 
“health-check”, the Committee appointed them to provide an 
outsourced Internal Audit function.
 n We conducted a competitive tender process for the 
appointment of the Group’s external auditor and recommended 
the appointment of Deloitte LLP .
Members of the Committee as at the date 
of this report:
 n Jonathan Nicholls (Chairman)
 n Tracey Graham
 n Lynn Minella
 n Justin Read
Please see pages 38 to 39 for detailed biographies.
Areas of focus in 2017
 n Formalise and publish the Group tax strategy in compliance with 
new legislation introduced during 2016.
 n Continue to ensure that the systems of internal control are robust 
and operating effectively and that the principal risks identified by 
the Board are effectively managed.
 n Review significant reporting judgements and key assumptions 
related to those judgements.
Audit Committee composition and meetings
During February 2016, Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella were 
appointed to the Board as Non-Executive Directors and also 
became members of the Committee. Following their appointment, 
Jamie Pike, who had been a member of the Committee since 
Admission, stood down from the Committee on 24 February 2016. 
Justin Read became a member of the Committee upon his 
appointment to the Board in January 2017 .
The Governance Code recommends that, in the case of FTSE 350 
companies, the Audit and Risk Committee comprises at least 
three Non-Executive Directors, independent for the purposes of 
the Governance Code, and that one such member has recent and 
relevant financial experience. The Board considers that Justin 
Read and I have recent and relevant financial experience. The 
Committee, as a whole, has competence relevant to the sector in 
which the Group operates.
The Committee met formally on four occasions during the year and 
expects to meet at least four times per year going forward. 
The Committee provides a forum for reporting and discussion with 
the Group’s external auditors in respect of the Group’s half year 
and year-end results and meetings are also attended by certain 
Executive Directors and senior managers by invitation.
Other members of the Board attend the Committee’s meetings, 
as and when required, by invitation.
Audit Committee Report
Jonathan Nicholls  
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
52
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Purpose and aim 
The purpose of the Committee is to make recommendations on 
the reporting, control, risk management and compliance aspects 
of the Directors’ and the Group’s responsibilities, providing 
independent monitoring, guidance and challenge to Executive 
Management in these areas. 
Key responsibilities include:
 n To ensure the consistent application of, and any changes to, 
significant accounting policies across the Group;
 n To monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group;
 n To monitor and challenge the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal financial controls, as well as the wider internal control 
and risk management systems; 
 n To monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s whistleblowing 
procedures; 
 n To evaluate the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function; 
 n To make recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
independence and effectiveness of the Group’s external auditor 
and to negotiate and agree their remuneration; and
 n To develop and implement the Group’s non-audit services policy.
The Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the 
Company’s website at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.
Accounting and key areas of judgement
A key factor in the integrity of financial statements is ensuring that 
suitable accounting policies are adopted and applied consistently 
on a year on year basis. The Committee specifically uses the Audit 
Planning meetings in May and November each year to consider 
proposed accounting treatments for major transactions, significant 
reporting judgements and key assumptions related to those 
judgements. In addition, these matters are reviewed throughout 
the year.
Audit Committee activities during the year
The Audit Committee ensures the integrity of financial reporting 
and audit processes and the maintenance of a sound internal 
control and risk management system. The table above 
summarises the agenda items covered at the Committee’s 
meetings during the year:
Financial and narrative reporting
 n Reviewed the full and half year results and associated 
announcements and recommended them to the Board 
for approval.
 n Reviewed the Group’s Annual Report & Accounts to consider

recommended them to the Board for approval.
 n Conducted a review of significant accounting policies 
and judgements.
 n Received corporate reporting updates from the external

Significant issues considered by the 
Committee during the year
Significant issues considered by the Committee
The Audit Committee considers all financial information published 
in the annual and half year financial statements and considers 
accounting policies adopted by the Group, presentation and 
disclosure of the financial information and, in particular, the key 
judgements made by management in preparing the financial 
statements. In addition to the matters described below, the 
Committee considered the tax prior year adjustment disclosed 
in Note 1 to the Group consolidated financial statements and 
concluded the adjustment has been appropriately calculated 
and disclosed.
The Audit Committee pays particular attention to matters it 
considers to be important by virtue of their impact on the Group’s 
results, or the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved 
in their application on the Group consolidated financial statements. 
The main areas of focus during the year are set out overleaf:
Audit Committee Report continued
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
54
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Revenue recognition and accounting for 
customer rebates
The Group has a number of contracts with its customers 
containing volume rebate clauses based on revenue earned in 
the period. Given the material nature of the Group’s rebates, the 
Committee requested that management review its accounting 
practices in this area which confirmed the nature of the basis of 
the calculation. The Committee reviewed management’s paper 
describing the process (with reference to contractual agreements) 
and the controls in place to record the rebate and settle in cash. 
Considering the limited judgement involved in the process due to 
the nature of the rebates provided, and input from the external 
auditor, the Committee was satisfied that accounting balances at 
31 December 2016 were appropriately recorded. Following 
discussion, and subject to there being no significant change to 
the agreements, quantum or processes, customer rebates will 
be removed from the Committee’s list of significant matters 
going forward.
Pension accounting
The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK and 
post-retirement obligations in its US operations. Judgement is 
taken by management around the assumptions used, including 
the impact of sensitivities to these assumptions, by its actuary to 
calculate the pension scheme assets and liabilities under IAS 19(R). 
The Committee considered the basis of the actuarial calculation, 
the assumptions used and the approach to minimum funding 
requirements under IFRIC 14. In the UK scheme there was a deficit 
of £28.7 million, as detailed in Note 21 to the Group consolidated 
financial statements. The Committee reviewed the assumptions 
with management and sought views from the external auditor 
before concluding on the appropriateness of the actuarial balances 
disclosed. In 2016, due to the decision to close the UK defined 
benefit pension scheme to future accrual, a curtailment gain of 
£30.3 million was recognised in the Group consolidated income 
statement, which management disclosed as an exceptional item. 
After assessing the non-recurring nature of the gain, the 
Committee concurred that the classification was appropriate. 
Additionally, the Committee also agreed the recording of the 
£9.4 million liability in respect of the US pension.
Alternative performance measures
The Group presents a number of alternative performance 
measures (“APMs”) within its published financial information, 
including its 2016 Annual Report & Accounts with the objective 
of providing readers with better understanding of financial 
performance in the period and so as to facilitate comparison with 
future periods and to assess trends in financial performance.
In light of the guidance issued by the European Securities and 
Markets Authority and the UK’s Financial Reporting Council, the 
Committee has understood and challenged management’s 
rationale for including an item as an exceptional item. Through 
discussion with management and the external auditor, the 
Committee has also sought to ensure that the policy for APMs is 
applied consistently and in compliance with the guidance provided. 
The Committee concluded that the presentation of APMs gave 
additional clarity on performance and was reconciled appropriately 
to reported amounts, with sufficient prominence, thereby satisfying 
the requirements.
Indicators of impairment 
The Group holds significant asset values in the form of mineral 
reserves, land and buildings, and property, plant and equipment. 
The Committee considered the processes adopted by 
management in assessing whether, in their judgement, any 
indicators of impairment existed and whether any subsequent 
detailed impairment testing should be undertaken. 
The Committee reviewed management’s conclusions in this area 
and concurred with management’s judgement that no indicators 
of impairment existed at the balance sheet date and, as such, 
no detailed impairment testing was required.
Management confirmed to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any misstatements, either material or immaterial, in the 
documents and information underpinning their assessment.
In conclusion, after reviewing the reports from management and 
consulting where necessary with the external auditors, the 
Committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately 
address the critical judgements and key estimates both in respect 
of the amounts reported and the disclosures. The Committee is 
also satisfied that the processes used for determining the value of 
the assets and liabilities have been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and are fairly stated.
Going Concern and Viability Statements
As requested by the Board, the Committee reviewed the Going 
Concern and Viability Statements prepared with the assistance of 
management, together with the supporting documentation, as 
described on pages 75 and 37 , respectively. Following its review, 
the Committee recommended the approval of both statements 
to the Board.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
55 Fair, balanced and understandable
It is the Board’s responsibility to determine whether the 2016 
Annual Report & Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable. 
The Committee reviewed the process for preparing the 2016 
Annual Report & Accounts, reviewed management’s analysis of 
the 2016 Annual Report & Accounts and how this met the 
objectives of providing fair, balanced and understandable 
disclosures, before forming the conclusion to recommend the 
2016 Annual Report & Accounts be approved by the Board as fair, 
balanced and understandable. The Committee’s role in that 
process is covered on page 46.
Internal controls and risk management
The Audit Committee supports the Board’s assessment of 
principal risks and the Board’s review of the Group’s internal 
financial controls, as well as the internal controls and risk 
management processes.
Internal Audit 
The Committee acknowledges the importance of an effective 
Internal Audit function and commissioned RSM to undertake a 
“health-check” of the Group’s current Internal Audit arrangements 
and the wider control environment. That report concluded that the 
Group had established a strong culture and control discipline and 
that the internal control framework operated effectively and was 
broadly similar to internal control frameworks operating within 
other comparable listed organisations. Nonetheless, opportunities 
for further improvement were identified, including the greater 
formalisation of the Group’s risk management framework and 
establishing a reporting programme to the Audit Committee, which 
have been addressed by management in the year. The report also 
recommended the creation of an outsourced Internal Audit 
function. During the year, following on from the “health-check” of 
Internal Audit arrangements and the wider control environment, 
the Group outsourced the Internal Audit function to RSM, who 
perform a rolling programme of audits considering the design 
and operation of key controls within operational, accounting and 
IT processes.
The external audit and review of its 
effectiveness
The Committee advises the Board on the appointment/re-
appointment of the external auditors and their effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity, and discusses the nature and 
results of the audit with the external auditors. As part of the 
review of the effectiveness of the external audit process, a formal 
evaluation process incorporating views from the Committee 
and relevant members of management was considered by 
the Committee. 
These reviews included:
 n the effectiveness of the external audit firm;
 n quality controls;
 n the audit team;
 n audit fee;
 n audit communications and effectiveness;
 n governance and independence;
 n ethical standards; and
 n potential impairment of independence by non-audit fee income.
The Committee has written Terms of Reference, which have 
been published on the Company’s corporate website at 
www.ibstockplc.com/investors. In addition, the Committee has 
formalised an annual plan to address the key areas for review, 
the reports from which will highlight to the Board any required 
developments in its risk management systems.
In addition to the review of the formal management letter from the 
external auditors which outlines how points raised by them have 
been addressed by management, feedback is sought from the 
external auditors on the conduct of members of the finance team 
during the audit process. In addition, I have met with the lead audit 
partner outside the formal Committee process. 
The external auditors are responsible for the annual statutory 
audits of the Group’s subsidiaries and other services which the 
Committee believe they are best placed to provide.
The Committee also considers the effectiveness of management 
in the external audit process in respect of the timely identification 
and resolution of areas of accounting judgement with input from 
the external auditors as appropriate; and the timely provision of 
the draft half year results announcement and Annual Report & 
Accounts for review by the auditors and the Committee.
Having undertaken its review, the Committee is satisfied that the 
external auditor has been independent and effective.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Audit tender
Following the sale by CRH plc in 2015, the Group retained the 
existing external auditors, who had been auditors for the preceding 
23 years. Consistent with best practice, the Committee conducted 
a competitive tender process for the appointment of the Group’s 
external auditors during the autumn. 
In September 2016, the Group decided to review its audit 
arrangements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and initiated 
a competitive tender process. Management invited four audit firms 
to take part in the process, including EY. “Carousel” days were 
held, at which each firm met with several members of management, 
including the CFO and senior financial management from across 
the Group. Formal proposal documents were submitted by the 
firms. Each firm gave a presentation to a panel led by the Audit 
Committee Chairman. 
Following the detailed and thorough process, the Committee 
decided to recommend to the Board that Deloitte LLP be 
appointed as the Group’s auditors, to audit the financial statements 
for the year commencing 1 January 2017 . 
A resolution proposing the appointment of Deloitte LLP will be put 
to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
24 May 2017 . The Committee and the Board would like to thank 
EY for their high professional standards and all they have done to 
provide assurance to the Board and shareholders during their 
time as the Group’s auditors. 
Audit fee and non-audit services
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor are set in Note 6 
to the Group consolidated financial statements. During the year EY 
has provided tax compliance services in respect of the US 
business. With this exception, and in line with good practice, EY 
does not provide taxation services for the Group. Such services 
are currently provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and RSM 
US LLP . During the year EY were commissioned to provide a 
report to the Board on Cyber Security risk. 
The non-audit services policy sets out clearly the non-audit 
services that may be provided by the external auditor. Under the 
policy, prior approval is required by the Committee for any 
non-statutory assignments where the fee would exceed £10,000, 
or where such an assignment would take the cumulative total of 
non-audit fees paid to the external auditors over 70% of that year’s 
statutory audit fees. However, when appropriate, a detailed 
calculation will be performed to ensure that the Group is compliant 
with the European Union’s New Statutory Audit Framework, which 
applies to our 2017 financial year. 
Fraud, whistleblowing and the Bribery Act
The Committee monitors any reported incidents under its 
whistleblowing policy. This policy is included in the Employee 
Handbook and sets out the procedure for employees to raise 
legitimate concerns about any wrongdoing in financial reporting 
or other matters such as:
 n potentially unlawful acts;
 n miscarriage of justice;
 n danger to the health and safety of any individual;
 n damage to the environment; or
 n improper conduct.
There were no concerns notified to the Group that required the 
attention of the Committee during the period under review and up 
to the date of this report. The Committee also reviews the Group’s 
procedure for detecting fraud and the systems and controls in 
place to prevent a breach of anti-bribery legislation. The Group is 
committed to a zero-tolerance position with regard to bribery. 
Anti-bribery guidance and training is provided to certain employees 
applying what the Group has determined to be a risk-based and 
proportionate approach. The Group maintains a record of all 
employees who have received this guidance and training.
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee was reviewed by both the 
Board and the Committee, in compliance with the Governance 
Code. The evaluation was conducted by external facilitators, 
EquityCommunications Limited, in the late autumn of 2016 and 
took the form of a questionnaire completed by all members of the 
Board and the Company Secretary. A report on the outcome of 
the evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness was prepared by 
EquityCommunications Limited and presented to the Board. The 
conclusion drawn from the review was that the Committee 
operates effectively. 
The Committee considers that it has acted in accordance with its 
Terms of Reference and has ensured the independence, objectivity 
and effectiveness of the external and internal auditors. 
The Company has complied for the year, and up to the date of this 
report, with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014.

57 Remuneration Committee 
Chair’s Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder,
As the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2016.
Throughout the year the Group has continued to develop following 
our IPO in 2015, despite the uncertainty arising from events such 
as Brexit and the US Presidential Election. Even though the year 
has been marked by unpredictable market conditions, the Group 
has made good headway in 2016. Turnover has increased by 5% 
to £435 million and adjusted EBITDA increased to £1 12 million 
(2015: £107 million). In the UK we experienced a slow-down in 
sales in the weeks leading up to the EU Referendum, but shortly 
after the result was announced sales volumes in all UK businesses 
were comparable to, and eventually exceeded, the prior year. 
The UK housing developer market in the UK grew during 2016, 
however the de-stocking by builders merchants meant that this did 
not flow through to increased brick sales volumes in the first half 
year. As merchants’ stock returned to more normal levels, brick 
sales increased in the second half year, resulting in a full year result 
slightly ahead of 2015. The concrete businesses experienced 
volumes and pricing ahead of those experienced in the prior year. 
Supreme was aided by healthy demand for its products in RMI and 
domestic landscaping, whilst Forticrete benefitted from continued 
growth in the new build housing sector. Glen-Gery, in the US, 
delivered another year of progress.
Against this backdrop, the Committee is keenly aware of the 
sensitivity of the public and shareholders regarding executive 
remuneration. In such an environment the Committee’s focus is 
therefore to ensure that our Remuneration Policy supports the 
Group’s goals to extend its position in the building products 
industry, to ensure that remuneration remains linked to Company 
performance and to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the Policy on an ongoing 
basis and is comfortable that it remains appropriate as the 
structure by which to incentivise and motivate the leadership team 
to implement the Company’s strategic goals and ensure they are 
aligned with shareholder expectations heading into the 2017 
financial year.
Wayne Sheppard, who had been a member of the Committee 
since Admission, stood down from the Committee on 24 February 
2016, following the appointment of Lynn Minella and Tracey Graham.
Company highlights for the 2016 financial 
period 
Financial highlights for the year include:
 n Group revenue – £435 million;
 n Profit before tax – £1 1 1 million; and
 n Adjusted EBITDA – £1 12 million;
reflecting the underlying strength of the business. 
Operational highlights include: 
 n UK Concrete products have performed well;
 n Sales price increases were secured in our key US sales 
channels; and
 n Major capital projects progressing well and to schedule.
In addition to our operational highlights, following a full consultation 
with affected members, the Ibstock Defined Benefit Pension 
Scheme closed to future accruals from 31 January 2017 .
Further details of performance against the Company’s key 
performance indicators are detailed on pages 18 and 19 and 
the Financial Review on pages 28 to 31.

on the Group’s financial performance, 20% on strategic measures 
and 20% on individual objectives reflect the overall Group 
performance this year and paid out at 64%-66% of target levels 
(32%-33%) of maximum opportunity). Further details of the annual 
bonus targets for the year and performance against those targets 
are provided on page 63.
Remuneration Committee decisions made 
during 2016
The Company’s remuneration strategy is designed to motivate our 
senior leaders to deliver the Company’s strategic objectives, 
ensure customer focus based on quality and consistency and drive 
long-term value for our shareholders. These core elements are 
captured in our incentive framework for the Executive Directors. 
Further details of how our incentives and their measures align to 
the Company’s key strategic objectives is found on page 60.
The Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2016 AGM on 
26 May 2016 and the Committee believe that it supports Ibstock’s 
business and remuneration strategy. No changes have been made 
to the Policy or its proposed operation for next year.
Key decisions made by the Committee during, and for, the financial 
year include:
 n The Committee considered the base salaries for the Executive 
Directors and awarded 2.2% increases to Wayne Sheppard and 
Kevin Sims, in line with the increase provided to the employee 
population.
 n The decision that Wayne Sheppard and Kevin Sims should 
receive an annual performance bonus in respect of 2016 equal 
to 41% and 40% of base salary respectively reflects 
performance against the measures for the year.
 n 2016 LTIP awards for Wayne Sheppard and Kevin Sims of 100% 
of salary. The grant levels and performance targets for the LTIP 
are consistent with the normal award policy – further details of 
the awards are provided on page 64. There was no LTIP vesting 
this year as the first awards under the plan were made in 2016. 
 n Reviewed the proposed changes to the Ibstock Defined Benefit 
Pension Scheme, as highlighted on page 58.
 n Established Long-Term Incentive Plan targets for 2016: 50% EPS 
growth and 50% on relative TSR (see page 64).
Further details on how our Remuneration Policy will be applied in 
practice for the 2017 financial year are set out on page 69.
From 1 January 2017 , we welcomed Justin Read onto the 
Remuneration Committee. Justin brings a wealth of experience, 
including from roles held at Segro and Speedy Hire that will be of 
great benefit to Ibstock as we continue to develop our business.
Shareholder engagement
The Remuneration Policy received strong support from our 
shareholders resulting in 99.36% vote in favour at our Annual 
General Meeting on 26 May 2016. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration received a 99.99% support from the shareholders. 
We will continue to engage with our shareholders in a two-way 
communication process to maintain this support and to ensure we 
have a transparent executive reward structure aligned to 
shareholder experience. If you would like to discuss any further 
aspect of our remuneration strategy I would welcome your views.

Introduction
In this section, we:
1 – set out the purpose of our Remuneration Policy and its linkage 
to our corporate strategic objectives; and
2 – set out the remuneration outcomes for the 2016 financial year.
Our Remuneration Policy and its link to our 
Group strategy
The Group’s strategy is laid out on pages 1 1 to 17 . 
Ensuring the alignment of the proposed Remuneration Policy to 
the Company strategy was key for the Remuneration Committee in 
developing the proposed Policy below in conjunction with our core 
principles of remuneration. 
Strategic priorities
Remuneration Policy
Continuing to focus on a safe 
working environment that has the 
development of employees and 
customer service at its core
Invest in new capacity and 
optimise output to take advantage 
of structural imbalances in the 
Group’s market
Penetrate markets further 
through innovation
Equity 
ownership 
and 
retention 
of shares
Retain and 
reward the 
Executive 
team to 
deliver the 
strategy
Annual bonus metrics
The maximum bonus 
(including any part of the 
bonus deferred into an 
Annual Deferred Bonus 
Plan (“ADBP”) Award) 
deliverable under the 
ADBP will not exceed 
125% of a participant’s 
annual base salary.
Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) 
and Lost Time Accidents 
(“LTA”)
These measures target 
customer satisfaction and 
health and safety in the 
workplace and therefore 
support this objective.
Return on Capital Employed 
(“ROCE”), Adjusted EBITDA, 
Adjusted Cash Flow
The success in maximising 
operational excellence will be 
reflected through increased 
profitability and cash flow and the 
efficiency of any investment made 
through ROCE measurement.
ROCE, Adjusted EBITDA, 
Adjusted Cash Flow, NPS
The efficient development of 
innovative products measured 
through ROCE and NPS 
performance will be reflected 
in increased profitability and 
cash flow.
LTIP metrics
Maximum annual award is 
normally 100% of salary.
Awards will vest at the 
end of three years. 
For 2017 , the performance 
conditions for awards are 
equally weighted between:
 n Adjusted Earnings per 
Share growth; and
 n comparative Total 
Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”).
Adjusted Earnings per Share 
(“Adjusted EPS”), Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”)
The success in maximising 
operational excellence will be 
measured through the long-term 
Adjusted EPS growth targeted by 
the L TIP . In addition, sustained 
value generation will be reflected 
in the share price of the Company 
which will be measured through 
the Company’s TSR performance 
under the L TIP .
TSR
The generation of cash and 
profit growth targeted by the 
annual bonus will help enhance 
the value of the Company which 
will be measured through the 
success of the Company’s TSR 
performance against its 
comparators (a performance 
condition under the LTIP).
Share Incentive Plan 
(“SIP”)
The Sharesave Plan
Minimum shareholding 
requirements
 n Chief Executive Officer 
200% of salary.
 n Chief Financial Officer 
150% of salary.
Our core principles of remuneration
 n To ensure senior executives are attracted, retained and 
motivated to drive the strategic development of the Company; 
 n To incentivise the management team in extending the 
Company’s position in the building products industry; and
 n To deliver long-term sustainable growth.
The key elements of the Company’s strategy and how its 
successful implementation is linked to the Company’s 
remuneration are set out in the following table.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2016 financial period 
Annual bonus outcomes
Our 2016 bonus outcomes outlined below reflect the performance measures and targets put in place during our 2016 financial period and 
their level of satisfaction. The bonus measures for the Executive Directors are aligned to the Company’s KPIs (which are outlined on pages 
18 and 19).
Bonus value achieved
2016 bonus measures Wayne Sheppard Kevin Sims
Adjusted EBITDA (20%), Adjusted Operating Cash Flow (20%), ROCE (20%), Net Promoter Score (10%), 
Lost Time Accidents (10%), Personal Objectives (20%)
£174,300 £115,309
The Company achieved between the threshold and target performance level set for adjusted EBITDA and ROCE metrics, but was below 
threshold for adjusted operating cash flow target. Group non-financial measures performance was below threshold for Net Promoter 
Score and on target for Lost Time Accidents. 
The total payout was 64%-66% of the target bonus (32%-33% of maximum bonus opportunity of 125% of salary for the two Executive 
Directors). Two thirds of the 2016 bonus was paid in cash and one third was deferred into shares for a period of three years.
Further detail of the bonus outcomes can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 63.
Single figure remuneration for our Executive Directors
We set out below the single figure remuneration for the two Executive Directors:
Executive Directors 2015 total 2016 total
Wayne Sheppard (CEO) £773,309 £788,685
Kevin Sims (CFO) £495,520 £509,544
The base salaries for the 2015 single figure was a combination of the pre- and post-IPO salaries paid to the Executive Directors which are 
lower than the 2016 salaries which was for the full year of Ibstock as a listed Company. This offsets some of the difference in the annual 
bonus payout.
The single figure table containing information for the 2015 and 2016 financial year for the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors 
are set out in detail on pages 62 and 65 respectively.
Equity exposure of the Executive Directors 
Both Executive Directors have shareholdings substantially in excess of the Company’s minimum shareholding requirements which are 
currently 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% for the Chief Financial Officer.
The following chart sets out all subsisting interests in the equity of the Company held by the Executive Directors at 31 December 2016.

1 – Share price on the date of grant was £1.954.
The awards were granted as nil-cost share options and vesting will be subject to achieving a challenging sliding scale of adjusted EPS and 
relative TSR against the FTSE 250 (excluding real estate and investment trusts) over a three-year performance period. The performance 
schedule for these measures is as follows:
Measure Weighting Threshold Maximum
Relative TSR 50% Median Upper quartile
EPS growth 50% 6% per annum 16% per annum
Relative TSR will be measured from the date of grant over a three year period (with one month averaging of TSR derive the start and the 
end values for the calculation). EPS growth will be measured over three consecutive financial years with the base point for the 2017 award 
derived from the EPS as at 31 December 2016.
2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan outcomes
The first grant of LTIP awards was made under the plan in 2016. These awards will vest in 2019.

no fees for these appointments. Kevin Sims does not hold any external directorships.
Comparison of overall performance and pay
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s shares since listing compared with the FTSE 250 index. The graph 
shows the Total Shareholder Return generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of 
dividend income. 
The Committee considers that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this index since 
listing. This graph has been calculated in accordance with the Regulations. It should be noted that the Company listed on 27 October 
2015 and therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 27 October 2015 to 31 December 2016.

Statement of considerations of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Policy for all employees is determined in terms of best practice and ensuring that the Company is able to attract and 
retain the best people. This principle is followed in the development of our Policy. 
The remuneration strategy of the Company has been designed to ensure all employees share in its success through performance-related 
remuneration and share ownership Awards under both the Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan will provide 
alignment between senior leaders and our shareholders based on overall corporate performance of the business. 
For all UK employees, the Company has adopted an SAYE Scheme and Share Incentive Plan (with local equivalents in other jurisdictions 
intended). Under the new Plans, all employees will have the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company subject to certain restrictions. 
The following table demonstrates how key objectives are reflected consistently in plans operating at all levels within the Company.

The Company currently does not use remuneration comparison measurements, nor has it consulted employees directly on the 
Remuneration Policy. However, in setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of the 
Company are taken into account to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company, including data on the remuneration 
structure for management level tiers below the Executive Directors, average base salary increases awarded to the overall employee 
population and the cascade of pay structures throughout the business.
As a Remuneration Committee, we are keenly aware of the sensitivity of shareholders and the wider public regarding remuneration, 
including the Government’s ongoing considerations for reforms to the governance framework in respect of executive pay. The Committee 
will continue to monitor developments closely and will comply with best practice reporting requirements as they come into force.

purposes in the table above, the Company has annualised the 2015 base salary as a plc Executive Director and compared this to the 2016 base salary. The salary paid to the 
Chief Executive Officer in 2015 was £330,730 which covers the period pre- and post-IPO. A comparison on this basis equates to a 29% rise in salary from 2015 to 2016.
2 – To aid the comparison, the total benefits paid to the Chief Executive Officer in 2015 has been annualised. The 2015 benefits value was £13,536 and the 2016 value was 
£15,829. The percentage change predominately reflects the move from a company car to a company car allowance made during the year by the Executive Directors.

67 Statement of consideration of shareholder views and voting at general meeting 
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping Remuneration Policy 
and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting the remuneration strategy and the Committee commits 
to consulting with key shareholders prior to any significant changes to its Remuneration Policy.
The Committee consulted with the Company’s key shareholders along with the Investment Association (“IA”) and the Institutional 
Shareholder Services (“ISS”) on the Policy summarised in this report. 
The first AGM took place on 26 May 2016, where the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy was put to a binding vote from our 
shareholders, and the Annual Report on Remuneration was put to an advisory vote. The voting outcomes are set out in the table below.
2016 AGM resolution Votes for % of votes cast Votes against % of votes cast

Annual Report on Remuneration 375,925,993 99.99% 27,541 0.01% 375,953,534 652,857
On the basis of this strong support from shareholders the Committee does not intend to make any changes to the Policy or its 
implementation for 2017 . The details for the 2017 financial year are outlined on page 69.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the Remuneration Policy and for 
determining specific packages for the Executive Directors and other selected members of the senior management team. Prior to the 
establishment of the Remuneration Committee, remuneration decisions were made by the Board of the Company. The Company 
consults with key shareholders in respect of Remuneration Policy and the introduction of new incentive arrangements. 
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website, www.ibstockplc.com/investors, and from the 
Company Secretary at the registered office. 
Our main responsibilities are: 
 n To determine and agree with the Board the broad Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors and other selected members of the 
senior management team;
 n To review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the Remuneration Policy; and
 n To review any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company or Group and to administer all aspects of any 
share scheme.
The Committee receives assistance from the Group HR Director and Company Secretary, who will attend meetings by invitation, except 
when issues relating to their own remuneration are being discussed. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer attend by 
invitation on occasions. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee 
The Committee retained the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as independent remuneration adviser. During the financial 
year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and members of the Executive team. 
PwC also provided the Company with tax and accountancy advice during the period. The Committee is satisfied that no conflict of 
interest exists or existed in the provision of these services.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective 
and independent advice is given to remuneration committees. Fixed fees of £58,000 (2015: £12,000) were provided to PwC during the 
period in respect of remuneration advice received.

69 Summary Remuneration Policy table
A summary of the approved Remuneration Policy is outlined below. There were no changes to the approved Policy made in 2016. 
The full Policy as approved by shareholders on 26 May 2016 is available on our website at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.
Element of remuneration Operation
Base salary The Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with companies of a similar size to Ibstock 
in the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services, real estate and equity investment trusts), validated against companies 
operating in a similar sector.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
 n remuneration practices within the Group;
 n the general performance of the Group;
 n salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group used for remuneration benchmarking;
 n any change in scope, role and responsibilities; and
 n the economic environment.
An Executive Director’s base salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually or when there is a change in position 
or responsibility.
In general, salary increases for Executive Directors will be in line with the increase for employees.
Benefits The Executive Directors receive a company car or car allowance, private health cover, death in service cover and 
income protection.
Additional benefits may be offered such as relocation allowances on recruitment. 
The maximum will be set at the cost of providing the benefits described.
Pension The maximum contribution into the defined contribution plan or a salary supplement in lieu of pension will be 20% of 
gross basic salary.
Annual and Deferred Bonus 
Plan (“ADBP”)
The Remuneration Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual Bonus Plan for each 
year, which will not exceed 125% of salary.
The maximum value of deferred shares is 50% of the bonus earned, which vest after a minimum deferral period of 
three years based on continued employment.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
LTIP maximum grant is 100% of salary p.a. (150% in exceptional circumstances).
The Committee considers and sets the performance measures and targets for each LTIP award. See page 64 for the 
details of the 2017 LTIP grant.
The LTIP contains clawback and malus provisions.
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) 
and The Sharesave Plan
The Company operates a SIP and Sharesave Plan in which the Executive Directors are eligible to participate (which is 
in line with HMRC legislation and is open to all eligible staff) to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the 
Company and thereby align their interests with shareholders.
Minimum shareholding 
requirement
The Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines that will encourage the Executive Directors to build up 
over a five-year period and then subsequently hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary. 
Adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued participation in the equity incentive arrangements. This 
policy ensures that the interests of Executive Directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned. 
 n Group Chief Executive Officer: 200% of salary.
 n Group Chief Financial Officer: 150% of salary.
Non-Executive Director and 
Chairman fees
The fees for Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman are set at broadly the median of the comparator group.
Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual fee and additional fees for chairmanship of committees. The Chairman 
does not receive any additional fees for membership of committees.
In general the level of fee increase for the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman will be set taking account of any 
change in responsibility and will take into account the general rise in salaries across the UK workforce.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Non-Executive Directors and Chairman and may settle 
any tax incurred in relation to these.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Malus and clawback
The ADBP and the LTIP include best practice malus and clawback provisions.
Annual bonus Deferred bonus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Malus Up to the date of payment of a cash bonus To the end of the three year deferral period To the end of the three year vesting period
Clawback Three years post the bonus determination n/a Two years post-vesting
The Committee believes that the rules of the plans provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback where required.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report.
The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set 
out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it 
would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
It is the Committee’s intention that commitments made in line with its policies prior to Admission will be honoured, even if satisfaction of 
such commitments is made post the Company’s first AGM following Admission and may be inconsistent with policy. 
Illustrations of the application of the Remuneration Policy
The charts below illustrate the total remuneration that would be paid to each of the Executive Directors, based on salaries at the start of 
the 2017 financial year, under three different performance scenarios: (i) minimum; (ii) on-target; and (iii) maximum. They also show the 
actual single figure of remuneration for the Executive Directors for the 2016 financial year. 
The table overleaf sets out the assumptions used to calculate the elements of remuneration for each of these scenarios. The elements 
of remuneration have been categorised into three components: (i) fixed; (ii) annual bonus (deferred bonus); and (iii) LTIP .

Pay at risk 
The charts below set out the single figure of each Executive Director based on whether the elements remain “at risk”. For example:
 n payment is subject to continuing employment for a period (deferred shares and LTIP awards);
 n performance conditions have still to be satisfied (LTIP awards); or
 n elements are subject to clawback or malus for a period, over which the Company can recover sums paid or withhold vesting.
Figures have been calculated based on on-target performance (fixed elements plus 50% of maximum annual bonus and 50% of the 
maximum LTIP). The charts have been based on the same assumptions as set out above for the illustrations of the application of the 
Remuneration Policy.

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement that 
had the greatest effect on our 
overall audit strategy and the 
allocation of resources in the audit 
 n Revenue recognition and 
particularly accounting for 
customer rebates
 n Determination of pension 
liabilities
Audit scope n We performed a full scope audit 
of the complete financial 
information of all four trading 
components and the head 
office entities.
 n The full scope audit procedures 
accounted for 100% of each of 
Revenue, Profit before tax and 
Total assets.
Materiality n Group materiality was £3.6m 
(2015: £2.0m) which represents 
approximately 5% of profit before 
tax before exceptional items 
(2015: 2% of Earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation before exceptional 
items).
Our assessment of risk of material 
misstatement 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below 
as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the 
efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we performed 
the procedures below which were designed in the context of the 
financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not 
express any opinion on these individual areas.
These risks are consistent with those identified and reported in 
2015 with the exception that we have removed the risk in relation to 
acquisition accounting which is no longer relevant for the current 
year. As described in Note 1 to the Annual Report and Accounts, 
during 2016 a prior year error was identified in relation to deferred 
tax in respect of mineral land held by the group due to the incorrect 
determination of the associated tax base at acquisition on 
26 February 2015. No further adjustments have been made or 
identified in respect of the acquisition accounting. 
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Ibstock plc

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition 
(£434.7m (2015: £358.3m) 
stated net of rebates for the 
period) and accounting for 
customer rebates
Refer to the Audit Committee 
Report (page 55); Accounting 
policies (from page 89); and 
Note 4 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 98).
Revenue recognition is a 
significant audit risk across all 
trading entities within the group. 
Specifically there is a risk of 
inappropriate revenue 
recognition if revenue is 
recorded within the wrong 
accounting period, if bill and 
hold transactions (Glen-Gery 
only) are recognised 
prematurely or if customer 
rebates are incorrectly recorded.
We identified and assessed key controls over the revenue process (i.e., that 
deliveries are recorded as revenue which are then collected into cash) for 
Ibstock Brick and Forticrete. We relied on these controls in our audit 
approach. We walked through the controls at Supreme and Glen-Gery to 
confirm the design although we undertook a substantive audit of the 
revenue process.
We used data analytics at the Ibstock Brick, Supreme and Forticrete 
components to capture 100% of the revenue transaction flows and 
analysed the relationship between revenue, debtors and cash.
We substantively tested revenue throughout the period by selecting a 
sample of transactions, including bill and hold transactions at Glen-Gery 
to ensure they met the IFRS revenue recognition criteria, and traced them 
to source documentation to ensure they were appropriately recorded.
We inspected revenue transactions around the period end and tested 
a sample of these to ensure they were recorded in the correct period.
We selected a sample of customer rebate contracts for significant 
customers, inspected the terms, confirmed the sales data on which the 
rebate is based and recalculated the rebate to ensure the amounts 
deducted from revenue were appropriate. 
For a sample of customers we validated, through third party confirmation 
procedures, that the terms on which the rebate calculations were based 
were complete and accurate.
We performed hindsight analysis over the accuracy of prior period rebate 
balances by assessing the cash paid after prior year end and compared 
this to the related accrual. 
To assess the completeness of rebates, we considered aged debtors, post 
period end credit notes and reviewed journal postings recorded for 
evidence of any unrecorded rebate amounts. We also made enquiries of 
management as to the existence of any other rebate arrangements.
We used computer aided audit techniques to assess journals for the 
period to identify for any manual journals resulting in an inappropriate 
posting to revenue. 
We reviewed significant manual journals for movements in revenue and 
rebates around the period end.
Our audit procedures did not identify 
any material differences regarding 
revenue recognition or the accounting 
for rebates.
Our journals testing did not identify any 
manual adjustments to revenue or 
inappropriate adjustments to rebates. 
Determination of pension 
liabilities £698.0m (2015: 
£550.5m)
Refer to the Audit Committee 
Report (page 55); Accounting 
policies (from page 89); and 
Note 21 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 114).
As at the year end, the Ibstock 
Defined Benefit Pension 
Scheme (as defined in Note 21) 
had a net deficit of £28.7m 
(2015: restricted surplus of 
£0.3m) with assets of £683.6m 
(2015: £558.9m) and liabilities of 
£698.0m (2015: £550.5m). The 
determination of the liability 
component is sensitive to small 
movements in the input 
assumptions which could 
materially change the valuation. 
We evaluated the output of the actuary used by management by giving 
due consideration to their competence, experience and independence. 
We involved our pension specialists to assist us in evaluating the validity of 
the input assumptions including in respect of the discount rate, inflation 
rate, cash commutation and mortality assumptions. The methodology to 
determine the assumption has been assessed for appropriateness. The 
assumptions have also been assessed with respect to available market 
data and consistency with actuarial practice, scheme profile and market 
developments. 
We assessed the pension curtailment gain recognised in the current year 
to ensure it had been calculated using an appropriate methodology and 
inputs. We assessed the magnitude and nature of the curtailment gain to 
evaluate whether the disclosure as exceptional is appropriate. 
We checked a sample of participant data to underlying information sources 
such as the payroll system.
We tested the calculation of the additional liability resulting from the 
application of IFRIC 14 and considering committed minimum funding 
requirements, as prepared by the actuary (management’s expert), by 
independently modelling the calculation including corroborating the 
data inputs.
The actuarial assumptions used in the 
IAS 19 valuation of the year end pension 
liabilities are considered to be within an 
acceptable range for a scheme with the 
characteristics of the Ibstock Defined 
Benefit Pension Scheme. 
The pension liability and curtailment gain 
have been appropriately disclosed in the 
financial statements.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
79 The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the group. Taken together, this enables us to 
form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take 
into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and 
effectiveness of group-wide controls and changes in the business 
environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at 
each entity.
The group operates from four trading entities, three in the UK and 
one in the US. In assessing the risk of material misstatement to 
the group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial 
statements, we performed an audit of the complete financial 
information (“full scope”) of the trading components Ibstock Brick, 
Forticrete, Supreme (all located in the UK) and Glen-Gery (located 
in the US). 
We also performed full scope procedures on the Figgs head office 
entities, comprising various holding companies in the group 
structure (together the “Figgs companies”). 
Our scoping approach is consistent with the prior year. All 
components were designated full scope and resulted in 100% 
coverage of the group’s Revenue, Profit before tax before 
exceptional items, Exceptional items and Total assets (2015: 100% 
coverage of the group’s Revenue, Profit before tax before 
exceptional items, Exceptional items and Total assets). 
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, 
or by component auditors from other EY global network firms 
operating under our instruction. Of the full scope components, 
audit procedures were performed on Ibstock Brick by the primary 
team and on Forticrete, Supreme and Glen-Gery by three 
component teams. We determined the appropriate level of primary 
team involvement in the work of the component team to enable us 
to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a 
basis for our opinion on the group as a whole.
The primary team interacted regularly with each of the component 
teams, where appropriate, during various stages of the audit, 
reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope 
and direction of the audit process. A team planning event was held 
at which senior audit team members of the primary team and 
component teams each attended to discuss the key risks and 
audit approach.
A senior member of the primary team attended the closing 
meeting of each of the component audits. 
These procedures, together with the additional procedures 
performed at group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the 
audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually 
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the group to be £3.6m (£2.0m), 
which is approximately 5% of Profit before tax before exceptional 
items (2015: 2% of Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation before exceptional items). Profit before tax before 
exceptional items for the year is £82. 1m as per the Income 
Statement in the consolidated financial statements. In the prior 
period Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
and before exceptional items was considered to be the key 
performance indicator of the group due to the focus of 
stakeholders during the IPO and the level of non-recurring 
transactions during the period. With one full year as a listed group 
a materiality based on the Profit before tax before exceptional 
items of the group is deemed more appropriate and is consistent 
with other listed companies. The increase in materiality is primarily 
due to the increase in Profit before tax before exceptional items. 
Starting basis
£1 10.9m profit before tax as per the  
Annual Report and Accounts
Adjustments
(£28.7m) adjusted for exceptional items as per note 5 of the  
Annual Report and Accounts
Materiality
£3.6m represents approximately 5% of the profit before tax  
before exceptional items
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and 
determined that there was no change in the final materiality from 
our original assessment at planning.
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Ibstock plc continued
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
80
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that performance materiality was set at 50% of our 
planning materiality, being £1.8m (2015: 50%, £1.0m). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our past audit. 
Our objective in adopting this approach was to ensure that the total 
uncorrected and undetected audit differences did not exceed our 
planning materiality of £3.6m for the financial statements as a whole.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance 
materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the group 
as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current period, performance materiality 
allocated to components was: 
£m 2016 2015
Ibstock Brick 1.50 0.90
Forticrete 0.50 0.30
Supreme 0.80 0.45
Glen-Gery 0.88 0.45
Figgs companies 0.35 0.20
The increase in allocation year on year is as a result of the higher 
performance materiality of £1.8m (2015: £1.0m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered 
as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £180,000 
(2015: £100,000), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 47 , the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 n the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 n based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements;
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

business model and strategy; and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
addresses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee that we 
consider should have been disclosed.
We have no exceptions 
to report.

reporting
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have identified no material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report or Directors’ Report.
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 n adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited

 n the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 n certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 n we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report.

reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add 
or to draw attention to in relation to:
 n the Directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report that they have carried out a

 n the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
 n the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; and
 n the Directors’ explanation in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies
Authorisation of financial statements
The Group consolidated financial statements of Ibstock plc, which 
has a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance 
with a resolution of the Directors on 7 March 2017 . The balance 
sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by W Sheppard and 
K Sims. 
Ibstock plc is a public company limited by shares, which is 
incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly 
traded. The registered office is Leicester Road, Ibstock, Leicestershire 
LE67 6HS and the company registration number is 09760850.
Basis of preparation
The Group consolidated financial statements of Ibstock plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2016 have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
On 26 February 2015, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Figgs Topco 
Limited acquired all of the shares of Ibstock Group Limited and 
Glen-Gery Corporation from CRH plc. Ibstock plc acquired Figgs 
Topco Limited and its subsidiaries in a share for share exchange 
prior to admission to public trading and as a result replaced Figgs 
Topco as the ultimate holding company in the Group structure, 
this resulted in no ultimate change in control of the acquired 
companies.
Under predecessor accounting, the results of Ibstock plc have 
been adjusted as if the entity had always been merged with Figgs 
Topco Limited, which was the holding company of other 
subsidiaries prior to the introduction of Ibstock plc into the Group 
structure as the ultimate holding company.
The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(“£’000”) except where otherwise indicated. The significant 
accounting policies are set out below.
Prior year restatement
Management has identified a misstatement related to the information 
presented in our 2015 Annual Report & Accounts, and has restated 
the comparative amounts for the prior period presented. The 
misstatement related to the non-recognition of a deferred taxation 
liability in respect of mineral land held by the Group due to the 
incorrect determination of the associated tax base.
The restatement results in the recognition of an additional deferred 
taxation liability of £8,453,000 at the date of acquisition (26 February 
2015) in the comparative period and a reduction to the negative 
goodwill of the same amount. In the comparative period, the taxation 
credit is increased by £846,000 and the deferred taxation balance has 
been restated to increase the liability by £7 ,607 ,00 to £63,497 ,000. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share are both reduced by 2.6 pence 
per share in the comparative period, although the previously reported 
adjusted EBITDA is unaffected by this restatement.
Basis of consolidation and acquisition accounting
The Group consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statements of Ibstock plc and its subsidiaries as at 
31 December 2016. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company, 
using consistent accounting policies. All intra-Group balances, 
transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting 
from intra-Group transactions have been eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group 
obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on 
which the Group no longer retains control. Details of all the 
subsidiaries of the Group are given in Note 30.
Its subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. 
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases. Therefore, the financial statements 
include the results of the operating companies which were 
acquired by Figgs Topco Limited on 26 February 2015 (see Note 
26), from that date.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for 
business combinations by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair value at acquisition date. The excess of the consideration 
transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recognised as goodwill. If the consideration transferred is less 
than the fair value of the net assets acquired, negative goodwill 
arises and is recognised directly in the income statement.
An estimation of the fair value is made for contingent consideration 
in accordance with IFRS 3 at the time of a business combination. 
Where there is a contractual obligation to settle the liability in cash 
based on events within the Company’s control this contingent 
consideration is accounted for as a credit to equity within other 
reserves and is not subsequently adjusted.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the business review on pages 26 to 27 . The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Director’s Report on 74 to 76. In 
addition, Note 23 to the financial statements include the 
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and has 
reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result, it believes 
its trading performance will demonstrate continued improvement in the 
coming periods, and that liquidity will remain strong.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
89 1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
The Board has reviewed the latest forecasts of the Group and 
considered the obligations of the financing arrangements. Given 
the continued strong liquidity of the Group, the Board has 
concluded that the going concern basis of accounting of its 
financial statements is appropriate.
In addition, see the Group’s Viability Statement set out on page 37 .
New standards, amendments and interpretations 
not yet adopted
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 1 during the 
current year. This has had no material impact on the financial 
restatement and related disclosures. 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 
2016, and have not been applied in preparing these Group 
consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to 
have a significant effect on the Group consolidated financial 
statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. 
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification 
and measurement of financial instruments, including impairment 
of financial assets and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 retains but 
simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three 
primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised 
cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and 
fair value through profit and loss (“P&L ”). The basis of classification 
of financial assets that are debt instruments depends on the 
entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity 
instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit 
or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes 
in fair value in OCI with no subsequent reclassification of 
cumulative gains and losses to profit or loss. There is now a new 
expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss 
impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were 
no changes to classification and measurement except for the 
recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive 
income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. 
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by 
replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an 
economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging 
instrument and for the “hedged ratio” to be the same as the one 
management actually use for risk management purposes. 
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different 
to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective 
for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
Early adoption is permitted. The Group is assessing the impact 
of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with 
revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised 
when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus 
has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the 
good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 
1 1 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The 
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted. The Group 
has completed an assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 and 
determined that the standard will have no material impact on 
the Group’s financial reporting.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both 
parties to a contract, i.e., the lessee and the lessor. IFRS 16 
requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease 
payments and a “right of use asset” for virtually all lease contracts. 
IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 2019. A company can choose 
to apply IFRS 16 before that date but only if it also applies IFRS 15 
Revenue from contracts with customers. The Group is in the 
process of assessing the impact of IFRS 16. The Group’s operating 
lease commitments are disclosed in Note 28.
There are no other IFRSs, Annual improvements or IFRIC 
interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to 
have a material impact on the Group and there are no current 
plans to early adopt any of the above-mentioned standards.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Finance Officer of the Group. The CODM reviews 
the key profit measure, “Adjusted EBITDA” disaggregated by UK 
and US based on geographical location and the organisational 
structure of the Group.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). 
The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in 
“Sterling” (“£”), which is the Group’s presentation currency.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations 
(i.e., subsidiaries with a functional currency that is not “Sterling”) 
are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
reporting date and their results are translated at the actual rates 
prevailing at the date of the transactions (or average rates, with a 
reasonable approximation) and the effect of fair value adjustment 
on the assets and liabilities are treated as part of the assets and 
liabilities of a foreign operation. The currency translation differences 
are recorded in the currency translation reserve within other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the currency 
translation reserve.
Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
90
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 (b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in 
other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and 
qualifying net investment hedges. The Group does not currently 
undertake such hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses that 
relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented 
in the income statement within net finance costs. All other foreign 
exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement. 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, except for borrowing 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended use, in which case they 
are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Capitalisation of 
borrowing costs commences when expenditures for the asset and 
borrowing costs are being incurred and the activities to prepare the 
asset for its intended use are in progress. Borrowing costs are 
capitalised up to the date when the project is completed and ready 
for its intended use.
There were no borrowing costs capitalised during the period.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at the cost to the Group 
less depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment 
includes directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is provided on the cost of all other assets (except 
assets in the course of construction and land), so as to write off the 
cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful economic life of the assets concerned, as follows:
Asset classification  Useful life 
Land Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings  20 – 50 years  
Plant, machinery and equipment 5 – 40 years 
Mineral reserves  Amortised on a usage basis
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for mineral 
deposits with economic potential and is not capitalised. Evaluation 
expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other 
projects that have been identified as having economic potential and 
in obtaining permissions to extract clay. Capitalisation of evaluation 
expenditure within “Mineral reserves” commences when there is a 
high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project 
is commercially viable, i.e., the project will provide a satisfactory return 
relative to its perceived risks, and therefore it is considered probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Mineral reserves may be declared for an undeveloped project 
before its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation 
costs may continue to be capitalised during the period between 
declaration of reserves and approval to extract clay as further work 
is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise 
the project’s returns.
The carrying values of capitalised evaluation expenditure are 
reviewed for impairment by management. Mineral reserves are 
amortised on a usage basis.
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date and revised where expectations are significantly different from 
previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for 
current and future periods is adjusted accordingly.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets
Separately acquired brands and non-contractual customer 
relationships are shown at historical cost. Brands and customer 
relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method to allocate the cost of brands and customer 
relationships over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Asset classification Useful life 
Brands 10 – 50 years 
Customer relationships 10 – 20 years
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis 
of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific 
software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful 
lives of three to five years.
For further details see Note 12.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation such as 
brands and non-contractual customer relationships and property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows 
(cash-generating units). Prior impairments of non-financial assets 
(other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each 
reporting date.

91 1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its 
present location and condition. Raw materials, consumables and 
goods for resale are recognised on a weighted average cost basis, 
while work in progress and finished goods are held at direct cost 
and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: 
at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables. The 
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial 
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial 
assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the 
short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category 
are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 
12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater 
than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables 
comprise “trade and other receivables” and “cash and cash 
equivalents” in the balance sheet (Notes 15 and 16, respectively).
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on 
the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase 
or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus 
transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through 
profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction 
costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the 
investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group 
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently 
carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. No financial 
assets are held for trading other than derivatives.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for 
merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course 
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are 
classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be 
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal 
course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or 
bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or less and bank overdrafts (if any). In the consolidated 
balance sheets, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in 
current liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that 
have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if 
payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating 
cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as 
non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs incurred. All other costs are 
expensed as incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost; any difference between the fair value initially 
recognised and the redemption value is recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method. The effective interest method takes into account 
estimations of future cash flows associated with the instrument. 
Management are required to re-assess these estimates at each 
reporting date and where the expectations of the nature and 
timing of cash flows change a one-off adjustment is required to 
alter the carrying value of the instrument in accordance with 
those new expectations.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date.
Finance cost on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income 
statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred on the 
financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as 
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is 
Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
92
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no 
evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity 
services and amortised over the period of the facility to which 
it relates.
An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different terms 
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a 
substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability 
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Employee benefits
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including 
both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group 
has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the 
benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior 
periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a 
defined contribution plan.
Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension 
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually 
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service 
and compensation.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined 
benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of 
plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually 
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest 
rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to 
maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Where defined benefit schemes have a surplus, the surplus is 
recognised if future economic benefits are available to the entity in 
the form of a reduction in the future contributions or a right to 
refund. See below judgement regarding the application of IFRIC 14.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in 
the income statement in employee benefit expense, except where 
included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined 
benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current 
year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net 
interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets, taking account of any changes in the defined benefit asset/
liability during the period as a result of contributions and benefit 
payments. This cost is included in interest expense in the 
income statement.
When the benefits of a defined benefit plan are changed or when 
the plan is curtailed, the change in the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation arising that relates to the plan amendment or 
curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss on its 
occurrence. Before determining the past service cost (including 
curtailment gains or losses) or a gain or loss on settlement, the net 
defined benefit obligation (asset) is remeasured using the current 
fair value of plan assets and current actuarial assumptions 
(including current market interest rates and other current market 
prices) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan before the 
plan amendment, curtailment or settlement.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
At 31 December 2015, a reimbursement asset was recognised 
representing an indemnity receivable from the former parent 
undertaking which was directly contributed to the pension 
scheme. A related liability for any additional pension liabilities that 
may arise as a result of the equalisation of pension benefits has 
been recognised within post-employment benefit obligations 
(see Note 21). This asset was received in January 2016.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to 
publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been 
paid. The Group recognises contributions payable to defined 
contribution plans in exchange for employee services in employee 
benefit expense.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood 
that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is 
recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any 
one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the 
provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
The restoration provision is to fund future obligations at a number 
of sites that the Group is associated with and where the Group has 
any constructive obligation to restore once it has fully utilised the 
site. The restructuring provision covers current and former 
employees who have ceased working on grounds of ill health and 
is a liability payable to their normal retirement date. Other provisions 
relate to provisions for sites used for landfill and for onerous 
contracts to cover the exposure that the Group has for both current 
property leases where the rent being paid is significantly higher than 
the current market rents and also vacant properties. All of these 
provisions are discounted on an annual basis.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
93 1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued
Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease by lease 
basis and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely 
committed cash outflows.
Off-market rental provisions relate to leases acquired as part of 
business combinations.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable for 
goods and services supplied by the Group, exclusive of local sales 
tax and trade discounts and after eliminating sales within the 
Group. All of revenue is attributable to the principal activities of the 
Group being the manufacture and sale of concrete products, clay 
facing bricks and associated special shaped and fabricated 
clay products.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, which is usually 
on despatch of goods. For “bill and hold” sales, in which delivery 
is delayed at the buyer’s request but the buyer takes title and 
accepts billing, revenue is recognised when the buyer takes title, 
provided: (a) it is probable that delivery will be made, (b) the item is 
on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time 
the sale is recognised, (c) the buyer specifically acknowledges the 
deferred delivery instructions and (d) the usual payment terms 
apply. Revenue is not recognised when there is simply an intention 
to acquire or manufacture the goods in time for delivery.
Customer rebates
Provisions for rebates to customers are based upon the terms 
of individual contracts, generally coterminous with the Group’s 
financial year-end, and are recorded in the same period as the 
related sales as a deduction from revenue. The Group estimates 
the provision for customer rebates based on the terms of each 
agreement at the time the revenue is recognised.
Other income
Other income is attributable to rental income from properties, 
landfill and gas activity. Other expenses represents associated 
expenses. This is not deemed to be a principal activity of the 
Group.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, 
except that development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is carried forward when its future recoverability can 
reasonably be regarded as assured. Any expenditure carried 
forward is amortised in line with the expected future sales from the 
related project. Research and development costs capitalised are 
not material.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the 
income statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and the expected infrequency of the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance in the financial period, so as to assess better trends 
in financial performance. Further detail on exceptional items are 
given within Note 5.
The Directors believe that the adjusted EBITDA and earnings per 
share measures provide useful information for shareholders. These 
measures are consistent with how the underlying business 
performance is measured internally and adjusted EPS is the 
Group’s measure for calculating distributions to shareholders.
The adjustments made to profit in arriving at adjusted EBITDA 
are described and reconciled below the Statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income. Adjusted EPS is reconciled to statutory 
EPS measures in Note 1 1. Neither measure is defined under IFRSs 
and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported 
by other companies. 
It is not intended that either adjusted measure is a substitute for, 
or superior to, statutory measurements.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except for 
tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the 
taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions 
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be 
uncertain. The calculation of the tax charge therefore necessarily 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax liabilities 
are based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due 
and tax assets are recognised on the basis of probable future 
recoverability. This requires management to exercise judgement 
based on their interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of 
settlement of tax liabilities or recoverability of tax assets. To the 
extent that the final outcome differs from the estimates made, tax 
adjustments may be required which could have a material impact 
on the tax charge and profit for the period in which such 
determination is made. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts included 
in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not 
recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; 
deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
94
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 The amount of deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not subject to discounting.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which 
the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary 
differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint arrangements, except for deferred tax liabilities where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary 
differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the 
temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient 
taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities where these have been levied by the same tax authority 
on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities within 
the Group where there is an intention to settle the balances on a 
net basis.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Mandatorily redeemable 
preference shares are classified as liabilities. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Ibstock shareholders are recognised in 
the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved in general meeting, or when paid in the 
case of an interim dividend.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for 
sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition 
and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within 
one year from the date of classification. Such assets and disposal 
groups are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair 
value less the costs to sell. Non-current assets classified as held 
for sale (or that form part of a disposal group classified as held for 
sale) are not depreciated or amortised.
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (for example 
options or shares) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the equity 
instruments is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
instruments granted:
 n including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
 n excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales 
growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a 
specified time period); and
 n including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, 
the requirement for employees to save or hold shares for a 
specific period of time).
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates 
of the number of instruments that are expected to vest based on the 
non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. It recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. In addition, in 
some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of 
the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for 
the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between 
service commencement period and grant date.
For the equity-settled share based payment transactions, the fair 
value of the share instruments granted is derived from established 
option pricing models. Further details on share based payments 
are set out in Note 27 .
2. Critical accounting judgements 
and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements 
and estimates, actual outcomes could be different. The Group has 
identified the following critical accounting policies under which 
significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are made and 
where actual results may differ from these estimates under 
different assumptions and conditions and may materially affect 
financial results or the financial position reported in future periods.
Estimates
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed by 
management on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period 
affected. The areas involving significant risk resulting in a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are as follows:
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016
95 2. Critical accounting judgements 
and estimates continued
Residual values and asset lives
Management has applied judgement in selecting the depreciation 
rates applied to depreciate property, plant and equipment, to 
depreciate tangible fixed assets over their useful economic lives. 
Assessment of useful lives and residual values are performed 
annually, taking into account factors such as technological 
innovation, maintenance programmes, market information and 
management considerations. In assessing the residual values, the 
remaining life of the asset, its projected disposal value and future 
market conditions are taken into account. The carrying value of 
property, plant and equipment, and a table showing the useful 
economic lives of these assets is disclosed in Note 13.
Mineral reserves
Upon acquisition by Figgs Topco Limited on 26 February 2015, 
mineral reserves were recorded at their fair value. The determination 
of the mineral reserves requires significant judgements and estimates 
to be applied, and these are reviewed regularly and updated.
Factors such as the availability of geological and extraction data, 
material performance and both the assessment of compliance with, 
and likelihood of extensions to, planning permissions, all impact 
upon the determination of the Group’s estimates of its mineral 
reserves. Management’s valuations are based on the expected 
future usage of reserves using production data, information from 
in-house geologists and input from external consultants.
Mineral reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of 
the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the Group 
consolidated financial statements. Estimates of mineral reserves 
are also used to calculate depreciation charges for the Group’s 
mineral reserves. The impact of changes in minerals is dealt with 
prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the 
asset over the expected future production. See Note 13 for details 
of the carrying value of mineral reserves.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the 
amount has been reliably estimated. Where there are a number of similar 
obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
Provisions are established by the Group based on the management’s 
assessment of relevant information and advice available at the time of 
preparing the Group consolidated financial statements. Outcomes 
are uncertain and dependent on future events and are reviewed 
regularly. Where outcomes differ from management’s expectations, 
differences from the amount initially provided will impact profit or loss 
in the period the outcome is determined.
The Group’s provisions principally relate to obligations arising from 
PP&E dilapidation and restorations. Key estimates within these 
provisions relate to the estimation of costs and the timing of future 
financial outflows to settle these obligations. Further details of specific 
estimates used in arriving at these provisions are provided in Note 20.
Judgements
Judgements are made by management in the process of applying 
the Group‘s accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts.
Impairment of intangible and non-current assets
Determining whether intangible and other non-current assets are 
impaired requires judgement and estimation. The Group 
periodically reviews intangible and non-current assets, for possible 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in 
management’s judgement, that the carrying amount of an asset 
may not be recoverable. Such indicating events would include a 
significant planned restructuring, a major change in market 
conditions or technology, expectations of future operating losses, 
or negative cash flows.
The Group did not record any impairment charges during the 
period ended 31 December 2016 as management’s judgement, 
based on a rigorous assessment, was that there were no 
indicators of impairment.
A requirement for an impairment test also arises when a non-
current asset is classified as being held for sale, at which time it 
must be remeasured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair 
value less cost to sell. Management’s assessment was to retain 
all assets held for sale at their carrying value since this is exceeded 
by the fair value less costs to sell.
Non-GAAP items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial 
statements where management believes it is necessary to do so to 
provide further understanding of the financial performance of the 
Group. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in its assessment of 
performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the earnings before interest, 
taxation, depreciation and amortisation adjusted for exceptional 
items. A full reconciliation is included at the foot of the Group 
statement of comprehensive income within the financial statements.
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the 
income statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance in the period, so as to facilitate comparison with 
future periods and to assess trends in financial performance.
In the current year, management has made the judgement to 
remove the profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment from 
the category of exceptional items due to management’s identified 
programme of surplus asset disposals. The prior year loss on 
disposal of property, plant and equipment was classified as an 
exceptional item as it was outside of the disposal programme. 
Exceptional items are disclosed in Note 5. The reconciliation of 
prior year statutory reported results for the period ended 
31 December 2015 to the adjusted period referred to within this 
Annual Report & Accounts is included in Note 3.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Borrowing costs
During the period ended 31 December 2015, the Group raised significant funds during refinancing the Group’s debt. In establishing 
borrowing costs, using the effective interest rate method, management is required to exercise judgement over the period in which the debt 
will be utilised and repaid. Currently, management considers that debt will be held to maturity and transaction costs of raising debt are 
included in the effective interest rate over those periods. The amount of transaction costs included in debt are disclosed in Note 8.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group’s accounting policy for defined benefit pension schemes requires management to make judgements as to the nature of 
benefits provided by each scheme and thereby determine the classification of each scheme. For defined benefit schemes, management 
is required to make annual estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes of scheme assets, future remuneration changes, 
employee attrition rates, administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, life expectancy and expected remaining periods of 
service of employees. Management will reassess these assumptions going forward following the closure of the Scheme.
In relation to the Group’s post-employment obligations in the US, management make estimations relating to employee numbers, inflation 
rates, discount rates and future contribution rates. See Note 21(b) for further details. 
These assumptions are based on the environment in the respective country. The assumptions used may vary from year to year, which 
would affect future net income and net assets. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome also affect future net 
income and net assets. In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers, such 
as actuaries. These assumptions are subject to periodic review.
In accounting for defined benefit plans, management is required to make judgements in relation to the application of International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee guidance IFRIC 14 and its applicability to Ibstock plc. This judgement concerns the Group’s ability to 
recognise an actuarial surplus/notional surplus on the UK defined benefit pension scheme, should such a surplus/notional surplus arise in 
future. The Group has considered the application of this guidance, including proposed amendments to IFRIC 14 published as an exposure 
draft in June 2015. The Group has applied IFRIC 14 and recognised an additional liability of £14.2 million for minimum funding requirements. 
The Group has applied IFRIC 14 in preparing the Group consolidated financial statements, has reassessed these assumptions following the 
closure of the Scheme, and is keeping the position under review in the light of developments in the proposed amendments to IFRIC 14.
Additionally management has exercised judgement in the treatment of the multi-employer US pension as a defined contribution scheme. 
Note 21 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
3. Reconciliation of statutory result to adjusted result for the year ended 31 December 2015
The Group acquired the trading entities of Ibstock Building Products Limited in the UK and Glen-Gery Corporation in the US, and their 
respective subsidiaries on 26 February 2015, hence only 10 months of trading performance is included within the statutory results for the 
period ended 31 December 2015. Due to the unusual nature of this comparative financial information within the statutory results, 
management has provided adjusted results for the period assuming the acquisition had arisen on 1 January 2015. Management believes 
this provides shareholders with clearer information on the results of the operating entities’ relative performance in 2015. A reconciliation to 
the statutory information for the period ended 31 December 2015 is shown in the table, below.

97 4. Segment reporting
As explained in Note 1, the management team considers the reportable segments to be the UK and the US. The key Group performance 
measure is Adjusted EBITDA, as detailed below, which is profit before net finance cost, tax, exceptional items, depreciation and 
amortisation and other non-underlying items. Transactions between segments are carried out at arms’ length. No aggregation of 
segments has been applied.

2016
Included within the current year are the following exceptional items:
Exceptional cost of sales
Exceptional costs of sales in the current year of £353,000 represent redundancy costs associated with restructuring the Group’s 
operations in Ravenhead. Similar activities resulting in these costs are only expected to arise infrequently.
Pension closure costs
Professional advisor fees of £731,000, together with employee compensation payments of £908,000, were incurred in the current year in 
relation to the closure of the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme. Due to the non-recurring nature of the closure, these costs were 
treated as exceptional.
A curtailment gain of £30,317 ,000 arose in 2016 as a result of the Group’s decision to close the UK defined benefit scheme to future accrual. 
Transaction costs
Professional fees and other costs of £102,000 incurred in the current year have been classified as exceptional. These costs are directly 
attributable to acquisition activity arising in the year and were classified as exceptional due to their non-recurring nature. 
Exceptional finance income
Exceptional finance income in the year resulted from gains made on foreign currency contracts around the date of the UK’s EU 
Referendum. Similar gains are not expected to recur.
All exceptional items were settled in cash, other than compensation costs accrued at the balance sheet date and the pension curtailment 
gain that is non-cash in nature based on an actuarial valuation of the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme as at 31 December 2016.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Tax on exceptional items
Apart from the following items, exceptional items are taxable or deductible in full in the current period.
(i)  The curtailment gain of £30,317 ,000 is not taxable in the current period. A deferred tax expense of £5,850,000 has been recognised 
in the period. 
(ii)  Administrative expenses include additional employer pension contributions of £265,000 arising from the closure of the Group’s UK 
defined benefit pension scheme. These pension contributions are tax deductible on a paid basis and a deferred tax asset of £51,000 
has therefore been recognised.
(iii)  Administrative expenses include exceptional legal and professional fees of £102,000 which are not tax deductible. 
2015
Included within the prior period are the following exceptional items:
Acquisition costs
Exceptional costs of sales
Inventory values were uplifted to fair value at the date of the acquisition, increasing costs of sales in the post-acquisition period. The 
£15,977 ,000 cost incurred for the utilisation of the fair value uplift adjustment on inventory was considered an exceptional costs of sales 
as it is a non-cash and non-recurring item. The inventory fair value uplift has fully unwound as at 31 December 2015.
Transaction costs
Professional fees and other costs of £9,392,000 were classified as exceptional in the prior period. These costs were directly attributable 
to the acquisition transaction which occurred in February 2015 and were classified as exceptional due to their material nature and as they 
are not expected to recur.
Retention and compensation payments
Other adjusting items of £986,000 in the period to December 2015 related to retention bonuses due to key staff which were committed 
to as part of the Group’s acquisition by Bain and the settlement of ‘B’ shares held by management.
IPO costs
Transaction costs
Costs of £12,497 ,000 were incurred during the process of the Group’s Initial Public Offering. This represented professional fees, 
management fees incurred prior to the listing and other transaction costs. Due to the non-recurring and material nature of such costs, 
they were classified as exceptional in the prior period.
Compensation and retention payments
Upon the successful IPO of the Group, senior management were provided with bonuses (£540,000) and share options (£723,000), which 
vested immediately under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) scheme. Since the bonus and cost of the award are fully recognised in the 
period, are not expected to recur and are intrinsically linked to the IPO transaction, they were treated as exceptional in the prior period. 
See Note 27(c)(i) for further details of the award. All other employee share schemes have been treated as recurring costs.
Negative goodwill
Negative goodwill of £1 15,738,000 arose on the acquisition of the trading entities. For further details of how negative goodwill was 
generated on the business combination, see Note 26.
Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment
The loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment relates to asset disposals and impairments incurred in the prior year. 
All exceptional items were settled in cash, other than share based payments, negative goodwill and the cost of sales adjustment that are 
non-cash in nature due to being items that are either equity-settled, or items arising solely from fair value accounting in the Group accounts.

Tax on exceptional items
Apart from the following items, exceptional items are taxable or deductible in full in the current period.
(i)  Negative goodwill of £1 15,738,000 is non-taxable and therefore did not impact the reported tax credit for the prior period.
(ii)  Acquisition costs of £7 ,039,000 and IPO transaction costs of £1 1,769,000 were treated as non-tax deductible and increased the 
current tax charge by £3,808,000.
(iii)  A deferred tax asset of £150,000 was recognised in respect of IPO-related share based payments totalling £723,000.
Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment is non-tax deductible.

This financial instrument is also classified as “other financial liabilities” and held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
During the year a credit of c.£3.2 million was included within the interest payable as a result of the lower interest rate payable.
Borrowing costs related to capital expenditure are insignificant and have not been capitalised. 
Notes to the Group consolidated financial statements continued
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2015
Included within the prior period are the following Finance costs: 
The shareholder loan notes, preference shares, old bank borrowings and revolving credit facility, each taken out on acquisition of the 
trading group in February 2015, were financial instruments held at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost 
method is based upon expected cash flows of each instrument. 
(i)  The loan notes attracted interest of 12% per annum on the principal plus any unpaid interest. Interest is payable on a quarterly basis. 
The notes are repayable at par on maturity in February 2021 or earlier at the option of the Company. The par value of the shareholder 
loan notes was £51.8 million. In October 2015 the shareholder loan note and accrued interest were repaid, the consideration being in 
the form of B preference shares and deferred shares. These newly issued shares were subsequently converted into ordinary and 
deferred shares as part of capital reorganisation that took place immediately prior to the IPO.
  The 43,250,000 £0.001 preference shares bore a 12% annual fixed yield, compounding quarterly on 31 March, 30 June, 30 
September and 31 December. On any redemption of these shares, the Articles of the Company provided that all arrears and accruals 
(if any) of the dividend should be paid. There was no fixed date of repayment; the shares could be redeemed at par at any time at the 
agreement of both the Company and the holder, or the shares are mandatorily redeemable at par on a triggering event, including the 
sale of the business. There was no premium payable on the redemption and the preference shares carried no votes at general 
meetings. In October 2015 the preference shares were converted into ordinary and deferred shares as part of a capital reorganisation 
that took place immediately prior to the IPO.
(ii)   The old revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) provided available funding of £40 million until it was repaid and extinguished in October 2015. 
Interest was charged at an annual rate of margin plus LIBOR (floored at 1%); the margin ranged from 2.75%-3.50% dependent on the 
prevailing earnings of the Group on a rolling 12-months basis. Interest was payable at either one, two, three or six monthly intervals, as 
appropriate. A commitment fee was payable on the undrawn element of the facility based on 35% of applicable margin. In October 
2015 the old RCF was repaid.
  The revolving credit facility was repaid and extinguished earlier than previously planned in October 2015 leading to an acceleration of 
transaction costs and an exceptional loss on early settlement of £1.88 million.
(iii)  The bank borrowings are a financial instrument classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and held at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The amortised cost method is based upon expected cash flows of each instrument. Where the expectations of the 
nature and timing of cash flows change a one-off adjustment is required to adjust the carrying value of the financial instrument to 
reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows.
  The old bank borrowings attracted interest of 8% plus LIBOR (floored at 1%) per annum, payable six monthly. The borrowings were 
repayable at par in February 2021. A voluntary early repayment exit charge of £38.045 million was levied based on the nature and 
timing of the settlement. The initial drawdown value of the borrowings was £250 million in February 2015. 
  On 30 June 2015 management revised the estimated lives and maturity dates for the securitised debt to October 2015 (previously to 
March 2018) after considering plans for an expected refinancing and associated ‘make whole’ premium, resulting in an exceptional 
finance charge. On repayment of this debt in October 2015 this facility was extinguished.
  A new bank borrowing facility was entered into in September 2015 with new lenders and first drawn in October as disclosed in Note 
19. This financial instrument is also classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For further details on these facilities, see Note 19.

The prior period tax credit has been restated from £6,869,000 to £7 ,715,000. The misstatement in the 2015 Annual Report & Accounts 
relates to the non-recognition of a deferred tax liability in respect of mineral land held by the Group due to an incorrect determination of 
the related tax base. The restatement results in the recognition of an additional deferred tax liability of £8,453,000 at the date of acquisition 
(26 February 2015) in the prior period and a reduction to the negative goodwill of the same amount. In the prior period, the tax credit is 
increased by £846,000 and the deferred tax liability has been restated to £63,497 ,000 as shown in Note 22.
The tax expense for the period includes a deferred tax credit of £185,000 relating to the recognition of US state tax losses arising as a 
result of the US business entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement declaring, retrospectively, a taxable presence in New York State 
and New York City since 2013.
The tax credit for the prior period includes a deferred tax credit of £738,000 relating to the recognition of US state tax losses acquired as 
part of the business combination. These tax losses were not recognised at the acquisition date due to the historic tax loss position of the 
US business. The US business has reported a taxable profit for the period and is expected to remain profitable in the foreseeable future. 
A deferred tax benefit has been recognised accordingly. 
There are no income tax consequences for the Company in respect of dividends declared prior to the date of authorisation of these 
financial statements and for which a liability has not been recognised.
The Group expects its effective tax rate in the future to be affected by the geographical mix of profits and the different tax rates that will apply 
to those profits, the use of brought-forward tax losses, the outcome of any future tax audits as well as the impact of changes in tax law.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK from 20% to 19% was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and will 
apply from 1 April 2017 . The further rate reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted in Finance Act 2016 on 6 
September 2016. The impact of these tax rate changes are reflected in these financial statements accordingly.

107 11. Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing profit for the period attributable to the parent shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number 
of options outstanding during the period. Where the average share price for the period is lower than the option price the options become 
anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of shares used for the earnings per share calculation are as follows:
Year ended

2016

Period ended 
31 December 
2015

Basic weighted average number of shares 406,025  288,236 
Effect of share incentive awards and options 2,671  60 
Diluted weighted average number of shares 408,696  288,296 
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share is a key measurement of management that is not defined by IFRS. The adjusted EPS 
measures should not be viewed in isolation, but rather treated as supplementary information.
Adjusted earnings per share figures are calculated as the Basic earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items, amortisation and 
depreciation on fair value uplifted assets and non-cash interest expenses. All adjustments are made net of the associated taxation impact 
at the Group’s Effective Tax Rate. Management has revised its method of calculation of Adjusted EPS in the current year to incorporate 
non-cash interest and the related taxation charge/credit. Additionally, the current year calculation reflects the Group’s effective tax rate in 
assessing the impact of adjusting items, which differs from the prior year. The prior year Adjusted EPS calculation has not been restated 
on the grounds of materiality. 
A reconciliation of the statutory profit to that used in the adjusted earnings per share calculations is as follows:

A £240 million facilities agreement covering the following financial instruments were entered into as part strategic planning for the Initial 
Public Offering in October 2015:
(i) New bank borrowings
A five-year £200 million facility was entered into in September 2015 and first drawn in October with mandatory repayments of £15 million 
due on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th anniversary dates subject to the Company’s right to elect not to make one of the repayment instalments 
due during the term of the loan. The borrowings attracted interest of between 1.25% and 2.50% depending on leverage ratio (defined as 
consolidated total net debt as a proportion of consolidated EBITDA) plus LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan in Euro) per annum, payable 
either three or six monthly at the option of the Group. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn element of the facility based on 35% 
of applicable margin.
(ii) New revolving credit facility (“New RCF”)
A new RCF for £40 million over five years was entered into in September 2015. The borrowings attract interest of between 1.25% and 
2.50% depending on leverage ratio (defined as above) plus LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan in Euro) per annum, payable either one, three 
or six monthly at the option of the Company. In the current year, the RCF was drawn on five occasions for amounts ranging from 
£2,975,000 to £7 ,075,000. At 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 the full facility was undrawn. 
The carrying value of financial liabilities have been assessed as materially in line with their fair values. 
No security is currently provided over the Group’s borrowings.

(i)   The restoration provision comprises obligations governing site remediation and improvement costs to be incurred in compliance with 
applicable environmental regulations together with constructive obligations stemming from established practice once the sites have 
been fully utilised. The key estimates associated with calculating the provision relate to the cost per acre to perform the necessary 
remediation work as at the reporting date together with determining the year of retirement. Estimates are updated annually based on 
the total estimated available reserves and the expected extraction rates. Whilst a significant element of the total provision will reverse in 
the medium term (two to ten years), the majority of the legal and constructive obligations applicable to mineral-bearing land will unwind 
over a 30-year timeframe. In discounting the related obligations, expected future cash outflows have been determined with due regard 
to extraction status and anticipated remaining life.
(ii)   Provisions for dilapidations, which arose as contingent liabilities upon the business combination in the prior year, are recognised on a 
lease by lease basis and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely committed cash outflows, which are estimated to occur 
over the lease term.
(iii)   The restructuring provision covers current and former employees who have ceased working on grounds of ill health and is a liability 
payable to their normal retirement date.
(iv)   Other provisions relate to provisions for the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (‘SERP’), product warranties, landfill and onerous 
contracts. The SERP is a defined contribution retirement plan in respect of basic salary entitlements for executive directors. The 
product warranties are based on the estimate of the cost of fulfilling customer warranty claims. The estimate is derived principally from 
historical data appropriately adjusted for specific risk factors. Under the Group’s standard sales terms, the Group repair or replace 
items that fail to perform satisfactorily for one year from the date of delivery to the customer. It is expected that most of this expenditure 
will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date. The landfill provision relates to the restoration of the associated sites and 
environmental remediation required by legislation. The onerous contract provision provides cover for the exposure that the Group has 
for both current property leases where the rent being paid is significantly higher than the current market rents and vacant properties at 
acquisition. Overall these provisions are not deemed material.
Amounts arising on acquisition of the trading business include contingent liabilities to reflect present obligations that existed at the date of 
acquisition. This includes certain legal claims in the UK of £1. 1 million which have been included in Other. For further details see Note 26.
The significant credits to the income statement arising in the year are as a result of the movement in Government bond rates used to 
discount the liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The Group holds insurance performance bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in respect of the Group’s maintenance and 
remediation obligations in respect of sites from which materials are being extracted. The bonds are typically in favour of the Department 
of Environmental Protection within the relevant jurisdictions. At 31 December 2016 the value of the bonds amounted to £1,538,000 
(31 December 2015: £1,230,000). The maximum term on the bonds outstanding at that date is September 2017 . The bonds are typically 
renewed on an annual basis at comparable levels.

The Group participates in the Ibstock Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK. The Scheme has 
four participating employers – Ibstock Brick Limited, Forticrete Limited, Anderton Concrete Products Limited, Figgs Bidco Limited (from 
26 February 2015) and Tyrone Brick Limited (up to 26 February 2015). The Scheme is funded by payment of contributions to a separate 
trustee administered fund. The scheme is a revalued earnings plan and provides benefits to its members based on their length of 
membership in the scheme and their average salary over that period. Following consultation with members, accounting for the Scheme’s 
closure to future accrual occurred in the year ended 31 December 2016. As a result, benefits were reassessed as active members were 
transferred to deferred membership.
The Scheme is administered by trustees who employ independent fund managers for the investment of the pension scheme assets. 
These assets are kept entirely separate from those of the Group.
Total annual contributions to the Scheme are based on independent actuarial advice, and are gauged to fund future pension liabilities 
(including projected increased in earnings and pensions) in respect of service up to the balance sheet date. The Scheme is subject to 
independent actuarial valuation at least every three years using the projected unit method.
The valuation used as at 31 December 2016 has been based on the results of the 30 November 2014 valuation, updated for changes in 
demographic assumptions, as appropriate. 
Through its defined benefit pension plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks that are inherent in such plans and arrangements. 
There are, however, no unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and no significant concentrations of risk. The risks can be 
summarised as follows:
 n asset value volatility, with the associated impact on the assets held in connection with the funding of pension obligations and the related 
cash flows;
 n changes in bond yields, with any reduction resulting in an increase in the present value of pension obligations, mitigated by an increase 
in the value of plan assets;
 n risk of volatility in inflation rates as pension obligations are generally linked to inflation; and
 n life expectancy, as pension benefits are provided for the life of beneficiaries and their dependents.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 The Company and Trustees intend to de-risk the Scheme’s investment strategy by moving towards a position that is predominantly liability 
matching in nature. This involves an Asset Liability Management (‘ALM’) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term 
investments that are in line with the obligations under the Scheme. Within this framework the ALM objective is to match assets to the 
pension obligations by investing in risk-reducing assets (such as long-term fixed interest and index-linked securities). The Company 
actively monitors the investment strategy to ensure that the expected cash flows arising from the pension obligations are sufficiently met.

All equities and bonds have a quoted market price in an active market. Properties and cash and cash equivalents are unquoted. Liability 
driven investment (‘LDI’) are funds constructed to reduce the risk within the Scheme. They help to mitigate against movements in inflation 
or interest rates by moving in a similar way to the liabilities following market movements. The funds are constructed from gilts and swaps. 
The Scheme’s LDI fund is managed by BMO and is predominantly unquoted.

The Group contributed 16.0% of pensionable salaries to the Scheme during the period reported. Based on the most recent valuation, 
a payment schedule was agreed with the Trustees of the Ibstock Pension Scheme so that the Scheme’s deficit can be eliminated. This 
included the Group contributing 16% of pensionable salaries to the Scheme in the year ended 31 December 2016 (no longer required 
following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual), as well as a further £7 .0 million per annum until May 2021. The weighted average 
duration of the defined benefit obligation is 20 years (2015: 19 years). In the year ended 31 December 2016, other costs related to the 
closure of the scheme to future accrual of £1,639,000 were incurred and classified as exceptional (see Note 5).
At the 31 December 2015 balance sheet date, a reimbursement asset is recorded which was directly contributed to the Scheme. Refer to 
Note 15 ‘Trade and other receivables’.
The principal assumptions used by the actuary in his calculations were:
31 December 
2016
Per annum
31 December 
2015
Per annum
Discount rate 2.80% 3.85%
RPI inflation 3.35% 3.10%
CPI inflation 2.35% 2.10%
Rate of increase in salary n/a 3.10%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.75% 3.60%
Commutation factor 15.52 12.00
Mortality assumptions: life expectancy from age 65
For a male currently aged 65 22.70 years 22.90 years
For a female currently aged 65 25.30 years 25.50 years
For a male currently aged 40 25.10 years 25.30 years
For a female currently aged 40 27.80 years 28.00 years
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases to life expectancy. The life expectancies quoted for members 
currently aged 40 assume that they retire at age 65 (i.e., 25 years after the balance sheet date).
The principal financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation. The discount 
rate is based on the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term to the defined benefit obligations. 
The obligations are primarily in Sterling and have a maturity of some 20 years. If the real discount rate increased/decreased by 0.25%, 
the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2016 would decrease/increase by approximately 5%.

(b) Multi-employer scheme
The Group participates in two multi-employer defined benefit pension schemes, being Aluminium, Brick and Glass Workers International 
Union (‘AB&GW’) and National Integrated Group Pension Plan (‘NIGPP’), which are both held in the United States. As the Group is unable 
to identify its share of the assets and liabilities for these schemes as insufficient information is available on which to calculate this split (as 
confirmed with the schemes actuaries), they are accounted for on a defined contribution basis. The charge for the year to December 2016 
is £243,000. The Group is not liable for any other contributing entities within either scheme. For exit from the schemes by the Group at the 
most recent actuarial valuation, it was estimated that the withdrawal liability for the schemes equalled £18,346,000 (2015: £13,981,000) 
and £1,836,000 (2015: £1,281,000) for the AB&GW and NIGPP , respectively, although management currently do not have any plans on 
withdrawing from either scheme.
The minimum contribution requirements for the AB&GW scheme are based on a minimum monthly charge per active employee, with the 
minimum contribution requirements for the NIGPP scheme being based on a minimum charge per hour worked. The expected 
contributions to the plan for the next annual reporting period, being the year ending December 2017 is £450,000. In respect of the 
AB&GW scheme, based on the total contributions made in 2016 to the multi-employer schemes, the level of participation the Group made 
compared to other participating entities was 83% and the Group has 70% of all members (active, deferred and retired). In respect of the 
NIGPP scheme, based on the proportion of the withdrawal liability against total plan liabilities, the level of participation the Group made 
compared to other participating entities was less than 1%.
In total, the AB&GW plan has a deficit as at 31 December 2016 of £21,284,000 (2015: £19,287 ,000). The contribution rates agreed to be paid by 
the Group include an element of rehabilitation funding with respect to the total plan deficit. For this scheme, the arrangements gives rise to a 
present obligation and as such a liability has been recognised of £9,389,000 (2015: £8,007 ,000) for future committed contribution amounts as 
at 31 December 2016, with an associated recognised deferred tax asset of £3,727 ,000 (2015: £3,052,000). This has been calculated by 
discounting the future cash flows, which accrete at 7% per annum in line with the rehabilitation funding plan as set by the scheme Trustees, at a 
rate commensurate with the time value of money using a 20-year US treasury rate (2.79%) given the duration of the rehabilitation funding plan 
runs to 2034. This calculation is based on management’s estimated number of employees in future years. The Trustees meet annually to 
reassess the funding contribution increase – this has been set at the 7% rate since 2012. Based on the contribution rates and total withdrawal 
liability for the NIGPP plan, management have determined any present obligation arising from the plan is immaterial.
(c) Defined contribution plan
The Group operates defined contribution schemes under the Ibstock pension scheme, the Supreme Concrete Limited pension scheme, 
the Anderton Concrete pension scheme and the Supreme Concrete Group Personal Plan. Contributions by both employees and Group 
companies are held in externally invested, externally administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has no 
further obligations in relation to the scheme. The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined contribution scheme in the year 
was £1,536,000 (period ended 31 December 2015: £1,209,000).

The net deferred tax liability at the prior period end has been restated from £54,662,000 to £62,269,000 due to a misstatement in the 
2015 Annual Report & Accounts relating to the non-recognition of a deferred tax liability in respect of mineral land held by the Group due 
to an incorrect determination of the related tax base. The restatement results in the recognition of an additional deferred tax liability of 
£8,453,000 at the date of acquisition (26 February 2015) in the prior period and a reduction to the negative goodwill of the same amount. 
In the prior period, the deferred tax credit is also increased by £846,000 from £9,038,000 to £9,884,000 as disclosed in Note 10.
There are no unrecognised deferred tax assets or liabilities as at 31 December 2016. In the prior period, a deferred tax asset of £227 ,000 
in respect of state net operating losses was not recognised.

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, credit sales and deposits with banks and is managed on a Group basis. This risk arises 
from transactions with banks, such as those involving cash and cash equivalents and deposits. To reduce the credit risk, the Group has 
concentrated its main activities with a Group of banks that have strong, independently verified credit ratings. For each bank, individual risk 
limits are set based on its ﬁnancial position, credit ratings, past experience and other factors. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly 
monitored.
The Group has significant sales contracts with a number of ‘blue-chip’ companies and accordingly the Directors believe there is a limited 
exposure to credit risk, but this is actively monitored at Board level. The Group’s policy on credit risk requires appropriate credit checks on 
potential customers before sales commence.

Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk, being currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk. In the post-acquisition period 
the Group’s interest rate risk arises principally from the revolving credit facility and bank borrowings which attract floating rate interest, see 
Note 19. The Group manages its interest rate risk by using a floating rate debt with varying repayment terms. The Group also does not 
trade in derivative financial instruments and so is not considered to be exposed to other price risk. The exposure to currency risk is 
considered low.
The exposure in different currency of financial assets and liabilities is as follows:

There are no material differences between the fair values and the book values stated above.
The Group has negligible risk to currency fluctuations as the majority of assets and liabilities are held in the same functional currency.
Liquidity risk
The Group has generated sufficient cash from operations to meet its working capital requirements and finance its investing activities. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by entering into committed bank borrowing facilities to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available, 
and monitoring cash flow forecasts to ensure the Group has adequate borrowing facilities.

At 31 December 2016, the Group had an RCF facility of £40 million over five years that was entered into in September 2015. During the 
year ending 31 December 2016, the RCF was drawn on five occasions for values ranging from £2,975,000 to £7 ,075,000, resulting in an 
interest charge of £16,000 in the year. At 31 December 2015 the full facility was undrawn. See Note 18 for further details.

Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 13 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the 
significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as 
prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
All of the Group’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 except for contingent consideration which has been 
categorised as Level 3. There were no transfers between levels during the period.
Financial instruments in Level 3
The Group’s financial instruments that are categorised under Level 3 are contingent consideration and the techniques used to value are 
provided in Note 26.
The following table presents the changes in Level 3 instruments for the period ended 31 December 2016.

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital, defined as net funds, are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or borrow additional debt.
Following the issue of the new banking facilities in September 2015 the Group must comply with two covenants each quarter from 
30 June 2016. These covenants are monitored on a regular basis by the Board. The covenants are certain ratios of interest cover and 
leverage, which are monitored on a regular basis by the Board. At the period end date, management believes significant headroom exists 
on both covenant conditions. New debt facilities were entered into in March 2017 , as disclosed in Note 34.
Immediately prior to and following the Group’s admission to the London Stock Exchange, a capital reorganisation took place. Further 
details are provided in Note 24.
Dividend policy
The Group intends that the Company will pay an interim dividend and a final dividend in respect of each financial year in the approximate 
proportions of one-third and two-thirds, respectively, of the annual dividend, to be announced at the time of the announcement of the 
interim and final results.
Our dividend policy is based on a pay-out ratio of 40-50% of adjusted profit after taxation over a business cycle. This adjusted profit 
measure is set out in Note 1 1 to the financial statements. Following announcement of our dividend policy at the time of the Group’s IPO in 
October 2015, the Directors’ remain confident that the policy remains appropriate. At 31 December 2016, the parent maintains significant 
distributable reserves.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 In the current year, share capital has increased by £817 , 131 as a result of the issue of ordinary share capital of £0.01 each to satisfy share 
options granted or exercised in the year.
In the prior period, the Group’s capital structure was reorganised in preparation for the IPO.
On 22 October 2015, the existing share capital structure was reorganised as set out above to consist of a single class of ordinary shares 
and a single class of deferred shares. Following the capital reorganisation, 352,868,422 new ordinary shares of £0.01 each and 
47 ,918,922,626 new deferred shares of £0.01 each were in issue.
At IPO (on 27 October 2015), the Company issued 52,631,578 new ordinary shares of £0.01 each at a premium of £1.89 per share. Share 
issue costs of £5.0 million were offset against the share premium of £99.5 million created on the issue of these shares.
On 16 December 2015, a capital reduction was completed in accordance with the terms of a special resolution passed on 21 October 
2015 under which:
(i)   47 ,918,922,626 deferred shares of £0.01 each were cancelled and extinguished, and
(ii)   the sum standing to the credit of the Company’s share premium account (an amount of £94.5 million) was cancelled.
Following the capital reduction in the prior period, the issued share capital of the Company consists of 405,500,000 ordinary shares of 
£0.01 each.
25. Reserves
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries.
Other reserves
Other reserves relate to contingent consideration arising on acquisition where there is no contractual obligation to settle the contingent 
consideration in cash based on events outside the Group’s control. There have been no changes in the Group’s contingent consideration 
in the year.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve of £369. 1 million arose on the acquisition of Figgs Topco Limited by Ibstock plc in the prior period and is the difference 
between the share capital and share premium of Figgs Topco Limited and the nominal value of the investment and preference shares in 
Figgs Topco Limited acquired by the Company. 
26. Business combinations
On 26 February 2015, Figgs Topco Limited acquired 100% of the voting shares of Ibstock Group Limited and its subsidiaries, and 
Glen-Gery Corporation and its subsidiaries for consideration totalling £377 ,962,000. The entities acquired specialise in the manufacture of 
clay and concrete building products in the UK and in the North East and Mid West regions of the US. As disclosed in Note 1, a prior year 
adjustment has been made to amend the acquisition balance sheet to incorporate a deferred taxation liability of £8,453,000. This has 
resulted in a restated negative goodwill arising on acquisition of £1 15,738,000. All other book and fair values of the net assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, are now final and are unchanged.

Total identifiable net assets at fair value 493,700
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition immediately recognised within the income statement (115,738)
Purchase consideration transferred 377,962
The fair value of the trade and other receivables amounts to £80,408,000, which equates to a net amount of trade receivables. The gross 
amount due under contracts is £80,903,000 of which £495,000 is expected to be uncollectable.
The full analysis of the deferred tax arising on business combination is set out in Note 22.
The consideration paid in association with the purchase of the Ibstock Group of companies was based on a multiple of earnings and not 
an assessment of the fair value of the assets of the business. As there is considerable value associated with intangible assets that only 
arise in the Group consolidated financial statements, and our tangible assets reflect the current market demand for building products and 
production capacity, the fair value of the acquired net assets are in excess of the consideration paid, and therefore negative goodwill has 
arisen, which has been immediately taken to the income statement. There are no expected taxation consequences in relation to the 
negative goodwill recognised.
Provisions and contingent liabilities at fair value of £7 ,000,000 were recognised at the acquisition date resulting from various legal claims 
in the UK of £1, 100,000, UK property risks of £3,300,000 and an environmental claim of £2,600,000 in the US. These fair values were 
provisional pending the receipt of final valuations of the potential liabilities. As at 31 December 2015, a final external valuation of the UK 
property risks has been received and the fair value increased from £3,300,000 to £7 ,850,000, and an internal valuation exercise identified 
increased US property risks of £151,000. Subsequent to the acquisition date, management has also received external legal advice that 
no liability in relation to the US environmental claim is required – resulting in a reduction in contingent liabilities of £2,600,000. Additionally, 
management identified a £2, 151,000 liability in respect of employee compensation previously recognised as a post-acquisition exceptional 
period cost. The related deferred taxation liability uplift of these final fair value adjustments is £210,000. As at the reporting date, all other 
fair values were determined to remain as originally determined at the acquisition date.

Initial cash consideration 312,853
Pension contribution 60,000
Contingent land proceeds 1,109
Contingent pension tax benefit 4,000
Total consideration 377,962
As part of the acquisition, the Group agreed to make a one-off contribution of £60.0 million to the Ibstock Brick Limited pension scheme 
on completion of the transaction. As the transaction was conditional on the contribution being made the payment cannot be separated 
from the business combination and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 3 is treated as part of the acquirer’s consideration paid for the 
business. The post-employment benefit obligation includes this £60.0 million contribution.
Additionally, in accordance with the share sale agreement (‘SSA’), half of any tax relief, over a contracted amount, received by the acquired 
business as a result of the one-off pension payment, shall be payable to the seller. The fair value of the future obligation was estimated at 
£4,000,000, with a range being nil to £4,000,000.
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of the acquired operations, half of all proceeds above a contracted amount, 
received by the acquired business on the sale of certain land assets in the future, shall be payable to the seller. Sale of land assets is in 
the control of the Group and accordingly is recognised in equity. Contingent consideration was recognised in relation to this, based on 
management’s best estimate of £1, 109,000 from an estimated range of nil to £3,800,000.
Transaction costs in relation to the acquisition of £9,392,000 were expensed and included within administrative expenses in the prior 
period.
From the date of acquisition, the acquired operations contributed £358,331,000 of revenue and £96,004,000 to profit before taxation of 
the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the financial statement period, revenue would have been £438,435,000 
and profit before taxation of the Group would have been £80,383,000. 
As disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report & Accounts, we have provided information to provide the users of the accounts with a 
comparable view of performance for 2014 and 2015. We have analysed below the performance of the acquired entities from 1 January 
2015 to 31 December 2015. The information for this period has been adjusted to include the impact of the fair value exercise and new 
financing structure as if it had been in place since the start of the period. The period ending 31 December 2014 has been included as 
comparative information, but has not been updated for the impact of the fair value exercise or financing structure following the acquisition.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 (a) Old scheme arrangements held by subsidiaries on acquisition
The acquisition of the trading entities of the Group on the 26 February 2015 triggered a modification to their existing share incentive plans. 
The schemes in place became cash settled on acquisition and the respective liabilities of these awards have been accounted within the 
fair value of net assets acquired.
(b) Management equity arrangements issued on acquisition
Ordinary B Shares options
On 26 February 2015 certain members of management were issued with 80,000 ordinary B shares in Figgs Topco Limited for a 
consideration of £7 .55 per share. See Note 24 for details of the share reorganisation which took place in the period.
B shareholders are entitled to a certain percentage of any proceeds received in the event of a sale of the business. The percentage 
receivable is dependent on the level of return on investment made by the ultimate parent and can range from 0%-12.5%.
Holders of vested B shares are entitled to receive the proceeds as set out above; holders of unvested B shares are only entitled to ever 
receive the original equity cost paid by management for the shares at grant. Provided that the holder remains in employment a proportion 
of the shares vest on each anniversary from grant until the fifth anniversary when all awards will have vested. All unvested awards will 
automatically vest on an exit event.

(c) New employee arrangements issued on IPO
Following the IPO of the Group on 27 October 2015, the Group entered into new share incentive plans; the Ibstock plc Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’), the Ibstock plc Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan (the ‘ADBP’) and the Ibstock plc Share Option Plan (the ‘SOP’). 
In addition, the Group has also established three all-employee share incentive plans, the Ibstock plc Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’) and 
the Ibstock plc Sharesave Plan (the ‘SAYE’). The LTIP , ADBP and SOP are, together, the ‘Discretionary Plans’, and the Discretionary Plans, 
the SIP and the SAYE, together, the ‘New Plans’. Under these arrangements, no awards have been forfeited in the year.

shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced share options. In the current 
year, 755,31 1 share options were granted and a charge of £264,000 was recognised. In the prior period, as part of the IPO process, 
337 ,665 options over shares were issued and immediately vested. The LTIP awards contain performance conditions dependent upon the 
Group’s earnings per share (‘EPS’) and total shareholder return (‘TSR’). The full charge of £723,000 was treated as an exceptional cost in 
the prior period. Please refer to the information given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 73 for details in relation to the 
vesting conditions in relation to the LTIP .
(ii) SOP
Options of 360,423 (2015: 848,312) shares were granted under the Share Option Plan during the year for all eligible employees at the 
discretion of the Board and this has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Awards under the scheme have a 
specified exercise price of 195.4 pence (2015: 212.0 pence), giving a weighted average exercise price of 207 . 1 pence. The SOP has an 
employment condition of three years and no other performance conditions.
(iii) SAYE
In order to participate in the Sharesave Plan, an employee must enter into a linked savings contract with a bank or building society to 
make contributions from salary on a monthly basis over a three or five-year period. A participant who enters into a savings agreement is 
granted an option to acquire Ordinary Shares under the Sharesave Plan at a specified exercise price. The total number of awards issued 
under this scheme during the prior period equalled 3,760,262. There has been no equivalent SAYE scheme in the current year.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the LTIP , SOP and SAYE awards during the period are detailed below:

In assessing the expected volatility level, due to Ibstock plc’s short share price history, volatility of similar listed companies have been used 
as a proxy.
(iv) ADBP
The ADBP incorporates the Company’s executive bonus scheme as well as a mechanism for the deferral of bonus into awards over 
Ordinary Shares. The ADBP will operate in respect of the annual bonus earned for the financial period. The Committee can determine that 
part of the bonus earned under the ADBP is provided as an award of deferred shares, which take the form of a £nil cost option. The 
maximum value of deferred shares is 50% of the bonus earned. The first deferred awards over Ordinary Shares under the ADBP will be 
made in relation to the 2016 year-end with options to be issued in April 2017 . The main terms of these awards are a minimum deferral 
period of three years, during which no performance conditions will apply; and the participants employment at the end of the deferral 
period. At 31 December 2016, an amount of £89,000 (2015: nil) had been recognised in accruals in relation to this award.

entered into a £250 million revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) with a group of six banks. The five-year facility contains covenant limits in line with 
those of the debt in place at 31 December 2016. An additional non-cash charge of £6.4 million in respect of acceleration of related debt 
costs and adjustments to interest on the basis of amortised cost will crystallise as a result of the refinancing in March 2017 .

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 1. Authorisation of financial statements
The Parent Company financial statements of Ibstock plc (‘the 
Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised 
for issue by the Board of Directors on 7 March 2017 and the 
balance sheet was signed on its behalf by W Sheppard and 
K Sims. 
Ibstock plc is a public company limited by shares, which is 
incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly 
traded. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London 
Stock Exchange. The registered office is Leicester Road, Ibstock, 
Leicestershire LE67 6HS and the company registration number is 
09760850.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards, the Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (‘FRS 
102’) and the Companies Act 2006. As a qualifying entity, as 
defined by FRS 102, the Company has elected to adopt the 
reduced disclosure exemptions set out with paragraph 1. 12 
of FRS 102, as described below.
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, 
under the historical cost convention.
The Company has not disclosed the information required by 
regulation 5(1)(b) of the Companies (Disclosure of Auditors 
Remuneration and Liability Limitation Agreements) Regulations 
2008 as the Group accounts of the Company are required to 
comply with regulation 5(1)(b) as if the undertakings included in 
the consolidation were a single group.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the business review on pages 26 to 27 . The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Directors’ Report on pages 74 to 76. In 
addition, Note 23 to the financial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and 
has reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result 
it believes its trading performance will demonstrate continued 
improvement in the coming periods, and that liquidity will remain 
strong.
The Board has reviewed the latest forecasts of the Group and 
considered the obligations of the financing arrangements. Given 
the continued strong liquidity of the Group the Board has 
concluded that a going concern basis of preparation of its financial 
statements is appropriate.
In addition, see the Group’s Viability Statement set out on page 37 .
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are included at cost stated at the 
historical value at the time of investment less any provisions for 
impairment and net of merger and Group reconstruction 
relief available.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share based 
compensation plans on behalf of the Group. The fair value of the 
employee services received under such plans is capitalised as an 
investment in the Company’s subsidiary until such time as 
intra-Group recharges are levied by the Company to recover this 
cost from its subsidiaries. Upon recharge, the amount recharged is 
treated as a return of capital contribution and recorded as a credit 
to equity (up to the value of the initial share based payment treated 
as a capital contribution). Any recharge in excess of the capital 
contribution is recognised within the Company income statement. 
The amount to be recognised over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of share based payments.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Ibstock’s shareholders are recognised in 
the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the final 
dividends are approved in the Annual General Meeting, or when 
paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Financial instruments
(i) Objectives and policies
The Company, in common with its Group subsidiaries, must 
comply with the Group’s finance guidelines that set out the 
principles and framework for managing Group-wide finances. 
Further information on the Group’s policies and procedures is 
available in the Group consolidated financial statements. The 
Company does not enter into speculative treasury arrangements.
(ii) Price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk
Foreign exchange risk management
The Company primarily transacts in Sterling and therefore 
exposure to foreign exchange risk is regarded as low.
Credit risk management
For the Company, this risk arises from cash and cash equivalents 
and deposits with banks. This is managed on a Group basis and 
there are a number of initiatives underway to mitigate this risk. 
These include concentrating activities with a group of banks that 
have strong, independently verified credit ratings. For each bank, 
individual risk limits are set based on its financial position, credit 
ratings, past experience and other factors.

continued
Liquidity planning, trends and risks
The Company has sufficient committed borrowing facilities to meet 
planned liquidity needs with headroom, through facilities provided 
by the Group.
The Company has adopted IAS 39 for ‘recognition and 
measurement of financial instruments’.
(iii) Financial assets
Financial assets, including preference shares, trade and other 
receivables, loans to fellow Group companies and cash and bank 
balances, are initially recognised at fair value.
Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including trade and other payables and loans 
from fellow Group companies, are initially recognised at fair value.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method in accordance with IAS 39.
Taxation
Taxation expense for the period comprises current and deferred 
tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is recognised in the 
profit and loss account, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
In this case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, respectively.
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions 
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be 
uncertain. The calculation of the tax charge therefore necessarily 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax liabilities 
are based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due 
and tax assets are recognised on the basis of probable future 
recoverability. This requires management to exercise judgement 
based on their interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of 
settlement of tax liabilities or recoverability of tax assets. To the 
extent that the final outcome differs from the estimates made, tax 
adjustments may be required which could have a material impact 
on the tax charge and profit for the period in which such a 
determination is made.
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the 
taxable profit for the year or prior years. Tax is calculated on the 
basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the period end.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is 
subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences 
between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as 
stated in the financial statements. These timing differences arise 
from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments 
in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the reporting 
date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are only 
recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against 
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the period end and that are 
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing differences.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, from the proceeds.
Related parties
The Group discloses transactions with related parties which are 
not wholly-owned within the same Group. Where appropriate, 
transactions of a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the 
opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to 
understand the effect of the transactions on the Group 
financial statements.
Foreign currency
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial statements are 
presented in Sterling (‘£’), which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.

Ibstock plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 (b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
income statement.
Disclosure exemptions
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the 
Company has elected to adopt the reduced disclosure exemptions 
set out in paragraph 1. 12 of FRS 102, because the Company 
prepares Group consolidated financial statements, as described 
below:
(a)  under FRS 102 (Section 1. 12(b)), the Parent Company is exempt 
from the requirements to prepare a cash flow statement on the 
grounds that its cash flows are included within the Ibstock plc 
Group consolidated financial statements.
(b)  The Parent Company is a qualifying entity and has taken 
advantage of the exemption from disclosing key management 
compensation (other than Directors’ emoluments) under FRS 
102 (Section 1. 12(e)), as it is a parent entity whose separate 
financial statements are presented alongside the Group 
consolidated financial statements, which contain the requisite 
equivalent disclosure.
(c)  The Parent Company is a qualifying entity and has taken 
advantage of the exemption from disclosing certain financial 
instrument disclosures under FRS 102 (Section 1. 12(c)), as it is a 
parent entity whose separate financial statements are presented 
alongside the Group consolidated financial statements, which 
contain the requisite equivalent disclosure.
(d)  The Company has elected to avail itself of the disclosure 
exemption within FRS 102 (Section 1. 12(d)) in relation to certain 
share-based payment disclosure requirements as it is a parent 
entity whose separate financial statements are presented 
alongside the Group consolidated financial statements, which 
contain the requisite equivalent disclosures.
(e)  The Company has taken advantage of the reduced disclosure 
exemption under FRS 102 (Section 1. 12(a)) and is not required to 
follow the requirements of paragraph 4. 12(a)(iv) of FRS 102 and 
as such discloses only a reconciliation of shares outstanding at 
between the beginning and end of the period, and not the prior 
period.
In addition, the Company has taken the exemption within Section 
33 of FRS 102 from disclosing transactions with members or 
investees of the Ibstock plc Group.
2. Critical accounting judgements 
and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting 
policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements and 
estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
Judgements
Judgements are made by management in the process of applying 
the Company’s accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of non-current assets
Determining whether non-current assets are impaired requires 
judgement and estimation. The Company periodically reviews 
non-current assets, for possible impairment when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgement, 
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such 
indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring, 
a major change in market conditions or technology, expectations 
of future operating losses, or negative cash flows.
The Company did not record any impairment charges during the 
year ended 31 December 2016 as management’s judgement, 
based on a rigorous assessment, was that there were no 
indicators of impairment.
3. Employee information
The Company has no employees. Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company are employed under letters of appointment. Full details 
of the Executive and Non-Executive remuneration is disclosed in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 58 to 73. For further 
details of Directors’ remuneration, refer to Note 7 of the Group 
consolidated financial statements.

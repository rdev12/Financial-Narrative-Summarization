Chairman’s review
Samih Darwazah Non-Executive Chairman
I am very pleased to report on another successful year for Hikma.
In 2007, we have continued meeting the strategic goals we set
for ourselves when we became a publicly listed company , while 
at the same time delivering consistent ﬁnancial performance.
Strategic progress
Our position as a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer in the
MENA region is stronger than ever . We have an excellent product
portfolio, a large and effective sales and marketing team and
excellent manufacturing capabilities that enable us to take
advantage of the opportunities in this fast-growing region.
Through the two acquisitions we made in the region this year , 
in Egypt and Jordan, we have extended our successful business
model into new markets and strengthened our position in our
core markets like Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
We have built a particularly diverse product portfolio and
promising product pipeline through the strength of our in-house
research and development team and with the benefit of
acquisitions. We are also developing our expertise in exciting 
new therapeutic areas such as oncology and diabetes. We have
made investments in capacity , particularly in our Injectables
business, and we continue to build scale and develop our
manufacturing capabilities.
Financial results
The Group performed well in 2007, achieving revenue of 
$448.8 million, up 41.6% from 2006. This growth was driven by
strong performances in our Branded and Injectables businesses
and was enhanced by acquisitions in MENA and Europe. Gross
margin for the Group was 49.4%, compared to 50.0% in 2006
and operating profit grew by 22.8% to $92.4 million. Earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation increased by
30.1% to $115.8 million. Profit attributable to shareholders for
the period increased by 14.8% to $62.6 million. Diluted earnings
per share increased by 14.2% to 35.4 cents per share.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 4.0 cents per
share (approximately 2.0 pence per share), which will make a
dividend for the full year of 7.5 pence per share, compared to 
7.0 pence per share for 2006. The proposed final dividend will 
be paid on 2 June 2008 to shareholders on the register on 
2 May 2008, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting.
Corporate responsibility
Since Hikma was founded, we have sought to adhere to the
highest ethical and operational standards. This year , we
commenced a thorough review of the social and environmental
impact of the Group in order better to align our desire to act
responsibly with our strategic business objectives. We are now
well-positioned to begin to set clear social and environmental
targets and action plans for further improvements in 
our performance.
Board changes
This year I stepped down as Chief Executive Officer , whilst
continuing my role as Chairman on a non-executive basis. I am
delighted that the Board appointed Said Darwazah as Chief
Executive Officer , a position he held prior to his appointment as
Health Minister for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Said’ s
knowledge of the Group, his significant business acumen and
pharmaceutical industry experience will ensure that Hikma
remains an exciting growth story for years to come.
Recent developments
On 17 January 2008 we successfully raised gross proceeds of
£81.6 million (approximately $160 million) through the placing 
of 17 million ordinary shares, to fund the acquisition of APM,
strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our flexibility to
finance future growth and pursue strategic acquisitions.
Outlook
In 2008 we expect to continue to see the results of the
investments we are making. Our Branded business, with its sales
and marketing team of more than 1,000, its broad product range
and quality reputation, will continue to deliver strong organic
growth and will also benefit from the enhanced opportunities
that the acquisitions in Egypt and Jordan will bring.
In our Injectables business, we will to continue to drive growth 
in the underlying business through new product launches and
further penetration of our existing product portfolio. Additional
growth will come as our new oncology business develops, as we
build our oncology product portfolio and as we launch these
products into new markets.
In our US Generics business, we expect continued pricing
pressure and significant gross margin erosion in 2008. Looking
ahead, we will work to grow this business through the recent
strengthening of the management team, increasing focus on
higher margin, niche products, dedicating additional capacity in
low cost countries and concentrating on acquiring lower cost API.
Importantly , we will also continue to invest in developing our
infrastructure and management in order to meet the growing
demand for our products across the Group, not just in 2008 but
in 2009 and beyond. strategy
We are focusing on the key segments of
our markets that offer the best prospects
for long-term growth. Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 13
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Said Darwazah Chief Executive Officer
In 2007 we have once again demonstrated the power of 
our diversified business model, achieving strong growth and
delivering healthy returns to shareholders.
Strategy
Our Branded business performed very well and the opportunities
within the MENA region remain exciting. In our Injectables
business, where we grew sales by nearly 80%, we are creating
economies of scale through our growing product portfolio and
enhanced sales and marketing efforts. In our Generics business 
in the US we were able to deliver nearly 10% sales growth and
strong cash flow for the Group despite intense competition and
pricing pressure.
In 2007 we also made significant investments in our businesses
that will enable us to drive future growth and to deliver on our
strategy of building Hikma into a leading speciality
pharmaceutical company .
Acquisitions
We began the year with two excellent acquisitions in Germany
– Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan. These companies substantially
broaden the scope of our Injectables business, bringing new
products, customers and manufacturing capabilities and helping
us develop a strong competence in oncology , one of the
industry’ s fastest growing therapeutic areas.
In September , we successfully entered the fast-growing Egyptian
market with the acquisition of Alkan Pharma in Egypt and, in
December , we further strengthened our position in our core
MENA markets through the acquisition of Arab Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing.
I am pleased to report that Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan are
fully integrated into Hikma and we are swiftly integrating Alkan
and APM. At Alkan, now Hikma Egypt, we have appointed a
new general manager with an in depth knowledge of the
Egyptian market, where we are working hard to establish the
Hikma brand. In Jordan, an excellent Hikma-trained team 
has joined the APM team, where they are strengthening key
functions and developing the potential of this excellent business.
We continue to see opportunities to develop our business
through acquisitions. Being a consolidator in the highly
fragmented pharmaceutical market in the MENA region will
remain a priority and we will continue to look for opportunities 
to enhance our position in core markets and to access new
emerging markets.
Management
We have made a number of management appointments over
the course of the year , adding talented managers with excellent
international experience. In addition to new general managers at
Hikma Egypt and APM, we have made two important oncology
hires – a new managing director for Ribosepharm and a global
head of oncology .
We have also continued to strengthen our underlying businesses.
In the MENA region, we have hired a new head of licensing, 
who will focus on further developing our in-licensing potential 
in order to reinforce our position as the partner of choice in the
MENA region. In the US, we have appointed a new head of
Injectables for the US market and have strengthened our ongoing
commitment to our oral generic business with senior hires in
finance and sales and marketing.
We are confident that these appointments will help us to execute
our strategy and maximise the opportunities available to us.
Products
We significantly expanded our product portfolio in 2007, from
176 to 353 products, enhancing our potential in core markets
and bringing opportunities in newer markets across all regions.
We have made excellent progress through our in-house R&D
efforts, with 129 product approvals and 28 new product
launches. The acquisitions of Ribosepharm, Alkan and APM 
have also added a number of exciting new branded generic and
in-licensed products that we are only just beginning to leverage
across our network. Through our licensing efforts, we have
added three new in-licensed products in MENA.
Looking forward, our pipeline is also impressive, with 104 new
products pending approval, including 46 ANDAs and 133
products under development.
Capacity
In order to meet the growing demand for our products, we 
have continued to invest in expanding our existing capacity 
and improving our operational efficiency during 2007. 
Our ongoing capital expenditure projects were enhanced by this
year’ s acquisitions, further expanding capacity and adding new
manufacturing capabilities. In our Branded business, we are now
investing in our plants in Jordan and Saudi Arabia and expect to
make further investments in 2008 in Egypt and at APM to
maximise the potential of these facilities. In our Injectables
business, we are adding further lyophilisation capacity in our
facilities in Portugal and are increasing utilisation of our new
cephalosporin plant.
We continue to focus on building Hikma into a leading speciality
pharmaceutical company delivering high returns on investment to
our shareholders. Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 14

Our vision
A leader in speciality pharmaceuticals
Our vision is to be a leading speciality pharmaceutical company
offering a diverse portfolio of high-quality , added-value products
across a wide range of therapeutic areas.
Our strategy
Focus on growth
We are focusing on the key segments of our markets that offer
the best prospects for long-term growth, particularly the branded
generic market in the MENA region and the speciality injectables
business. Growth will come both organically and through
acquisitions, which will be used to develop our position in new
markets, strengthen our leading position in existing markets and
provide access to new products and technologies.
Deliver high quality products to patients at a lower cost
Our goal of delivering high quality and cost-effective products to
patients in the many and varied markets in which we operate
requires developing our research and development capabilities,
leveraging our API sourcing skills and maintaining very high
manufacturing standards.
Operate responsibly
As we go about our day-to-day business, we will also strive to run
our operations responsibly , balancing our commercial objectives
with the expectations of a broad range of stakeholders. Overall,
we recognise that our vision will only be achieved if we maintain
our commitment to quality , especially when it comes to our
people and our organisation.
Our business and markets
Our primary business is the development, manufacture and
marketing of generic and in-licensed pharmaceutical products.
Our operations span almost 50 countries around the world,
primarily in the MENA region, the United States and Europe.
Fast growing MENA market
We have signiﬁcant operations in the MENA region, which is
primarily a branded pharmaceutical market, where patented,
generic and OTC pharmaceutical products are marketed under
speciﬁc brand names. In this region we market our own branded
generic products and a number of patented brands that we in-
licence from the originators. We compete against both the
multinational originators and local manufacturers, but are one of
the few regional players, with operations in 17 MENA markets
and over 1,000 sales and marketing employees across the region.
In our core markets – Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Jordan and Sudan –
we are one of the top six players, and across all our markets
many of our top products have a market share of 15% or more.
We estimate that the total size of the MENA pharmaceutical
market was over $8.0 billion in 2007
1
. Key external drivers of
future growth include growing per capita income and medical
expenditure, the increasing affordability of generic products, 
the region’ s expanding healthcare infrastructure and favourable
market trends such as improving literacy , increasing life
expectancy and higher birth rates.
In 2007, we strengthened our capacity to take advantage of
these favourable market trends. Through the acquisition of Alkan
Pharma (“Alkan”) in September of 2007, we extended our reach
into the important Egyptian market, where we estimate the
private sector was worth approximately $1.9 billion in 2007.
Through the acquisition of Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Co. Ltd. (“APM”) in December 2007, we also strengthened our
position in our existing markets, particularly in Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
Speciality injectables market
Our Injectables business focuses on a specialised sub-segment of
the global generic market and has a growing presence in the
MENA region, Europe and the US. While in each of these areas
we compete against local and multinational competitors, the
total number of competitors is more limited than in the oral
segment of the generic market, due to the complexity of the
injectable manufacturing process and more challenging
regulatory requirements.
We are developing strong market positions in each of our
Injectable markets. In the MENA region, we are the sole generic
supplier of six speciﬁc injectable products and our products often
have a market share of 25% or more. In Europe and the US 
we have achieved similar market shares for a number of our
products, especially the cephalosporins.
In 2007 we made two important acquisitions that helped us 
to enter the injectable oncology market, which is forecast to
become the second largest within the pharmaceutical industry 
by 2010
2
.
The first was the acquisition of Ribosepharm GmbH
(“Ribosepharm”), which specialises in the marketing and
distribution of branded generic injectable oncology products both
to private practices and hospitals in Germany . We will be able 
to draw on Ribosepharm’ s expertise in the field of oncology in
Germany to expand into other oncology markets in Europe, as
well as into the MENA region and eventually the United States.
We further developed our oncology capability with the
acquisition of Thymoorgan GmbH Pharmazie & Co. KG
(“Thymoorgan”), a manufacturer of injectable oncology products.

Business and financial review Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 16
US generic market
Our Generic business operates in the competitive US market, 
by far the largest single market in the world for generic
pharmaceutical products, with sales of approximately $29 billion
in 2007
1
. In this market, Hikma competes in the private and
government market on the basis of price, quality , product range
and customer service, and overall through its ability to provide
certain niche products. Downward pressure on prices, driven
primarily by an increase in the number of competitors operating
in the market, has affected the US generic market in recent years.
In the future, we expect continued competition, particularly from
low cost generic pharmaceutical producers from India and China.
Key performance indicators
Progress on our strategic objectives is monitored by the Board
by reference to five key financial performance indicators (“KPIs”)
applied on a Group-wide and segmental basis. These same
indicators are used by executive management to manage the
business. Performance in 2007 against these indicators is set out
in the table below, together with the prior year performance
data. We are no longer including R&D costs as a percentage of
revenue as a KPI as this is no longer the best way to measure our
investment in our pipeline, given the increase in spending on
product acquisitions. This year , however , we have added new
product launches as a non-financial KPI.

Group performance
Revenue for the Group increased by 41.6% to $448.8 million,
compared to $317.0 million in 2006. Excluding the acquisitions
of Ribosepharm, Thymoorgan and Alkan, revenues increased by
28.0%. The latter increase was primarily due to strong increases
in revenue in both the Branded and Injectable businesses.
In 2007, 44.3% of revenue was generated by our Branded
business, 27.7% of revenue was generated by our Generic
business and 27.0% by our Injectables business. Geographically ,
51.1% of revenue was generated in the MENA region, while
32.0% of revenue was generated in the United States and
17.0% in Europe and the rest of the world. 
The Group’ s gross profit increased by 39.7% to $221.5 million,
compared to $158.5 million in 2006. Group gross margins for
2007 were 49.4% of revenue, compared to 50.0% in 2006. 
On a segmental basis, gross margins improved in the Branded
and Injectables businesses, but declined in the Generic business,
due to continued price erosion.
Group operating expenses increased in 2007 by 53.3% to
$129.1 million, compared to $84.2 million for 2006, mainly 
due to an increase in sales and marketing and general and
administrative expenditures related to acquisitions and to an
increase in corporate expenses required to support the enlarged
Group. These expenses include an amortisation charge of 
$1.6 million relating to intangible assets arising on these and
other acquisitions completed during the year . Sales and
marketing expenses represented 13.6% of Group revenue 
in 2007, compared to 11.0% in 2006.
Sales and marketing expenses before acquisitions
2
grew by
26.7%, which reflects the strong growth in both the Branded
and Injectables businesses. Including acquisitions, sales and
marketing expenses increased by 74.3% to $61.0 million, due
primarily to the acquisition of Ribosepharm, and to the full
consolidation of Al-Jazeera Pharmaceutical Industries (“JPI”). 
The Group’ s general and administrative expenses increased by
51.7% to $46.0 million, compared to $30.3 million in 2006. As
anticipated, the change arose mainly from the consolidation of
JPI, Ribosepharm, Thymoorgan and Alkan. The need to support
the growth of the Group has also increased corporate general
and administrative costs, which include costs associated with 
the company’ s new long-term incentive plan. General and
administrative expenses represented 10.3% of Group revenue 
in 2007, compared to 9.6% in 2006.

Investment in R&D for the Group increased by 5.7% 
to $19.3 million, compared to $18.3 million in 2006. 
This increase, which can be attributed to ongoing investment 
in the development of our product portfolio, was lower than 
in 2006 reflecting a shift towards product and business
acquisitions. T otal investment in R&D represented 4.3% of 
Group revenue in 2007, compared to 5.8% in 2006.
Other net operating expenses, which consist mainly of provisions
against slow moving items partially offset by foreign exchange
gains, were $2.8 million, compared to $0.6 million in 2006.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
increased by 30.1% to $115.8 million, compared to $89.0 million
in 2006. Operating profit for the Group increased by 22.8% to
$92.4 million, compared to $75.2 million in 2006. Group
operating margin declined by 3.1 percentage points to 20.6% in
2007, compared to 23.7% of revenue in 2006.
Research and development
The Group’ s product portfolio continues to grow. In the year to
31 December 2007, Hikma added 177 new products to the
Group portfolio, which now covers 353 products in 728 dosage
strengths and forms
1
. We manufacture and/or sell 40 of these
under licence from the originator .
In the year to 31 December 2007, Hikma received 129 regulatory
approvals, including nine ANDA approvals for the Generics
business and one ANDA approval for the Injectables business.
Over the same period, 28 new products were launched.

Branded Pharmaceuticals
Revenue in the Branded business, our largest business 
segment, increased by 52.9% to $198.9 million, compared to
$130.1 million in 2006. Excluding the acquisitions of JPI and
Alkan, underlying sales growth was 32.0%, primarily due to
strong growth across all our MENA markets. New product
introductions and more focused sales and marketing efforts 
have helped to drive demand and increase sales. A particularly
strong performance in the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”)
countries was driven in part by the successful integration of JPI.
Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Sudan were the Branded
business’ s largest markets in 2007. In Algeria, Hikma grew 
well above the average market growth rate. This growth was
driven by an increase in the number of marketed products,
enhanced sales and marketing efforts, with more focus on
doctors, pharmacists and better geographical coverage, and by
strengthening our relationships with the leading distributors. 
Our market share in Algeria reached 6.0% in 2007, compared 
to 3.9% at the end of 2006, making us the fourth largest
pharmaceutical company in the Algerian market
1
.
Sales in Saudi Arabia grew by nearly 80%, as we worked hard 
to complete the integration of JPI. By year end the combined
sales teams were performing well and we had achieved strong
margin improvement. We also increased our share of the tender
market, beneﬁting from our new status as a local manufacturer .
Our share of the private market, however , decreased to 3.8% in
2007, compared to 4.0% in 2006, making us the sixth largest
player in the Saudi Arabian market
1
. We are conﬁdent of further
progress in 2008 through increased sales efforts, the beneﬁts of
new product launches – including three new products launched
in 2007 and further beneﬁts of the JPI / Hikma integration. We
will beneﬁt from APM’ s strong position in the Saudi market.
Our growth in the Jordanian market was also strong in 2007 
and well ahead of the underlying market, due to new product
launches, more focused sales efforts especially for key products
and better market coverage by our medical representatives. 
We received 12 product approvals and launched nine new
products in the Jordanian market during the year . In 2007, 
we maintained our position as market leader in the Jordanian
market and our market share increased to 7.7%, compared to
7.3% in 2006
1
.
In Sudan we performed extremely well, largely due to a 
strong product focus, an increase in the number of medical
representatives and better geographical coverage, combined 
with a more stable operating environment, growing pharmacy
chains and an overall increase in pharmaceutical spend.
Signiﬁcant beneﬁts were also derived from the integration of 
JPI’ s Sudanese operations. While market data is not readily
available for the Sudanese market, we believe that we now 
have a leading position in this market.
We also achieved strong performances in some of our newer and
smaller markets, including UAE, Lebanon and the Ukraine, driven
mainly by better brand recognition and product launches.
In 2007 we continued to work hard to strengthen our leading
position in the MENA region. Through the acquisition of Alkan
in September 2007, we extended our reach into the important
Egyptian market, which we estimate was worth approximately
$1.9 billion in 2007. We now have more than 250 sales and
marketing staff in Egypt and market 84 products in 126 dosage
strengths and forms. Five of these products are in-licensed and 
a further 19 products are pending approval. In addition, we
continue to sell Astellas’ life-saving immunosuppressant, Prograf
®
,
in the Egyptian market and will soon launch Actos
®
, T akeda’ s
leading T ype T wo diabetes drug.
Through the acquisition of APM at the end of December 2007,
we strengthened our position in our existing markets, particularly
in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. This acquisition brings together a
high quality and complementary portfolio. APM’ s currently
marketed portfolio of 105 products in 222 dosage strengths 
and forms will enhance the product offering available to 
Hikma’ s enlarged sales force by expanding existing product 
lines, strengthening existing therapeutic areas and adding 
new molecules. APM’ s portfolio includes oral, injectable and
dermatological products and spans a number of therapeutic
categories, including cardiovascular , diabetes and oncology .
Sales from in-licensed products grew by 44.6% to $64.2 million
in 2007, representing 32.3% of Branded sales, compared 
to 34.1% in 2006. During the year , three new licensing
agreements were signed and ﬁve new licences were added 
with the acquisition of Alkan in Egypt, bringing the total number
of in-licensed products marketed in the Branded business to 33.

Gross proﬁt in the Branded business increased by 55.5% to
$108.0 million, compared to $69.5 million in 2006. Gross margin
in the Branded business increased to 54.3%, compared to
53.4% in 2006. This change in gross proﬁt margin is attributed
primarily to an improvement in product mix.

Business and financial review
Operating proﬁt in the Branded business increased by 56.7% 
in 2007, to $61.7 million. Through a strict focus on operating
efﬁciencies, operating margins in the Branded business increased
to 31.0% in 2007, compared to 30.3% in 2006, which
demonstrates the successful integration of JPI. In 2007, 
operating expenses included only a small amortisation charge
related to acquisitions. Going forward, however , we expect 
the amortisation charge for intangible assets related to
acquisitions to be close to $4.0 million.
In 2007, the Branded business received 78 regulatory approvals,
including 12 in Jordan, 49 in other MENA markets and 17 in
Europe and the rest of the world. In line with our strategic
objectives for the Branded business, we launched a total of 15
new products in 2007, nine in Jordan, three in Saudi Arabia and
three in Egypt. The total number of Branded sales and marketing
staff operating across our 17 MENA markets at year end was
1,010, which includes 256 in Egypt, 221 in Saudi Arabia, 191 in
Jordan and 127 in Algeria.
Injectable Pharmaceuticals
Our global Injectable business manufactures injectable
pharmaceutical products in powder , liquid and lyophilised 
forms for sale across the MENA region, Europe and the US. 
The Injectable business contributed 27.0% of total Group
revenue in 2007, compared to 21.3% in 2006. 
Revenue in our Injectable business increased by 79.3% to 
$121.2 million, compared to $67.6 million in 2006. The increase
reflects underlying organic growth of 25.2%
1
, driven primarily 
by a strong performance in the MENA region, as well as the
consolidation of Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan, the injectable
oncology businesses acquired in the first half of 2007.
During the year , the Injectables business received 42 regulatory
approvals, including 11 in Europe, 30 in the MENA region and
one in the US. 25 of these approvals were for new products, the
rest were for new dosage strengths or forms. Since the beginning
of 2008, we have received a further four approvals in the US.
In the MENA region, the Injectables business delivered strong
growth across most markets, with the largest contributions
coming from Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. This growth 
was driven by our strong product position, more focused sales
and marketing efforts, additional medical representatives, an
increased focus on institutional customers and an increasing
ability to execute a bundled sales strategy . Growth was reinforced
by the 18 new products launched during the year .
In Europe, we saw strong growth in the Italian and Portuguese
market as a direct result of increased customer focus, and we
were able to maintain our position in the highly competitive
German market. During the year we launched four new products
in the European market.
In the US, we faced increased competition. Nevertheless, we
continue to grow own product sales and are developing a strong
market position for our products, particularly the cephalosporins.
In 2007 we began selling our products to the US government
and won several new contracts with buying groups for 2008. 
We launched two new products in the US market in 2007 and
expect to launch a further three products in multiple dosage
strengths and forms in the first half of 2008.
In 2007 we took the important strategic step of entering the
injectable generic oncology market. In January we acquired
Ribosepharm, a German oncology company specialising in 
the marketing and distribution of branded generic injectable
oncology products. In May , we acquired Thymoorgan, a German
contract manufacturer of lyophilised and liquid injectables for
both oncological and non-oncological uses. 
Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan, now our oncology business,
performed well in 2007, contributing sales of $36.6 million,
which includes approximately $11 million of sales from 
in-licensed products that have been or will be discontinued,
which is in line with expectations at the time of the 
Ribosepharm acquisition.
The sales and marketing team at Ribosepharm is performing 
well in the German injectable oncology market and we are
successfully expanding our oncology product portfolio, 
which now includes 12 marketed products and a pipeline 
of 13 additional products. At Thymoorgan, we commenced 
the manufacture of our first products for the European and
MENA markets.

Deliver
Gross profit of the Injectables business increased by 91.1% to
$54.2 million, compared to $28.3 million in 2006. The Injectable
business’ s gross margin increased to 44.7%, compared to 41.9%
in 2006. The increase in gross margin reflects the contribution of
Ribosepharm, which as a sales and marketing organisation has
higher gross margins than the underlying business. The gross
margin contribution from Ribosepharm more than offset lower
gross margins before the impact of acquisitions resulting from
increasing price competition in Germany , the increase in MENA
tender sales, which have lower margins, and an increase in
overheads and depreciation expense related to our new plant in
Portugal. As we expand production at the new plant in Portugal,
we expect overhead and depreciation expenses to decrease as a
percentage of sales.
Injectable operating profit increased by 53.1% to $20.5 million,
compared to $13.4 million in 2006. Injectable operating margins
decreased to 16.9% in 2007, down from 19.8% in 2006. 
The decrease was driven primarily by the lower underlying gross
margins but also to an increase in operating expenses incurred to
support continued growth across all regions. These operating
expenses include an amortisation charge of $1.6 million related
to the acquisition of intangible assets. In 2008, we expect this
charge will be approximately $2.2 million.
During the year , we focused on developing our Injectables sales
and marketing capabilities across all geographies and ended the
year with 77 sales and marketing representatives in the MENA
Region, and 43 in Europe, including five in Portugal and 33 in
Germany , and 10 in the United States.
Generic Pharmaceuticals
The Generic business contributed 27.7% of total Group 
revenue in 2007, compared to 35.9% in 2006 as the Branded
and Injectables businesses continue to grow both organically 
and through acquisitions. Consistent with 2006, all Generic
revenues were generated in the United States. 
While price competition remained high in 2007, improved sales
efforts and increased demand for key products helped to drive
volume growth. Sales from recently launched products also drove
Generic revenues, which grew by 9.3% in 2007 to 
$124.2 million, compared to $113.7 million in 2006. 
Our sales contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs
(“the VA”), an agency of the government of the United States,
for the supply of Lisinopril expired on 20 December 2007. 
As the VA has not submitted a new solicitation for this product,
we expect volumes to be considerably lower going forward. 
We expect to compensate with sales from products launched 
in 2007 and 2008, but these sales will have lower margins, 
and will result in lower margins going forward for the segment 
as a whole.
Recent additions to strengthen the Generics senior management
team will support the business going forward. A new finance
director was appointed in late 2007 and a new sales and
marketing director was appointed in early 2008. Both have
significant experience in the pharmaceutical industry .
The Generic business received nine ANDA approvals in 
2007, including four for new products. In addition, a total 
of six products were launched during the year . 
Gross profit of the Generic business decreased by 2.0% to 
$58.6 million, compared to $59.8 million in 2006. Gross margin
in the Generic business was 47.2%, compared to 52.6% in
2006. This reflects continued price erosion, as well as changes 
in the product mix.
Generic operating profit decreased by 12.1% to $31.6 million.
Operating profit margins in the Generic business decreased to
25.5% of revenue, compared to 31.7% in 2006. The decrease in
operating margin is attributed to price erosion and the product
mix mentioned above, as the level of operating expenses
remained largely unchanged.
Other businesses 
Other businesses, which include primarily Arab Medical
Containers, a manufacturer of specialised plastic packaging, 
and International Pharmaceuticals Research Centre, which
conducts bio-equivalency studies, had aggregate revenue 
in 2007 of $4.5 million, or 1.0% of total Group revenue. 
Other businesses delivered an operating loss of $3.4 million in
2007, compared to a loss of $1.2 million in 2006, as a result 
of an increase in investment in research and development.  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 24
Finance income and costs
The Group’ s financing income principally comprises interest
income. Financing income decreased by $3.2 million to 
$2.0 million in 2007, compared to $5.3 million in 2006.
Financing costs increased by $5.9 million to $10.8 million,
compared to $5.0 million in 2006. The decrease in finance
income and increase in finance costs was due to the decrease 
in cash and cash equivalents and increase in debt primarily 
as a result of the cash used to finance the acquisitions made
during the year . 
Profit before tax
Profit before taxes for the Group increased by $8.2 million, or
10.8%, to $83.8 million, compared to $75.6 million in 2006. 
Tax
The Group had a tax expense of $19.6 million in 2007. 
The effective tax rate was 23.4%, a year on year decrease 
of 2.6 percentage points. This improvement reflects an increase 
in sales generated in the MENA region.
Minority interest
Hikma’ s minority interest increased to $1.6 million in 2007,
compared to $1.4 million in 2006.
Profit for the year
The Group’ s profit for the year attributable to equity holders of
the parent grew by 14.8% to $62.6 million for the year ended 
31 December 2007, compared to $54.5 million in 2006.
Earnings per share 
Diluted earnings per share for the year to 31 December 2007
were 35.4 cents, up 14.2% from 31.0 cents in 2006. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 4.0 cents per
share (approximately 2.0 pence per share), which will make the
dividend for the full year of 7.5 cents per share, compared to 
7.0 cents per share in 2006. The proposed final dividend will be
paid on 2 June 2008 to shareholders on the register on 2 May
2008, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting.
Operating cash flow and investment
Net cash inflow from operating activities was $45.1 million,
compared to $35.3 million in 2006. Working capital increased 
by $46.9 million, compared to $35.1 million at the end of 2006,
primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventory in line
with historic sales and planned growth.
T rade receivables increased by 59.1% compared to 31 December
2006 largely as a result of acquisitions in addition to organic sales
growth. Excluding acquisitions
1
, receivable days stood at 125 days
as at 31 December 2007, compared to 126 days at 31 December
2006, indicating steady receivable growth in line with sales. 
Inventory increased by 76.4% compared to 31 December 2006,
due to acquisitions and the necessity to support planned growth
in sales. Excluding acquisitions
1
, inventory days stood at 
207 days as at 31 December 2007, compared to 193 days 
at 31 December 2006.
Net cash used for investing activities was $350.9 million,
compared to $72.7 million in 2006. The most significant
component of investment activity during the year was acquisition
related: $73.6 million paid for the acquisitions of Ribosepharm
and Thymoorgan, $61.1 million paid for Alkan Pharma in 
Egypt and $167.4 million paid for Arab Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing in Jordan. In addition, capital expenditure
amounted to $50.4 million, compared to $49.7 million in 
2006. This expenditure relates primarily to expansion projects 
in the Branded and Injectables businesses. During the year the
Group also made regular investments to upgrade and maintain
existing facilities. 
On 17 January 2008 we successfully raised gross proceeds of
£81.6 million (approximately $160 million) in an equity placing 
of shares, funding the acquisition of APM, strengthening our
balance sheet and and enhancing our flexibility to finance 
future growth. 
Outlook
In 2008, we are expecting revenue growth of between 35% 
and 40%, supported by organic growth and by the acquisitions
and investments we have made over the past two years. 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 47%.
In our Branded business, we expect to continue to deliver strong
organic growth. We expect further growth to come from the
acquisitions we have made in the MENA region, which are
performing extremely well. We now have over 1,000 Branded
sales and marketing staff in place across the MENA region, 
an enhanced product portfolio and broad manufacturing
capabilities to drive and support this growth. 
In our US Generics business, we expect sales in 2008 to be
broadly in line with that achieved in 2007, and expect continued
pricing pressure and significant gross margin erosion. Looking
ahead, we will work to grow this business through the recent
strengthening of the management team, increasing focus on
higher margin, niche products, dedicating additional capacity in
low cost countries and concentrating on acquiring lower cost API. 
Financial performance Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 25
In our global Injectables business, we expect strong growth driven
by new product launches, further penetration of our existing
product portfolio and from our new oncology business, as we
build our product portfolio and launch these products into 
new markets in Europe and MENA. We also expect to deliver
improving operating margins in this business, as we benefit 
from increasing economies of scale.
We are confident of delivering another year of strong
performance in 2008 driven by our Branded and Injectable
businesses as we continue to grow Hikma into a leading 
speciality pharmaceutical company .

Risk management
Operational risks
There are a number of factors that have or could in the future
affect the Group’ s results of operations, including the following:
Regulatory 
In common with other companies operating in the
pharmaceutical industry , Hikma is subject to extensive regulation
in all its markets. There is no single worldwide harmonised set of
regulations relating to the development, manufacture and sale 
of pharmaceutical products and we are, therefore, subject to
different laws, regulations and codes depending on the regions
or countries in which our businesses operate.
Industry, economic and political dynamics.
The Group operates in diverse markets and geographic regions
and is therefore subject to diverse industry , economic and political
dynamics. However , we believe the geographic spread of our
operations gives the Group unique strength and ﬂexibility , and
also lessens the impact on the Group’ s results and ﬁnancial
condition of any disruption in, or any other extraordinary events
at, any one of our three businesses or a change in the economic
conditions or political environment or sustained civil unrest in any
particular market or country .
Pricing dynamics
Pricing for the Group’ s products reﬂects a variety of factors,
including changes in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (“API”)
and other raw material costs, intensity of competition, industry
practice, governmental regulation and general market conditions.
Generic pharmaceutical markets in the United States and Europe
are extremely competitive and/or regulated by governments, 
both of which result in downward pressure on prices. We aim 
to maximise the margins we achieve on our products through
competitive pricing strategies, together with initiatives to
minimise raw material and other manufacturing and 
operating costs.
Government tender bids
Whilst the majority of Group sales have been to the private
sector , each of our three businesses participates in government
tenders. The timing and outcome of these tenders are
unpredictable, and the Group’ s results could be affected by the
gain or loss of a signiﬁcant government contract.
Research and development and commercialisation 
of new products
The Group’ s results of operations may be impacted signiﬁcantly
by the timeliness of its research and development and product
commercialisation activities. In order to bring a drug to market
successfully , the Group must identify products for which it can
generate attractive margins and growth, undertake the required
research and development and obtain regulatory approvals.
Additional costs may be incurred, and sales opportunities lost, 
if there is any signiﬁcant delay in any of these steps. Given the
importance of research and development, Hikma has expanded
its investment in research and development, particularly in Jordan
where it can beneﬁt from lower labour and bio-equivalency costs. 
Financial performance API and other raw material costs
Raw material costs represented over 30% of the Group’ s net
sales in the year ended 31 December 2007, with the most
signiﬁcant portion of these costs relating to APIs. Whilst the prices
of the APIs that the Group uses have in general fallen in recent
years, these prices are volatile and can vary signiﬁcantly from
supplier to supplier . In some cases, increase in API and other raw
material costs may not be able to be passed on to customers and
can therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’ s results of
operations. Hikma has a dedicated API sourcing function that 
has been successful in sourcing lower cost API’ s through more
competitive suppliers in Asia.
Seasonality
The Group’ s business, in particular the Branded Pharmaceuticals
business, is seasonal, and it generally experiences higher net sales
and net proﬁt in the ﬁrst half of each ﬁnancial year , as compared
to the second half of its ﬁnancial year . Accordingly , the Group’ s
outstanding borrowings historically have been higher during the
ﬁrst half of the ﬁnancial year in order to ﬁnance the working
capital requirements of the Group.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions remain a key part of the Group’ s strategy to develop
and grow its business. The risks associated with this include the
availability of suitable acquisition candidates and assimilating 
and integrating acquired companies into the Group. Other risks
include delays in implementation or unexpected costs or liabilities,
as well as the risk of failing to realise operating beneﬁts or
synergies from completed transactions. The Group mitigates
these risks by implementing a structured integration process
which can include placing experienced management into the
acquired company to effect the swift installation of internal
controls and by subjecting management processes to close
monitoring and review by internal audit and senior management.
Financial risks
The Group T reasurer is responsible for Financial Risk Management
and setting the appropriate controls and risk policies. He is
supported by treasury and budgeting managers at the 
operating company and segmental levels, and reports to the
Chief Financial Officer .
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group uses the USD as its reporting currency and is therefore
exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in European,
Algerian and Sudanese currencies. Consequently , it enters into
various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates
change, to preserve the value of assets and proﬁtability . Using
these derivative ﬁnancial instruments has not had a material
impact on the Group’ s ﬁnancial position at 31 December 2007.
See Note 28 to the Group’ s consolidated ﬁnancial statements for
a description of the Group’ s Foreign Exchange risks.
Interest rate risk 
The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by
changing the proportion of ﬁxed rate debt and variable rate debt
in its total debt portfolio. T o manage this mix the Group may
enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges
the periodic payments based on notional amounts and agreed
upon ﬁxed and variable interest rates. Using these swap
agreements has not had a material impact on the Group’ s
ﬁnancial position at 31 December 2007. See Note 28 to the
Group’ s consolidated ﬁnancial statements for a description of 
the Group’ s interest rate risks.
Credit risk 
In most cases, the Group grants its buyers credit terms for
settlement of sales invoices. Credit risk is managed through 
the Group Credit policy and the use of various ﬁnancial
instruments such as letters of credit, factoring and credit
insurance arrangements. Further details are set out in Note 28
of the Group’ s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Liquidity risk
The Group has constant ﬁnancing requirements, both for 
short-term working capital needs and for long-term strategic
plans. Corporate T reasury ensures the Group debt/capital
structure and banking arrangements can accommodate these
ﬁnancing needs. Corporate T reasury also endeavours to efﬁciently
utilise excess liquidity from one subsidiary to another , while
complying with any foreign currency , legal or tax restrictions.
Inflation risk
Hikma believes it is not subject to material risk due to inflation in
any of its core markets at present.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
The Group’ s accounting policies are more fully described in 
Note 2 of the Group’ s consolidated financial statements.
However , certain of the Group’ s accounting policies are
particularly important to the presentation of the Group’ s 
results and require the application of significant judgement 
by the Group’ s management. 
In applying these policies, the Group’ s management uses its
judgement to determine the appropriate assumption to be 
used in the determination of certain estimates used in the
preparation of the Group’ s results. These estimates are based on
the Group’ s previous experience, the terms of existing contracts,
information available from other outside sources and other
factors, as appropriate.
The Group’ s management believes that, among others, the
following accounting policies that involve management
judgements and estimates are the most critical to understanding
and evaluating the Group’ s financial results.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents sales of products to external third parties 
and excludes inter-company income and value added taxes. 
Sales of goods are recognised when the risk of loss and title are
transferred to customers and reliable estimates can be made of
relevant deductions. The Group’ s revenue recognition policies
require management to make a number of estimates, with the
most significant relating to charge backs, product returns, rebates
and price adjustments which vary by product arrangements and
buying groups.

and Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing.

Financial performance 
Charge backs
The provision for charge backs is the most signiﬁcant and
complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. In the US,
the Group sells its products directly to wholesalers, generic
distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies.
The Group also sells its products indirectly to independent
pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and group
purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as “indirect
customers”. The Group enters into agreements with its indirect
customers to establish pricing for certain products. The indirect
customers then independently select a wholesaler from which
they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices. The Group 
will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between
the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the
wholesaler’ s invoice price. This credit is called a charge back. 
The provision for charge backs is based on historical sell-through
levels by the Group’ s wholesale customers to the indirect
customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory levels. As sales 
are made to the large wholesalers, the Group continually
monitors the reserve for charge backs and makes adjustments
when it believes that actual charge backs may differ from
estimated reserves.
Accounts receivable and bad debts
The Group estimates, based on its historical experience, the level
of debts that it believes will not be collected. Such estimates are
made when collection of the full amount of the debt is no longer
probable. These estimates are based on a number of factors
including specific customer issues and industry , economic and
political conditions. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group has signiﬁcant investments in goodwill and intangible
assets as a result of acquisitions of businesses and purchases of
assets such as product development and marketing rights.
Under IFRS, goodwill and intangibles with indeﬁnite useful
economic lives are held at cost and tested annually for
impairment, whilst the remaining intangibles are amortised over
their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are reviewed
annually and impairment reviews are undertaken if events occur
which indicate an impairment to the carrying values of the assets.
Purchases of intellectual property and product rights to
supplement our R&D portfolio are capitalised as intangible assets.
Such intangible assets are amortised from the launch of the
underlying products and are tested for impairment. This policy is
in line with practice adopted by other major pharmaceutical

Contingent liabilities
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may 
arise from product-speciﬁc and general legal proceedings, from
guarantees or from environmental liabilities connected with our
current or former sites. These potential liabilities are considered 
to have a remote probability of crystallising and are therefore
treated as contingent liabilities in the Group ﬁnancial statements,
and accordingly disclosed in Note 37. Although there can be no
assurance regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, we do
not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on our
ﬁnancial position or proﬁtability . 
Tax
The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and
regulations prevailing in the countries where it operates and the
likelihood of settlement. The tax expense represents the sum of
the current and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based
on taxable proﬁt for the year . T axable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt
as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’ s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date. transform Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 29

Corporate and social responsibility report 
2007 has been a very successful year for our CSR
programme, and all of the people who have helped to
make this happen should be proud of their contribution 
to the future of our Company.
When Hikma was established in 1979, our founders
brought with them a set of strong ethical values. 
A commitment to these values has always guided 
our decision-making, and helped to ensure that we
consider the broader social, environmental and 
economic context in which we operate.
Today, our CSR programme is an important part of our
strategic commitment to our core values. These values
complement our strong governance and excellent
management practices.
We know that our ﬁnancial success rests on a foundation
of non-ﬁnancial performance. The stronger our reputation,
the better our ability to attract, train and retain the 
best employees, the more efﬁciently we use increasingly
scarce resources and the more links we have with local
communities. As a result, the greater our opportunities 
for success in the broader context of our stakeholders.
As the Board member with responsibility for CSR, I am
pleased to introduce this year’s review of progress. 
I also look forward to working with our CSR Core
Committee and CSR Champions to fulﬁl our commitments
in the year ahead.
Mazen Darwazah
Executive Vice-Chairman, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC
Introduction
We remain of the belief that we cannot achieve our long-term
goals without maintaining a commitment to quality . It is a key
business objective to operate responsibly , and to achieve our
commercial aims within the framework of our responsibilities 
to a broad range of stakeholders. This is especially true when it
comes to our people and our organisation. Over the 30 years
since Hikma was established, we have grown into a successful
global company while maintaining the strong ethical principles
held by our founder . We believe that retaining these values is 
as important to our future success as it has been to our
development so far . In the past, it had been enough that these
core values were implicit, but in 2006, with a fast expanding
group, we recognised that a more structured approach was
required to ensure that we continue to consistently operate 
under these corporate values. Our continuing commitment to
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is our strategic response to
this end.
A structured approach to CSR
Hikma’ s approach to the management and growth of its business
has always been guided by its ethical standards and core values.
In 2006 we initiated the process of developing a more structured
approach, through the implementation of a group-wide CSR
programme. A key achievement in 2007 has been the integration
of CSR in our governance system, and the development of the
operational capacity needed to implement CSR consistently
across our major manufacturing sites. CSR is now addressed at
key subsidiary level, with corporate support and reporting lines 
to the Board of Directors, where major policies are approved
before implementation at the operational level.
Our CSR Core Committee (“the Committee”) oversees the
development and implementation of CSR-related policies,
programmes and activities. Its membership is drawn from senior
management and our various operating subsidiaries, and is
headed by a dedicated CSR Manager who reports directly to 
the Executive Vice Chairman, Mazen Darwazah. The Committee
meets monthly and co-ordinates the management,
implementation and dissemination of information to the
subsidiary-based CSR champions for onward communication 
to our staff.
The formalisation of our approach to CSR has led to the
development in 2007 of some of the ﬁrst group-wide policies
that will apply across all units. This process began in 2006, with
implementation of a Code of Conduct, applicable to all
employees, including Directors. In 2007, the Board approved
additional Group-wide policies in areas such as Health & Safety
and the Environment. During 2007 we established an internal network of CSR
Champions, starting with our main manufacturing facilities. 
This network is responsible for implementing CSR policies 
at a subsidiary level, as well as reporting to the Committee and
CSR Manager . We now have CSR Champions in place at six sites
– two in Jordan and one each in Portugal, Algeria, the US and
Saudi Arabia. We are in the process of training and appointing 
a CSR Champion in Egypt and will be making appointments at
our other newly acquired subsidiaries.
Our network of CSR Champions enables us to share the learning
from our six priority sites, so we can improve the effectiveness 
of our CSR programmes across the Group. T wo formal meetings
of the CSR Champions were held in 2007 to ensure a consistent
understanding of our approach and priorities, and to provide the
information and resources they will need to achieve our goals.
The ﬁrst of these meetings was a training session held by our 
CSR Manager to provide an initial introduction to CSR. 
The second session was a facilitated workshop during which 
the CSR Champions reviewed activities to date, shared their
experiences of implementing local CSR activities and developed
future targets and work plans.
The company also has an Ethics Committee which aims to
monitor the ethical integrity of the Group across all areas 
of our business, and is responsible for the review and approval 
of statements and policies on ethics, conduct, values and
principles within the Group. This committee is chaired by 
Michael Ashton, an independent non-executive director .
Building on International Best Practice
As the concept of CSR is relatively new in many of the countries
in which we operate, we have drawn guidance from existing
international best-practice. We are using the Global Reporting
Initiative’ s G3 guidelines to help inform our approach to
reporting. These guidelines have been particularly useful in
helping to develop a consistent group-wide approach to
measuring performance and setting targets for improvement.
While our reporting systems are still being reﬁned, we are happy
to present some of our ﬁrst group-wide data in this report.
Additional information will be available on our website during
2008, and we aim to obtain G3 application level C.
In 2007 we also became one of seven founding members of the
United Nations Global Compact in Jordan. The Global Compact
network includes over 3,000 company members from over 100
countries, and is based on a framework of ten universally
accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour , the
environment and anti-corruption. Our membership gives us the
opportunity to engage with companies at both a local and global
level, providing us with the opportunity to improve regional
understanding of CSR issues by sharing our knowledge and
expertise, as well as providing us with learning opportunities and
tools for implementation.
Progress to date
The following information provides an overview of our
achievements in 2007 and outlines some of the initiatives 
we have planned for 2008. As our CSR programme develops 
we will seek to expand its reach to all manufacturing facilities
across the Group.
Health and Safety
Our top priorities are to ensure that we provide a safe working
environment and the necessary training for our people to achieve
their potential. 
In 2007 we developed our first Group-wide Health and Safety
policy . This policy builds on the country-specific policies which
were already in place. In 2008, a Health, Safety and Environment
(HSE) supervisor will be appointed to each of our main units and
will be responsible for implementing these policies. In addition, 
all employees at these manufacturing sites will be trained on the
corporate Health and Safety policy . 
Health and Safety has been one of our data gathering priorities
and the data gathering process is already helping us to develop
focused procedures to help us achieve our target eliminating
occupational injuries.
Initiatives launched in 2007:
• Jordan: Providing health insurance for all employees.
• US: Hired external specialists to conduct safety and 
technical training.
• US: Working on an initiative to reduce injuries.
• Saudi Arabia: Included CSR in training programmes.

People
Hikma has always placed a high importance on our employees
and on employee development. Dedication to the welfare,
education and quality of life of our employees is engrained in 
our core values. Our research and development, production 
and management processes depend on a highly-trained,
experienced and committed workforce. With the introduction 
of data gathering on training, we expect to be able to better
align employee development with achieving our business goals. 
During 2007, we continued to invest in ongoing education 
for eligible employees under our Continuing Education Scheme,
which support employees in fully-funded further education
programmes. In addition, we continued to support talented
students, providing access to appropriate educational resources.
Initiatives launched in 2007:
• Jordan: Working towards OHSAS 18001 certification at one 
of our facilities.
• US: Conducting quality control training on a monthly basis.
• US: Implementing a training and corrective action system,
which will identify and allocate training more efficiently .
Ethics
Pharmaceutical companies owe an extraordinary duty of care 
to their customers, and to the patients using their products.
Honesty , integrity and adhering to the highest ethical standards
are three of our core values and key to our business success. 
Our Ethics Committee has Board-level representation, and
oversees the development and implementation of our 
ethics programme.
As reported in 2006, we have adopted a Corporate Code of
Conduct (“the code”) for our employees. In 2007 we ensured
that this Code was widely circulated, read and signed by
management and corporate staff. We have also developed and
implemented a training programme for Hikma’ s anti-corruption
policy in which over 200 managers have been trained and will in
turn, train their employees. As a signatory to Partnering Against
Corruption Initiatives (PACI), we have made a public commitment
to zero tolerance towards all forms of corruption and bribery .
In 2008, we will launch an anti-corruption manual to help
employees identify and avoid areas of high risk. This will be
supplemented by additional training and broader explanation 
of our conﬁdential whistleblowing policy , which was previously
approved by the Board and implemented.
As part of our commitment to ethical standards, we are 
working with our suppliers to understand their Human Rights
and Environmental Policies. We have started this work by
contacting our signiﬁcant suppliers for each of the key
manufacturing sites. Where necessary , we will work with 
our suppliers to help them meet our requirements.
T argets for 2008: 
• Undertake regular training on anti-corruption policies and
procedures at our main manufacturing sites.
• Launch an anti-corruption manual and provide training 
on whistleblowing.
Environment
Care and preservation of our environment is one of our core
values. We also gain a business beneﬁt through greater efﬁciency
and control of resource input costs. In 2007 we adopted a
Group-wide environmental policy , which will help us to embed
environmental efﬁciency into our operations. Our main
environmental impacts are in the area of energy consumption,
water usage, and waste production. We are working on ways 
to minimise all three of these impacts.
One of our major accomplishments in 2007 has been the
collection for the ﬁrst time of consistent data on energy usage,
water usage and waste production at our main production sites.
Gathering the data has helped to raise awareness of our resource
use and promote action. Our sites have increased recycling or
moved towards incineration as opposed to putting waste to
landﬁll. 2007 also saw two of our Jordanian facilities working
towards ISO 14001 certiﬁcation.
Our manufacturing and operations are energy intensive, and 
we will continue to investigate ways to reduce our energy use. 
At several sites we are looking at solar energy generation to
reduce our reliance on carbon dioxide producing fossil fuels. 
We are also starting to implement energy efﬁciency projects,
including energy saving lighting, more efﬁcient variable frequency
drive air compressors, increased insulation, and more efﬁcient
ofﬁce equipment.
Many of our sites are located in arid countries where water
scarcity is a pressing concern. Supported by our monitoring 
and measurement process, we have programmes in place across
our sites to minimise water usage and to decrease water waste.
In some instances, these programmes may require the installation
of new equipment that is more water efficient. We also clean
waste water where possible before returning it to external
treatment plants.
Another priority is waste reduction. We manage our waste
responsibly and continually look for further opportunities to

reduce resource inputs as well as to reduce waste. Although
hazardous waste and other production waste had always been
measured and appropriately disposed of, our focus on gathering
data has led to a greater level of awareness, which has in turn led
to increased waste reduction and recycling of non-hazardous
waste. In addition we continue our multi-site commitment to
steel, aluminium, cardboard, plastic, paper and glass recycling.
Initiatives launched in 2007:
• Jordan: Installed photocell mixers and purchased new energy
efficient variable frequency air compressor .
• US: Replaced fast coaters and drying ovens with more energy
efficient models.
• Algeria: Reduced the amount of cardboard and plastics that
go to landfill by 80%.
• Portugal: Purchased energy efficient equipment and increased
water recycling.
T argets for 2008:
• Achieve ISO 14001 certification at two facilities in Jordan. 
• Investigate solar energy use at facilities in Jordan, Portugal 
and Algeria.
• Investigate purchasing renewable energy in the US.
• Centralise the system for recycling of plastics, carton and 
paper at facilities in Portugal, Jordan and Algeria.
Community
Investment in the communities in which we work is a core 
value at Hikma. From our heritage as a family-owned company ,
we recognise the importance of taking care of the communities
that surround us. We see ourselves as an integral part of our
communities, and we are committed to making those
communities better for everyone who lives there. 
Education is at the heart of Hikma’ s commitment to society . 
We co-operate with local universities and professional colleges 
in on-site student training, site visits and assistance with 
research projects.
We continue to work with a host of local charities and have
invested time and funds into local projects. We remain
committed to encouraging Group-wide employee involvement 
in our work with charities to build strong, ongoing relationships.
In particular , in 2007 we worked with Tkiyet Um Ali, a non-
governmental organisation helping to eradicate hunger in Jordan.
Charitable donations constitute another part of Hikma’ s 
role within our communities. In 2007, we donated a total of
$700,000 in cash, most of which went to the King Abdullah
Fund for Development which seeks to alleviate poverty in Jordan.
The medical donations worth $592,000 were mostly made
through the Hashemite Rescue Committee, which offers relief 
to disaster stricken areas such as Bangladesh. Other medical
donations were made to physicians organising free medical days.
Initiatives launched in 2007:
• Jordan: Partnered with national universities and colleges 
to allow students to train at our facilities and to undertake
technical research projects.
• Algeria: Organised a 10-day event for Algerian women
working from home. This event gave them the opportunity 
to exhibit and sell their wares, and was supported by the
Algerian national agency for small loans.
• US: Donated test equipment to support science in 
primary education.
• Jordan: Donated $25,000 worth of medicines for Africa Mercy ,
a project undertaken by Mercy Ships to improve the healthcare
capacity of African countries by providing medical training and
surgical services.
T argets for 2008:
• All of the main units will organise an annual Hikma
volunteering day , supported by the CSR Champions. 
The theme for 2008 will be raising cancer awareness.

material investment decisions, acquisitions and divestments, 
and review of the effectiveness of the Group’ s systems of 
internal control.
Except for the matters formally reserved for the Board, and 
in accordance with the Company’ s Articles of Association, 
the Board has delegated responsibility for the management of
the Group, through the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , to its executive 
management team.
Composition of the Board
A majority of the Board comprises Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board currently comprises of the Non-Executive Chairman,
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , the Executive Vice-Chairman and 
ﬁve Non-Executive Directors. The names of the Directors and their
biographical details are set out on page 35. The Chairman and
the Executive Vice-Chairman were appointed to the Board on the
incorporation of the Company on 8 September 2005. The Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer was appointed to the Board on 1 July 2007, and
save for Ronald Goode, who joined the Board on 12 December
2006, each of the Non-Executive Directors joined the Board prior
to the Company’ s listing on the London Stock Exchange, 
on 14 October 2005.
On 1 July 2007, on the recommendation of the Nomination
Committee, the Board appointed Said Darwazah as the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer of the Company . On this appointment, Samih
Darwazah relinquished his role as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , and 
now continues to serve the Company as its Non-Executive
Chairman. Previously , the Company had combined the roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , both these roles having
been held by Samih Darwazah, the founder of the Group.
Prior to his relinquishing the role of Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , the
Board believed that the unparalleled experience brought to the
Group by Samih Darwazah, being both its founder and its leader
through the transition from private to public company , justiﬁed
his holding the positions of both Chairman and Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer . On the appointment of Said Darwazah as Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer , the Board undertook consultation with its 
major shareholders and in conjunction with external advisers
concluded that his former executive role with the Company
should not preclude Samih Darwazah from continuing to 
give important guidance to the Group through the Board as 
its Non-Executive Chairman.
On the appointment of its new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , the Board
adopted written guidelines on the separation of the roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer .
Each of Michael Ashton, Breffni Byrne, Ronald Goode and 
Sir David Rowe-Ham are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The ﬁfth Non-Executive Director , Ali Al-Husry , who continues to
bring broad ﬁnancial experience to the Board as well as a 
detailed knowledge of the MENA region which is signiﬁcant 
to the Group’ s business, is not treated as being independent 
as a result of his close links to the Darwazah family through
Darhold Limited, the Company’ s largest shareholder .
During the year under review, the Company has complied 
with the Combined Code requirement that at least half of the
Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent
Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors who have
diverse business backgrounds, skills and experience bring
independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy ,
performance, resources, key appointments, standards of conduct
and other matters presented to the Board.
The Senior Independent Director is Sir David Rowe-Ham.
Board procedures and support
The Group’ s Board procedures require the provision of regular
and necessary management information to Directors to enable
them to fulﬁl their duties, with full Board papers circulated in
advance of Board and Committee meetings. The Company
Secretary is charged with ensuring good information ﬂow within
the Board and its committees, so that appropriate levels of
information are provided in a timely manner to the Board before
making decisions.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary , who is responsible for ensuring that good
board procedures are followed and for advising the Board
through the Chairman on all matters of corporate governance to
maintain compliance throughout the Group. The appointment
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for
the Board. T o the extent necessary , the Directors are able to
obtain independent professional advice at the Company’ s
expense in the performance of their duties as Directors.
Corporate Governance report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 37
Board meetings
During the year under review, the Board held eight scheduled
meetings and three other meetings. The Company Secretary
attended all Board meetings and Committee meetings. 
A table showing attendance at these meetings is set out below.
All directors attended meetings of the Board and committees of
which they are members unless, in the case of additional
meetings called on short notice, prevented from doing so by prior
commitments. Where Directors are not able to attend such
meetings as a result of conﬂicts in their schedule, they receive 
and read the papers for consideration at that meeting, relay 
their comments in advance and, if necessary , follow up with 
the Chairman on the decisions taken.

The Directors maintain a close dialogue between Board meetings,
ensuring that, amongst other things, the Non-Executive Directors
are kept up to date with major developments in the Group’ s
business. Visits by each of the Non-Executive Directors to the
Group’ s main facilities in the MENA region, the United States and
Europe help to reinforce the Board’ s understanding of the key
business issues facing the Group.
Board performance evaluation
All Directors other than Ronald Goode, who was elected by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 6 June
2007, were elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General
Meeting, held on 25 May 2006. Said Darwazah will be subject to
election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be
held on 15 May 2008. All Directors are subject to re-election at
intervals of no more than three years. Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed for an initial term of three years, which can be
renewed and extended for not more than two further 
three-year terms.
The Chairman believes that the Non-Executive Directors continue
to bring a balance of skill and experience to the Board, and have
shown themselves to discharge their roles effectively and with
commitment to their respective roles and to the strategic aims of
the Group. Biographies of the Non-Executive Directors are set out
on page 34.
As required by the Combined Code, a formal evaluation of the
performance of the Board, the Chairman, the Committee
Chairmen and the individual Non-Executive Directors was
undertaken during the period under review.
The evaluation process was led by the Senior Independent
Director , who met with each of the Non-Executive Directors and
the Committee Chairmen to undertake a formal appraisal of 
the performance of the Board, its committees and each of the
individual Directors. These discussions focused on Board and
Committee performance, membership, timetabling, internal and
external support, the quality and timely availability of relevant
Board information and the contribution of, preparation for and
performance by individual Directors at Board and Committee
meetings. The results of the evaluation process and feedback
were reviewed with the Chairman and formed part of his
appraisal of the overall effectiveness of the Board and its
members. Overall the review concluded that the Board functions
well, with good communication, and with issues raised in 
good time to allow for consultation, debate and effective 
decision-making.
In addition to the matters set out above in respect of all Directors,
the Senior Independent Director met with the non-executive
directors to undertake a formal appraisal of the performance of
the Chairman. This review also addressed the effectiveness of his
leadership, the setting of the Board agenda, communication with
shareholders, internal communication and Board efﬁciency .

Dialogue with shareholders
Ongoing communication with shareholders is a high priority .

webcast and disseminated on the Company’ s website.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , Executive Vice-Chairman, Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer and other senior corporate executives have 
all participated in this investor programme during the period
under review.

question the Board and committees at the Annual General
Meeting. The Company maintains a website (www.hikma.com)
containing ﬁnancial and other information which is updated
regularly . Additionally , the Company presents a balanced view 
of the Group’ s performance and prospects through the release 
of appropriate press announcements and other updates.
Corporate Governance report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 38
The Board is kept updated on the views of shareholders and 
the market in general through the feedback from the investor
meeting programme and results presentations. Analysts’ reports
are circulated to the Board members together with monthly
Investor Relations Reports. The Senior Independent Director has
undertaken to be available to shareholders if they have a concern
that cannot be appropriately addressed through the Chairman.
Board committees
In accordance with the principles of good corporate governance
and in compliance with the Combined Code and the Markets
Law, the Board maintains three committees – the Audit
Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration
Committee. The Group also has an Executive Committee
comprising the Executive Directors and senior management of
the Group, and an Ethics Committee, which draws its members
from the Board and the senior management of the Group.
Each of the three Combined Code committees has terms of
reference, which were reviewed during the year . Copies are
published on the corporate website at www.hikma.com. 
Their Chairmen give regular reports of the committees’ business
to the Board.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of two independent 
Non-Executive Directors – Sir David Rowe-Ham (Committee
Chairman) and Michael Ashton – and the Executive Vice-
Chairman, Mazen Darwazah. As required by the Corporate
Governance Principles, the majority of the members of the
Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors and an
independent Non-Executive Director holds the Chairmanship 
of the committee.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for succession
planning and for ensuring that all appointments to the Board are
made on objective criteria. In accordance with its terms of
reference, the Committee is required to take into account the
skills, knowledge and experience of the Board in making its
decisions and is able to use external search ﬁrms or open
advertising to compile shortlists of candidates for the Board.
It is also charged with reviewing the appropriateness of the 
size, structure and composition of the Board.
The Nomination Committee met three times during the year ,
with full attendance, to review overall Board structure and
composition and to recommend the appointment of a new 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer . The Committee undertook extensive
discussions with the Group’ s advisers in respect of this
appointment and conducted a directed consultation process 
with major shareholders, culminating in the recommendation of
the appointment of Said Darwazah as the new Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer of the Company .
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the Company’ s 
four independent Non-Executive Directors – Michael Ashton
(Committee Chairman), Breffni Byrne, Sir David Rowe-Ham and

with the membership requirements laid out in the Corporate
Governance Principles.

attendance. The Committee is responsible for setting and
reviewing executive remuneration and that of the Company
Secretary and is able to take advice from external consultants
when required. A full report on the role of the Remuneration

the Group’ s business. Thus, the Committee is responsible for the
review and approval of statements and policies on ethics,
conduct, values and principles within the Group.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’ s systems of
internal control and risk management and has complied with the
requirements of the Corporate Governance Principles in
establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the risks the Group faces. The Board is responsible for
monitoring the effectiveness of these systems on an ongoing
basis and, at least annually , conducting a formal review of the
Group’ s policies on internal control. The system of internal control
provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The key elements are as follows:
� An organisational structure with clear operating and reporting
procedures, authorisation limits, segregation of duties and
delegated authority;
� Annual budgets, updated forecasting, and long-term business
plans for the Group that identify risks and opportunities which
are reviewed and approved by the Board;
� A comprehensive system of internal financial reporting which
includes regular comparison of financial results and key
performance indicators against budget, informed by
management commentary;
Corporate Governance report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 39
� A clearly defined process for controlling capital expenditure
and other financial commitments, including appropriate
authorisation levels, which are monitored and approved by 
the Board on an ongoing basis;
� Written policies on procedures for all material functional areas
with specific responsibility allocated to individual managers.
During the year under review, Ernst & Y oung continued its
management and execution of the Group’ s internal audit
function on a global basis under a three year contract which
commenced in 2006. This involves a risk-driven approach to
internal audit which is overseen by the Audit Committee. 
The internal audit process focuses on reviewing areas of business
risk, internal controls ﬁnancial reporting and other systems in the
Company’ s main subsidiaries and at the corporate level, with
regular reports of its ﬁndings made to the Audit Committee.
Ernst & Y oung have direct access to the Audit Committee and
the Board Chairman.
The Board conﬁrms that, in accordance with the requirements 
of the Corporate Governance Principles, a review of the
effectiveness of the Group’ s systems of internal controls was
conducted during the year .
Insurance
The Company maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and
Officers’ insurance in respect of action taken against Directors.
Additionally , in accordance with Hikma’ s Articles of Association,
to the extent permitted by law, Directors are granted an
indemnity from the Company in respect of liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office.
Compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
During the year under review, the Company applied the
principles set out in section 1 of the Combined Code, including
both the main principles and the supporting principles, and the
corporate governance principles set out in the Markets Law. 
At the year end the Company was in full compliance with the
Corporate Governance Principles. However , consistent with the
prior year and for the reasons outlined above, the founder of the
Group, Mr Samih Darwazah, occupied the roles of both Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman for the first half of the year 
under review.

The Board believes that the Group has adequate resources to
continue operating for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
it will adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Composition
Hikma’ s Audit Committee comprises four members – Breffni
Byrne, Michael Ashton, Sir David Rowe-Ham, and Ronald Goode
– all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors, and
whose qualifications are set out on page 34. The committee is
chaired by Breffni Byrne, who is a chartered accountant and who
is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial
experience. No members of the Committee have links with the
Company’ s external auditors. The Company therefore considers
that it complies with the Corporate Governance Principles
regarding the composition of the Audit Committee. 
The Committee Chairman receives additional remuneration 
to compensate him for his additional responsibilities.
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its
responsibilities with regard to financial reporting, external and
internal audit and internal control. This includes reviewing the
Company’ s annual financial statements, interim report and
trading updates, reviewing and monitoring the extent of 
non-audit work undertaken by external auditors, and monitoring
the effectiveness and output of the Company’ s internal 
audit activities, internal controls and risk management 
systems. The Audit Committee is also responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditors, as well as
the effectiveness of the audit process. The ultimate responsibility
for reviewing and approving the annual report and financial
statements and the half-yearly reports remains with the Board.
Meetings
The Audit Committee met eight times during the year under
review, with the Chief Financial Officer and the Company
Secretary in attendance. The Audit Committee reviewed the
2006 annual report and financial statements, the 2007 interim
report and each of the regulatory statements made by the
Company in respect of trading and results issued during the year .
The Committee also reviewed and approved the audit plans for
2007 for both internal and external auditors and the related
scope of internal audit work to be undertaken. The Committee
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’ s internal controls and
risk management processes and the disclosures made in the
annual report and financial statements on these matters. 
The Committee also reviewed its own terms of reference and
general effectiveness, both specifically and in the context of the
overall annual review of corporate governance matters
conducted by the Company .
The Group’ s external auditors, Deloitte and T ouche LLP , attended
four Audit Committee meetings for the purposes of presenting
their 2006 audit results and findings, the results of the 2007
interim review and their audit plan for 2007. The internal
auditors, Ernst & Y oung presented their 2007 audit plan and
summary findings of their work to the Audit Committee, who
continue to review the response by management, proposed
action plans and the overall effectiveness of the internal audit
function. In accordance with the Combined Code, the Audit
Committee also met with the Group’ s external auditor and
internal auditor without executive management present.
Audit Committee report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 41
In addition, the Audit Committee Chairman met with the
external auditor in the United States and also in Germany
following the acquisition of Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan
during the year . The Audit Committee Chairman also met with
Ernst & Y oung in late 2007 to discuss the scope of the 2008
internal audit programme.
Attendance of members at Audit Committee meetings is shown
on page 37 of the report on corporate governance.
External auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development,
implementation and monitoring of the Group’ s policy on external
audit, and has adopted a policy in relation to the provision of
non-audit services by the external auditors.
Fees paid in respect of audit, audit-related and non-audit 
services are outlined in Note 4 to the Group financial statements.
Audit-related services are services carried out by the external
auditor by virtue of its role as auditor and principally include
assurance-related work and accounting advice.
In line with audit independence requirements the external auditor
does not provide services such as information system design and
valuation or advocacy work which could be considered to be
inconsistent with the audit role. In addition audit related and 
non-related services provided by the external auditor in excess 
of certain monetary limits require prior approval by the Audit
Committee. The Committee has reviewed the non-audit services
provided by the external auditor and is satisfied that the nature of
these services has not compromised the auditor’ s independence.
A policy has also been adopted whereby prior approval by the
Audit Committee is required before the recruitment of a senior
member of the audit team or the recruitment of an employee 
of the external auditors to a senior finance position within 
the Group.
The Group Whistleblowing Policy contains arrangements for the
Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Senior Independent
Director , and Ronald Goode (as a US-based member of the Audit
Committee) to receive, in confidence, complaints on accounting,
risk issues, internal control and other instances of allegedly
improper behaviour by Group employees.
Overview
The Audit Committee concludes that it has acted in accordance
with its terms of reference and ensured the independence 
of external audits. The Audit Committee also reviewed the
effectiveness of the external auditors and recommends to the
Board that they be re-appointed. The Chairman of the Audit
Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to
answer questions on the work of the Committee.

Creditor payment policy
The Company’ s policy , which is also applied by the Group, is to
settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms
of each transaction, ensure that suppliers are made aware of the
terms of payment and abide by the terms of payment. T rade
creditors of the Company at 31 December 2007 were equivalent

approximately $1.3 million, principally to local charities serving
the communities in which the Group operates. Donations of
medicines accounted for approximately $590,000 of total
donations made.
The Group does not make political donations.
Capital structure
The Company has one class of Ordinary Shares which carries no
right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at
general meetings of the Company . As at 31 December 2007, 
the Company had 898 ordinary shareholders and 170,733,807
Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each in issue. During 2007 the
Company issued 2,569,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the
exercise of options under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 
2004 Stock Option Plan.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor 
the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general
provisions of the Company’ s Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any
agreements between holders of the Company’ s shares that 
may have resulted in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights. No person has any special rights with regard
to the control of the Company’ s share capital. With regard to 
the appointment and replacement of directors, the Company is
governed by the Articles of Association, the Combined Code,
and prevailing legislation.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2007, the Company had been notified
pursuant to sections 89A to 89L of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 and Rule 5.1.2R of the Disclosure and
T ransparency Rules of the UKLA of the following interests in the
voting rights attaching to shares in the capital of the Company:
Name of Number of Percentage
Shareholder shares held
Darhold Limited 52,649,972 30.83%
Capital Research and Management 
Company 10,223,003 6.08%
Legal & General Group PLC 5,181,598 3.05%
No further notifications were received between 31 December
2007 and the date of this document. However , as a result of
shares subscribed in the placing undertaken by the Company 
on 17 January 2008, Darhold Limited now holds 57,883,028
Ordinary Shares, though no notification obligation arose as a
result of this subscription.
Other matters Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 43
The T akeover Code – Rule 9
At the Annual General Meeting held on 6 June 2007, a vote 
of the independent shareholders of the Company approved 
the award of up to an aggregate of 437,141 Ordinary Shares
pursuant to the Company’ s 2006 Long-T erm Incentive Plan to
Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah (the “L TIP Holders”).
Because of the relationship of the L TIP Holders with Darhold
Limited, who at the time of the Annual General Meeting held
52,649,972 Ordinary Shares (representing 31.129% of the issued
share capital of the Company at 25 April 2007, being the latest
practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Annual
General Meeting), each of the L TIP Holders (together with certain
other identified individuals at that date) was treated as acting in
concert with Darhold Limited for the purposes of the T akeover
Code (the “Concert Party”). As at 25 April 2007, the Concert
Party held, in aggregate, interests in 60,550,416 Ordinary Shares
in the capital of Hikma (representing 35.800% of the then issued
share capital of the Company). On full exercise of the options
under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals 2004 Stock Option Plan (the
“2004 Plan”) and full vesting of the L TIPs, the Concert Party
would potentially have, in aggregate, interests in 62,659,557
shares in the capital of the Company (representing 36.590% of
the enlarged issued share capital of the Company , on the basis
that no Ordinary Shares were issued other than pursuant to the
exercise of such options or vesting of L TIPs).
During the period from the Annual General Meeting in 2007 to
17 March 2008, the L TIP Holders together with other members 
of the Concert Party who hold options over Ordinary Shares
pursuant to the 2004 Plan (the “Option Holders”) have exercised,
in aggregate, options over 500,000 Ordinary Shares in the capital
of the Company , of which 180,000 Ordinary Shares were sold

share capital of the Company as at the date of this document).
Pre-emptive issue of Ordinary Shares
During the year under review, and in the period since

by shareholders at annual general meeting to issue Ordinary
Shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis.
Articles of Association
A summary of the relevant provisions of the Company’ s Articles
of Association (the “Articles”) is set out in the “Shareholder

Articles are to the existing set of Articles. It should be noted
however that the Company will adopt new Articles of
Association with effect from the conclusion of the Annual
General Meeting to be held on 15 May 2008.
Significant agreements and contracts

agreements between the Company and its Directors or
employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the “Regulations”). 
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board
has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the Combined Code and the Markets Law relating to directors’
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The auditors are required to report on the “auditable” part of this report and to state whether , in their opinion, that part of the report
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report is therefore
divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Directors who were members of the Committee during the year under review are set out on pages 36 to 39 in the Corporate
Governance report.
The responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration policy and its cost is a matter for the full Board, on the advice of the
Remuneration Committee. The ongoing recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved without
amendment by the Board for submission to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management
and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee members
have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from
cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice-Chairman on
matters relating to directors’ performance and remuneration in respect of the period under review. The Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer , Executive Vice Chairman and General Counsel may attend meetings by invitation except when their individual remuneration
arrangements are discussed. No director takes part in discussions relating to his own remuneration or benefits. As detailed below,
during the year the Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation from Halliwell
Consulting. Halliwell Consulting also provides associated administrative support for the Company’ s share plans. No services other than
those detailed in this report were provided to the Company by Halliwell during the year under review.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role
described. The terms of reference are available on the Company’ s website or on request by shareholders in writing from the Company
Secretary whose contact details are set out on page 104 of the Annual Report.
Philosophy behind Remuneration Committee’s approach
The Company’ s remuneration policy is designed to encourage, reward and retain executives and the Remuneration Committee
believes that shareholders’ interests are best served by remuneration packages which have a large emphasis on performance related
pay , thus encouraging executives to focus on delivering the Group’ s business strategy . By providing meaningful incentives to
executives the Company’ s policy seeks to ensure that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance related pay is
maintained.
Remuneration Committee report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 45
Remuneration policy 2007
Overall policy
The Remuneration Committee’ s policy during the year under review was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at
the following quartiles in comparison to the Company’ s Comparator Group:
Potential total short-term Potential annual Potential total 
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind remuneration available share awards compensation value
Lower quartile Upper quartile Lower quartile to median Median to Upper quartile Median to 
to median upper quartile upper quartile
This supports the performance based culture of the Company. Fixed costs are minimised The policy in respect of long-term
and total short-term remuneration will only reach and exceed the median if the incentives and potential 
performance-based bonus is earned for the relevant financial year. compensation value is an extension
of the policy on total short-term
remuneration. Executives will only 
receive a market competitive 
package if the annual bonus and
long-term incentives are earned.
2007 Comparator Group
The constituents of the Company’ s Comparator Group (“CG”) for benchmarking remuneration during 2007 were as follows:
Name Name Name
Acambis Plc Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc Oxford Biomedica Plc
Alizyme Plc CAT Group Plc Protherics Plc
Allergan Inc Forest Laboratories Inc Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC
Alpharma Inc King Pharmaceuticals Inc SkyePharma Plc
AstraZeneca PLC Mylan Laboratories Inc Vernalis PLC
Axis-Shield Plc Neutec Pharma Plc Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc
Factors the Remuneration Committee took into account when selecting the Comparator Group included:
� the industry within which the Company operates, specifically taking into account both the international nature of the Company’ s
business and its competitors, and the international nature of the Company’ s current executive team and potential recruits to that
team;
� the market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees of the Company; and
� the UK listing environment of the Company .
Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
It is the Committee’ s current intention to use the same Comparator Group (with the removal of CAT Group Plc and Neutec Pharma
Plc due to acquisition) to benchmark the Company’ s Executive compensation in 2008 and as the Comparator Group for the total
shareholder return performance condition attached to awards under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Long-T erm Incentive Plan
(“L TIP”).
Ongoing review
The Remuneration Committee continues to review the remuneration policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate for
the financial year under review. Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:
� market conditions affecting the Company;
� the recruitment market in the Company’ s sector;
� changing market practice; and
� changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to apply the 2007 policy in 2008.
Background
During the year , the Company appointed Said Darwazah as its Chief Executive Officer . His appointment commenced on 1 July 2007.
At the same time, Samih Darwazah relinquished his executive role, continuing in his position as the Non-Executive Chairman of the
Company . At this time the Committee undertook an independent review of remuneration for Chief Executive Officers in conjunction
with the appointment. This was performed by the Committee’ s independent external remuneration consultants, Halliwell Consulting.

Policy 2007 and 2008 – Lower quartile to median
The Company’ s remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the Executive Directors below the median to support a
performance based culture.

Lower quartile $374,000
*The salary for Samih Darwazah has been annualised for the purposes of comparison, though Mr Darwazah performed an executive role only until 30 June 2007.
**The salary for Said Darwazah has been annualised for the purposes of comparison, though he performed an executive role only from 1 July 2007.
As in 2007, the increases in executive salary reflect the Committee’ s ongoing policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, only
modest salary rises should be required.
When determining the salary of the executives the Committee takes into consideration:
� the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar 
size and complexity , in particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within the
pharmaceuticals industry and the Comparator Group;
� the performance of the individual executive director;
� the individual Executive Director’ s experience and responsibilities; and
� pay and conditions throughout the Company .

Annual performance related bonus
Policy 2007 and 2008 – Upper quartile bonus potential
Bonus payments are not pensionable. The following tables summarise the main features of the Company’ s executive bonus plan.
Bonus Samih Darwazah Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah
Company bonus potential 100% 100% 100%
Upper quartile CG 94% 94% 94%
Median CG 55% 55% 55%
2007 bonus paid as percentage of salary 80% 80% 90%
Upper quartile bonus payments in the CG as a percentage of salary* 133% 133% 104%
*Certain of the US companies contained in the CG do not have a cap on bonus and therefore pay in excess of the CG Upper quartile amount.
The maximum target bonus potential is 100% of salary . It is possible for exceptional performance to earn up to a total maximum
bonus of 200% of salary . The maximum bonus potentials for 2008 will remain the same as those applied for 2007.
The bonuses for 2007 have been paid on the basis of the level of the satisfaction of the performance targets, and in respect of Samih
Darwazah and Said Darwazah, on a pro rated basis. The table below shows the principal performance targets used for 2007 and their
percentage satisfaction.

The targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they 
are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company in order to ensure that they continue to remain
challenging. It is the opinion of the Committee that the overall nature of the conditions remains appropriate for the requirements 
of the Group in 2008, although the percentage targets will be reviewed.
Share incentives
Policy 2007 and 2008 – Upper quartile
The Remuneration Committee’ s policy is to provide annual share grants to senior executives at the upper quartile level compared to
the Comparator Group. Ongoing share incentives, excluding all-employee plans, are provided to the Executive Directors solely
through the L TIP . The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the L TIP enable the Company to provide a
competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement
expense. Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with the attached performance condition ensures that the Company’ s
comparative T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR”
1
) performance against the Comparator Group is at least at the upper quartile before
executives will receive the full benefit of their share incentives. This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committee’ s desire to
correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
1
T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR”) – is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period (the return is the value of
the capital gain and reinvested dividends).  It is normally used comparatively and the Company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
Remuneration Committee report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 48
The Remuneration Committee granted the following awards to Executive Directors during 2007.
Name Percentage of salary
Said Darwazah 139.42
Mazen Darwazah 112.50
For operational reasons the Company granted smaller awards than indicated in its consultation with shareholders on the changed
parameters of the L TIP . The Committee intends to revert to the policy agreed during this consultation for the 2008 grants.
The following table summarises the main features of the L TIP and its proposed operation during 2008.
Maximum annual grant face value
2
as percentage of salary and performance condition
Maximum annual grant 300% (current normal operating maximum set by the Remuneration Committee 200%)
The Awards will be subject to comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group. 20% of Awards will be released for
median performance with full release occurring for upper quartile comparative performance. The Remuneration Committee will also
ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance. When considering this
underlying financial performance the factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee will include profit after tax, revenue
growth and the achievement of operational milestones.
Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah
Proposed grants for 2008 face value as a percentage of salary* 200% (maximum of 200% (maximum of
148,778 Ordinary Shares) 138,363 Ordinary Shares)
*The maximum numbers of shares detailed above have been fixed pursuant to a resolution approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company
held on 6 June 2007 in accordance with Rule 9 of the T akeover Code.
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent
upon the degree to which the performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share
price of the Company at this time.
Basis of performance condition selection and measurement
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures
that the executives have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled
to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions. The Remuneration Committee will provide a full explanation
and justification at the time of the release of the award and why it believes that the underlying financial performance of the Company
is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied. The Committee has
appointed Halliwell Consulting to assist in the ongoing calculation of TSR in accordance with the rules of the L TIP . The Committee will
approve these figures prior to the release of any award.
Dilution
In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) the Company can issue a maximum of 10% 
of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans. Under the L TIP rules, grants of no more
than 3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be awarded in the first three years following the Company’ s IPO 
in 2005.
The following table summarises the current level of dilution resulting from Company share plans following the IPO:
Share awards as a percentage of issued share Share awards as a percentage of issued share 
capital as at 31 December 2007 in a rolling capital as at 31 December 2007 granted
ten year period during the year
All-employee Share Plans 0% 0%
Discretionary Share Plans 0.454% 0.454%
The Company has currently not implemented any all-employee option arrangements.
It is the Company’ s current intention that the awards granted in 2008 will be satisfied by newly issued shares.
Post employment benefits
Policy 2007 and 2008 – Lower quartile to median
The Executive Directors participate in the Hikma Pharmaceuticals Defined Contribution Retirement Benefit Plan (the “Benefit Plan”) in
accordance with the Rules of the Benefit Plan relevant to employees of the Group based in Jordan. Under the Benefit Plan the Group
matches employee contributions made to the Benefit Plan. These are fixed at 5% of applicable salary . Participants are entitled to 30%
of the Group’ s contributions to the Benefit Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each
subsequent year . The participant’ s interest in the Group’ s contribution fully vests after ten years of employment.

Face value for awards under the L TIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.

In addition, pursuant to applicable law, each of the Executive Directors receives contributions as a percentage of salary which are paid
by the Group into government social security systems.

healthcare and life insurance.

comparison against the CG benchmarks.
Other remuneration matters
Directors’ shareholding policy
The Remuneration Committee does not currently have a formal shareholding requirement due to the substantial shareholdings of 
the Executive Directors. The Committee, however , wholeheartedly supports the alignment of interests created by a minimum level 
of executive shareholding and should the make-up of the Board change would consider the introduction of a formal shareholding
requirement.
All-Employee share arrangements
Historically , the Company has used options to provide share incentives to employees of the Company . While options may continue to
be a part of the compensation package for those employees who do not participate in the L TIP , the Company has decided to operate
a Company-wide all-employee share purchase and matching plan which will be implemented as soon as practicable. The view of the
Board is that this type of arrangement has the same cost versus benefit advantages behind the change from options to L TIP awards 
and is important in supporting the engagement of employees with the business as a whole. The main features of the Hikma
Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) are set out below. Shares required to satisfy awards under the SIP will be
purchased in the market.
Name Status Eligibility Main features
SIP As soon as practicable All employees of the The Plan provides employees with the opportunity of 
Company including the purchasing £1,500 (or local currency equivalent) of shares a 
Executive Directors year out of salary and providing additional matching shares
on a 1:1 ratio. These matching shares will be normally
released three years after they have been awarded provided
that the associated shares purchased by the employee have
been retained and provided the employee is still employed
by a Group Company at this time.
Remuneration Committee report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 50
Executive Directors’ contracts
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company in force at the end of the year under review are as follows:
Name Company notice period Contract date Unexpired term of contract Potential termination payment
Said Darwazah 12 months 1 July 2007 Rolling contract 12 months salary 
and benefits
Mazen Darwazah 12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary 
and benefits
The Executive Directors’ contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by at least 12 months’ written notice. This arrangement is
in line with best corporate practice for listed companies. In the event of the termination of an executive’ s contract, salary and benefits
will be payable during the notice period (there will, however , be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive
grants during the period of notice other than in accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plan). The Remuneration
Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Director’ s termination of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of the
Company or cessation of employment.
Said Darwazah, who has an executive service contract with the Company as detailed above, will be proposed for re-election at the
next Annual General Meeting of the Company .
External appointments
The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector
appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the Director , from which the Company can benefit.
Executive Directors may therefore accept non-executive appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest, and are
allowed to retain any fees paid under such appointments. During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah
received fees of US$10,155 and US$36,150 respectively , in respect of such appointments.
Non-discretionary statutory entitlement
On 1 July 2007, on the appointment of Said Darwazah as Chief Executive Officer , Samih Darwazah relinquished his executive role
within the Group. Pursuant to the requirements of Jordanian Social Security legislation, this triggered a one-off compulsory statutory
payment to Mr Samih Darwazah in lieu of social security contributions relating to his historical employment with the Group. 
The details of this payment are set out on page 51 of this report. No other payment was made to Samih Darwazah in respect of the
termination of his executive role, including any payment in lieu of notice. Jordanian Social Security legislation is such that the Group
will not be required to make any such payment in respect of any other Executive Director .
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Policy 2007 – Upper quartile
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chief Executive
Officer and Executive Vice Chairman and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The nature of the Company’ s business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA, Middle East 
and Europe. The Board is therefore made up of Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both in the UK and
internationally . The use of options for Non-Executive Directors is very prevalent in the US and also to some extent internationally .
However , as a UK listed company complying with UK best practice it is not considered appropriate to grant options to the Company’ s
independent Non-Executive Directors. T o ensure that the Company remains able to attract the appropriate calibre of candidate and to
take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has therefore set its fee policy at the upper quartile.
During the year Samih Darwazah relinquished his executive role with the Group, remaining its Non-Executive Chairman. At this time,
the Board consulted external advisors in respect the appropriate level of fees to be paid in respect of his role as Non-Executive
Chairman.
The individual basic and committee fees, which are paid in £Sterling, are as follows:

Sir David Rowe-Ham 64 57 76476
*The fees of Samih Darwazah, who has only served part of the year , have been annualised on the same basis as the remuneration of his fellow Non-Executive Directors
to allow the levels to be compared to other Non-Executive Directors of the Company and his peers within the Comparator Group.
Remuneration Committee report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 51
The level of Non-Executive Director fees will be kept under review to ensure that that nomination Committee is able to recruit
Non-Executive Directors of the appropriate calibre in accordance with the requirements of succession planning.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not
entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company . The Non-Executive Directors do not have service
contracts, but have letters of appointment with the Company . Each appointment is terminable on one months’ notice from either the
Company or the Director , but is envisaged to be for an initial period of up to 36 months, subject to the terms of the Company’ s
Articles of Association, the Companies Act and shareholder approval.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration Committee report Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 54
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the financial statements. The Directors are required to
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU
(IFRSs) and have also elected to prepare financial statements for
the Company in accordance with IFRSs. Company law requires
the Directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance
with IFRSs, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’ s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’ s
“Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial
Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. Directors are
also required to:
� properly select and apply accounting policies;
� present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
� provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and financial
performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company , for safeguarding the assets,
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a
directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report which 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.

We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects
the Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the 2006 Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing

overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.

1. Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year , the Group has adopted IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” which is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. The impact of the
adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these ﬁnancial statements regarding the
Group’ s ﬁnancial instruments and management of capital.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’ s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The ﬁnancial statements have also been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation to market of certain ﬁnancial
assets and liabilities.
The Group’ s previously published ﬁnancial statements were also prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards. These International Financial Reporting Standards have been subject to amendment and interpretation by the International
Accounting Standards Board and the ﬁnancial statements presented for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007
have been prepared in accordance with those revised standards. Unless stated otherwise these policies are in accordance with the
revised standards that have been applied throughout the year and prior years presented in these ﬁnancial statements.
The presentational and functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is the US Dollar as the majority of the Company’ s business
is conducted in US Dollars ($).
The signiﬁcant accounting policies are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the results of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (the “Company”) and entities controlled
by the Company (together the “Group”) and the Group’ s share of the results and net assets of its associates. Control is achieved
where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies either directly or indirectly of an investee entity so
as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from the Group’ s equity therein. The interest of
minority shareholders is stated at the minority’ s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently , any
losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent. The results
of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary , adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances,
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group
in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’ s identiﬁable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the
acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business
combination over the Group’ s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
If, after reassessment, the Group’ s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’ s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’ s proportion of the net fair value of the assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or joint control, through
participation in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the ﬁnancial statements using the equity method of accounting
except when classiﬁed as held for sale.
Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but not control or joint
control over these policies.
Investment in joint venture
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and a third-party undertake an economic activity that is subject to
joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity , and exists only when the strategic
ﬁnancial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control (the venturers).
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 61
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Each venturer contributes cash or other resources to the jointly controlled entity . These contributions are included in the accounting
records of the venturer and recognised in its ﬁnancial statements as an investment in the jointly controlled entity .
The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using proportionate consolidation. The application of proportionate consolidation
means that the balance sheet of the Group includes its share of the assets that it controls jointly and its share of the liabilities for
which it is jointly responsible.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill: arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of the 
identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for
impairment at least annually . Any impairment is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’ s cash-generating units. Cash-generating units
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually , or more frequently when there is an indication that the
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets
of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is
not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary , the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
(b) Marketing rights: are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year in which the rights ﬁrst generate sales.
(c) Customer relationships: represent the value attributed to the long-term relationships held with existing customers at the date of
acquisition and are amortised over their useful economic life.
(d) Product related intangibles:
(i) product ﬁles and under-licenced products are assigned indeﬁnite useful lives which are reviewed for impairment at least 
annually; any impairment is recognised immediately in proﬁt and loss and is not subsequently reversed; and
(ii) Under-licence agreements and product dossiers are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year acquired.
(e) Purchased software: is amortised over the useful economic lives commencing when the asset is available for use.
(f) In process research and development is amortised over the useful life commencing in the year acquired.
(g) Trade name: some trade names are assigned indeﬁnite useful lives and others have ﬁnite useful lives over which they are
amortised. The trade names with indeﬁnite useful lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually; any impairment is
recognised immediately in proﬁt and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position of each Group company are 
expressed in US Dollars, the functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and the presentation currency for the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
T ransactions in currencies other than local currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net proﬁt or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on
non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value and the related foreign exchange are recognised directly in equity .
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’ s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences
arising, if any , are classiﬁed as equity and transferred to the Group’ s translation reserve. Such cumulative translation differences are
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when goods or services are supplied or made available to external customers against
orders received and when title and risk of loss has passed.
Revenue represents the amounts receivable after the deduction of discounts, value added tax, other sales taxes, and allowances given
and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are
monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual and historical information and past experience.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 62
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Chargebacks
The provision for chargebacks is the most signiﬁcant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. In the USA the Group
sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies. The Group
also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and Group purchasing
organisations, collectively referred to as “indirect customers”. The Group enters into agreements with its indirect customers to
establish pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which they purchase the
products at agreed-upon prices. The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price
with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’ s invoice price. This credit is called a chargeback. The provision for chargebacks is based
on historical sell-through levels by the Group’ s wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory
levels. As sales are made to the large wholesale customers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes
adjustments when it believes that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves.
Returns and rebates
In certain countries and consistent with industry practice, the Group has a product return policy that allows selected customers to
return the product within a speciﬁed period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date, in exchange for a credit to be applied to
future purchases.
The Group estimates its provision for returns and rebates based on historical experience, changes to business practices and credit
terms. While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, history may not always be an accurate indicator of
future returns. The Group continually monitors the provisions for returns and rebates, and makes adjustments when it believes that
actual product returns may differ from established reserves.
Price adjustments
Price adjustments, also known as “shelf stock adjustments”, are credits issued to reﬂect decreases in the selling prices of the Group’ s
products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction. Decreases in selling prices are
discretionary decisions made by Group management to reﬂect competitive market conditions. Amounts recorded for estimated shelf
stock adjustments are based upon speciﬁed terms with direct customers, estimated declines in market prices and estimates of
inventory held by customers. The Group regularly monitors these and other factors and re-evaluates the reserve as additional
information becomes available.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
T o the extent that variable rate borrowings are used to ﬁnance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective cash ﬂow hedge of
interest rate risk, the effective portion of the derivative is deferred in equity and released to proﬁt or loss when the qualifying asset
impacts proﬁt or loss. T o the extent that ﬁxed rate borrowings are used to ﬁnance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective
fair value hedge of interest rate risk, the capitalised borrowing costs reﬂect the hedged interest rate.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speciﬁc borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividend income
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as capital leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to
the lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a
straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease. Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating
lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under capital leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or , if lower , at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the
balance sheet as a capital lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability .
Government grants
Government grants relating to property , plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement
over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 63
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Research and development
Research and development expenses are fully charged to the income statement, as the Group considers that the regulatory and other
uncertainties inherent in the development of its products generally mean that the recognition criteria in IAS 38 “Intangible assets” are
not met. Where, however the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets will be recognised and amortised over their useful
economic life.
Retirement beneﬁt costs
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement beneﬁt schemes are dealt with as payments to deﬁned contribution schemes where the Group’ s obligations
under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme.
Tax
The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group operates.
Furthermore, the Group computes and records deferred tax assets and liabilities according to IAS 12 “Income T axes”.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year . T axable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income
statements because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’ s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt
nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity , in
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity .
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render
services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” requires an expense to be recognised when the Group buys goods or services in exchange for share
or rights over shares (“share based payments”) or in exchange for other equivalent assets.
The cost of share-based payments’ transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which 
the share-based payments are granted. The equity settled stock options scheme fair value is determined using a binomial model. 
The long-term incentive plan fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The expected life used in the models has
been adjusted, based on management’ s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability , exercise restrictions, and behavioural
considerations (further details are given in Note 35). In valuing share-based payments, no account is taken of any performance
conditions, other than conditions linked to the market price of the shares of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 64
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
The cost of share-based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity , on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period based on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not
ultimately vest. Where the terms of a share-based payments are modiﬁed, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 
had not been modiﬁed. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the
modiﬁcation, as measured at the modiﬁcation date. Where a share-based payments award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested
on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately . However , if a new award is
substituted for a cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new
awards are treated as if they were a modiﬁcation of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. The dilutive effect 
of outstanding share-based payments is reﬂected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Property, plant and equipment
Property , plant and equipment have been valued at cost on acquisition and are depreciated, except for land, on a straight-line basis 
at the following depreciation rates:
Buildings 2% to 4%
Vehicles 10% to 20%
Machinery and equipment 5% to 20%
Fixtures and equipment 8% to 33%
Projects under construction are not depreciated until construction has been completed.
Any additional costs that extend the useful life of property , plant and equipment are capitalised. Property , plant and equipment which
are ﬁnanced by leases giving Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are capitalised at the
lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, and
depreciated in the same manner as other property , plant and equipment over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life.
Whenever the recoverable amount of an asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the
impairment loss is taken to the income statement. Projects under construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Purchased products are valued at acquisition cost and all other
costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost of own-manufactured products comprises direct
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their
present location and condition. In the balance sheet, inventory is primarily valued at standard cost, which approximates to historical
cost determined on a moving average basis, and this value is used to determine the cost of sales in the income statement. Net
realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and all
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions are made for inventories with net realisable value lower than cost or for slow
moving inventory .
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are used to manage the Group’ s exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The principal
derivative instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts. The Group
does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and then remeasured at subsequent reporting
dates to fair value. Hedging derivatives are classiﬁed on inception as fair value hedges, cash ﬂow hedges or net investment hedges.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, with the changes in the
fair value of the hedged asset or liability .
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as cash ﬂow hedges are recognised in equity . Amounts deferred in equity are
transferred to the income statement in line with the hedged forecast transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash ﬂow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the
income statement.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 65
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Investments
Available for sale investments with quoted market prices are initially recognised at cost on acquisition and remeasured to their 
fair values at year-end. Gains or losses on remeasurement to fair value are recognised in shareholders’ equity until the investments 
are sold, disposed of, or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gains or loss relating to these investments
previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement. Available for sale ﬁnancial assets without market prices and 
the fair value of which cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, less a provision for any impairment loss, which is taken to 
the income statement.
The fair value of quoted ﬁnancial assets represents the closing price in the ﬁnancial markets at the date of the ﬁnancial statements.
However , the fair value of unquoted ﬁnancial assets, or those with no declared price are estimated by comparing the fair value of a
similar ﬁnancial instrument or through a discounted cash ﬂow method.
Accounts receivable
T rade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in proﬁt or loss when there is
objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’ s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are subject to an
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in
the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
T rade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at fair value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that
an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An intangible asset with an indeﬁnite useful life is tested for
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or income-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (income-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense
immediately .
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately .

12. Intangible assets (continued)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected 
to benefit from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been
allocated as follows:
2007 2006
$000’s $000’ s
Branded
Arab Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Company 66,479 –
Al Jazeera Pharmaceutical Industries 6,752 6,727

Others
Arab Medical Containers 742 742
IPRC and STD 95 90
837 832
Total 148,083 8,316
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the
year . Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks speciﬁc to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs
are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts derived from the most recent ﬁnancial budgets approved by management for the next 
ﬁve years.

(2,230) (4,024)
A deferred tax asset on unused tax losses totalling $1,944,000 (2006: $578,000) has not been recognised in the year due to the
unpredictability of the related future proﬁt streams. These losses may be carried forward indeﬁnitely . In addition, a deferred tax 
asset of approximately $5.0 million (2006: $8.5 million) on other deductible temporary differences has not been recognised due 
to uncertainty regarding the tax treatment of the proﬁts against which these differences will reverse.
As at 31 December 2007, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to $195 million (2006: $161 million). 
No income taxes have been provided on the Company’ s share of these undistributed earnings due to management’ s ability and 
intent to reinvest such amounts indeﬁnitely . A determination of the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liability has not 
been made because it is not practical to do so. A portion of these earnings can be distributed without incurring additional taxes.

T rade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits set as deemed appropriate 
for the customer . Credit limits are set based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the credit worthiness of a
particular customer . The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large private wholesalers to
privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. T ypical credit terms 
in the US range from 30–60 days, in Europe 60–120 days, and MENA 180–360 days. Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to
minimise risks by the use of trade ﬁnance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of speciﬁc trade and other
receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance
account is written off against the underlying receivable.

As at 31 December 2007, the Group was in a net current liabilities position and as a result it was in breach of certain ﬁnancial
covenants related to its short-term debt. The breach arose as a result of short-term debt taken out to fund the acquisition of APM 
on 27 December 2007.
The relevant ﬁnancial institution was made aware of this fact prior to the breach and gave its consent. The proceeds of the post year
end equity placing on 17 January 2008 were applied to repay short-term debt and as such the breach was remedied.
More details of the equity placing are provided in Note 40.

25. Other provisions
Other provisions represent the end of service indemnity provisions of Hikma Pharmaceuticals Limited – Jordan, Hikma Italia, JPI, AMC,
APM, Hikma Pharma Co. (T unisia) and Pharma Ixir Co. Ltd (Sudan). This provision represents a one month salary payable for each year
employed for certain individuals in accordance with the agreements for the Group employees for those companies except for Hikma

It is the Group’ s policy to lease certain of its ﬁxtures and equipment under ﬁnance leases. The average lease term is ﬁve years 
(2006: six years). For the year ended 31 December 2007, the average effective borrowings rate was between 3.9% and 7.5% 
(2006: between 3.8% and 7.0%).
28. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives
Credit risk: 
The Group’ s principal ﬁnancial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Group’ s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks in the US, expired goods and without recourse discounts. A provision for impairment is
made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of
the cash ﬂows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
As a market norm, clients in the MENA region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to clients in Europe and the 
US. As at 31 December 2007, the Group’ s largest three clients in the MENA region represented 14% of Group T urnover (located in 
S. Arabia), 4% of Group turnover (located in Algeria) and 3% of Group turnover (located in Algeria). The amount of receivables due
from the Algerian market for 2007 is $34,979,000 (2006: $13,804,000). The Group manages this risk through the implementation
of stringent credit policies and procedures and certain credit insurance agreements. As at 31 December 2007, none of the Group’ s
major debtors have gone into liquidation.
Market risk: 
The Group’ s objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, ﬂuctuations in earnings and cash ﬂow associated with
changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Management
actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative ﬁnancial
instruments.
Foreign exchange risk: 
The Group uses the US Dollar as its functional currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in
European, Algerian and Japanese currencies. Consequently , the Group enters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign
exchange rates change to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk: 
The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of debt that is ﬁxed by entering into interest rate
swap agreements. Using these derivative ﬁnancial instruments has not had a material impact on the Group’ s ﬁnancial position at 
31 December 2007 or the Group’ s results of operations for the year then ended.

An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels
at 31 December 2007, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at 31 December
2007, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $2.8 million in interest expense being incurred per year .
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 80
28. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives (continued)
Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities:
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used 
to estimate the fair value:
� Cash and cash equivalents – approximates to the carrying amount;
� Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments;
� Long-term loans – approximates to the carrying amount in the case of ﬂoating rate bank loans and other loans;
� Forward exchange contracts – based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date;
� Receivables and payables – approximates to the carrying amount; and
� Lease obligations – approximates to the carrying value.
Management consider that the book value of the Group’ s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities do not materially differ from their fair value.
Currency risk: 
Currency risks as deﬁned by IFRS 7 arise on account of ﬁnancial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the
functional currency and being of a monetary nature. The following table illustrates ﬁnancial assets and liabilities for the Group
demonstrated in different currencies:

For liquid assets and liabilities maturing in less than one year , the Group moved from a net assets position of $89,204,000 as 
at 31 December 2006 to a net liabilities position of $206,916,000 as at 31 December 2007. This came as a result of increased
borrowings to fund acquisitions during 2007.
The Group believes, that given the $158 million net equity placing in January that was used to repay short-term debt (less than one
year), its committed ﬁnancing headroom and forecast operating cash ﬂow during 2008, it has the ability to satisfy its liability
commitments.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 82
29. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Currency derivatives
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge signiﬁcant future transactions and cash ﬂows. The Group is party to a variety of
foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The instruments purchased are
primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’ s principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was committed
to, are as below.
2007 2006
$000’s $000’ s
Foreign exchange forward contracts and options (Euro) 1,471 –
Foreign exchange forward contracts (Yen) 578 –
These arrangements are designed to address signiﬁcant exchange exposures.
At 31 December 2007 the fair value of the Group’ s currency derivatives was a net loss of $24,889. The fair valuation of the currency
derivatives that are designated and effective as cash ﬂow hedge resulted in a loss of $24,889 for the year ended 31 December 2007
that has been reﬂected in equity . These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. 
At 31 December 2006 there were no open forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of cash ﬂow hedges of currency and interest rate ﬂuctuations is not signiﬁcant and
will not affect in a material way the ﬁnancial health of the Group.
Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. These contracts (with
original nominal values of $15 million as at 31 December 2006 increasing to $23.8 million as at 31 December 2007) have ﬁxed
interest payments at rates ranging from 3.9% to 4.75% for periods up until 2017 and have ﬂoating interest receipts at LIBOR.
The fair value of swaps entered into by the Group is estimated as a liability of $28,000 (2006: $149,000). These amounts are based
on market values provided by the banks that originated the swaps and are based on equivalent instruments at the balance sheet
date. Some of these interest rate swaps are designated as effective cash ﬂow hedges and the fair value thereof totalling $82,000
(2006: $149,000) has been deferred in equity . The ineffective element of the cash ﬂow hedges are taken to the income statement.
No gain or loss has been recognised in the income statement for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2006.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of interest rate swaps by interest rate ﬂuctuations is not signiﬁcant and will not affect
in a material way the ﬁnancial health of the Group.

The revenue and net proﬁt of Thymoorgan from the date of acquisition that is included in the Group’ s income statement for the year
amounted to $5,588,000 and $389,000 respectively .
The amount of goodwill recognised in relation to the Thymoorgan acquisition relates to the value attributed to the employee know
how within the business, as Hikma do not have contractual or legal rights over these assets they do not meet the identiﬁability criteria
within IAS 38 and hence are reﬂected within goodwill. In addition, the goodwill is also attributable to the anticipated proﬁtability of
the distribution of the products manufactured into the new Hikma oncology market.

32. Acquisitions of subsidiaries (continued)
Full year impact of acquisitions:
If the acquisition of Thymoorgan, Hikma Pharma Egypt and APM had been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year , the
Group’ s revenues for the year would have been approximately $508,307,000 and the Group’ s proﬁt attributable to equity holders of
the parent would have been approximately $72,405,000. The appropriate additional contribution by entity for the period from the
beginning of the year up to the acquisition date is illustrated in the table below:

34. Contingent liabilities
The Group was contingently liable for letters of guarantee and letters of credit totalling $17.8 million (2006: $16.9 million).
The integrated nature of the Group’ s worldwide operations, involving signiﬁcant investment in research and strategic manufacture at
a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and
delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the proﬁts on which individual Group companies are liable to tax. Disagreements
with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be
transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conﬂicting claims from revenue authorities as to the
proﬁts to be taxed in individual territories. Resolution of such issues is ongoing.
In common with many other companies in the pharmaceutical industries the Group is subject to certain legal and product liability
claims from time to time. Whilst provisions have been made for probable losses that management deems to be reasonable or
appropriate there are inherent uncertainties connected with these estimates.
The Group does not expect the resolution of uncertainties to have a material effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
35. Share-based payments
Equity settled share option scheme
During the year ended 31 December 2007 and 2006, the Company had two share-based compensation schemes settled by equity
instruments with two separate grant dates. The options over these instruments are settled in equity once exercised.
Details of the grants under the scheme are shown below:
2005
T ype of arrangement General employee share option plan
Date of grant 13 October 2005
Number granted 1,600,000
Contractual life 10 years
Vesting conditions 20% per year for ﬁve years beginning on the ﬁrst anniversary of the grant date
The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $0.74. This was calculated by
applying a binomial option pricing model. The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $4.50, exercise price of $4.50,
expected volatility of 26.2%, expected dividend yield of 6.67%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free interest rate 
of 4.54%. T o allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would exercise the options immediately 
after vesting date.
2004
T ype of arrangement General employee share option plan
Date of grant 12 October 2004
Number granted 9,520,000
Contractual life 10 years
Vesting conditions 20% per year for ﬁve years beginning on the ﬁrst anniversary of the grant date
The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $0.35. This was calculated by
applying a binomial option pricing model. The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $0.91, exercise price of $0.91,
expected volatility of 44.8%, expected dividend yield of 3.85%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free interest rate of
4.22%. T o allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would exercise the options immediately after
vesting date.

The cost of the equity settled share option scheme of $865,000 (2006: $879,000) has been recorded in the income statement as part
of general and administrative expenses.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was $8.56. The options
outstanding at 31 December 2007 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of two to three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’ s share price over the previous three to four years.
Long-term incentive plan
During the year , the Company granted awards under Hikma Long-T erm Incentive Plan (“L TIP”) to certain employees. Under the L TIP ,
conditional awards of nominal cost share options are made which vest after three years subject to a total shareholder return (“TSR”)
performance condition. This condition measures the Group’ s TSR relative to a comparator group of other pharmaceutical companies.
In this case, the vesting schedule dictates that 20% of awards vest for median performance and 100% for upper quartile performance,
with pro rata vesting in between these points. No awards vest for performance which is below the median.
Details of the grants under the plan are shown below:

methodology for estimation of the fair value. The model inputs were as follows:
(a) the exercise price of the share award of nil;
(b) the life of the share award of three years;
(c) the current price of the underlying shares on the date of grant of £3.79;
(d) the volatility of the Company’ s share returns of 34.64%;

West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp: (401 (k) salary saving plan)
Prior to 2001, West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp established a 401 (k) deﬁned contribution plan, which allows all eligible employees
to defer a portion of their income through contributions to the plan. All employees not covered by any collective bargaining
agreement are eligible after being employed for one year . Employees can defer up to 25% of their gross salary into the plan, not to
exceed $15,500 and $15,000 for 2007 and 2006, respectively , not including catch-up contributions available to eligible employees as

($163.8 million) acquisition of Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company thereby providing the Group with increased 
flexibility to finance future growth.
The estimated cost of the placing was $2,530,000.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 94
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements. The Directors have elected to prepare
ﬁnancial statements for the Company in accordance with IFRSs. Company law requires the Directors to prepare such ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with IFRSs, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’ s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the
International Accounting Standards Board’ s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements”. In virtually 
all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. Directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company , for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities and for the preparation of a directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of
the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.

1. Significant accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by that Act,
the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and UK law.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as
those set out in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements with the addition of the policy as noted below.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
2. Investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries represents 100% share in Hikma Pharma Limited – Jersey , Hikma Holdings and 52.5% of JPI (the other
47.5% being held elsewhere in the Group). The cost method is being used to account for these investments.

4. Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
These comprise cash held by the Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
5. Financial liabilities
Other payables
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of other payables approximates to their fair value.
6. Short-term debts
Short-term debts represents the drawdown of $170 million of a bridge loan to finance the acquisition of APM and drawdown of 
$28 million under the $40 million credit line from Citibank. These amounts were repaid following the equity placing on 17 January
2008. The relevant financial institution was made aware of this fact prior to the breach and gave its consent. The proceeds of the post
year end equity placing on 17 January 2008 were applied to repay short-term debt and as such the breach was remedied.
7. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives
Currency risk: 
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the
functional currency and being of a monetary nature. The following table illustrates financial assets and liabilities for the Company in
different currencies:

The Company believes, that given the $158 million net equity placing in January that was used to repay short-term debt (less than
one year), its committed financing headroom and forecast operating cash flow during 2008, it has the ability to satisfy its liability
commitments.
Interest rate risk
An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels
at 31 December 2007, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at 31 December
2007, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $2.0 million in interest expense being incurred per year .

(2006: $923,000) of which salaries and wages compromise an amount of $763,000 (2006: $492,000) the remaining balance of

Articles of Association
The disclosures set out below summarise certain parts of the Articles. If required, full provisions can be found in the Articles
themselves. The Articles may only be amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
Share rights
Any share in the Company may be issued with such rights (including preferred, deferred or other special rights) or such restrictions,
whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution
determine (or , in the absence of any such determination, as the Directors may determine).
If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of share, the rights attached to any class may be modified, abrogated or
varied with the consent in writing of the holders of three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the
sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.
The Directors may , subject to the terms of allotment, from time to time make such calls upon the shareholders (each a “Member”) 
as they think fit in respect of any monies unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way 
of premium). A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for all calls made upon him even if there is a subsequent transfer
of the shares in respect of which the call was made.
Transfer of shares
Subject to Article 75 (see below), the Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully-paid share,
although such discretion may not be exercised in a way which the UK Listing Authority or the London Stock Exchange regards as
preventing dealings in the shares of the relevant class or classes from taking place on an open or proper basis. The Directors may
likewise refuse to register any transfer of a share in favour of more than four persons jointly .
In relation to a certificated share, the Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless the instrument of transfer 
is left at the Company’ s office, or at such other place as the Directors may from time to time determine, accompanied by the
certificate(s) of the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer and the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share.
Article 75 states, amongst other things, that:
(1) if any Member , or any other person appearing to the Directors to be interested in any shares in the capital of the Company held
by such Member , has been duly served with a notice requiring them to disclose the extent of their shareholding and does not
comply within 14 days, then the Company may (at the discretion of the Directors) at any time thereafter by notice to such
Member (a “restriction notice”) direct that, in respect of the shares in relation to which the default occurred and any other shares
held at the date of the restriction notice by the Member , or such of them as the Directors may determine from time to time 
(the “restricted shares”), the Member shall not, nor shall any transferee to which any of such shares are transferred other than
pursuant to a permitted transfer or as set out below, be entitled to be present or to vote on any question, either in person or by
proxy , at any general meeting of the Company or separate general meeting of the holders of any class of shares of the Company ,
or to be reckoned in a quorum;
(2) where the restricted shares represent at least 0.25% of the issued shares of that class, then the restriction notice may also direct that:
• any dividend or other monies which would otherwise be payable on or in respect of the restricted shares shall be withheld by
the Company and shall not bear interest against the Company; and/or
• such a Member may not elect to receive shares of the Company instead of cash in respect of any dividend; and/or
• no transfer of any of the shares held by such Member shall be recognised or registered by the Directors unless the transfer is a
permitted transfer or (a) the Member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information required and (b) the transfer
is of part only of the Member’ s holding and, when presented for registration, is accompanied by a certificate by the Member in 
a form satisfactory to the Directors to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the Member is satisfied that none of the
shares the subject of the transfer are restricted shares.
Shareholder information Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 102
(3) a transfer of shares is a permitted transfer if:
(a) it is a transfer by way of, or in pursuance of, acceptance of a takeover offer for the Company; or
(b) the Directors are satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a bona fide sale of the whole of the beneficial ownership of the
shares to a third party unconnected with the transferring Member or with any other person appearing to the Directors to be
interested in such shares; or
(c) the transfer results from a sale made on or through a market operated by the London Stock Exchange or on or through any
stock exchange outside the United Kingdom on which the Company’ s shares of the same class as the restricted shares are
normally dealt.
Powers of Directors
The Board is empowered to appoint Directors, but Directors so appointed are required to submit themselves for election at the first
Annual General Meeting following their appointment and for re-election where they have been a Director at each of the preceding

such contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal or who is so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit
realised, but he shall declare the nature of his interest.

in relation to any resolution on which he is debarred from voting.
However , a Director shall (in the absence of some other material interest than is indicated below) be entitled to vote (and be counted

at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
– the giving of any guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of a debt or obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for

Shareholder information Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 103

benefit of any Directors.
A Director shall not vote or be counted in the quorum on any resolution concerning his own appointment as the holder of any office
with the Company or any subsidiary , including fixing or varying the terms of his appointment or the termination thereof.
If any question shall arise as to the materiality of an interest or the entitlement of any Director to vote and such question is not
resolved by his voluntarily agreeing to abstain, such question shall be referred to the Chairman and his ruling shall be final except 
in a case where the nature of the interests of the Director have not been fairly disclosed.

Articles that prescribe the Directors’ permitted interests and entitlement to vote to any extent or ratify any contract, arrangement or
transaction not duly authorised by that Article.

CHAiRmAN’s st At EmENt
The shareholders received a cash offer from Punch 
International N.V on 8 January 2007, and the statement 
from the Independent Committee of our Board of 
Directors on 23 January 2007, expressing its reservation on 
the Punch International proposal, considering the 
company’s performance. The offer closed on 13 February 
2007 with Punch International increasing its shareholding 
from 49% to 92.58% in Punch Graphix plc. 
Subsequently, the independent Non-Executive Directors 
resigned on 20 February 2007. I want to express my 
appreciation for their contribution to the development of 
the Company during their terms of office.
The long-term strategy for growth to establish Punch 
Graphix as a strong technology player in selected markets 
of the graphic sector is further supported by the new 
Board of Directors, with a stronger emphasis on short-
term profitability, cash and shareholder value appreciation, 
to be achieved through continuous and pro-active cost 
control, operational efficiency actions, and top line 
management. We will keep investing in technology, 
further enhance our approach on total solutions, while 
strengthening our service offering. 
Looking back at 2006, revenues 
increased to €173.34m, operating 
profit before taxation increased by 
15% and earnings per share rose  
by 17%.
The Xeikon 6000 launched in September has been 
unanimously recognised as a new standard in the high-
end digital colour market with graphic art printing quality. 
The basysPrint ‘Very Large Format’ product line was 
upgraded with new technology for its optics, delivering 
superior speed and lower maintenance requirements. 
Punch Graphix continued supporting successfully its 
partner Agfa in the newspaper sector, especially with the 
new entry level Computer-to-Plate model.
The period saw the further strong growth of the Xeikon 
brand in Europe and Japan, but showed a slower 
evolution than expected in the USA. 
The basysPrint brand continued gaining momentum, 
specially in countries where UV plates are still widely used, 
such as Brazil, India and China.
To support the growth, the Group invested a further €8m 
in plant and machinery. We carried out a number of 
actions to increase operating efficiency, such as the SAP 
implementation in Germany and Canada, and marketing 
and sales process alignment.
I am confident that our well balanced business model 
with high recurring revenues and our presence in both 
digital and offset sectors is suited to challenge a dynamic 
and competitive environment. I am optimistic that with 
our changed focus to optimise further cash and return, we 
will offer strong returns to shareholders.

CHiEF EXECUti VE’s REViEw Ben C. Van Assche answers some 
frequently asked questions about the 
progress and future of Punch Graphix
Q You have recently undertaken a 
strategic review – what are the key 
elements of your strategy moving 
forward?
 
A The Punch Graphix strategy is founded on four value-
adding business streams and I see the integration of 
those streams in the interest of the customer as a key 
success factor and one of my main responsibilities. First  
is the equipment development. Our R&D teams are 
continuously monitoring technological changes, 
customer feedback and competitor activity. 
The second stream is designing a user-friendly, software-
based workflow that interfaces with customers’ existing 
environments. The third is the consumables stream. We 
believe in environmentally friendly consumables that 
enhance output quality. Using electro-photography for 
Xeikon, combined with in-house developed toner 
capability as well as through the choice of UV-sensitive 
plate technology for basysPrint, we address both 
environmental requirements and improve reproduction 
quality. Moreover, with about half of our total revenue 
from consumables and services in 2006, this recurring 
revenue stream provides a solid base for development. 
Finally, the fourth stream is the support and service areas, 
where we make a real difference for our customers. Every 
customer has different requirements and workflow 
constraints and we are committed to matching our 
solutions to their individual needs. 
Over half of our total workforce is engaged in directly 
supporting our customers and ensuring prompt and  
pro-active interaction.
 
Q Where do you see the key areas for 
growth within the business? How did the 
change of control of the Company in 
February 2007 impact on the business 
priorities?
A At the time of admission, we presented three main 
areas for growth and the direction is still valid, although 
the focus has shifted between these areas under 
guidance of the new Board, that was put in place  
20 February 2007.
One growth area is the extension and enhancement of 
our technology leadership. We were the pioneer of digital 
printing colour systems in the early 90s and although we 
have some very large competitors, we still put ourself 
apart with a number of very specific unique selling points, 
placing our systems at the high end of the document 
printing segment with graphic art quality. In the area of 
industrial applications, we have a promising foothold in 
labels and several speciality applications, which has a 
significant potential for the future. In the CtP areas, a  
more mature product, we see growth in enhancing the 
productivity and quality of systems further. 
Another area for growth is to selectively address market 
opportunities. For digital, from a geographical 
standpoint, clearly the US is the most attractive country 
for a brand like Xeikon to grow, followed by Europe and 
Japan. On the CtP side (non newspaper), the Asian and 
South American markets remain the most active with 
positive growth expected for the coming years. 
Another important part of our go-to-market strategy is 
the full solution approach. For example, we are targeting 
in-plant printing facilities for large companies or 
institutions. To enter those markets successfully we 
present flexible finishing solutions with in-line coating or 
perfect book binding solutions. 
Technology and market growth will however only be 
possible if our operational excellence keeps up its pace: 
we continue to realise synergies and whenever possible 
streamline and integrate functions. We have rationalised 
the CtP product platforms and adopted a more strict 
digital front end and software phasing process, while 
optimising production processes for both digital and 
prepress business lines. 
However the progress made in this area until the end of 
last year must, in the view of our main shareholder, be 
further improved. Under impulse of the new Board, the 
priority setting is shifting towards a stronger emphasis on 
return and cash generation. For this purpose a number  
of actions have been put in place, in a very systematic 
and controlled manner, in particular in the field of 
working capital and operations. We are among others 
reviewing our international industrial strategy, by 
optimising and centralising logistics and production in 
cooperation with Punch International. One consequence 
of this industrial review has been the closure of the 
operation in Shenzhen.  Punch Graphix plc

Q How are you developing your 
international footprint?
A Our strategy is to provide dedicated service in every 
region where there is substantial market traction and 
when economies of scale can be achieved. This can also 
be achieved through cooperation with well established 
distribution networks, for the other regions. As defi ned 
with the new Board, we will be re-enforcing indirect 
distribution networks for the prepress business line, in 
order to gain a larger exposure in the CtP key markets, 
while further developing our own sales and service 
network for the Xeikon brand.
Q How are you keeping ahead 
with technology?
A Our technology leadership is clearly a key success 
factor of Punch Graphix. We are investing close to 10% 
of turnover in R&D, as well as running a number of R&D 
projects with business partners, for example with 
substrate manufacturers. We foster partnerships with 
universities and technology centres and today we have 
research activities with among others the universities of 
Brussels, Hasselt, Gent, Leuven, Rostock. Last, but not 
least, we place strong emphasis on recruiting, training 
and retaining the best experts in the areas we consider 
core and strategic.

Performances fully in line with stated 
growth strategy 
Summary 
Since Admission to AIM in May 2005, Punch Graphix has 
experienced strong growth. In both 2005 and 2006, 
growth in the operating result outstripped growth in 
revenues, resulting in growing operating result margins. 
Punch Graphix’s shares have risen over 30% between 
Admission and 31 December 2006 and continue to 
exhibit exciting growth prospects. 
Overview
2006 was a satisfactory year for the Group, with both the 
high-end digital colour printing systems division (Xeikon) 
and the Computer-to-Plate prepress division (basysPrint 
and OEM) showing healthy development. Group revenue 
was €173.3m, an increase of 10% over 2005. Of this, 33% 
was generated by prepress activities, and 67% by digital 
printing activities. The split between equipment sales 
and sales of consumables and services grew in favour of 
recurring revenue compared to the previous year.
Group operating result was €22.5m, an increase of 5% 
over 2005. Result before tax and the net result 
attributable to the equity rose by 15% and 28% 
respectively over 2005.
By the end of 2006, the total installed base of Punch 
Graphix machines was approximately 3,000, compared
to approximately 2,500 at the time of Admission.
Markets and key drivers
During 2006, market conditions remained favourable for 
Punch Graphix. Digital colour printing was the fastest 
growing of all printing technologies with a wider range of 
printers adopting new applications. In addition, ongoing 
trends such as the increasing use of colour printing and a 
widening use of personalisation in printed media, have 
contributed to growth.
The CtP equipment market remained fairly stable overall, 
refl ecting a combination of the mature off set markets in 
Europe and the United States, and the faster growth 
experienced in Asia and South America. Key drivers for 
the CtP market included the continuing upgrade of the 
large installed base of earlier computer-to-fi lm solutions 
and fi rst generation CtP machines, the search for more 
productive solutions and the further consolidation of
the printing market into large facilities in lower cost 
geographies such as Asia and South America.
Digital colour printing solutions (Xeikon)
Xeikon enjoyed another strong year overall, especially 
in the sale of consumables. This was driven by systems 
sold and installed during 2005 coming on stream and,
in particular, a number of existing US customers 
substantially increasing their toner requirements.
The number of pages printed by the installed base of 
Xeikon machines grew by over 25% during the year.
The Group launched its new generation digital colour 
printing system, the Xeikon 6000, in September 2006, 
in combination with a new colour toner range (Form 
Adapted), and a major update to the X-800 digital 
front-end. In February 2007, the Xeikon range was further 
extended with the introduction of the Xeikon 4000 and 
Xeikon 5000Plus. The expectation in the market place 
of the launch of the Xeikon 6000 restricted orders for 
Xeikon 5000 machines. However, the Xeikon 6000 is 
helping equipment sales in the high-end part of our 
targeted market, with the fi rst units being delivered in 
the later part of 2006.
The combination of the Xeikon 6000, the FA toner range 
and the updated X-800 digital front-end sets a new 
standard in digital colour printing for speed, productivity, 
image quality, substrate range and extended applications.
These features, combined with favourable printing costs, 
put Punch Graphix ahead of its competition in this 
market segment.
Prepress solutions
Prepress activity was strong throughout the year, 
particularly in the emerging CtP markets in Asia.
The basysPrint approach of combining readily available 
and cost competitive UV plates and CtP equipment 
without the need for fi lm has been more widely adopted, 
indicating greater acceptance of the Group’s technology. 
As a result, unit sales of basysPrint prepress equipment 
were signifi cantly ahead of 2005.
During 2006, basysPrint was chosen as a preferred 
partner and has entered into a co-marketing agreement 
with ArtworkSystems, the prepress front-end software 
market leader. Other arrangements with plate suppliers 
also helped increase the awareness of, and confi dence 
in, the basysPrint brand. In October 2006, we introduced 
new optics to the ‘‘Very Large Format’’ range which have 
been well received by the market. They off er clear 
advantages in terms of speed of imaging and scalability 
and considerably extend the life of the lighting unit.
The extension of the factory in Boizenburg, Germany, 
which commenced in the summer of 2006, was 
completed early 2007 and will improve order fl ow and 
reduce delivery and installation lead times. Our new

“ With the UV-Setters, we can handle all the 
UV-sensitive plates used by our customers, 
and are absolutely fl exible with regard to plate 
format. At the same time, we are able to off er 
a really favourable price. We are certain that our 
investment in UV-Setters will drive our expansion 
still further
   ”
Mao XunYi, Managing director, Shanghai Sanken Printing Co., Ltd, PRC
We further developed our relationship with our key 
newspaper market partner, Agfa, in line with agreements 
entered into in 2005. These provide the Company with 
greater transparency on orders and allow for a more 
structured approach to joint product development.
Strategy and prospects
During 2006, as part of its ongoing growth strategy, the 
Group invested signifi cantly in facilities and machinery to 
support its expansion programme, including new 
equipment for the toner factory in Heultje, Belgium,
and the expansion of the Boizenburg CtP factory. 
The strategy of expanding our own sales and services 
organisations progressed further in 2006.
New approaches to team management were deployed 
across the Company to focus on continuous 
improvement through sharing best practice and 
effi  ciencies. Empowerment of our people at all levels for 
business excellence is a key component of our strategy 
for growth.
Productivity levels are expected to increase further 
through the continued streamlining of the Group. 
Priorities for 2007 include further upgrading the Group’s 
professional capabilities and enhancements to processes 
which are vital to the long-term future and growth of 
Punch Graphix, such as marketing, sales and service, 
purchasing, production and IT.
The Group’s commitment to research and development 
investment has historically resulted in a number of 
product enhancements and new product launches 
which have provided the foundation for the ongoing 
growth and competitiveness of Punch Graphix. These 
investments are continuously fi ne-tuned in order to 
sustain the Group’s growth prospects.
We are confi dent about the prospects for Punch Graphix 
for the current year and beyond and remain fi rmly 
committed to maximising shareholder value.

FiNANCiAl REViEw 
The results published in this annual 
report have been prepared under the 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union
The Group reported a strong full second year, in revenue, 
profit and earnings per share. 
Trading
Revenues increased from €158.3m, in 2005, to €173.3m in 
2006. Of this amount €1.1m relates to the acquisition of 
Linomedia in February 2006 (76.5%) and the rest to 
organic growth.
The split between digital printing and prepress was 67% 
against 33%. Compared to the previous year, the split 
between equipment sales and recurring revenues (sales 
of consumables for the digital printing machines, spare 
parts and servicing) grew in favour of the recurring 
revenue: 54% equipment and 46% recurring revenue 
(compared to 56% and 44% in 2005). Geographically, 
Europe remains the most important market (67%), 
followed by the Americas (26.5%) and Asia (6.5%).
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation) increased by 20% from €34.7m, in 2005 to 
€41.7m in 2006. In sales terms this represents a margin of 
25%. Operating profit on sales for the year was €22.5m, 
which represents an increase of 5% on the previous year.
The tax charge of €5.2m reflects an effective tax rate of 
25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 30.3% in 
2005. The Group benefited from the utilisation of tax 
losses and the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 
respect of tax losses.
Minority interest and earning per share
Minority interests decreased further from €435,000 in 
2005 to €101,000. The Group acquired the minority 
interests in its German and Italian subsidiaries.
In the reported year, earnings per share increased by  
17% to 15.55 euro cent. The average number of shares  
in issue in the calculation of earnings per share was 
102.2m. For 2005, the Company had on average €93.3m 
shares in issue.
Dividend
Given the change of control, further to the offer from 
Punch International N.V, the Board will propose not to pay 
a final dividend for 2006. 
Cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities increased from €3.9m 
to €27.5m despite an increase in working capital of €3.6m.
Credit terms have been used to enable sales while 
recognising the need to ensure action against  
customers with over extended credit. 
Payables remained stable at €20.5m. Improvements to  
the purchasing process have encouraged more timely 
payments to suppliers which enable stronger 
relationships and more advantageous partnership 
agreements.
Events in 2006 such as the Linomedia acquisition and the 
new products inventory build-up for the Xeikon 6000 and 
FA toner range justified higher inventory levels at year-
end. Inventory management remains an operational 
challenge which has benefited from attention in 2006 
and will continue to do so in 2007, particularly through 
the further reduction of slow moving stocks levels. 
Capital expenditure was €8m on tangible assets 
(improvement and replacement of production 
equipment and assets held for rental contracts and 
demonstration equipment). The Shenzhen, Heultje,
and Boizenburg investments are completed. The
largest component of investment in intangible assets
is to be found in the capitalisation of development 
activities (€7.6m).
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the year 
amounted to €39.8m.
The results were positively influenced by the market 
value of our hedging instruments (Financial result  
of €0.9m).
Shareholder’s funds
Shareholders’ funds totalled €107.9m. The increase in the  
year of €12.5m is driven mainly by retained earnings.

introduction
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and the Board believes that this is a key 
element to continuing to deliver the Group’s strategy. 
While the Group is not required to comply with the 
provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code, the Group 
complies wherever possible with principles of good 
governance.
s tAtement o F d irectors’ res Ponsibilities
The Board is responsible for leading and controlling the 
Group and is accountable to the shareholders for the 
operational and financial performance of the Group. 
The Directors are responsible for internal controls and 
company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year which give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group 
and of the profit or loss for that period. 
A more detailed description of the Directors 
responsibilities in respect of the financial statements  
can be found in the Directors’ report.
Goin G concern
Having made due enquiries the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
t he bo Ard
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and met 
six times during 2006. It is responsible for:
overall Group strategy; 
approving revenue and capital budgets and material 
expenditure plans; 
approving substantial acquisitions and disposals of 
businesses, subsidiaries or material assets; 
determining the financial and corporate structure of 
the Group (including financing and dividend policy); 
approving material or extraordinary contracts; 
setting the Company’s values and standards and 
ensuring that its obligations to its shareholders and 
others are understood and met; and 
ensuring appropriate training of Directors and other 
senior executives. 
Day-to-day management of the Company’s business is 
delegated to the management team. At each meeting 
the Board reviews comprehensive financial information, 
produced by management each month and considers 
the trends in the Company’s business and their 
performance against strategic objectives and plans. 
It also regularly reviews the work of its formally 
constituted standing committees as described below 
and compliance with the Group’s management policies 
and compliance with legal requirements.

All members of the Board and its committees attended 
all scheduled meetings held in 2006 except that  
Mr Dumarey and Mr Humphreys were absent on one 
occasion due to a business trip abroad.
Details of the service contracts of the Executive  
Directors are shown in the Remuneration report. The 
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts 
but have appointment letters, which can be renewed  
or extended.
In furtherance of the principles of good corporate 
governance, the Board has maintained the Audit, the 
Remuneration and the Nomination Committees, each of 
which is comprised solely of the Company’s Non-
Executive Directors.
Audit committee
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for 
monitoring the quality of internal controls and ensuring 
that the financial performance of the Company is 
properly measured and reported on. In particular,  
the Audit Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations as to the appointment, reappointment 
or removal of external auditors and monitoring the 
expertise and independence of such auditors. It receives 
and reviews reports from Punch Graphix’s management 
and auditors relating to the interim and annual accounts 
and the accounting and internal control systems in use 
throughout the Company. The Audit Committee expects 
to meet at least twice a year and has unrestricted access 
to the Company’s auditors. The chairman of the Audit 
Committee was Nigel McCorkell and other members 
were Kenneth Humphreys and Geoffrey White. The  
Audit Committee met twice in 2006.
r emuner Ation committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance 
of the Executive Directors and makes recommendations 
to the Board on matters relating to their remuneration 
and terms of employment. The Remuneration Committee 
also makes recommendations to the Board on proposals 
for the granting of share options and other equity 
incentives pursuant to any share option scheme or equity
incentive scheme in operation from time to time. 
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Kenneth 
Humphreys, with Geoffrey White and Nigel McCorkell as 
other members and met twice in 2006.
n omin Ation committee
The Nominations Committee meets as and when 
necessary to assess the suitability of candidates proposed 
for appointment by the Board and to prepare a 
description of the role and capabilities required for a 
particular appointment. The chairman of the Nomination 
Committee was Geoffrey White and other members were 
Kenneth Humphreys and Nigel McCorkell. The 
Nomination Committee met once in 2006.

r el Ationshi Ps with sh Areholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining 
regular dialogue with institutional shareholders to ensure 
that its strategy and any concerns can be addressed. 
In addition, all shareholders have the opportunity to 
attend the Annual General Meeting where the Group’s 
operations can be discussed with the Directors. The 
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer make themselves 
available for meetings with analysts and representatives 
of the major shareholders on the day of the preliminary 
announcement of the annual results and half year results 
or shortly thereafter and upon request at other times of 
the year. They report to the Board on shareholders’ views. 
r el Ationshi P with the A uditor
During the reported year BDO Stoy Hayward LLP 
provided tax advice to the Company and its principal 
subsidiaries. The Board has considered the effect on 
independence of the auditor and the objective criteria 
on which any decisions to appoint BDO Stoy Hayward 
LLP should be made. It was concluded that in the 
circumstances its appointment as tax advisors was the 
most cost-effective means of securing appropriate advice 
without a serious risk of affecting the independence of 
the auditor. BDO Stoy Hayward LLP has confirmed that it 
does not consider its independence to be affected. The 
Board has developed policies to safeguard the 
independence of the auditor based on:
internal BDO Stoy Hayward LLP processes to prevent 
information being shared between teams except 
where it is appropriate; 
separate consideration of each category or major item 
of work, including the cost effectiveness of any 
proposed work and the suitability of competing 
advisors; and 
consideration of the total level of fees payable to BDO 
Stoy Hayward LLP and other member firms.
intern Al controls
The Board of Directors is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and has established a 
framework of financial and other controls. 
The Board has taken and will continue to take appropriate 
measures to ensure that the chances of financial 
irregularities occurring are reduced as far as possible by 
improving the quality of information at all levels in the 
Group, fostering an open environment and ensuring that 
financial analysis is rigorously applied. Any system of 
internal control can, however, only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
•
•
•
The major elements of the system of internal control are
as follows:
1.  Major commercial, strategic and financial risks are 
formally identified, quantified and assessed by each 
operating unit during the annual budgeting exercise 
and presented to and discussed with Executive 
Directors, after which they are considered by the Board. 
2.  There is a comprehensive system of planning, 
budgeting, reporting and monitoring of the Group’s 
operating units. This includes monthly management 
reporting and monitoring of performance and 
forecasts. The reports are reviewed by Group staff and 
are also submitted to the Board for review. Monthly 
and quarterly reviews are embedded in the internal 
control process and cover each principal operating 
unit. Monthly reviews require each operating unit to 
consider, inter alia, business development, financial 
performance against budget and forecast, and capital 
expenditure proposals. Quarterly reviews of operating 
units also include a review of longer term business 
development performance against budget and 
forecast and all other aspects of the business. They are 
attended by Executive Directors and other Group staff 
as appropriate.
3.  There is a structure which clearly defines lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority.
4.  Each operating unit is required to comply with defined 
policies, financial controls and procedures and 
authorisation levels which are clearly communicated.

r emuneration r e Port The Company’s compensation arrangements are overseen 
by the Remuneration Committee of the Board which during 
the financial year ended 31 December 2006 consisted of Ken 
Humphreys (chair) who prepared this report, Geoffrey White 
and Nigel McCorkell.
The policy of the Board is that the committee shall consist 
of Independent Non-Executive Directors. The CEO 
attends meetings by invitation but does not attend in 
relation to matters that can affect him.
The Committee considers changes in compensation 
policy likely to have a material impact on the Company 
and is informed on a regular basis on leadership 
performance, legislative compliance on employment 
issues, industrial agreements and incentive plans 
operating throughout the Company.
The Committee is responsible for: 
establishing and recommending to the Board the 
policy for executive remuneration;
determining on behalf of the Board and shareholders 
the level and structure of the packages of the Executive 
Directors and selected senior executives; and 
reviewing and ensuring the alignment of executive 
remuneration throughout the organisation including 
Company share schemes.
Policy
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure the 
compensation systems compliment and to reinforce its 
performance culture, leadership and talent management 
systems. Its aim is to offer packages that are competitive 
and designed to attract, retain and motivate personnel of 
the highest calibre. The Committee aims to recognise 
competence, experience and contribution to reward the 
•
•
•
delivery of challenging targets over the long-term on 
both growth and profitability.
A base salary, a bonus scheme and a long-term incentive 
plan (shares) are designed to ensure the delivery of best 
in class performance and align interests of the 
shareholders, executives and the Company.
PAck AGes
The basic salary is set using appropriate external data for 
similar jobs in companies of comparable size and 
complexity. Packages also take into account professional 
qualifications, experience and proven competencies.
incentive s chemes
The Executive Directors participate in an annual cash bonus 
scheme which is aligned to reward the delivery of 
challenging business targets – sales, profit, cash and 
individual personal targets. The Committee ensures these  
are aligned with shareholder interest and are competitively 
benchmarked. The maximum bonus achievable for the CEO 
is 50% of salary and for the CFO 30%.
l on G t erm i ncentive Pl An (lti P)
The LTIP is intended to offer an effective incentive over 
the longer term to executives and certain other senior 
employees. The total number of new ordinary shares that 
may be issued pursuant to the LTIP over a 10 year period 
may not exceed 5% of the total share capital of the 
Company. The use of a relevant TSR (Total Shareholder 
Return) based hurdle ensures an alignment between 
comparative shareholder returns and rewards of 
executives. The Committee assesses the TSR of the 
Company against the performance of the AIM UK 50 and 
the TSR of a Group of comparable competitors. Punch Graphix plc

The Company has sent a letter to the members of the leadership team that they may receive a specific (maximum) 
number of shares, provided the target of 10% growth in EPS per year is reached during the period 1 January 2006 to 
31 December 2008. This potential grant is made under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).

sAFety, he Alth And environment
Punch Graphix is committed to building, implementing 
and ensuring working practices and production 
processes that pay need to the safety, health and 
environmental protection of its employees, products, 
customers and stakeholders. It constantly strives to 
ensure its products have the greatest possible positve 
impact on the local and global environment.
Punch Graphix’s commitment to the safety, health and 
environmental protection of its products covers all 
phases of the production process.
c onception
The Punch Graphix product range keeps the environment 
in mind even at the conceptual stage of the product. Its 
digital presses are environmentally friendly in three 
different aspects:
Xeikon presses allow printing on demand thanks to the 
low set-up times. Only those items that are actually 
required are printed. This is a revolutionary concept for 
fully personalised marketing campaigns, but it is also 
extremely important in terms of environmental 
friendliness, since this means that there is no need for 
keeping a stock of printed matter. The printer will only 
use the exact amount of paper and ink needed at that 
moment.
Digital technology makes it possible for the digital 
master of the document to be transferred via the 
internet and then printed locally. Hence, there are no 
transportation costs involved in the document transfer, 
and this helps reduce CO2 emissions in road or air 
transport. 
•
•
s ocial an D environmental  
r es Ponsibility r e Port Punch Graphix makes sure that the marking material 
used for its products, such as toner particles, makes 
for environmentally friendly digital presses. With 
traditional printing methods volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs), harmful to the environment and to 
human health, are released into the air. Xeikon digital 
presses use a quick, clean and environmentally friendly 
printing method and thus do not release VOCs. 
Moreover, the marking material the Company selects 
is totally recyclable. In addition, the FA toner range has 
been FDA-approved for food contact.
In the conception of the prepress product range, 
environmental friendliness is also given high priority:
When using basysPrint prepress technology in a 
traditional printing process, there is no need for the 
usual intermediate step illumination-to-film. The 
removal of the film lessens the environmental stress 
of the printing process. 
The fact that basysPrint allows the use of UV-sensitive 
conventional plates is highly beneficial to the 
environment and is, moreover, energy-efficient. Other 
CtP technologies require the newer digital plates and, 
thus, need hazardous developing liquids. Conventional 
plates do not use hazardous developing liquids and do 
not require as much energy.

d esign
The RoHs (Restriction on the use of Hazardous 
substances in electronic equipment) Directive is a 
European regulation that restricts the use of certain 
hazardous substances in electrical and electronic 
equipment. A programme is defined for all Punch 
Graphix products to comply with this directive and the 
new generation of prepress and digital products is, 
furthermore, designed to optimise energy efficiency.
Production
In all production plants, special care has been taken to 
comply with the WEEE (waste from electronic and 
electrical equipment) regulation, which limits the total 
quantity of waste that may go to final disposal, and the 
M.A.P . (Milieu Actie Plan – Environmental Action Plan) 
regulation on energy efficiency. At these plants, waste 
water is separated from the pluvial water to reduce the 
stress on the waste water treatment. 
At the toner production plant in Heultje (Belgium), 
substantial investment plans have been undertaken to 
optimise energy consumption. Also, this year special 
investment programmes are underway to implement 
recycling in the production process, by implementing 
more efficient classifying technology which will increase 
yield and reduce waste.
Quality
The entire Punch Graphix product range meets 
international quality standards thanks to the rigorous 
quality programme the Company implements in its 
production processes. Its production plants in Ieper 
(Belgium) and Boizenburg (Germany) are ISO 9001:2000 
certified and its production plant in Lier (Belgium) is 
expected to gain the ISO 9001 in the first half of 2007. 
humAn resources
Good HR management is essential to succeed in business 
and it is only through its employees that the Company 
will build on its current competitive advantages. Punch 
Graphix takes care that it is and is seen as an attractive, 
transparent and honest organisation that encourages 
employee initiative and development and provides a safe, 
pleasant working environment.
eQuAl o PPortunities
The Punch Graphix policy rigorously stipulates that all 
persons should be treated fairly irrespective of their 
colour, race, sexual orientation, age, religious or political 
beliefs. The Company is committed to the principles of 
equal opportunity, it specifically prohibits discrimination 
of any type, and it ensures that employees who are 
physically impaired can work for the Company wherever 
and whenever this is reasonably possible.
FAmily su PPort
Punch Graphix recognises that its future depends on  
the ability to recruit and retain the right people. The 
Company has an open approach to flexible working 
conditions and concurs with its employees in their 
requests and concerns about supporting a healthy family 
life. Its employee-friendly policies cover maternity/ 
paternity leave and pay, among others.
initi Atives
In the past two years, Punch Graphix has been 
committed to supporting the Plato Initiative in the 
Mechelen region (Antwerp). Plato is an intensive 
counselling and supporting programme that helps 
SMEs grow and prosper. Plato seeks to professionalise 
the management of SMEs by means of work experience 
exchanges and networking under the supervision 
of large companies in order to achieve SME growth 
and development. Punch Graphix plc

inde Pendent A uditors’ re Port to the 
sh Areholders o F Punch Gr APhix P lc
We have audited the Group and parent Company 
financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Punch 
Graphix plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, 
the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, 
the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes 
in Shareholders’ Equity and the related notes. These 
financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.
r esPective res Ponsibilities o F d irectors And 
Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not 
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is 
not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual 
Report and consider whether it is consistent with the 
audited financial statements. The other information 
comprises only the 2006 Highlights, the Business Review, 
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the 
Directors’ Report, the Remuneration Report, the Financial 
Review, the Social and Environmental Responsibility 
Report, Directors and the Corporate Governance Report. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
auDitors’ r e Port Our report has been prepared pursuant to the 
requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and for no 
other purpose. No person is entitled to rely on this report 
unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this 
report by virtue of and for the purpose of the Companies 
Act 1985 or has been expressly authorised to do so by our 
prior written consent. Save as above, we do not accept 
responsibility for this report to any other person or for any 
other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and 
all such liability.
bAsis o F Audit o Pinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion 
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the financial statements.
oP inion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2006 and of its profit for the year then 
ended;
the parent Company financial statements give a true 
and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of 
the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006; 
the financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
The information given in the Directors’ Report is 
consistent with the financial statements.

accountin G Policies bAsis o F Pre PAr Ation
These financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (‘the Group’) have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS and IFRIC 
interpretations) issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies preparing 
their accounts under IFRS.
These financial statements are presented in euros, the 
functional currency of the Group. The Company’s 
functional currency is Sterling. However, the Company 
presents its financial statements in euros as the majority 
of transactions of the Group are in euros.
The Company was incorporated in the United Kingdom 
as Punch Graphix Limited on 24 March 2005 and 
re-registered as a public limited Company with the name 
Punch Graphix plc on 29 April 2005. On 20 April 2005, the 
Company acquired Punch Graphix International N.V, 
formerly Xeikon International N.V, Punch Graphix Prepress 
Belgium N.V, formerly Strobbe Graphics N.V, Punch 
Graphix Prepress Germany GmbH, formerly basysPrint 
GmbH, and certain other companies, in which Punch 
International N.V (‘Punch International’) had an 
investment immediately prior to 20 April 2005. Following 
the Company’s Admission onto AIM on 26 May 2005, 
its issued share capital was £10,282,922 divided into 
102,829,220 fully paid ordinary shares. 
The Company’s controlling interest in its directly held 
subsidiaries was acquired through a transaction under 
common control, as defined in IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. The Directors note that transactions under 
common control are outside the scope of IFRS 3 and  
that there is no guidance elsewhere in IFRS covering 
such transactions.
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a 
transactions falls outside the scope of IFRS. This guidance 
is included at paragraphs 10 to 12 of IAS 8 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 
This requires, inter alia, that where IFRS does not include 
guidance for a particular issue, the Directors should also 
consider the most recent pronouncements of other 
standard setting bodies that use a similar conceptual 
framework to develop accounting standards. In this 
regard, it is noted that the United States Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an 
accounting standard covering business combinations 
(FAS 141) that is similar in a number of respects to IFRS 3. 
Further there is currently a major project being run jointly 
by the IASB and FASB to converge IFRS and US GAAP .
In contrast to IFRS 3, FAS 141 does include, as an 
Appendix, limited accounting guidance for transactions 
under common control which, as with IFRS 3, are outside 
the scope of that accounting standard. The guidance 
contained in FAS 141 indicates that a form of accounting 
that is similar to pooling of interests accounting, which 
was previously set out in Accounting Principles Board 
(APB) Opinion 16, may be used when accounting for 
transactions under common control.
Having considered the requirements of IAS 8, and the 
guidance included within FAS 141, it is considered 
appropriate to use a form of accounting which is similar 
to pooling of interests when dealing with the transaction 
in which the Company acquired its controlling interest in 
its subsidiaries.
In consequence, the financial information for Punch 
Graphix plc reports the result of operations for the prior 
year as though the acquisition of its controlling interest 
through a transaction under common control had 
occurred at the beginning of the earliest period 
presented. The effects of intercompany transactions have 
been eliminated in determining the results of operations 
for the period prior to the acquisition of the controlling 
interest, meaning that those results are on substantially 
the same basis as the results of operations for the period 
after the acquisition of the controlling interest.
Similarly, the consolidated balance sheets and other 
financial information have been presented as though the 
assets and liabilities of the combining entities had been 
transferred at 1 January 2005.
At the date of authorising these financial statements, the 
following standards and interpretations were in issue but 
not effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures; 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments; IAS 23 (revised) Borrowing 
Costs; IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under 
IAS29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies; IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2; IFRIC 9 Reassessment 
of Embedded Derivatives; IFRIC 10 Interim Financial 
Reporting and Impairment; IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury 
Share Transactions; and IFRIC 12 Service Concession 
Arrangement. The directors anticipate that the adoption 
of standards and interpretations in future periods will 
have no material financial impact of the financial 
statements of the Group.
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors 
that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of 
making judgements about carrying values of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. Punch Graphix plc

IAS 36 Impairment of assets requires the directors to 
estimate inputs into valuation models concerning 
matters such as forecast cash flows and profit margins. 
The directors base their estimates both on past 
experience and expected market trends going forward. 
Management must also make assumptions concerning 
inventory valuation, the valuation of receivables and the 
valuation of the warranty provision. In each instance, 
management take account of the historical performance 
of the group in respect of these matters, together with 
current information concerning, for example, product mix 
and performance and exposure to credit risk.
A summary of the more important accounting policies is 
set out below. The accounting principles have been 
applied consistently for all years’ presented.
bAsis o F consolid Ation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or 
indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies 
of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The 
consolidated financial statements present the results of 
the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a 
single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances 
between Group companies are therefore eliminated 
in full.
business combin Ations
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
results of business combinations using the purchase 
method. In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquiree’s 
indentifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition 
date. The results of acquired operations are included in 
the consolidated income statement from the date on 
which control is obtained. When a business combination 
is achieved in stages, goodwill is calculated on the 
increase in stake. The impact of fair value adjustments on 
the Group’s previously held interest is not accounted for 
through goodwill.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business 
combination over the interest in the fair value of 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired. Cost comprises the fair values of assets given, 
liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus 
any direct costs of acquisition.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any 
impairment in carrying value being charged to the 
income statement.
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of 
consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to 
the income statement.
int An Gibles
r esearch and development costs
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with 
the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical 
knowledge, is recognised in the income statement as an 
expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development 
projects (relating to the design and testing of new or 
improved products) are recognised as intangible assets to 
the extent that such expenditure is expected to generate 
future economic benefits and meets the recognition 
criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Other 
development expenditures are recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as 
an expense are not recognised as assets in a subsequent 
period. Development costs that have been capitalised are 
amortised from the commencement of the commercial 
production of the product on a straight-line basis over 
the period of its expected benefit. The amortisation 
periods adopted do not exceed five years. The capitalised 
development costs are assessed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
c omputer software development costs
Generally, costs associated with developing or 
maintaining computer software programmes are 
recognised as an expense as incurred. However, costs 
that are directly associated with identifiable and unique 
software products controlled by the Group that have 
probable economic benefits exceeding the cost beyond 
one year, are recognised as assets. Direct costs include 
staff costs of the software development team. Computer 
software costs that have been capitalised are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected 
useful lives, not exceeding a period of five years.
o ther intangible assets
Expenditure on acquired patents, trademarks and 
licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful economic lives, but not exceeding 
20 years. Amortisation of intangible assets is included 
within depreciation and amortisation expense in the 
income statement.
imPAirment o F non- Fin Anci Al A ssets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets 
with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken 
annually on 31 December. Other non-financial assets are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. Whenever the carrying amount of an 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount (being the higher 
of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use), an 
impairment loss is recognised within other operating 
charges. The fair value less cost to sell is the amount 
obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length 
transaction while value in use is the present value of 
estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the 
continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the 
end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated 
for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the cash 
accountin G Policies continued Punch Graphix plc

generating unit to which the assets belong. Reversal of 
impairment losses recognised in prior years is recorded in 
income when there is an indication that the impairment 
losses recognised for the assets no longer exist or have 
decreased. As an exception, impairment losses 
recognised for goodwill are not reversed.
Pro Perty, P l Ant And e Qui Pment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at 
purchase price or production cost including directly 
attributable costs less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. Expenses for the repair of property, 
plant and equipment are usually charged as an expense 
when incurred. They are, however, capitalised when they 
increase the future economic benefits expected to arise 
from the item of property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the 
item. Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction 
represent plant and properties under construction and 
are stated at cost less any recognised impairment loss. 
This includes cost of construction, plant and equipment 
acquired and other direct costs. Assets under 
construction are not depreciated until such time as the 
relevant assets are available for their intended use.
The estimated useful lives of the various identified asset 
categories are as follows:
Buildings  25 to 40 years
Machinery and equipment 3 to 8 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years
Other fixed assets 3 to 5 years
The depreciation is calculated to write off the carrying 
value of items on a straight-line basis starting from the 
month of purchase. Where the carrying amount of an 
asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, 
it is written down immediately to its recoverable value.
Government G r Ants
Government grants relating to the purchase of property, 
plant and equipment are included in non-current 
liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
expected lives of the related assets.
l eAses
As lessee
Finance lease
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the 
Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases 
are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower 
of the fair value of the leased property or the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease 
payment is allocated between the liability and the 
finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the 
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental 
obligations, net of finance charges, are included as 
borrowing. The interest element of the finance cost is 
charged to the income statement over the lease term. 
The leased assets are depreciated over their expected 
useful lives on a basis consistent with similar owned 
property, plant and equipment. If there is no reasonable 
certainty that ownership will be acquired by the end of 
the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of 
the lease term and its useful life.
Operating lease
Lease payments under operating leases are recognised as 
an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As lessor 
Finance lease
When assets are leased under a finance lease, the present 
value of the lease payment is recognised as a receivable. 
Financial income is recognised over the term of the lease 
using the net investment method, which reflects a 
constant periodic rate of return. Profits arising on sales 
under finance leases are recognised in the period that the 
sale occurs.
Operating lease
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in 
property, plant and equipment in the balance sheet. They 
are depreciated over their expected useful lives on a basis 
consistent with similar owned property, plant and 
equipment. Rental income (net of any incentives given to 
the lessee) is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term or in accordance with usage as appropriate.
inventories
Inventories are initially valued at cost, and subsequently 
at the lower of cost or net realisable value, fixed 
according to the weighted average cost method. Work 
in progress and finished goods are valued at direct 
production cost. The cost of production comprises the 
direct cost of materials, direct manufacturing expenses, 
appropriate allocation of material and manufacturing 
overhead, and an appropriate share of the depreciation 
and write-downs of assets used for production. If the 
purchase or production cost is higher than the net 
realisable value, inventories are written down to net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the 
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
t r Ade r eceiv Ables
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount 
less impairment losses as a result of a past event that 
occurred subsequent to the assets’ recognition, such as 
evidence of a deterioration in counterparty credit risk.

Deferred income tax is provided in full using the balance 
sheet liability method, on temporary differences between 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the tax bases. Punch Graphix plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2006

Job:	 8921_PG_06	AR_back_AW.indd	 Proof:	 09	 Proof Read by:
Operator:	Rich	 Date:	 12.04.2007	
Server:	 studio	3	 Set-up:	 Rob	 First	Read/Revisons
Deferred taxes are not calculated on the following 
temporary differences:
initial recognition of goodwill;
goodwill for which amortisation is not tax 
deductible; and
the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that are 
not a business combination and at the time of 
the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet 
date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the unused tax losses and credits 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax balances are 
not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the 
Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities relate to the taxes levied by the same tax 
authority on either:
the same taxable Group Company; or
different Group entities which intend either to settle 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously, in each future period in which 
significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are expected to be settled or recovered.
investments in Associ Ates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a 
position to exercise significant influence, but not control 
or joint control, through participation (but not control of) 
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee. The results and assets and liabilities of associates 
are incorporated in these financial statements using the 
equity method of accounting except when classified as 
held for sale. Investments in associates are carried in the 
balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
associate, less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. Losses of the associates in excess of the 
Group’s interest in those associates are not recognised 
unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of 
the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as 
goodwill and included in the carrying value of the 
investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition 
below the Group’s share of the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of 
acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in 
profit and loss in the period of acquisition.

Where a Group Company transacts with an associate of 
the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent 
of the Group’s interest in the relevant associate. Losses 
may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment.
The Company’s investments in associated undertakings 
are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
cA sh And c Ash e Quiv Alents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits 
held on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments, and bank overdrafts. In the balance 
sheet, bank overdrafts are included in borrowings 
in current liabilities.
shAre c APit Al And sh Are P remium
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares, other than on a business combination, are shown 
as a deduction, net of tax, in equity from the proceeds. 
Share issue costs incurred directly in connection 
with a business combination are included in the 
cost of acquisition.
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in 
the period in which they are declared.
Where the Company or its subsidiaries purchase its own or 
its parent Company’s equity share capital, the consideration 
paid, including any attributable transaction costs, net of 
income taxes, is deducted from the total shareholders’ 
equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled. Where 
such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any 
consideration received is included in shareholders’ equity.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events. 
It is probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the 
amount can be made.
wArr Anty
The Group recognises the estimated liability to repair or 
replace its products still under warranty at the balance 
sheet date. This provision is calculated based on the past 
history of the level of repairs and replacements or on the 
basis of best estimates.
o nerous contr Acts
The Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts 
when the expected benefits to be derived from a 
contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the obligations under the contract.

r estructurin G
Restructuring provisions mainly comprise lease 
termination penalties and employee termination 
payments, and are recognised in the period in which 
the Group becomes legally or constructively  
committed to payment. 
A constructive obligation to restructure arises only when 
an entity:
has a detailed formal plan for restructuring; and
has raised a valid expectation in those affected that 
it will carry out the restructuring by starting to 
implement that plan or announcing its main features 
to those affected by it.
Costs relating to the ongoing activities of the Group are 
not provided for in advance. Any fixed assets that are no 
longer required for their original use are transferred to 
current assets and carried at the lower of the carrying 
amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
borrowin G costs And interest
Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds 
received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent 
periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using 
the effective yield method. Any difference between 
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value is recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowing.
When borrowings are repurchased or settled before 
maturity, any difference between the amount repaid and 
the carrying amount is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
r evenue reco Gnition
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards 
have been transferred to the buyer, when the Group no 
longer retains significant management involvement in 
the sold item, when it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the 
enterprise, when the amount of the revenue can be 
measured reliably and when the costs incurred can be 
reliably measured. Sales of print systems, consumables 
and parts and options are recognised net of sales tax and 
discounts. Revenue from service arrangements is 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion when 
this can be measured by reference to labour hours 
incurred prior to the year end as a percentage of total 
estimated labour hours for the contract. When the 
outcome of the transaction involving the rendering 
of services cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is 
recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised 
that are recoverable. No revenue is recognised on barter 
transactions involving the exchange of similar goods and 
services. Interest is recognised on a time proportion basis 
that reflects the effective yield of the asset. Dividends are 
recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive 
payment is established.
•
•
emPloyee bene Fit costs
Employees benefit payments are generally paid in cash 
and expensed to the income statement. The non-cash 
element of employee benefits generally relate to share 
based payments.
Forei Gn currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency 
other than the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (the ‘functional 
currency’) are recorded at the rates ruling when the 
transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets 
and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities 
are similarly recognised immediately in the income 
statement, except for foreign currency borrowings as a 
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are 
translated into euros at rates approximating to those 
ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and 
liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill 
arising on the acquisition of those operations, are 
translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising on translating the opening 
net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas 
operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity 
(the ‘foreign exchange reserve’). The Company balance 
sheet has been translated at a rate of 0,6715 €/£.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative 
exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange 
reserve relating to that operation up to the date of 
disposal are transferred to the income statement as  
part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Fin Anci Al instruments
Fin Anci Al A ssets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the 
following categories, depending on the purpose for 
which the asset was acquired. Other than financial assets 
in a qualifying hedging relationship (see below), the 
Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives. 
They are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. 
The Group does not have any assets held for trading nor 
does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at 
fair value through profit or loss.
loans and receivables 
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They arise principally through the provision 
of goods and services to customers (trade debtors), but 
also incorporate other types of contractual monetary 
asset. They are carried at cost less any provision for 
impairment. Punch Graphix plc

h eld-to-maturity investments
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the 
Group’s management has the positive intention and 
ability to hold the maturity. These assets are measured 
at amortised cost, with changes through the income 
statement.
Available-for-sale
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the  
above categories, are classified as available-for-sale and 
comprise the Group’s strategic investments in entities not 
qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled 
entities. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognised directly in equity. Where a decline in 
the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset 
constitutes objective evidence of impairment, the 
amount of the loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the income statement.
Fin Anci Al li Abilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two 
categories, depending on the purpose for which the 
liability was acquired. Other than financial liabilities in a 
qualifying hedging relationship, the Group’s accounting 
policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only out-of-the-money 
derivatives. They are carried in the balance sheet at  
fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement.
o ther financial liabilities
These other financial liabilities include the following 
items:
Trade payables and other short-term monetary 
liabilities, which are recognised at amortised cost. 
Bank borrowings drawn by the Group are initially 
recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs. 
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method, which ensures that any interest expense 
over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on 
the balance of the liability carried in the balance sheet. 
‘Interest expense’ in this context includes initial 
transaction costs and premiums payable on 
redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable 
while the liability is outstanding.
The Group does not apply the principles of hedge 
accounting.
shAre-b Ased PA yments
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair 
value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the 
income statement over the vesting period. Non-market 
vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting 
the number of equity instruments expected to vest at 
each balance sheet so that, ultimately, the cumulative 
•
•
amount recognised over the vesting period is based 
on the number of options that eventually vest. Market 
vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the 
options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions 
are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the 
market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative 
expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market 
vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified 
before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the 
options, measured immediately before and after the 
modification, is also charged to the income statement 
over the remaining vesting period.
investment in subsidi Aries
The Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is 
recognised at cost less provision for impairment.

The Group’s operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of products and services provided, with each 
segment representing a distinct business line that  offers different products and serves different markets. Unallocated costs, mainly represent 
corporate expenses. Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories, receivables and operating 
cash and exclude financial assets. Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and corporate borrowings. Capital expenditures comprise 
additions to property, plant and equipment (see note 12) and intangible assets (see note 10), including additions resulting from acquisitions. For 
the primary reporting format, the two business segments are CtP (Computer to Plate) and DP (Digital Printing).

Included in the charge of the year is the €1,600,000 adjustment to goodwill described in note 1 1. Acquisition includes the €1,090,000 of  
pre-existing goodwill relating to Linomedia.
Capitalised development costs principally comprise internally generated expenditure on major projects where it is reasonably anticipated that the 
costs will generate future economic benefits.     
All amortisation charges have been determined in accordance with the accounting policies described on page 30 and are recognised in 
depreciation and amortisation in the income statement.
The average remaining useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows: development costs two years and software licences one year.

       € ‘000 € ‘000
At 31 December 2006, goodwill can be allocated to the business segments as follows:    
CtP       7,852 9,699
Digital       4,776 3,317
Other       15 15
Goodwill       12,643 13,031
Management have assessed the carrying value of this goodwill on a value in use basis, using cash flow projections from formally approved 
budgets covering a five year period. Cash flows outside of this period grew at a constant rate of 3% (2005: 3%). The discount rate applied to the 
cash flow projections is the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 18% (2005: 18%). The projected gross profit margin is a key assumption and 
is based on management’s past experience. Forecast profit margins have been set in a conservative manner. The impairment test demonstrated 
that no impairment loss should be recognised.
In 2006, Punch Graphix Prepress Germany utilised €1,600,000 of income tax income on losses carried forward. At acquisition date no deferred tax 
asset was recognised. In accordance with IFRS3, the carrying amount of goodwill was reduced to the amount that would have been recognised  
if the deferred tax asset had been recognised in the balance sheet on the acquisition date (20 December 2004). The reduction of the carrying 
amount of goodwill of €1,847 ,000 was recognised as a depreciation and amortisation in the income statement. Punch Graphix plc

No shares were exercisable at the end of the year. The Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) is intended to offer an effective incentive over the 
longer term (three years) to executive directors and certain senior executives. Advice on the scheme was taken from Allen & Overy LLP  
and Altium Capital Limited prior to the AIM launch and was detailed in the launch data. The LTIP plan was adopted by the company on  
28 April 2005. 
The LTIP plan allows the Board to grant awards of shares in the company to employees of the group of Punch Graphix companies or to service 
companies, which the Board determines to be eligible for such grant. The total number of new ordinary shares, which may be issued may not 
exceed, when aggregated with ordinary shares issued pursuant to the LTIP in the previous 10 years, five percent of the total share capital of 
the company. A participant receiving an award under the LTIP will have full legal and beneficiary ownership of the ordinary shares from the 
date of grant, subject to certain restrictions. Participants will have voting rights and are entitled to dividends and other distributions in relation 
to these ordinary shares. The ordinary shares of an award, may not be disposed of before the end of the vesting period, which is for the 
current awards granted, three years from the date of grant. The awards granted are subject to a minimum of the earnings per share per 
annum and to other performance conditions, which are linked to the growth and the performance of the Company in relation to the AIM UK 
50 and to a peer group of companies. If a participant, who is an employee ceases to be in employment within the Group of Punch Graphix  Punch Graphix plc

companies, due to retirement, disability, illness, injury, redundancy or as a result of the sale of the business or subsidiary, by which the 
participant is employed, the award will continue to vest. If employment ceases for other reasons, the award will be forfeited. If the participant, 
who is an employee, dies, the award will vest immediately.
 
If a participant which is a service company ceases to provide services to the Company or a subsidiary, the award will be forfeited, unless the 
Board determines otherwise.
On the lapse of an award the ordinary shares subject to an award will be transferred to a third party specified by the Company, unless the 
participant transfers to the Company a cash amount equal to the market value of such number of ordinary shares.
The weighted average fair value of each share granted during the year was €0.88 (2005: €0.87). This fair value has been based upon the IPO 
placing price taken into consideration a discount for the applicable market conditions of the LTIP . An amount of €534,000 (2005: €104,000)  
has been recognised as an expense in the year in respect of the LTIP . This amount was calculated using the Black-Scholes model with 
following assumptions:
       2006 2005
Current share price (in €):       1.87 1.88
Strike price (in €):       1.42 1.42

The Board granted, in accordance with the rules of the LTIP plan, on 27 February 2006 the total award of shares to the service company of  
Dick Tilanus. 
In 2005, 732,456 shares were issued under the LTIP of which 574,570 shares remain outstanding. They were issued at an exercise price of €1.42 
and vest over 3 years.
On 16 November 2006, the Company announced that 150,000 ordinary shares of 10p each in the capital of the Company were issued and 
alloted to Wolive N.V, the service company for Ben Van Assche, the CEO of the Company, pursuant to the Company’s LTIP . 
11,570 shares issued to Wolive N.V were new ordinary shares of 10p each in the capital of the Company and the balance of 138,430 ordinary 
shares were transfers of existing shares to Wolive NV from former members of the LTIP . The 150,000 ordinary shares will vest over a three year 
period if the EPS grows by 10% compared to the EPS of the preceding fiscal year.
The Board of Directors has decided that certain employees of the leadership team shall have the opportunity to receive all together a 
maximum of 128,000 ordinary shares (the ‘Award’) of Punch Graphix plc. (the ‘Company’) after a period of three Financial Years of the 
Company commencing on the first day of the Financial year 2006 (the ‘Performance Period’) under the LTIP . The shares will be granted under 
the LTIP after the end of the financial year ending on 31 December 2008 or on such earlier date, in accordance with the Rules of the Plan, and 
shall vest immediately without conditions. No vesting period will begin earlier than upon the grant of the Award. However the Award will only 
be made if the growth in the Company’s earnings per share over the Performance Period equals or is greater than ten per cent (10%) per 
annum for each individual year.
For the determination of the grant and vesting date the rules as described above take precedence over the LTIP . The participation in the LTIP is 
at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Group has entered into finance leases for periods ranging from 4 to 40 years. The interest rate inherent in the leases is fixed at the contract 
date for all of the lease term. The average effective interest rate contracted approximates to 6.25% (2005: 6.25%). All leases are on a fixed 
repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rents. Obligations under finance leases are secured by the 
lessor’s charge over the leased assets.
Long-term bank loans includes a five year loan at a floating interest rate with six monthly installments. Short-term bank loans consist mainly of 
straight loans with a term of one week and a fixed interest rate (with a weighted average interest rate between 3.5 and 4.5%). Punch Graphix plc

Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using local tax rate applicable in each country. Deferred tax 
assets have been recognised in full on taxable losses as realisation of the tax benefit from these losses is probable. The movements in gross

26. Fin Anci Al i nstruments
(i) Financial risk factors
The Group seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of their local business, however, fluctuations in market 
prices, foreign currency exchange rates on sales and purchases or inter-company loans are inherent risks in the performance of the business. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure arising from its operational, financing and investment activities. The net 
exposure is managed on a central basis in accordance with the principles laid down by the directors. As a policy, the Group does not engage 
in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The long-term bank loan  
(see note 22) with floating interest rate exposes the group to interest rate risk.
(ii) Foreign exchange risk
Due to the international nature the Group’s business it is exposed to different foreign exchange risks arising from various currency exposures 
primarily with respect to the US dollar and £UK. Companies in the Group use forward contracts or other instruments, concluded with local 
banks to hedge their exposure to foreign currency risks in their local reporting currency. The Groups financial liabilities and assets can be 
analysed by currency as follows:

(iii) c redit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risks and has policies in place to monitor the credit risks on customers. For major projects 
the intervention of credit insurance companies or similar organisations is requested. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in respect 
of trade debtors and finance lease receivables are reflected by the amounts included in the balance sheet.
(iv) l iquidity risk
Liquidity risk is linked to the evolution of the Group’s working capital and is managed centrally. The Group monitors the change in working 
capital through focused actions. Punch Graphix plc

(v) Fair value interest risk
The Group enters into lease arrangements as both lessee and lessor. These leases are transacted at fixed rate thereby exposing the Group to 
fair value interest rate risk. Currently, the Group does not hedge any of this risk. Finance leases to which the Group is exposed to fair value risk 
can be analysed as follows:

There is no significant difference between the book and fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
h edging activities
At 31 December 2006, the Group held several foreign exchange contracts to hedge future cash inflows in USD and JPY. The hedged items 
concern foreseeable transactions (sales orders) and highly probable future transactions (from anticipated orders). Hedging activities were 
effected by combining forward exchange contracts and currency options and swaps, which combines a call and put and aims to hedge 
future USD and JPY inflows. Since the Group does not apply the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement, the hedge items that are recognised at year-end, are included in the balance sheet at fair value and movements in fair value are 
taken directly to net profit or loss for the year. The following foreign exchange contracts are outstanding:

27. Pension commitments
The Group established a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees. The Group’s pension arrangements 
are principally defined contributions in nature. Defined benefit arrangements are not significant, covering just eight employees. The assets of 
these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds administered and under control of trustees.
At 31 December 2006, no contributions were outstanding to these schemes. Pensions costs are disclosed in note 4.

shares (586,320 shares) granted under LTIP vests. In respect of the vesting of the LTIP an amount of €380,000 has to be recognised in the 
income statement in 2007.
The Board of Directors decided in 2006 that certain employees of the leadership team would receive a maximum of 128,000 ordinary shares 
if certain conditions were fulfilled. Due to the offer of Punch International and the Rules of the Plan, the Board of Directors decided to grant 
50% of the shares. In January 2007, 64,000 ordinary shares of 10p each were issued.
The Companies Act 1985 permits the Directors to revise the financial statement subsequent to issuance if they are found to be defective.

The following notes explain your general rights as a shareholder and your right to attend and vote at this meeting or to appoint someone else 
to vote on your behalf.
1.  Only those members registered in the Register of Members of the Company as at 10am on 19 May 2007 shall be entitled to attend and 
vote at the meeting convened above in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. 
2.  A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the above notice is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend 
and, on a poll, to vote instead of him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a shareholder 
from attending in person and voting at the meeting.
3.  A form of appointment of proxy is enclosed. If you return more than one proxy appointment, that received last by the registrar before  
the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence. The form of proxy includes a vote withheld option. Please note that a  
vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes for and against any  
particular resolution.
4.  The appointment of a proxy and the original or duly certified copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is 
signed or authenticated should be deposited with the Company’s registrar at the address shown on the proxy form or received by the 
registrar not later than 10am on 19 May 2007 or 48 hours before the time for holding any adjourned meeting. 
5.   In accordance with the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those members entered on the Company’s register of members 
not later than 10am on 19 May 2007 or, if the meeting is adjourned, shareholders entered on the Company’s register of members not later 
than 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting. Changes to entries on 
the register of members after that time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.

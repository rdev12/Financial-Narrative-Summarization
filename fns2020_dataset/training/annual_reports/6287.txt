Chairman’s Statement
I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE an improved profit performance,
against a background throughout 2005 of continuing challenging
trading conditions in the Group’s principal market of commercial
printing.
The figures have been prepared under International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and those for 2004 have been
restated on a comparable basis. The effect of adoption of IFRS on
both the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet is not material.
The figures in this paragraph exclude the exceptional items in
both 2004 and 2005 referred to below. Revenue for the year
reduced by 4% to £40.94m from £42.73m, mainly as a result of
two Group companies withdrawing from unprofitable activities.
Operating profit increased by 4% to £4.19m from £4.02m,
representing an operating margin of 10% (2004: 9%). Profit 
before tax increased by 8% to £3.82m from £3.52m, representing
a pre-tax margin of 9% (2004: 8%). Earnings per share increased
by 12.5% to 9.9p from 8.8p.
The £1.44m exceptional gain in 2005 relates to the sale of the
Group’s freehold property in Old Street, London EC1, previously
occupied by Royle Financial Print, and includes the second stage
payment of £0.9m received from the sale in 2003 of the Group’s
unused property in Lewes, Sussex, on approval of planning
consent for redevelopment. The £0.34m charge in 2004 relates
mainly to the costs of reorganisation and relocation of W E Baxter Fulmar plc  
°
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 11 10 Chairman’s Statement
in May 2004 and the related loss on sale of fixed assets, together
with the costs of closure in October 2004 of the specialist greetings
card finishing department within Royle Corporate Print.
After exceptional items, operating profit was up 53% at £5.63m
from £3.68m, pre-tax profit was up 65% at £5.26m from £3.19m,
and earnings per share were up 90% at 15.2p from 8.0p.
Year end equity shareholders’ funds were £27.92m, up from
£25.62m, giving net assets per share of 103.6p, up from 95.1p, an
increase of 9%. Year end net indebtedness reduced to £2.45m
from £9.10m with resultant gearing of 9% (2004: 35%), reflecting
the £2.65m net proceeds from property sales and the continuing
below normal levels of capital expenditure. Net financing costs
payable at £0.38m (2004: £0.50m) were covered 11.2 times
(2004: 8.1 times) by operating profit before exceptional items.
The Group’s book-related businesses continue to perform well,
increasing revenue by 4% to £14.31m (2004: £13.79m), reflecting
sustained demand. The Group’s commercial and financial printing
businesses experienced a reduction in revenue of 8% to £26.63m
(2004: £28.94m), mainly as a result of the reorganisation of 
W E Baxter in mid-2004 and the closure of the greetings cards
business of Royle Corporate Print later in 2004, both having been
unprofitable activities.
The improvement in Group profitability while trading remains
highly competitive, together with our awards success, has been
achieved by the continuing efforts of our staff and I thank them for
their commitment. 
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend
per share of 3.4p, which, if approved at the AGM on 10 May 2006,
will be paid on 17 May 2006 to those shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 21 April 2006. Together with
the unchanged interim dividend per share of 1.8p paid on 
7 November 2005, dividends per share total an unchanged 5.2p,
which is covered 1.9 times (2004: 1.7 times) by earnings per share
before exceptional items.

Chief Executive’s Review
THE GROUP’S PRE-TAX MARGIN OF 9%, up from 8% in 2004,
remains at the higher end of results within our industry and
reflects both an 8% increase in pre-tax profit and a reduction in
revenue of 4%.
This result is consistent with Group strategy of targeted
reorganisation of unprofitable elements of our business and
selective investment in areas of profitable growth.
Operational Review
The Group is managed on a unified basis and therefore reports its
results as one operating segment.
Our businesses which operate in the commercial and financial
printing markets account for the majority of Group revenue at
65% (2004: 68%). In the period under review, revenue for these
Group businesses has fallen by 8% to £26.63m (2004: £28.94m)
mainly due to the reorganisation of W E Baxter in May 2004 and
the closure of the Royle Corporate Print specialist greetings cards
operations in October 2004, both having been unprofitable
activities. 
The continuing pressure on prices within the commercial print
market, driven by overcapacity and static demand in 2005, also
contributed to this decline in revenue. This was mitigated to some
extent during the second half of 2005 by an increase in City
activity benefiting Royle Financial Print, our typesetting and
financial document operation. Fulmar plc  
°
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 15 14 Chief Executive’s Review
Royle Financial Print was relocated within the City in
December 2005 to smaller leasehold premises, more suited to its
activities, and a new typesetting and pre-press system installed at
a total cost of £0.15m.
The Group has enjoyed many years of continuous awards
success and this year is no exception, with Royle Corporate Print
being awarded bronze in the Sappi European Print Awards and
voted “Report and Accounts – Winner” of the Printing World
Annual Awards. Fulmar Colour was short listed with four entries
in the Printing World “Brochures” category and repeated its
success of 2004 by being “Highly Commended for Brochures” in
the 2005 McNaughton Review.
Revenue from the Group’s activities in the markets of
paperback books, jackets and covers contributed 35% of the
Group total (2004: 32%), increasing by 4% to £14.31m (2004:
£13.79m). Following a slower than anticipated start to the year,
demand increased in the second half.
In January 2005, Bookmarque, the Group’s paperback book
printing business, took delivery of a third Timson web book text
printing machine at an installed cost of £1.6m and this, together
with the introduction of a third permanent shift on its binding
line, increased capacity, such that Bookmarque was able to
successfully tender for new contractual business. 
In October 2005, Bookmarque was appointed as a paperback
book supplier to Penguin for a proportion of its requirements,
with the first orders being received during November 2005.
Following a period of high capital expenditure in all our print
operations in earlier years, these businesses are well equipped,
resulting in a reduced level of capital expenditure for 2005 at £2.3m.
Freehold Property
In December 2005, the Group completed on the sale of its freehold
premises in Old Street, London EC1 for a cash consideration of
£1.8m. These premises had previously been occupied by Royle
Financial Print. 
The Group sold, in 2003, a vacant freehold property in Lewes,
Sussex previously occupied by W E Baxter, for an initial
consideration of £1.6m in cash. An additional consideration of
£0.9m became payable, during the year, on completion of the
planning process and this was received in November 2005. 
The Group is entitled to receive a further payment on the
conclusion of the redevelopment and sale of the apartments, for
which planning consent has now been granted. The final
payment, if any, will be calculated at 35% of the gross sale
proceeds of the new apartments above £10.2m, excluding the
affordable housing element. At present, it is anticipated that any
such payment received would be insignificant.
Outlook
While our commercial printing businesses continue to operate in
a market that is characterised by relatively static demand and
under-utilised capacity resulting in downward price pressure, we
have begun to see signs of some improvement since the year end.
This is further supported by increased demand for financial print.
Our book related businesses are operating in a more buoyant
market environment and we continue to win new business. We
therefore remain cautiously optimistic in the immediate future for
the Group as a whole.

Fulmar plc

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 19
Health, Safety and Environmental Policies
Great importance is attached to health, safety and the
environment and the Group has a strong culture of proactive
management, reinforced by regular internal monitoring and
support at executive level. This is supported by the Group’s health
and safety, and environmental policies.
Charitable Donations
The Group made charitable donations of £2,000 during the year
(2004: £2,000).
Suppliers’ Payment
The Group’s payment policy is in accordance with terms that 
are agreed with individual suppliers. Creditor days at 
31 December 2005 amounted to 79 days (2004: 73 days). 
The company only incurs administrative expenses and the
creditor days amounted to 50 days (2004: 56 days).
Going Concern Statement
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will find on pages 91 to 96 the notice of the
forthcoming annual general meeting of the company to be 
held on 10 May 2006. 
In addition to the ordinary business of the meeting, three
resolutions (numbered 6 to 8) are proposed as special business. 20 Directors’ Report
Authority of Directors to Allot Shares
Resolutions 6 and 7 are similar to the authorities given to the
directors at the last annual general meeting of the company.
By law, directors are not permitted to allot new shares (or to
grant rights over shares) unless authorised to do so by
shareholders. In addition, directors require specific authority
from shareholders before allotting new shares (or rights in respect
of shares) for cash without first offering them to existing
shareholders in proportion to their holdings.
Resolution 6 gives the directors the necessary authority for the
period of five years from the date of the passing of such resolution
to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £449,234
(being equal to approximately one-third of the issued share capital
of the company). 
Resolution 7 empowers the directors, for the period of five
years from the date of the passing of such resolution, to 
allot shares for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders on a
pro-rata basis, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £67,385,
which is the equivalent of 5% of the issued share capital of the
company. It also enables the directors, in the case of an issue by
way of rights, to deal with fractional entitlements and to make
such exclusions or other arrangements as may be appropriate to
resolve legal, regulatory or practical problems which might arise,
particularly with regard to overseas shareholders.
It is intended that these authorities and powers are renewed at
successive annual general meetings.
There is no present intention of issuing any ordinary shares,
except perhaps in connection with the company’s share 
option scheme. As at 23 March 2006 the company holds no equity
securities in treasury.
Purchase of Own Shares
Resolution 8 renews the authority for the company to make
market purchases (within the meaning of section 163 of 
the Companies Act 1985) on the London Stock Exchange up to an
aggregate of 2,695,405 ordinary shares (equivalent to 10% of the
issued share capital of the company) at a minimum price per
ordinary share of 5p and a maximum of 105% of the average of
the middle market quotations of the ordinary shares as derived
Fulmar plc  
°
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 21
from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five
business days immediately preceding the day on which that
ordinary share is contracted to be purchased. This proposal
should not be taken as an indication that the company will
purchase shares at any particular price or indeed at all, and the
directors will only consider making purchases if they believe that
such purchases would result in an increase in earnings per share
and are in the best interests of the shareholders.
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual
general meeting of the company, or, if earlier, the expiry 
of 15 months from the date of the passing of such resolution.
It is intended to renew this authority and power at successive
annual general meetings.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company’s
auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general
meeting.
Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the
board.

Corporate Governance
THE DIRECTORS SUPPORT The Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued in July 2003 (the ‘Combined Code’). 
The board sets out its report on how the Group has applied the
principles and whether it has complied with the Combined Code
during the year.
Application of the Principles 
Directors
The board is responsible for the Group’s strategic direction, and its
operating and financial performance. The board comprised three
executive and two independent non-executive directors, all of
whom met on eight occasions in 2005, following a formal agenda. 
Directors’ biographies are given on page 4.
The separate roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are clearly
defined. The Chairman conducts board and shareholder meetings
and ensures that all directors are properly briefed. The Chief
Executive is responsible for developing and co-ordinating the
business and implementing Group strategy.
There is an agreed procedure for the directors to take
independent professional advice at the company’s expense, 
to have access to the Company Secretary and receive appropriate
training where necessary, including an induction on appointment.
All directors are required to retire by rotation at least every
three years when they can offer themselves for re-election if
eligible.
All members of the remuneration and nominations committee
met once during 2005. They monitor, review and make
recommendations to the board on all elements of the
remuneration and performance of the directors of the company.
They also consider the award of options under the company share
option plan and make recommendations to the board in respect of 24 Corporate Governance
the appointment of directors of the company. The committee
consists solely of non-executive directors, and its terms of
reference are available from the Company Secretary on request.
The report on remuneration is set out on pages 29 to 32.
Annual performance appraisals of the executive directors are
conducted by the remuneration and nominations committee, 
and feedback given to the individuals throughout the year. The
executive directors similarly appraise the performance of the non-
executive directors. There is ongoing evaluation of the board and
its committees, by the directors, throughout the year.
Relations with Shareholders
The company encourages meaningful dialogue with both its
institutional and private investors. The executive directors
undertake presentations following the announcement of the
interim and final results, and the directors are available 
for comment throughout the year and at the annual general
meeting.
Accountability and Audit 
The responsibilities of the directors and auditors are set out on
pages 27 and 33.
The board has established the necessary procedures to
implement the Combined Code provisions, except as mentioned
below. These have been in place throughout 2005 and up to the
date of approval of the financial statements.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by the Group and this process
is regularly reviewed.
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s
systems of internal control and reviewed them for their
effectiveness during the year by examining reports from
individual directors and the external auditors. Any system of 
internal control can only provide reasonable but not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Fulmar plc  
°
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 25
The principal components of the systems for planning, executing,
controlling and monitoring the Group’s activities in order to
achieve its objectives and minimise major risks are:
• an organisational structure with defined lines of responsibility
and delegation of authority;
• a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting system
which enables the board to evaluate the performance of 
the Group on a monthly basis and take action where necessary
on a timely basis;
• continual review and development of the Group’s internal
control, risk management and management information
systems;
• clearly defined guidelines for capital investment.
Steps continue to be taken to further embed internal control
and risk management procedures into the operations of the
business and to deal with areas of improvement which come to
management’s and the board’s attention.
The board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function
but does not consider it necessary at the current time.
All members of the audit committee met twice during 2005.
They assist the board in discharging its duty to ensure that the
financial statements presented by the company to its shareholders
conform with all legal requirements and that the Group’s systems
of internal control and whistle blowing procedures are adequate.
They consider the re-appointment of auditors, their fees, and the
scope and findings of their audit. The committee consists solely of
non-executive directors, and its terms of reference are available
from the Company Secretary on request.
An account of the Group’s position and prospects is given in 
the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review on 
pages 9 to 15. 26 Corporate Governance
Compliance Statement
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2005 the company has
been in compliance with the Code provisions set out 
in Section 1 of the Combined Code except for the following matter:
•   directors’ notice and contract periods are set at more than one
year as explained on page 30.
Fulmar plc

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 27
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
THE DIRECTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE for preparing the Annual
Report and the financial statements. The directors are required to
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Company law
requires the directors to prepare such financial statements in
accordance with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation. They continue to prepare financial statements
for the company in accordance with UK GAAP.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable
IFRS. Directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and under-
standable information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance. 28 Statement of Director’ Responsibilities
In the case of UK GAAP financial statements, the directors are
required to prepare financial statements for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company. In preparing these financial statements, the directors
are also required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgements that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the company, for safeguarding the
assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation
of a directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report which
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Regulations 2002
require the auditors to report to the company’s members on the
‘auditable part’ of the directors’ remuneration report and to state
whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as
amended by the Regulations). All information relating to the
‘auditable part’ of the report is shown in note 4 to the accounts.
In all other respects the report contains unaudited information.
Information about the emoluments and share options of the
directors is given in note 4 to the accounts. Their interests in the
share capital of the company are shown on page 18.
The remuneration policy for executive directors is controlled by
the remuneration and nominations committee of the board,
comprising the independent non-executive directors, J K McKay
and J D Dutton. Their aim is to ensure that the remuneration
packages for executive directors are designed to attract, motivate
and retain high quality individuals. The packages reflect the
executives’ own responsibilities and the performance of the Group
as a whole.
The remuneration policy is as follows:
• competitive salaries are provided by reference to information
on similar positions in the printing and related industries;
• each executive director will receive an annual bonus if the
percentage increase in the Group’s earnings per share in that
year exceeds a threshold of the percentage increase in the retail
price index in that period plus 3%, such bonus to be at a rate
of 1.5% of the executive director’s basic salary for each 1% that
the earnings per share exceeds the threshold; 30 Directors’ Remuneration Report
• where circumstances exist beyond the scope of the policy (such
as negative earnings per share in the prior year), the
remuneration and nominations committee will use its
discretion to determine whether any bonus is payable and, if
so, the amount of such bonus. In forming its view, the
committee will take account of the bonus arrangements set out
in the directors’ contracts;
• the company makes fixed payments into the Group’s main
defined contribution pension scheme having taken account of
the level of basic salary;
• directors may be granted options under the share option plan
and hold options under the sharesave scheme;
• a benefits package is provided including an appropriate
company car, or alternative, and medical expense and
permanent health insurances;
• service contracts are of two years duration and are terminable
by not less than two years notice by either party. Whilst the
committee acknowledges that there is a case for setting one
year notice and contract periods, the committee considers the
current arrangements to be in the best interests of the Group in
maintaining the services of its key directors. Any compensation
payments will be determined having regard to the particular
circumstances of the case.
As set out in note 4 to the accounts, the executive directors
have waived their right to receive a bonus for 2005 under the
annual bonus scheme. The bonus was waived because it resulted
mainly from exceptional items.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined
by the board as a whole in line with fees paid to non-executive
directors of similar companies. They are normally appointed
under fixed term contracts of two years duration and are
terminable by not less than one years notice by either party.

In October 2005, BOOKMARQUE was appointed as a paperback
book supplier to Penguin. While our COMMERCIAL PRINTING businesses continue to operate 
in a market that is characterised by relatively static demand and
under-utilised capacity resulting in downward price pressure, we
have begun to see signs of some improvement since the year end.
This is further supported by increased demand for FINANCIAL PRINT. The Group has enjoyed many years of continuous AWARDS SUCCESS
and this year is no exception, with ROYLE CORPORATE PRINT being
awarded bronze in the Sappi European Print Awards and voted
“Report and Accounts – Winner” of the Printing World Annual Awards.

Independent Auditors’ Report – Group
to the Members of Fulmar plc
WE HAVE AUDITED the Group financial statements of Fulmar plc
for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the
consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet,
the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement
of recognised income and expense and the related notes 1 to 20.
These Group financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the directors’ remuneration report that is
described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual company
financial statements of Fulmar plc for the year ended 
31 December 2005.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, 
the directors’ remuneration report and the Group financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the 34 Independent Auditors’ Report – Group
European Union are set out in the statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as
having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the
relevant financial reporting framework and whether the Group
financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article
4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the Group financial
statements. We also report to you if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ transactions
with the company and other members of the Group is not
disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not
complied with any of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure
requirements specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. These comprise the amount of each
element in the remuneration package and information on share
options, details of long term incentive schemes, and money
purchase and defined benefit schemes. We give a statement, to the
extent possible, of details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the corporate governance statement
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
Fulmar plc  
°
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 35
statement on internal control covers all risks and controls, or form
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information
contained in the annual report for the above year as described in
the contents section including the unaudited part of the directors’
remuneration report and we consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. 
Basis of Audit Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group
financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the Group financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited. 36 Independent Auditors’ Report – Group
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December
2005 and of its profit for the year then ended; and
• the Group financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act

for the year ended 31 December 2005
1 Accounting Policies
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the first
time. The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition
from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 20. The financial
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS
adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements IFRS
6 and 7 and IFRIC 4 to 9, which have not been applied in these
financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective. The
directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and
interpretations in future years will have no material impact on the
financial statements of the Group.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
Accounting Convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost
convention.
Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial
statements of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings
made up to 31 December each year.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent
liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the
date of acquisition. Any excess of fair value of consideration given
for the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets
acquired is recognised as goodwill. In circumstances where the fair
values of the identifiable net assets exceed the cost of acquisition
the excess is immediately recognised in the income statement.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included in the consolidated income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal
as appropriate.
In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, goodwill is
no longer amortised but stated at cost less any provision for
impairment in its value.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to
IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to
reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and
is not included in determining subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Property, Plant and Equipment
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the
course of construction. On other assets depreciation is provided
on cost or net book value in order to write off the cost less residual
value over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The rates of
depreciation are as follows:
• Freehold buildings and long 
leasehold land and buildings –  2% per annum
• Short leasehold land and 
buildings –  over the term of the lease
• Plant and machinery –  10 – 25% per annum
• Motor vehicles –  20% per annum
• Fixtures, fittings and 
equipment –  10 – 25% per annum.
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for
their intended use or sale are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their
intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the
period in which they are incurred. Fulmar plc  
°
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 49 48 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts
1 Accounting Policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes materials, direct labour and appropriate production
overheads.
Taxation
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be paid or received on
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
and the corresponding tax bases used in tax computations and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred
tax is provided in full on temporary differences which result in an
obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax or a right to
pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they
crystallise based on current tax rates and laws. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not discounted.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all
or part of the asset to be recovered.
Financial Instruments
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are
recognised in the income statement when there is objective
evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand
deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank Borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are
accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the
effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value
of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period
in which they arise.
Trade Payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts
Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts
are capitalised at their fair value on acquisition and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. The finance charges are
allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital
element outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to income in equal annual
amounts over the lease term.
Pension Costs
The expense of defined benefit pension schemes is determined
using the projected unit method and charged to the income
statement based on actuarial assumptions at the beginning of the
financial year. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in
the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in
which they occur. Net pension obligations are included in the
balance sheet at the present value of the scheme liabilities, less
the fair value of the scheme assets. Fulmar plc

Pension Costs continued
The expense of the defined contribution pension schemes and
other employee benefits is charged in the income statement as

Share Based Payments
In accordance with the transitional arrangements of IFRS 2 ‘Share
Based Payment’ the Group has not revalued the share options
issued prior to 7 November 2002.
2 Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
The Group is managed on a unified basis and therefore reports
its results as one operating segment.

Deferred tax has not been provided in respect of gains realised
that have been rolled over into the acquisition cost of replacement
assets. This tax will become payable if the replacement assets are
sold and further rollover relief is not obtained. The estimated
amount of tax that would become payable by the company and the
Group in these circumstances is £167,000 (2004: £167,000).
Group deferred tax assets of £310,000 (2004: £381,000) and
£985,000 (2004: £1,289,000) have not been recognised in respect
of timing differences relating to revenue losses and capital losses
respectively as there is insufficient evidence that the assets will be
recovered due to the uncertainty of the availability of future profits
against which the losses can be recovered.

11 Other Financial Assets
Trade and other Receivables
Trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date include
amounts receivable from the sale of goods of £9,006,000 (2004:
£10,793,000).
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 75 days.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and
other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Bank Balances and Cash
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and
short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less. Investment income includes interest received on
bank deposits of £75,000 (2004: £29,000).
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and
cash, and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade
receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net
of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s
management based on prior experience and their assessment of
the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the
counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and
customers.
Contingent Asset
The Group sold, in 2003, a vacant freehold property in Lewes,
Sussex previously occupied by W E Baxter, for an initial
consideration of £1.6m in cash. An additional consideration of
£0.9m became payable, during the year, on completion of the
planning process and this was received in November 2005. The
Group is entitled to receive a further payment on the conclusion of
the redevelopment and sale of the apartments, for which planning
consent has now been granted. The final payment, if any, will be
calculated at 35% of the gross sale proceeds of the new
apartments above £10.2m, excluding the affordable housing
element. At present, it is anticipated that any such payment
received would be insignificant.
12 Other Financial Liabilities
Trade and other payables principally comprise amounts
outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and
other payables approximates to their fair value.

18 Pension Schemes
The Group operates a number of funded pension schemes which
are administered independently of the Group’s finances. 
The schemes covering the largest number of employees are of
the defined contribution type. The total cost charged to income of
£227,000 (2004: £212,000) represents contributions payable to
these schemes.
The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme. The pension
cost of the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with
the advice of qualified actuaries using the attained age method
and the most recent formal valuation was at 1 April 2002.
The disclosures required by International Accounting Standard
19 (IAS19), Retirement Benefits, are set out below; the scheme
assets are valued at market value and the liabilities are estimated
by an actuary using the projected unit method. The financial

20 Reconciliations on the Transition to IFRS
The principle differences between IFRS and UK GAAP in the
consolidated financial statements are described below.
Dividends
Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends were accrued at the balance
sheet date although there was no obligation to pay until formal
approval by shareholders was granted at the annual general
meeting. Under International Accounting Standard (IAS) 10
‘Events after the balance sheet date’, a liability should only be
recognised once there is an obligation to pay. As a result the
dividend will only be recognised once the shareholders approve it,
and the impact is shown in the tables below.
Employee Benefits
Under UK GAAP, FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ required the
pension deficit to be shown by way of memorandum disclosure in
the notes to the accounts rather than accounted for in the balance
sheet. IAS 19 ‘Employment Benefits’ requires that the operating
and financing costs of defined benefit schemes are included within
income and allows a number of options for the recognition of
actuarial gains and losses. The Group has adopted the approach
of recognising the full pension deficit at the date of transition.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in full in the
consolidated statement of income and expense (‘SORIE’). The
impact is shown below, together with the related corporation and
deferred tax adjustments.
Reconciliations
The balance sheet reconciliations at 1 January 2004 (date of
transition to IFRS) and at 31 December 2004 (date of last UK
GAAP financial statements) and the reconciliation of profit for
2004, as required by IFRS1 are shown below. Fulmar plc

21 Significant Accounting Policies
The separate financial statements of the company are presented
as required by the Companies Act 1985, and prepared in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting
Standards.
Accounting Convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost
convention.
Tangible Fixed Assets
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the
course of construction. On other assets depreciation is provided
on cost or net book value in order to write off the cost less residual
value over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The rates of
depreciation are as follows:
• Freehold buildings and long 
leasehold land and buildings ......... 2% per annum
• Short leasehold land and 
buildings ........................................ over the term of the lease
• Plant and machinery ..................... 10 – 25% per annum
• Motor vehicles ............................... 20% per annum
• Fixtures, fittings and equipment .... 10 – 25% per annum
The company capitalises directly attributable interest on all
tangible fixed assets in the course of construction. Rates of
capitalisation depend on whether a specific loan has been taken
out (when the actual interest rate and interest paid is used), or
where the construction is financed by general borrowings (when
a weighted average rate is calculated on all non-specific
borrowings).
Investments
Shares in Group companies are stated in the parent company
balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result
in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a
right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply
when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing
differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and
expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from
those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred
tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the
revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell
the asset. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it
is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts
Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts
are capitalised at their fair value on acquisition and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. The finance charges are
allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital
element outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to income in equal annual
amounts over the lease term. Fulmar plc

contracts of the subsidiaries. The extent of this liability at the
balance sheet date was £3,481,000 (2004: £6,878,000). However,

against which the losses can be recovered. Fulmar plc

29 Combined Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ Funds and

°
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 89 88 Notes to the Company Accounts
31 Prior Year Adjustment
FRS 21 – ‘Events After the Balance Sheet Date’ came into effect 
for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
FRS 21 (which embodies IAS 10) does not allow entities to provide
for final dividends declared after the balance sheet date. The
company balance sheet and combined recognition of movements
in shareholders’ funds and statement of movement in reserves
have been restated to reflect the new policy. The effects of the
change in policy are as follows: the 2004 closing profit and loss
reserve has been increased by the value of the 2004 final
proposed dividend (£917,000). The balance sheet creditor for the
dividend has also been reduced accordingly. The £917,000 2004
dividend is now included within the 2005 dividends paid balance
of £1,402,000 (with the remainder being the 2005 interim
dividend of £485,000). In addition, the 2004 dividends paid
balance has been restated to include the 2003 final dividend of
£942,000 and the 2004 interim dividend of £485,000, resulting in
a combined payment of £1,427,000.
Details of the proposed final dividend are given in note 7.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005
FULMAR, the South London-based commercial and book printer, announces a further increase
in pre-tax profit and earnings per share, despite continuing challenging trading conditions
throughout 2005 in the Group’s principal market of commercial printing.
This improved result is consistent with Group strategy of TARGETED REORGANISATION of
unprofitable elements of our business and selective investment in areas of profitable growth.
The Group has enjoyed many years of continuous AWARDS SUCCESS and this year is no
exception, with ROYLE CORPORATE PRINT being awarded bronze in the Sappi European Print
Awards and voted “Report and Accounts – Winner” of the Printing World Annual Awards.
FULMAR COLOUR was short listed with four entries in the Printing World “Brochures” category
and repeated its success of 2004 by being “Highly Commended for Brochures” in the 2005
McNaughton Review.

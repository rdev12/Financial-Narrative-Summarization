The Alumasc Group
Alumasc is a UK based supplier of premium building and precision 
engineering products. The majority of the group’s business is in the 
area of sustainable building products, which enable customers to 
manage energy and water use in the built environment. We believe 
that growth rates in these sectors, through the construction cycle,  
will exceed UK industry averages.
All Alumasc businesses have strong UK market positions within their individual market  
niches and several are market leaders. Alumasc sustains this strong strategic positioning by 
offering customers quality products, service and trust. For certain brands, Alumasc is seeking  
to leverage UK successes in international markets, with particular focus in North America and  
parts of the Middle East and Far East.
Alumasc fosters an entrepreneurial, achievement orientated culture 
whereby businesses are encouraged to innovate and respond 
quickly to local market needs within a cohesive group 
strategic and management framework. Alumasc 
businesses also benefit from the group’s 
financial strength and access  
to capital.

Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
This has been a year of major strategic re-alignment 
for Alumasc, coupled with the group’s best 
performance since 2008.
John McCall
Chairman
Overview
This has been a year of major strategic  
re-alignment for Alumasc, coupled with a strong 
trading performance.
Revenue from continuing operations rose by 
£9.2 million (+10%) to £98.1 million. Underlying 
profit before tax rose by £1.2 million (+16%)  
to £8.4 million, building on the improving trend 
of recent years, and our best performance  
since 2008.
This improvement, we believe, is further evidence 
of outperformance by our portfolio of sustainable 
building products businesses against the welcome 
background of improving demand from UK 
construction. We estimate that our building 
products businesses have outgrown the sector by  
an average 3% per annum over the past five years.
Following its review of group strategy, the Board 
initiated the sale of two businesses during the 
year, which it considered unsuited to its more 
focused vision for the future. The smaller of 
the two, Pendock Profiles, sold in September 
2014, generated a small trading profit prior to 
its sale and was sold at a profit to its book value. 
The much larger of the two, Alumasc Precision 
Components, continued to make losses until its 
sale at the close of the financial year, and a loss 
was incurred upon sale.
After taking full account of the impact of these 
two sales, basic earnings per share increased 
by 9% from 11.3 pence to 12.3 pence. The 
transactions will be earnings enhancing in the 
coming year.
The disposal of these businesses is viewed by the 
Board as a major step towards the greater focus 
of group resources in the field of sustainable 
building products foreshadowed in last year’s 
annual report. It is pleasing that both businesses 
have found new owners providing a better fit 
for their particular attributes, and we wish them 
every success for the future.
The combination of the strong performance 
outlined above with the sales proceeds from  
the two business disposals enabled the group  
to record a small cash surplus at the year-end. 
This provides an ideal base from which to pursue 
the development opportunities for our continuing 
activities referred to later in this report.
Dividends
In view of the trading performance, and 
consistent with its policy broadly to grow 
dividend payments in line with profit growth, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend  
of 3.5 pence per share (2014: 2.8 pence),  
giving a total for the year of 6 pence per share 
(2014: 5 pence), an increase of 20%. The Alumasc Group plc

Board
David Armfield, a founding partner of Kinetix 
Corporate Finance LLP , was appointed a Director 
in October 2014. David has had a 30 year 
career in the City and, through Kinetix, provides 
corporate finance advice to the clean technology 
and environmental sustainability sectors. His 
insights in these fields and, more generally, 
sustainable solutions for the built environment, 
are of real relevance to the group’s plans  
for development. 
After a little over six years as a Non-Executive 
Director, John Pilkington retires from the Board 
following the announcement of these results. 
John’s contribution and support have been 
much valued during this period of change  
and we wish him continued success with  
his wide-ranging interests.
Strategy
Our central strategy is to develop our market-
leading positions in the supply of products 
and solutions for managing water and energy 
in buildings. This marketplace embraces 
both new-build and refurbishment activities 
and presents some specific opportunities 
outside Alumasc’s UK base. In addition to 
the continuing drive for organic growth, 
acquisitions will be considered where they 
complement this focused development.
The strategic disposal of Alumasc Precision 
Components necessarily triggers the 
relocation of certain group business activities 
to new premises. In addition to providing an 
opportunity for rationalising several operations, 
this move will also assist with the commercial 
opportunity to restructure our approach to the 
market for our water management product 
ranges under the banner of Alumasc Water 
Management Solutions.
Prospects
Alumasc’s focus on premium building products 
for sustainable building, coupled with the 
steady improvement in the UK economy, have 
resulted in widespread growth in demand for 
our product ranges during the past year. This 
improvement is widely forecast to continue, 
both generally and in the construction sector. 
Against this background, and with higher order 
intake and continuing success in establishing 
our overseas presence, the Board believes that 
the group will continue to make progress in  
the coming year.

Strategic Report
Building Products’ Divisional Strategy and Business Model
Strategic objectives
To grow shareholder value through the 
development of our premium building 
products activities, each a leading player in 
its individual market niche. These activities 
are mainly focused on managing the scarce 
resources of energy and water in the built 
environment, where we expect growth rates 
to outperform the UK construction sector on 
average through the economic cycle. 
Market outlook
Market commentators are predicting the UK 
construction market will continue to recover 
steadily after a period of significant contraction 
during the post 2008 recession. Alumasc plans 
to leverage this anticipated growth through 
continued introduction of new products, 
investment in high quality management and 
sales resources and the development of  
export sales. 
Divisional strategy
The strategic positioning of our Building 
Products activities has enabled us to 
grow faster than UK construction market 
averages in recent years. 
We are well positioned to continue to 
benefit from the forecast growth in the UK 
construction market over the coming years. 
Our Business Model What We’ve Done
The business model is to drive profitable growth 
within a devolved organisational structure. The 
management team of each group business has 
an in-depth understanding of its market niche, 
customer base and routes to market and is 
therefore able to evolve and adapt rapidly to 
market developments and exploit opportunities 
for growth. Alumasc facilitates this by recruiting, 
retaining, empowering and motivating high 
quality management teams in each  
of our businesses.
We are increasingly identifying and exploiting 
opportunities for organic growth and developing 
synergies between our businesses. Examples 
are the new Alumasc Water Management 
Solutions brand (“ AWMS”) and the planned 
£10 million investment in a new manufacturing 
and warehouse facility for this operation to be 
occupied in 2017.
Harness our key strengths of 
strong market positions, strong 
management teams and well 
respected brands.
Combine our strengths with  
a culture of innovation, service, 
quality and trust.
Deliver market leading and 
differentiated solutions to 
customers, specifiers and end 
users of buildings. 
Leverage our strategic positioning 
to drive revenue growth, strong 
margins, operating cash flows  
and return on investment.
Management teams of each Alumasc business 
are encouraged to take an entrepreneurial, 
dynamic and innovative approach to developing 
their niche market positions. 
Investing to Support 
Profitable Growth
Approach
Operating Models
The operating models of each Alumasc business 
are designed to be flexible to gear revenues 
up or down in line with short term demand 
and to keep a close control of overheads such 
that the businesses benefit from operational 
gearing, whilst outsourcing capital intensive 
manufacturing activities where appropriate. 
In recent years we have invested almost  
£1 million pa, mainly in high quality people  
to drive profitable growth over the medium  
to longer term through innovation, new 
product development and further penetration 
of UK and international markets. The Alumasc Group plc

Measuring Progress
• Divisional revenue growth rates are consistently ahead of UK construction market averages; 
• We are generating rising operating profits, margins and returns on investment; and 
• We continue to invest to support realisation of the future growth potential of the business.
Note: In order to better illustrate underlying trends in the continued successful execution of our strategy, the impact of the abnormally large 
Kitimat export project has been excluded from the data below in the years 2012-2015.
Alumasc aims to continue its recent track 
record of growing revenues faster than the 
UK construction market on average.
Divisional operating profits and margins have 
been growing faster than divisional revenues.
Alumasc has consistently invested in people
and new product development to underpin 
continued growth. 
Divisional return on investment is strong, 
reflecting the growing profitability of the 
division combined with relatively low  
capital intensity.
Both the Construction Products Association 
and Experian are forecasting UK construction 
output to grow over the coming years and 
Alumasc’ s divisional order books are increasing.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s Strategic and Performance Overview
Our strategic positioning and growth initiatives have 
enabled the Building Products division to outperform 
growth rates in the UK construction sector by around 
3% per annum for the last five years.
Strategic overview
Alumasc’s strategic objectives are to continue 
to develop and invest in our market leading 
building products businesses, primarily through 
organic growth but also through selective 
acquisitions. In addition, we will continue  
to grow and develop Dyson Diecastings  
by winning new work and improving 
operational efficiencies.
Over the last year the Board concluded  
its review of where Alumasc’s best 
opportunities lie for focusing and directing 
group resources in building value for 
shareholders. The outcomes were:
1. The decision to focus the group’s strategy 
for future profitable growth on our market 
leading building products businesses;
2. Strategic reviews of each of our businesses 
during the year identified a number of 
exciting opportunities for further organic 
growth and synergy:
• Alumasc Rainwater and the existing 
Harmer and Gatic drainage brands, 
complemented by the introduction  
of new products, were combined on  
1 July 2015 to form one holistic rainwater 
and drainage business, Alumasc Water 
Management Solutions;
• there is increasing evidence in our order 
books of the anticipated recovery of 
Levolux towards mid-cycle revenues and 
operating margins. This will be leveraged 
by the development of balcony products 
and growth in export sales;
• a planned major product range expansion 
at Timloc; and
• further growth potential in our roofing 
and walling businesses, including new 
product introductions and investment 
in additional high quality sales and 
commercial resources; and
3. The decision to sell: 
(a) Alumasc Precision Components (“APC”), 
the group’s loss making engineering 
products business. The sale of APC,  
which was completed on 26 June 2015 
for cash consideration of £5.8 million,  
will be significantly earnings and cash flow 
enhancing for the group in the 2015/16 
financial year; and 
(b) Pendock Profiles, a small non-core building 
products business, sold in September 2014 
for £1.5 million.

The initial results from this more focused 
strategic approach began to be evident in  
the financial year to 30 June 2015 when  
the group’s rate of revenue and profit growth 
from continuing operations accelerated, with 
group revenues ahead by 10% and underlying 
profit before tax increasing by 16%.
The business model and KPIs for Alumasc’s 
building products activities, which in 2014/15 
represented over 90% of group revenues and 
profit from continuing operations, are set out 
on pages 6 and 7. This highlights:
• our strong strategic positioning in sustainable 
building products market niches, particularly 
those connected with the management of 
the scarce resources of energy and water  
in the built environment;
• our continuing investment in people and 
innovation to underpin the delivery of the 
medium to longer term growth potential  
of our business. The related average annual 
incremental cost of this investment absorbed 
within operating profit over the last five 
years is approaching £1 million per annum, 
with an investment of just over £1 million 
planned for the 2015/16 financial year;
• our increasing penetration of higher growth 
markets within the UK such as London and 
the South East where some of our businesses 
were historically under-represented;
• a better balance of end-user markets for our 
building products sales, particularly through 
penetration of refurbishment markets 
(illustrated by the chart on page 11);
• our ability to leverage existing routes  
to market with new products and 
development of e-commerce channels; and
• the continuing expansion of our international  
reach, particularly through Levolux and Gatic.
These strategic initiatives have enabled our 
Building Products division to outperform 
growth rates in the UK construction sector by 
around 3% per annum over the last five years, 
see page 7.
In view of the actions being taken to 
exploit the organic growth and synergistic 
opportunities described above, management 
believes Alumasc can continue to outperform 
forecast UK construction market growth over 
the coming years.
Performance overview
Once again, the Board is pleased to report the 
group’ s highest annual profit from continuing 
operations since 2007/08. Underlying profit 
before tax advanced to £8.4 million compared 
with £7.2 million in 2013/14, an increase of 16%.
This improved performance was driven entirely 
by our building products activities, with every 
operating segment in the building products 
division recording better results than a year ago.
Group revenues from continuing operations 
increased by 10% to £98.1 million (2013/14: 
£88.9 million), driven by a £10.0 million increase 
in Building Products revenues partly offset  
by a £0.8 million reduction in Dyson  
Diecastings’ revenues.
The group’s underlying operating profit 
increased to £9.0 million (2013/14: £7.8 million) 
and operating margins improved to 9.2%, some 
0.5 percentage points above the prior financial 
year, as sales revenue growth allowed better 
leverage of Building Products’ overheads.
Interest costs on borrowings were similar  
to the prior financial year. However, net bank 
financing charges in total were a little higher 
than in the prior year at £0.6 million due to  
the accelerated amortisation of banking fees  
as we completed our routine refinancing of  
the group (discussed in the Financial Review)  
earlier than anticipated.
The resultant group underlying profit before  
tax from continuing operations improved to 
£8.4 million (2013/14: £7.2 million).
Total profit for the year (after discontinued 
operations and tax) improved from £4.0 million 
in 2013/14 to £4.4 million in 2014/15. A 
reconciliation between underlying profit before 
tax and profit for the year is shown on page 14. 
Group cash generation for the year was  
again strong with EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) 
from continuing operations increasing to  
£10.6 million (2013/14: £9.1 million). Following  
the sale of APC just prior to the financial year 
end, the group finished the year in a debt-free 
position. A more detailed review of the group’s 
cash flow performance is provided in the 
Financial Review on page 14.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share from continuing 
operations improved by 19% to 18.4 pence 
compared with 15.4 pence in 2013/14, 
reflecting the higher underlying profit before 
tax combined with a reduction in the group’s 
underlying tax rate from 24% to 22% in line 
with the reduction in UK corporation tax rates. 
The number of shares in issue was unchanged 
in the year.
Basic earnings per share from continuing 
operations increased from 13.4 pence to  
15.0 pence, reflecting improved underlying 
profits and also higher non-cash pension 
scheme financing costs calculated under IAS19.
Basic earnings per share (after discontinued 
operations) improved by 9% from 11.3 pence 
to 12.3 pence. 
Future prospects
The group’s order books at 30 June 2015 were 
£26.5 million, 27% ahead of 30 June 2014. 
Whilst the timing of larger construction 
contracts can impact the outcome in any 
one year, and two large multi-million pound 
contracts (Kitimat and Chiswick Park Building 
7) completed in the second half of 2014/15, 
Alumasc is increasingly well positioned to 
benefit from the current forecast growth in both 
the UK economy and UK construction output. 
Dividends
In view of the improved results for the year 
and the exit from APC, the Board is proposing 
an increased final dividend of 3.5 pence per 
share (2013/14: 2.8 pence), to be paid on 28 
October 2015 to shareholders on the register 
on 2 October 2015. This would give a total 
dividend for the year of 6.0 pence per share 
(2013/14: 5.0 pence), an increase of 20%. The 
Board confirms its previous intention to grow 
the dividend broadly in line with the growth in 
underlying earnings, having regard to the cash 
required to invest in the business to support 
delivery of the group’s growth ambitions and 
its pension scheme funding commitments. The Alumasc Group plc

Health and safety
The group’s number one priority continues 
to be to provide a safe place of work for our 
employees. Further progress has been made 
during the year in ensuring our strong health and 
safety ethos is fully embedded throughout our 
businesses. Our principal health and safety KPI, 
the performance rate index defined on page 18, 
improved to 3.76 from 4.92 in the previous year. 
This reflected a reduction in both the number and 
the severity of incidents, particularly in the higher 
risk engineering businesses. The improvement in 
health and safety performance over the last year 
is consistent with longer term trends resulting 
from prioritisation, focus and the continuous 
improvement actions taken by both management 
and employees over many years. There were 
further successes in identifying near miss incidents 
during the year and we are using this information 
to take action to prevent potential future 
accidents. Our recent initiative of strengthening 
risk assessments, safe systems of work and 
training in those areas of our businesses judged 
to be those capable of causing the most serious 
incidents is now almost complete. 
Review of operations – continuing 
operations
Building Products division
Divisional revenues grew by over 12% to £90.3 
million (2013/14: £80.4 million) and underlying 
operating profit grew 23% to £9.8 million 
from £8.0 million. Divisional operating margins 
improved to 10.8% from 9.9% in the prior 
year, benefiting from revenue growth and  
the impact of operational gearing. 
Profits improved year on year in all operating 
segments in the division.
Solar Shading and Screening
Levolux is a late cycle business, with most  
of its revenues generated from the new build 
commercial market sector, which has only 
recently begun to recover from the recession 
of a few years ago. Against this background, 
Levolux’s revenues for the year remained similar 
to the prior year at £16.0 million.
Despite this, Levolux’s profit nearly doubled 
year on year to £0.9 million as the execution 
of construction contracts was consistently 
well managed across the portfolio, leading to 
a good project margin performance. Results 
also benefited from the successful delivery of 
a multi-million pound solar shading solution 
to the final building at Chiswick Park in West 
London. Overheads were reduced, benefiting 
from the “One Levolux” initiative which 
merged the two former Levolux businesses into 
one, under a common management structure 
with a single set of business processes.
Levolux continues to gain traction in North 
America where it is building a reputation 
not only in solar shading but also in assisting 
architects and building owners to achieve 
innovative design solutions. Repeat business 
is now being secured in the North-East of the 
USA, California, Texas, the area around the 
Great Lakes and in Canada. Additional sales 
resources are being added in 2015/16 to build 
on this positive momentum. North American 
sales are expected to be in excess of 10% of 
Levolux’s revenues in the current financial year. 
We also plan to add dedicated sales resource in 
the Middle East.
Encouragingly, order intake in the 2014/15 
financial year exceeded expectations and was 
some 18% ahead of the prior year. At 30 June 
2015, Levolux’s closing order book was  
£15.6 million, 19% up on a year previously, 
with £2.1 million of that order book expected 
to convert into revenue beyond the current 
financial year. Some of the additional orders 
received relate to a new range of balcony 
products introduced during the year. These 
have attracted an encouraging initial level  
of customer interest.
However, in the absence of any notable  
large project wins that will benefit the current 
2015/16 financial year, we believe that the more 
significant recovery in this business, now being 
evidenced by improving order intake, remains 
some twelve months away.
Roofing and Walling
This was the group’s best performing  
operating segment in the year, with revenues 
increasing by 22% to £32.8 million and 
underlying operating profit growing by 28%  
to £3.8 million. This result was achieved  
despite a significant year on year reduction 
in both revenues and profits from the large 
Kitimat smelter refurbishment project in 
Canada, which was very close to completion  
at 30 June 2015.
Our roofing business has transformed its 
performance over the last three years from 
a loss making operation to one that is now 
strongly profitable. This has been achieved 
through strong sales volume growth, following 
an increase in the number of high calibre 
managers, sales and commercial personnel, 
who have enabled us to introduce new 
products, systems, services and solutions. 
These include the resurgent Euroroof-branded 
portfolio of waterproofing solutions targeted 
at refurbishment markets; the Alumasc BluRoof 
storm water management solution; The 
Alumasc Quality Promise; and the Surefoot 
range of roofing support systems. 
Levolux Helps Suffolk  
Go Green
A bold new ‘Energy from Waste’ facility 
in Great Blakenham, Suffolk is having a 
surprisingly positive impact on the Suffolk 
landscape, thanks to an Aerofoil Fin 
screening solution from Levolux. 
Designed by Grimshaw Architects to 
achieve a BREEAM ‘Excellent’ rating, the 
new facility processes almost 260,000 
tonnes of household and business waste 
each year to generate sufficient electricity 
to power the equivalent of 30,000 homes. 
With an unrivalled track record, Levolux 
was ideally equipped to design an external 
screening solution that would give the 
facility an attractive external aesthetic that 
mimics the formation of clouds passing 
across the Suffolk sky.

Building Products’ divisional revenue 
analysis by end user market
These developments have allowed greater 
penetration of refurbishment as well as new 
build end user markets, with a growing 
presence in the more active markets of London 
and the South East of England. In addition, 
the former Blackdown green roof and Roof-
Pro roofing support businesses are now 
fully integrated as brands within our larger 
roofing business, facilitating a more effective 
systems selling approach across the portfolio, 
generating both revenue and cost synergies.
Our Facades business had a record year, 
benefiting from strong demand in Scotland 
under the HEEPS funding regime, which 
is providing financial support for the 
refurbishment of hard to heat homes mainly 
in the social housing refurbishment sector. 
Action is being taken to develop the presence 
of Alumasc’s Facades business in new build 
and specification markets in order to reduce 
exposure to potentially volatile refurbishment 
demand dependent on government funding, 
particularly against a background of significant 
cuts to the Eco and Green Deal schemes in 
England and Wales. Initial projects involving 
the new Alumasc Ventilated System, developed 
over the last year, have been very encouraging 
and this system should help us to win work in 
the timber frame housing market in the current 
financial year. 
Rainwater, Drainage and  
House Building Products
This segment grew overall revenues by 11%  
to £23.9 million and underlying operating profit 
by 5% to £3.0 million. The level of incremental 
profit drop through from the additional sales 
was impacted by capacity issues in the first 
half of the 2014/15 financial year. These short 
term issues are now resolved, although these 
businesses will require investment in larger 
facilities to support further planned growth  
in the coming years.
Our Rainwater & Drainage business had 
another successful year, driven by strong 
growth in sales from the Harmer drainage 
brand, benefiting from new cast iron and steel 
products added to the range and new sales  
and commercial personnel who have joined  
the business over the last year. Additional 
products are currently being introduced to 
further complement the existing range and  
to allow the business to better access the civil 
drainage market. These include the Harmer 
SML Below Ground and Gatic Filcoten channel 
drainage ranges. Gatic Filcoten is a modern, 
high quality fibre-reinforced composite product, 
which provides a number of benefits relative 
to traditional concrete solutions, including 
improved tensile strength and recyclability.
The combination of the requirements  
of the Flood and Water Management Act 
2010, evolving customer needs and Harmer’s 
widened product range have provided the ideal 
opportunity for Alumasc to offer a more holistic 
approach to providing specifiers and end users 
with integrated solutions. Therefore a new 
umbrella brand, Alumasc Water Management 
Solutions (“AWMS”), was launched on 1 July 
2015 to combine and leverage the strengths of 
the Skyline fascia, soffit and copings; Alumasc 
Rainwater; Harmer building drainage and Gatic 
civil drainage brands, supported by combined 
sales, commercial and technical resources. This 
is an exciting example of the type of organic 
growth and synergistic opportunity identified 
in the Strategic Review during the year. Further 
detail on AWMS is given in the caption to  
the right.
Alumasc Rainwater delivered another year  
of growth, including increased sales of  
pre-painted aluminium gutters, which reduce 
overall life cycle costs to customers, and increased 
penetration of the contemporary and bespoke 
markets for rainwater and related goods.
In view of increasing physical capacity 
constraints, and given the two year transitional 
arrangement we have agreed regarding the 
relocation of AWMS, currently co-located on 
the property sold together with APC in June, 
we are taking the opportunity to invest in a 
new purpose built factory. This will also have 
capacity to incorporate Alumasc Roofing’s 
operations and logistics functions, increasing 
the potential to achieve warehousing and 
logistics synergies. The associated capital 
investment is expected to be around £10 
million over the next two years.

Dyson Diecastings
Dyson Diecastings is a highly respected 
business in its niche, with a reputation 
for excellence in engineering. Following 
a year of transition as we refreshed the 
management team, Dyson is now well 
positioned for profitable growth.
Rainclear, the specialist distributor of Rainwater 
products that was acquired by Alumasc in 
2012, reported a record profit in its first 
full year under new Alumasc management, 
following the planned departure of the former 
owner and founder of the business in 2014. 
Rainclear continues to develop its web-based 
sales, whilst also growing sales through its 
traditional independent merchant base.
Timloc, Alumasc’s house building products 
business, also delivered another record year of 
revenue and profit, benefiting from the further 
introduction of new products into its established 
distribution channels, and through increased 
penetration of markets in London and the South 
East. In view of challenges in the first half of the 
year in managing this growth, caused by physical 
capacity constraints in its existing premises near 
Goole, and with existing property leases due to 
expire in the next two years, it has been decided 
that Timloc also needs new premises to support 
future growth. Therefore, Timloc will relocate 
from two existing sites to a single new leased 
facility, close to the M62 near Goole in 2017. 
This will enable it to consolidate all its operations 
under one roof providing a platform to continue 
its track record of sales growth and improvement  
in operational efficiency.
Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s Review of Operations
Construction Products
Divisional revenues increased by 13% to  
£17.5 million and operating profit by 25%  
to £2.1 million.
Gatic had a strong year both in domestic and 
overseas markets, including a major project at 
Doha port. It is currently completing another 
significant contract at London Gateway, 
following a successful initial project there two 
years ago. After a slow start to the 2014/15 
financial year, Slotdrain sales into the domestic 
market improved markedly in the second half. 
Alongside Alumasc Rainwater & Drainage,  
Gatic will also now benefit from the new 
Alumasc Water Management Solutions brand, 
including the ability to sell the new SML below 
ground and Filcoten products as part of its 
own range and enabling the ProSlot product 
launched last year to be sold through Harmer’s 
established distribution channels.
In the USA, new Gatic drainage products, 
including a grated system, were successfully 
launched in April. The initial market reaction 
has been positive. We are hopeful that 2015/16 
will be the year in which Gatic gains some real 
traction in the USA. 
Scaffold and Construction Products had another 
successful year, growing revenues and profits 
once again. It benefited from new product 
introductions and broadening distribution 
channels.
Dyson Diecastings
The 2014/15 year was one of transition for Dyson 
as a number of key managers retired and 
replacements were recruited. Dyson’ s revenues 
reduced by 9% to £8.1 million, much of this 
reflecting the non-recurring impact of the initial 
stocking of a new product line by a customer 
in the first half of the previous financial year. 
Lower revenue led to a reduction in operating 
profit to £0.7 million from £1.1 million, after 
one-off charges of £0.1 million relating to the 
establishment of the new management team. 
Dyson is a strong business within its niche and 
management expects to be able to improve 
profitability in the current financial year, 
predicated on a combination of:
(a) securing new business including some 
known transfer work; and 
(b) operational efficiencies including better 
production planning, capacity management 
and modest investment in the foundry. 
Review of operations  
– discontinued operations
Discontinued operations comprise APC,  
sold in June 2015; and Pendock Profiles,  
sold in September 2014.
APC
Consistent with group strategy, the APC 
business, including the freehold property from 
which it operates, was sold for gross sales 
proceeds of £5.8 million on 26 June 2015. 
APC’s legacy defined benefit obligations to the 
Alumasc Group Pension Scheme remain within 
the continuing group.
The overall level of pre-tax losses relating to 
APC in 2014/15 was £3.0 million comprising a 
lower level of operating losses, costs of settling 
the customer claims described in our interim 
report, a small loss on sale and the costs of 
selling the business.
Further detail is provided in note 6 to the 
financial statements.
Pendock Profiles
Pendock Profiles made a small trading  
profit prior to its sale in September 2014.  
The gross sales proceeds of the business  
were £1.5 million. The value of net assets  
sold was £0.6 million and after transaction 
costs of £0.1 million, the book gain on sale  
was £0.8 million.

A Strong Performance from 
Alumasc Facades
Alumasc Facades had a record year. 
Together with our roofing business it formed 
part of Alumasc’s strongest performing 
operating segment in 2014/15 and was a 
major contributor to group cash flow. 
Cash flow and net debt
The group’s cash flow performance is 
summarised in the table above. The sale  
of APC on 26 June 2015 allowed the group to 
repay its remaining net indebtedness, thereby 
putting Alumasc in a modest net cash position 
of £0.9 million at the year end.
Cash generation was strong with group EBITDA 
from continuing operations increasing to £10.6 
million (2013/14: £9.1 million), reflecting the 
increased level of operating profit generated 
by building products activities. Tight control 
was maintained over working capital. Average 
trade working capital as a percentage of 
sales (excluding short-term working capital 
movements relating to the large Kitimat 
construction contract as it neared completion) 
increased modestly to 11.9% reflecting some 
inventory build during the year to support 
ongoing growth. The final Kitimat project

Strategic Report
Financial Review
to work completed in the 2014/15 financial year,  
is expected to be received in the 2015/16 
financial year. 
Capital expenditure and capital  
investment plans
Capital expenditure related to continuing 
operations of £1.2 million in the 2014/15 
financial year was broadly in line with the 
prior year level. Following relatively low levels 
of capital spend during the period when the 
group was recovering from the recession of 
a few years ago, demand for capital spend 
across Alumasc is now increasing to support 
the anticipated ongoing growth in the business. 
Capital spend in the current financial year is 
expected to be in the range of £2-3 million 
including tooling for new product development. 
This is prior to the anticipated £3-4 million 
spend as part of the overall £10 million 
investment in the new facility for AWMS and 
Alumasc Roofing to be built near Kettering. The Alumasc Group plc

Capital structure, capital invested  
and shareholders’ funds
The group defines its capital invested as the 
sum of shareholders’ funds, bank debt and  
the pensions deficit (net of tax).
Capital invested remained broadly stable during 
most of the year at just under £40.0 million, 
but reduced to £31.8 million just ahead of the 
30 June 2015 year end following the receipt of 
proceeds from the sale of APC. 
Post tax returns on investment from continuing 
operations grew significantly during the year  
to 19.9%, compared to the 13.4% reported in 
the prior year mainly as a result of the sale of 
APC, which was both a loss making business 
and relatively capital intensive, and also as a 
result of the growth in the operating profits  
of the Building Products division. 
Year end shareholders’ funds decreased from 
£17.0 million at 30 June 2014 to £15.9 million 
at 30 June 2015, as actuarial losses on defined 
benefit pension schemes exceeded the retained 
profit after tax for the year.
Going concern 
The Board’s assessment of going concern  
is set out on page 48.
Re-financing and banking facilities
As described in more detail in note 22 to 
the financial statements, the group has 
recently entered into a five year, £30 million 
revolving credit facility (“RCF”) with its existing 
relationship banks, Barclays and HSBC. This 
facility will be sufficient to allow the group 
to fund its organic growth plans, including 
the property investment near Kettering, 
and potential acquisitions should the right 
opportunities arise at a relevant price.  
The new RCF is structured as an accordion 
facility, whereby £12.5 million is currently 
formally committed and the remainder available 
as needed but subject to final credit approval 
from the banks at the relevant time.  
Taxation
The group’s underlying tax rate reduced from 
24.2% in 2013/14 to 22.0% in 2014/15, 
broadly in line with the UK statutory rate.  
The reduction in the group’s total tax charge  
to £0.4 million (2013/14: £1.1 million) reflected 
the impact of business disposals where gains  
on the sale of assets were shielded by indexation 
allowances and capital losses brought forward.
Pensions
The group’s defined benefit pension deficit 
calculated under IAS19 conventions for 
accounting purposes increased during the year 
to £20.9 million (30 June 2014: £17.9 million). 
This mainly reflects the further reduction during 
the year in AA corporate bond yields which 
are used to discount future pension liabilities 
to present values under IAS19’s methodology. 
Each 10 basis point change in yields impacts the 
present value of the group’s pension liabilities 
(up or down) by £1.7 million. Corporate bond 
yields did begin to rise once again towards the 
end of the financial year.
The base level of pension deficit reduction 
payments agreed with the Pension Trustees, 
following the 2013 triennial actuarial review will 
remain unchanged in the 2015/16 financial year 
at £2.5 million, plus scheme running expenses 
and PPF levy payments of circa £0.5 million. 
However, prior to the results of the forthcoming 
2016 triennial review being concluded, Alumasc 
has agreed to make an additional one-off cash 
payment to the pension schemes at a rate of 
25% of any amount by which group underlying 
profit before tax exceeds £8.4 million in the 
year ending 30 June 2016. 
The group is working on a number of initiatives 
to reduce gross pension liabilities, improve 
pension scheme investment performance at an 
acceptable level of risk, and to reduce pension 
scheme administration costs.
In view of the group’s low current borrowing 
requirements, this structure will give Alumasc 
the flexibility it needs, and avoid significant 
commitment fees being incurred on unutilised 
facilities, some of which might not be needed.
The RCF is unsecured, but is subject to similar 
cross-guarantees between the group and 
subsidiary companies as those contained in 
its predecessor facility. Loan covenants remain 
unchanged: EBITDA interest cover of at least 
4 times and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less 
than 3 times.
In addition to the RCF, the group has recently 
renewed for one year its overdraft facilities of 
£3 million. These are repayable on demand.
Goodwill impairment reviews 
The Board conducted goodwill impairment 
reviews at the financial year end. No 
impairments were identified. Further 
information on the impairment reviews is given 
in the Audit Committee report on page 29 and 
in note 14 to the group financial statements.
Business risk and internal control
A summary of the group’s principal risks and 
mitigating controls is set out on pages 16 to 17.
As evidenced by the results of internal and 
external audits, the group’s internal financial 
controls strengthened further during the year, 
reflecting continuous improvement activities.

Strategic Report
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risks Mitigating actions taken
Loss of key employees
Comment
Generally staff turnover is low.
• Market competitive remuneration and incentive arrangements.
• Changes in numbers of people employed monitored in monthly subsidiary board meetings, 
with staff turnover a KPI in most businesses.
• Key and high potential employees identified and monitored on a local and group basis.
• Focused training and development programmes for key and high potential people.
• Exit interviews held for senior people who leave the business, with learning points shared.
Product/service differentiation relative to 
competition not developed or maintained 
Comment
Innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit is 
encouraged in all group companies.
• Devolved operating model with local management responsible for identifying opportunities 
and emerging niche market trends.
• Group-wide innovation best practice days are held annually.
• Innovation and new product development workshops held regularly in most group companies.
• Annual group strategic planning meetings encourage innovation and “blue sky” thinking,  
with group resources allocated and prioritised as appropriate to support approved ideas.
Economic and market risks 
Comment 
Alumasc is a UK-based group of businesses 
with the majority of group sales made to the 
UK construction sector. 
• Develop and retain strong management teams (see above).
• Ensure Alumasc products are market leading and differentiated against the competition  
to improve specification and to protect margin (see above).
• Develop export sales (particularly in North America, the Middle East and Far East).
• Increasing sales to the more resilient building refurbishment (relative to new build) markets.
• Increasing mix of UK sales towards the stronger London & South East regional markets. 
Risk of loss of customers
Comment 
Generally good track record of customer 
retention.
• Develop and maintain strong relationships through regular contact and seeking always  
to provide superior products, systems, solutions and service.
• Good project tracking and enquiry/quote conversion rate tracking.
• Increasing use of, and investment in, customer relationship management (CRM) software.
International Business Development risk
Comment
International business development plans 
might take longer to succeed than initially 
anticipated or, in some instances, not succeed 
as intended. 
• Group board involvement in export development programme planning and monitoring.
• Monthly agenda item (where relevant) in Operating Company board meetings.
• Employ people with knowledge of both local markets and our products/systems.
• Take appropriate UK and local professional advice.
• Regular monitoring/tracking of progress against plans and forecasts, adapting management  
action accordingly (for example recent widening of the product range in Gatic USA).
Pension obligations
Comment
Alumasc’s pension obligations are material 
relative to its market capitalisation and net 
asset value.
• Continue to grow the business so the relative affordability of pension contributions is 
improved over time.
• Maintain a good, constructive and open relationship with Pension Trustees.
• Meet agreed pension funding commitments.
• Pension scheme management is a regular group board agenda item.
• Use of specialist advisors on both actuarial and investment matters.
• Monitor and seek market opportunities to reduce gross pension liabilities.
Health and safety risks 
Comment 
The group has a strong overall track record of 
health & safety performance, with the number 
of lost time accidents significantly reduced over 
the last 10 years. 
• Health and safety is the number one priority of management and the first agenda item on all 
subsidiary and group board agendas.
• Risk assessments are carried out and safe systems of work documented and communicated.
• All safety incidents and significant near misses reported to board level. Appropriate remedial 
action taken.
• Group health & safety best practice days are held twice a year, chaired by the Chief Executive.
• Annual audit of health and safety in all group businesses by independent consultants.
• Specific focus on improving health and safety in higher risk operations.
• All safety incidents and near misses reported monthly. The Alumasc Group plc

Risks Mitigating actions taken
Product warranty/recall risks
Comment 
The group has a good track record with regard  
to the management of these risks and does not  
have a history of significant claims.
• Robust internal quality systems, compliance with relevant industry standards (eg ISO, BBA etc) 
and close co-operation with customers in their design and specification of the group’s products.
• Group insurance programme to cover larger potential risks and exposures, where available.
• Back to back warranties from suppliers, where appropriate.
• Seek to manage contractual liabilities to ensure potential consequential losses are minimised 
and proportionate, and overall liabilities are capped, where possible.
• Specific local risk management procedures in group brands that install, assemble and supply 
building products (Levolux, Blackdown).
Reliance on key suppliers
Comment 
Whilst the group does not have undue 
concentration on any single or small group of 
suppliers, certain Alumasc businesses do have 
key strategic suppliers, some of whom are 
located in the Far East.
• Annual reviews of supplier concentration as part of strategic planning/formal business risk 
review process, with alternative suppliers sought and developed where practicable.
• Regular visits to key suppliers, good relationships maintained and quality control checks/
training carried out.
• Regular reviews as to whether work should be brought back to the UK (or elsewhere) as 
economic conditions evolve.
Loss of key production facilities/business 
continuity 
Comment
The group has not experienced any significant 
loss of production facilities causing business 
continuity issues. Whilst the likelihood of a 
catastrophic loss is low, the impact if it were  
to happen could be high.
• Business continuity plans prepared at subsidiary level, having regard to specific risk factors.
• Advice is being taken from insurers on continuous improvement of these plans.
• IT disaster recovery plans are in place, with close to real time back up arrangements using 
either off-site servers or cloud technology.
• Critical plant and equipment is identified, with associated breakdown/recovery plans, including 
assessment of engineering spares held on site.
Strategic development and change projects 
Comment 
There are execution risks around a number  
of current strategic change projects, including 
the establishment of the AWMS brand, the 
relocation of AWMS and Timloc to the new 
properties in 2017 and various ERP systems 
implementations.
• Key strategic change projects are governed by Steering Committees sponsored by the  
managing director of the business, with group executive director involvement, supported  
by independent specialist consultants where necessary particularly IT and property.
• Risk reviews conducted and updated regularly.
• Project plans established and monitored monthly.
• Project boards established. The project manager reports to the Steering Committee.
• Use of proven, reliable software solutions and avoidance of bespoking wherever possible.
• Careful documentation and challenge of legacy business processes prior to implementation  
of new systems.
• Pre-implementation testing, training and communication, with go-live delayed  
if implementation risk is judged to be too high.
Credit risk 
Comment 
The group has a generally good record 
in managing credit risks. Risks are higher 
amongst smaller building contractor 
customers, who are often installers of the 
group’s products.
• Most credit risks are insured. 
• Large export contracts are backed by letters of credit, performance bonds, guarantees  
or similar.
• Any risks taken above insured limits in the Building Products division are subject to strict 
delegated authority limit sign offs, including group executives’ sign off for risks above £50k.
• Credit checks when accepting new customers/prior to accepting new work.
• The group employs experienced credit controllers, and aged debt reports are reviewed in 
monthly Board meetings. The Alumasc Group plc

Strategic Report
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Health and Safety
The group’s number one priority continues to be 
to provide a safe place of work for employees, 
and health and safety remains the first agenda 
item for all subsidiary and group board meetings. 
The majority of directors and many senior 
managers within the group have been trained 
to Institution of Occupational Safety and Health 
(IOSH) accreditation standard. The group holds 
regular health and safety best practice days. In 
addition, each group business has local health 
and safety committees that meet regularly and 
each operation is subject to at least an annual 
health and safety audit, with consequential 
action plans being monitored in Board meetings. 
Each operational location is subject to an annual 
Independent Environmental Compliance audit.
Further progress has been made during the year 
in ensuring our strong health and safety ethos is 
fully embedded throughout our businesses. Our 
principal health and safety KPI, the performance 
rate index* improved to 3.76 from 4.92 in the 
previous year. This reflected a reduction in both 
the number and severity of incidents, particularly 
in the higher risk engineering businesses. The 
improvement in health and safety performance 
over the last year is consistent with longer term 
trends, resulting from prioritisation, focus and 
continuous improvement actions taken by both 
management and employees over many years. 
There were further successes in identifying 
near miss incidents during the year and we are 
using this information to take action to prevent 
potential future accidents. Work is now largely 
complete in our recent initiative of strengthening 
risk assessments, safe systems of work and 
training in those areas of our businesses judged 
to be those capable of causing the most  
serious incidents. 
Environment
Many of our building products businesses 
are strongly focused on providing effective 
solutions to enhance sustainability in the built 
environment. The group has established leading 
positions in energy and water management, 
through brands such as Alumasc Water 
Management Solutions, Levolux and Gatic.  
We are committed to complementing this 
leadership by adopting environmentally sound 
business practices throughout our operations. 
Subscription to the BREEAM Points System, as a 
framework for analysis and scoring, allows the 
designer to differentiate between those products 
with true sustainable credentials and those not 
achieving the benchmark. Indicative ratings for 
building materials given in the BRE Green Guide 
to Specification also allows designers to choose 
those products or construction methods that 
will be most beneficial in contributing to a high 
BREEAM points score. Alumasc is able to offer 
a wide variety of A+ rated solutions that allow 
designers and specifiers to achieve the highest 
standards of sustainability and make BREEAM 
‘Excellent’ and ‘Outstanding’ designs  
eminently possible.
Levolux is well-placed to contribute to the Green 
Building Council’s campaigning. Its products are 
fully recyclable and help maintain a naturally cool 
and energy efficient environment. 
Our programme of environmental audits, carried 
out by external consultants, has continued 
through the year. These audits are designed not 
only to highlight areas in which we can improve, 
but also to form a basis for our achieving 
ISO14001 accreditation in a number of our 
businesses. ISO14001 establishes a framework 
Committed to Sustainability
Many of our building products 
businesses are strongly focused 
on providing effective solutions 
to enhance sustainability in the 
built environment. The group has 
established leading positions in energy 
and water management, through 
brands such as Alumasc, Levolux, 
Harmer, Gatic and Blackdown. We  
also work with Carbon Footprint 
Ltd, the carbon and sustainability 
management specialists to help us  
to seek to reduce emissions over time.

of control for an Environmental Management 
System, against which an organisation can be 
certified by a third party. 
The group has an ongoing programme to 
monitor progress against a number of criteria 
against which improvements in environmental 
performance can be measured in operating 
businesses. This programme has delivered 
continuous year-on-year improvements against 
measures from the use of recycled paper to 
energy usage and efficiency. 
As new environmental regulations come into 
force, the group takes active steps to comply.  
We continue to ensure compliance with the 
REACH Regulations on the manufacture and 
import of chemicals in the EU.
All operational sites segregate their process 
waste to allow direct recovery and recycling.  
Our obligations to recover and recycle packaging 
waste are discharged by membership of an 
independent compliance scheme operated  
by Valpak. 
Carbon management
We recognise that improving our energy 
consumption, particularly within our more 
energy-intensive operations in the Engineering 
Products division, is a key way in which we can 
improve both our environmental and financial 
performance. This success has been driven by 
investments in more energy-efficient equipment 
and improvements in management practices. 
Prior to the sale of APC in June 2015, our two 
foundry sites continued the improvements they 
began in 2001, targeting and achieving energy 
savings each year to benefit from rebates on 
their electricity bills under Climate Change  
Levy agreements. 
Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions
The group works with Carbon Footprint Ltd, 
the carbon and sustainability management 
specialists, as part of its commitment to 
continuously improve our environmental  
and sustainability credentials. 
With the sale of Alumasc Precision in June 2015 
the ongoing emissions produced by the group 
will reduce due to the high energy consumption 
integral to APC’s manufacturing process. This 
is illustrated by the analysis of emissions from 
continuing and all operations above.
Sustainability
The wider group is well positioned to benefit 
from environmentally-driven changes in policy 
and regulation. In particular, the growing 
awareness of sustainability and life-cycle cost 
amongst building and construction specifiers 
should assist those group businesses that assist 
their customers to manage energy and water use 
in the built environment.
Community
In addition to the wider community benefits 
arising from our environmental programme, 
the group is committed to supporting local 
community initiatives and a number of charitable 
donations have been made throughout the year 
as described in the Directors’ Report on page 25.
Human Rights
As Alumasc comprises a number of relatively 
small businesses operating from the UK and 
exporting to mainly developed countries, the 
Board does not consider it necessary for the 
group to have a formal human rights policy. 
However, Alumasc has long had a culture of 
seeking to treat people fairly and of being 
honest and straightforward in its business 
relationships. The group’s policies on the related 
topics of equal rights employment policies, 
communication with employees, our business 
ethics policy, our anti-bribery and corruption 
policy and our whistleblowing policy are detailed 
elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their Annual Report and the consolidated financial statements for The Alumasc Group plc for the financial year ended  
30 June 2015.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activities of the group are the design, manufacture and marketing of products for the building and construction industries and the 
manufacture of engineering products and components for a variety of industrial markets. A review of the group’s operations, future prospects  
and Key Performance Indicators are included in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 19.
The following sections are incorporated by reference into the Directors’ Report:
• Strategic Report (pages 1 to 19);
• Board of Directors (pages 20 to 21);
• Statement of Corporate Governance (pages 27 to 28);
• Audit Committee Report (pages 29 to 32); and
• Directors’ Remuneration Report (pages 33 to 40).
In compliance with the business review provisions of the Companies Act 2006, principal risk factors are discussed under the section “Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties” on pages 16 to 17. Key Performance Indicators are set out on pages 1 and 13. Information on potential future developments in 
the group is set out in the “Prospects” sections on pages 5 and 9.
Results and dividends
The group reported underlying profit before tax from continuing operations of £8.4 million (2013/14: £7.2 million) and total profit for the year after 
tax of £4.4 million (2013/14: £4.0 million). The Directors recommend a final dividend of 3.5 pence (2013/14: 2.8 pence) per ordinary share payable 
on 28 October 2015 to members on the register at the close of business on 2 October 2015 which, together with the interim dividend, makes a 
total of 6.0 pence for the year (2013/14: 5.0 pence).
The company operates a Dividend Re-Investment Plan, details of which are available from Capita Registrars.
The right to receive any dividend has been waived by the Trustee of the company’s Employee Benefit Trust over any shares that the Trustees may hold 
from time to time. At the year end, the Trustees’ holding was 485,171 shares (2013/14: 485,171). The shares held in Trust are to meet commitments 
under the company’s performance based executive share plans.
Share capital
The present capital structure of the company is set out in note 26 to the group financial statements.
Purchase of own shares by the company
At last year’s Annual General Meeting, authority was granted to the Directors to purchase, in the market, the company’s own shares, up to the limit 
of 14.9% of the issued share capital. The authority is expressed to run until the company’s next Annual General Meeting at which it will expire. No 
purchases pursuant to this authority have been made during the year. Renewal of this authority will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. The Directors do not propose to exercise the authority unless satisfied that a purchase would be in the best interest of shareholders and 
could be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share.
Directors
The Directors who served during the financial year are listed opposite. The biographies of Directors serving at 30 June 2015 are set out on pages 20 to 21.

 Financial Statements 41 - 93 Information required for shareholders
The following provides additional information for shareholders as a result of the implementation of The Takeovers Directive into UK law.
The details of the company’s share capital structure are given in note 26 to the group financial statements. With the exception of 485,171 ordinary 
shares held in the employee trust being subject to a waiver of the right to a dividend, all shares carry equal rights and no restrictions other than 
those imposed from time to time by laws and regulations and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Significant interests
Director’s interests in the share capital of the company are shown on page 23. Major interests (i.e. those above 3%) of which the company has been 
notified are also shown on page 23.
Change of control
The group’s committed financing facility includes a change of control provision. Under this provision, a change in ownership/control of the company 
would result in withdrawal of these facilities.
There are no other material agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the company following a takeover bid.
There are no additional agreements between the company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office  
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Environmental matters
The Board aims to conduct its business so as to minimise as far as practicable any adverse effects that its operations may have on the environment 
and to find alternative ways of operating where its activities may have an environmental impact. The group requires that each operating business 
achieves minimum standards of environmental efficiency in accordance with group policy.

Health and safety
The Alumasc Group plc places the highest priority on health and safety matters and seeks to achieve high standards for the well-being of its 
employees. There is a clear group policy to this effect. Achieving an embedded health and safety culture and the reduction of accident risk is the

Creditor payment policy
While the company does not follow a specific code of practice, it is the company’s policy to settle the terms and conditions of payment with suppliers 
when agreeing each transaction, to make sure that suppliers are made aware of such terms and, providing the supplier meets its contractual 
obligations, to abide by them. At the year end the company had no trade creditors (2014: none). The group’s average number of creditor days  
as at 30 June 2015 was 70 (2014: 74).
Research and development
The group continues to devote effort and resources to the research and development of new processes and products. Research and development 
expenditure during the year totalled £0.3 million (2013/14: £0.2 million).

Directors’ Report
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the group and the company; 
b) the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with  
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that the group faces; and
c) The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.

26 Statement of Corporate Governance
There is a commitment to high standards of corporate governance throughout the group. The Board endorses the general principles set out in The UK 
Corporate Governance Code September 2012 (“The Code”) (which is available on www.frc.org.uk) and is accountable to the group’s shareholders 
for good governance. This report, together with the information contained in the Audit Committee Report on pages 29 to 32 and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 40 explains how the Directors seek to apply the requirements of The Code to procedures within the group.
Directors
During the year, the Board consisted of a Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and five Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman,  
John McCall, has a significant shareholding detailed in the Directors’ Report on page 23.
Keith Walden, a Non-Executive Director, retired from the Board on the 2 September 2014. David Armfield joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director on 1 October 2014. John Pilkington, a Non-Executive Director, retired from the Board on 3 September 2015.
Three of the Board’s Non-Executive Directors, Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn and Richard Saville, have been members of the Board for more than the 
recommended nine years. In addition, Philip Gwyn has a significant shareholding, detailed in the Directors’ Report on page 23. The Board has 
reviewed the role of each of these Directors and concluded that each is independent in character and free from any relationship that could affect 
exercise of their independent judgement. It is felt that their knowledge and understanding are fundamental to the Board’s deliberations and these 
Directors also have other significant commercial commitments.
Jon Pither is the Senior Independent Director.
No individual or group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision-making. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ interests in the shares of the company are set out on page 23 and they receive a fixed fee for their services.
Profiles of the Board members appear on pages 20 and 21 of this report. These indicate the high level and range of business experience which 
enables the group to be managed effectively. 
The Board meets at least seven times a year and more frequently where business needs require. Two of these meetings are focused upon strategic 
matters. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decision which includes material capital commitments, commencing or settling major 
litigation, business acquisitions and disposals and Board appointments. Directors are given appropriate information for each Board meeting, including 
reports on the current financial and trading position.
Any Director appointed is required to retire and seek election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
Additionally, one-third of the Directors retire by rotation each year and seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The Directors required to 
retire are those in office longest since their previous re-election.
All Directors have access to independent professional advice if required and at the company’s expense. This is in addition to the access that every 
Director has to the Company Secretary. The Secretary is charged by the Board with ensuring that Board procedures are followed.
Statement of compliance
During the year ended 30 June 2015 the group has complied with the requirements of The Code save for the following:
Under Code provision B.2.1 the nominations committee did not comprise of a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
In the period between 1 July 2014 and the appointment of David Armfield on 1 October 2014 the group had only one independent (as defined by 
the Code) Non-Executive Director, John Pilkington. Since 1 October 2014 the company has therefore been compliant with Code provisions B.1.2., 
C.3.1. and D.2.1., having two independent Non-Executive Directors. John Pilkington was classed as independent, however Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn 
and Richard Saville have been in office for longer than the prescribed nine years and are therefore not classed as independent under The Code. 
Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the roles of the Chairman and of the Chief Executive.
The role of the Chairman is to conduct Board meetings and to ensure that all Directors are properly briefed in order to take a full and constructive 
part in Board discussions. He is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Board and of the Executive Management and of the other  
Non-Executive Directors and has active involvement in all key strategic decisions taken by the group. 
The role of the Chief Executive is to oversee the day to day running of the group’s business including the development of business strategies and 
processes to enable the group to meet shareholder requirements. The role involves leading the executive team and evaluating the performance of 
the Executive Management. Together with the Group Finance Director, he is also responsible for dealing with investor and public relations, external 
communications and corporate governance.

Board evaluation
In line with The Code, a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was carried 
out during the year. A briefing paper was prepared by the Chairman and formed the basis of one-to-one discussions between each of the Directors 
and the Chairman and, in the case of the Chairman, between the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director. Issues arising from this process 
were discussed with the Board with recommendations for actions where appropriate. The Senior Independent Director in conjunction with the  
Non-Executive Directors is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chairman.
Board committees
The Board has delegated authority to the following committees and there are written terms of reference for each committee outlining its authority 
and duties. All terms of reference comply with The Code and are available on the company’s website www.alumasc.co.uk.
(i) Audit Committee 
Details of the composition of the Audit Committee and its activities during the year are given in the Audit Committee Report on page 29.

There is regular dialogue with individual institutional shareholders and private shareholders with large holdings, as well as general presentations after 
the announcement of results. The Board receives regular updates on all the meetings and communications with major shareholders, who are offered 
the opportunity to meet with the Non-Executive Directors from time to time. The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that cannot be addressed through regular channels such as The Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance Director.
All shareholders have the opportunity to raise questions at the Annual General Meeting when the company also highlights the latest key business

28 Audit Committee Report
Introduction
The members of the Audit Committee throughout the year were Richard Saville (Chairman), Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn, John Pilkington and David 
Armfield. The Board considers that Richard Saville has relevant, recent financial experience. The Committee meets at least three times per year  
and its main duties are as follows:
(i) monitoring the integrity of and reviewing the financial reporting process and reviewing the financial statements, including the appropriateness 
of judgments and estimates taken in preparing the financial statements
(ii) the appointment of, and the review of the effectiveness and independence of the external auditors
(iii) monitoring the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls and risk management processes, including approval of the scope and review  
of the results of internal audit activities.
The Group Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Financial Controller attended the meetings of the Committee. In addition, 
the external auditors attended two meetings during the year and the members of the Committee met with the external auditors on one occasion 
without members of the management team being present.
Activities of the Committee in the 2014/15 financial year
The main activities of the Committee during the year were:
(i) reviewing the interim and full year results announcements and financial statements, with particular focus on the key estimates and judgments 
taken by management in the preparation of those statements and the external auditor’s comments in those areas;
(ii) review and approval of the audit plan of the external auditor, including the scope of the work, the key areas of focus in terms of audit risk and 
judgment, and the basis on which the auditor assesses materiality;
(iii) considering the effectiveness of the external audit and the independence of the auditors, and recommending the re-appointment of KPMG LLP 
as external auditor;
(iv) review and approval of the plan and scope of internal audit work, including consideration of internal audit reports issued during the year and 
discussion of the key matters and improvement points arising from those audits with management; and
(v) review and update of the Committee’s terms of reference (available at alumasc.co.uk/governance).
Significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements
The committee considered, in conjunction with management and the external auditor, the significant areas of estimation and judgment in preparing 
the financial statements and disclosures, discussed how these were addressed and approved the conclusions of this work. The principal areas of 
focus in this regard were:
(i) Risk of Goodwill Impairment 
The carrying value of acquired goodwill in the cases of Blackdown and Roof-Pro was highlighted in the group’s 2014 Annual Report as being 
at ongoing risk of impairment. Both businesses began to be restructured in the 2013/14 year to improve their performance and reduce cost, 
including sharing external sales and overhead functions with Alumasc’s wider Roofing business. During the 2014/15 financial year both 
Blackdown and Roof-Pro became fully integrated within Alumasc’s Roofing business and, as a result, profits and cash flows are now measured 
and managed at an overall Roofing business level only. Accordingly, testing for impairment of goodwill is now also carried out at the Roofing 
business level, this being the smallest cash generating unit in the organisation that relevant cash flows are measured. As described in the 
Strategic Report, the profitability and cash generation of Alumasc’s Roofing division improved considerably in the 2014/15 financial year and 
consequently no impairment of assets was identified. 
The assumptions used in the various impairment reviews and related sensitivity analyses are detailed in note 14 to the financial statements.

 Financial Statements 41 - 93 Governance 
Audit Committee Report
(ii) Revenue and Profit Recognition on Construction Contracts
 Revenue and profit recognition on construction contracts that span more than one accounting period is an inherently judgmental area, involving 
estimation of the percentage of contract completion, and estimates of costs to complete the work. The larger, more material construction 
contracts carried out during the year were either complete or substantially complete at 30 June 2015, thereby reducing the degree of estimation 
and judgment required at the year end. Accordingly, the Committee was satisfied with the level of revenue and profit recognised on construction 
contracts for the financial year.
(iii) Defined Benefit Pension Schemes’ valuation
 As described in the risk review on page 16, Alumasc has relatively significant legacy defined benefit pension obligations in the context of the 
overall size of the group. Therefore, quite small changes to the market assumptions (particularly the discount rate and inflation rate) used to 
value defined benefit pension obligations under IAS19 can have a material impact on the group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Further details are given in note 24 to the financial statements. Having reviewed the 
valuation assumptions adopted by management, in conjunction with actuarial advice received and the review of those assumptions by the 
external auditors, the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used give rise to an appropriate valuation of the group’s pension obligations 
using IAS19’s valuation methodology.
(iv) Inventory Valuation
 The Committee retains a focus on inventory valuation, partly because these valuations are dependent on the application of up to date 
costing rates and judgments with regard to the level of labour and production overheads absorbed into the valuation. The Committee seeks 
confirmation at each year end that physical quantities of stock have been verified through full inventory counts at each Alumasc manufacturing 
site and, via feedback from management, internal audit and external audit, that appropriate costing rates have been applied. No particular issues 
or exceptions were noted from this work either at the 30 June 2014 or 30 June 2015 year ends. In the past, the judgments and risks surrounding 
the valuation of inventory at Alumasc Precision Components has been a particular area of focus for the Committee. The recent sale of this 
business has reduced the degree of risk in the group balance sheet in this area.
Assessment of the effectiveness of external audit
The Committee assesses the performance of KPMG both through formal Committee meetings, KPMG’s reports to the Committee and in more 
informal interaction throughout the year. The Committee also receives structured feedback from senior group and operational management on the 
robustness, value added and efficiency of the various external audits across the group during the year.
Having considered this information, the Committee concluded that the external audit process continues to operate effectively and that KPMG 
continued to be effective in their role. 
Assessment of the independence of the external auditor
The group’s policy on the independence of auditors is consistent with the ethical standards published by the Auditing Practices Board.
The firm carrying out the group’s external audit was last changed seven years ago, and the Committee assesses the effectiveness and independence 
of the external auditor every year.
Any non-audit services proposed to be carried out by the external auditor are discussed and approved in advance by the Committee. During both  
the financial year under review and the prior financial year, no non-audit services were provided by KPMG. 
In accordance with best practice and professional standards, KPMG rotated the audit partner responsible for the audit two years ago, when the 
original audit partner had served for five years. The current audit partner had not previously been involved in providing any audit or non-audit 
services to Alumasc. 
KPMG have confirmed to the Committee that they consider themselves to be independent within the meaning of regulatory and professional 
requirements. 
In view of all the above, the Committee remains satisfied with the independence of the external auditor.
Re-appointment of the external auditor
Having reviewed the performance and independence of the external auditors during the year, the Committee has recommended to the Board to 
propose to shareholders that KPMG LLP are re-appointed until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2016.

Report and Accounts 2015
30 Effective internal control and risk management
The Alumasc Board as a whole acknowledges that it is responsible for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  
The system is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. However, this risk cannot be wholly eliminated and therefore  
the system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against the risk of material misstatement, fraud or loss.
The group has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the business. The process was in place 
during the year and remained in place on the date that the Annual Report and financial statements were approved by the Board. The main elements 
of the group’s internal control process are as follows:
(i) Risk Management
 Risk management is a continuing activity throughout the year, dealt with through the board meetings of operating companies. In addition,  
a formal business risk review exercise is conducted every year at each operating company and for the group as a whole. This identifies the  
most important risks, their likelihood of occurrence and possible business and financial implications and the effectiveness of mitigating controls.  
A group level summary of these risk reviews is provided on pages 16 and 17. Each operating company has implemented procedures for 
controlling the relevant risks of their business.
 Based on their attendance at the board meetings of each operating subsidiary, the Executive Directors report periodically to the Board on the  
risk management processes that have been in place during the year and the effectiveness of the level of control in managing the identified risks. 
The Board is able to confirm that these procedures are ongoing.
(ii) Financial Reporting and Monitoring
 The Board receives regular financial reports, including monthly management accounts, monthly rolling re-forecasts, annual budgets and five year 
strategic plans. These procedures are intended to ensure that the Board maintains full and effective control over all financial issues. An Executive 
Committee, comprising the group’s Executive Directors and the Divisional Managing Directors of the group’s operating segments reviews trading 
activities and addresses matters of common interest with regard to safety, strategic development, performance, risk and other matters of mutual 
group interest. 
 Day to day management of the group companies is delegated to operational management with a clearly defined system of control, including:
• An organisational structure with an appropriate delegation of authority within each company;
• The identification and appraisal of business and financial risks both formally, within the annual process of preparing business plans and 
budgets and informally through close monitoring of operations;
• A comprehensive financial reporting system within which actual results are compared with approved budgets, quarterly re-forecasts and  
the previous year’s figures on a monthly basis and reviewed at both local and group level; and
• An investment evaluation procedure to ensure an appropriate level of scrutiny and approval for all significant items of capital expenditure.
(iii) Internal Controls Assurance
 The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board has reviewed during the year the effectiveness of the system of internal control from information 
provided by management, the group’s external auditors and the results from internal audits. The Board as a whole assessed the key risks 
affecting the group in the delivery of its long-term strategies, as summarised on pages 16 and 17.
 The Committee was pleased to note further improvements in the group’s internal financial controls during the year as evidenced by the reports 
of internal and external auditors. 
(iv) Internal Audit
 The Committee’s view is that the size and complexity of the group and the close involvement of the Executive Directors make it unnecessary for 
Alumasc to have a dedicated internal audit function, although part of the Group Financial Controller’s role, and that of her team, is to carry out 
internal audits in each of the group’s principal operating locations each year. This position is kept under annual review by the Committee.
 The principal focus of this internal audit work is to check the existence and effective operation of key internal financial controls. 
 The Committee reviews and approves the proposed scope of internal audit activities each year, and ensures that key risk areas are covered, and 
that agreed recommendations arising from previous internal and external audits are re-reviewed to assess whether they have been implemented.

Whistleblowing policy
The group has a whistleblowing policy, which provides a formal mechanism whereby every group employee can, on a confidential basis,  
raise concerns over potential malpractice or impropriety within the group. A copy of the whistleblowing policy can be found on the group  
website www.alumasc.co.uk.
Bribery and corruption policy
The group has in place a policy with regard to compliance with the Bribery Act. The group’s anti-bribery policy and guidelines reflect the Directors’ 
zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption of all kinds.
This policy has been cascaded down into the operating companies and training held at Head Office and subsidiary level. Any matters of particular 
concern whether arising from due diligence or otherwise with regard to related parties as defined in the Act are raised and discussed at monthly 
operating board meetings.
Business ethics policy
The group has in place a business ethics policy, setting out the standards of business conduct that the group expects from its executives and employees. 
This policy is subject to periodic review to ensure it reflects the operation of the group and the business environment in which it operates.
Going concern
The Board is satisfied that the group has adequate resources to continue for the foreseeable future for the reasons given on page 48.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Our remuneration policy was approved at the company’s Annual General Meeting on the 30 October 2014 and is intended to apply for 3 years.
The full policy can be found in the company’s 2014 Remuneration Report and at the Investor Relations section of the website (www.alumasc.co.uk).
This report was prepared by the Remuneration Committee (The Committee) and approved by the Board for the financial year ending 30 June 2015.
The Remuneration Committee members throughout the year were Jon Pither (Chairman), Philip Gwyn, Richard Saville, John Pilkington and David 
Armfield. The Committee meets at least twice a year to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors. It is also responsible for determining  
the fees of the Chairman. The Chairman generally attends meetings of the Committee but takes no part in deliberations relating to his own position. 
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director attend meetings of the Committee as requested but take no part in deliberations relating to their 
own position.
The Executive Directors abstain from any discussion or voting at full Board meetings on Remuneration Committee recommendations where the 
recommendations have a direct bearing on their own remuneration package.
This report is comprised of three sections:
• The Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Annual Statement;
• An overview of the remuneration policy; and
• The Annual Remuneration Report, explaining how our remuneration policy has been implemented during 2014/15.
These sections will be subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the company’s Annual General Meeting on 22 October 2015.
The Remuneration Committee’s overall approach remains unchanged from prior years. We are focused on ensuring the group’s remuneration policy 
is aligned with shareholders’ interests while also enabling us to attract, retain and motivate high quality executive management.
In making remuneration decisions, the Committee considers the group’s overall performance against its long-term goals. For the year to 30 June 
2015, the group has delivered a positive set of results as described in the Strategic Report. Particular highlights include:
• group revenues from continuing operations increased by 10% to £98.1 million;
• underlying profit before tax from continuing operations increased by 16% to £8.4 million; and
• the strategically important divestment of the loss-making Alumasc Precision Components business was concluded in the year.
The Committee met four times during the year – the topics under discussion were:
• approving the remuneration policy;
• approving the rules of the new Executive Share Option Scheme, which became effective on 30 October 2014;
• reviewing the base salaries of the Executive Directors and group employees more generally;
• establishing and reviewing the achievement of the bonus criteria for the Executive Directors;
• recommendations as to the LTIP award in March 2015; and
• recommendations as to the vesting of the LTIP award maturing in March 2016.
As a result, for the year ahead, the remuneration structure remains largely unchanged but will be kept under review. The detail of the Directors’ 
remuneration is contained in the report that follows.

Report and Accounts 2015
33 Strategic Report 01 - 19
 Governance 20 - 40
 Financial Statements 41 - 93 Policy overview
In setting the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the following:
• the need to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior management;
• internal pay and benefits practice and employment conditions within the group as a whole; and 
• periodic external comparisons to examine current market trends and practices and equivalent roles in similar companies.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:
• Base salary 
Base salary for each Executive Director is reviewed annually by the Committee, taking account of the Director’s performance, experience and 
responsibilities. The Committee has regard to salary levels paid by UK listed companies of a similar size and nature. This approach ensures that 
the appropriate benchmark data is used. When determining Executive Directors’ base salaries, the Committee also considers wider economic 
factors, the performance of the group as a whole and the general level of salary increases across the group. 
• Annual bonus 
The Committee’s general policy is that Executive Directors should receive a bonus in relation to the achievement of stretching performance 
targets which reflect how well the group has performed against budget. The Committee wishes to retain the flexibility to set bonus targets 
which reward outperformance against predetermined performance objectives and which reflect the needs of the business.
• Long-term incentives 
The group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) which was approved by shareholders in October 2008. The purpose of the Plan 
is to motivate key individuals to take the company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance. 
Under the Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the achievement of 
performance targets.
• Pension provision 
Pension provision is provided by company contributions into defined contribution schemes and/or as a separate cash allowance. The group has 
two closed defined benefit schemes and there are no plans to reintroduce such schemes.
• Benefits 
The group operates a policy whereby Executive Directors are provided with health insurance, disability insurance and life cover, and are given  
a cash alternative to a company car.
The key principles of the policy are:
• a reward structure that balances short-term and long-term performance; and
• base salaries set at around median level for a group of Alumasc’s size, complexity and industry sectors, but with the potential to earn  
upper-quartile rewards for sustained medium to longer term exceptional performance; and
• competitive incentive arrangements underpinned by a balance of financial measures and linked to corporate performance, ensuring  
a focus on business performance and alignment with the interests of shareholders.
As a result, the Committee has determined that the remuneration of Executive Directors will provide an appropriate balance between fixed  
and performance-related elements. The Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy to ensure it takes due account of best 
remuneration practice and that it remains aligned with the interests of shareholders. 
How shareholders’ views are taken into account 
The committee considers shareholder feedback received at the Annual General Meeting each year. This, plus other feedback received during the 
year, is then considered as part of the group’s annual review of remuneration. At the 2014 Annual General Meeting over 99% of those voting chose 
to vote in favour of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the Committee is grateful to receive this level of support.
How employees’ pay is taken into account
Pay and conditions elsewhere in the group were considered when finalising the current policy for Executive Directors and continues to be considered 
in relation to the implementation of this policy. In order to do so, the committee assesses the wider pay and employment conditions in other parts of 
the group.
How the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy relates to the wider group 
Both executives, and employees below executive level, have their base pay reviewed each year taking into account wage and general inflation, 
affordability to the group/relevant operating company, performance/development of the individual in their role and general market rates for specific 
skills. Employees below executive level have lower proportions of their total remuneration subject to incentive based rewards. Long term incentives 
are reserved for those judged as having the greatest potential to influence the group’s earnings growth and share price performance.

34 Service contracts
The Committee’s policy on service contracts for Executive Directors is that they should provide for termination of employment by either side giving  
12 months’ notice. The group’s policy going forward will be that no Executive Director should be entitled to a notice period or payments in excess  
of their contractual arrangements.
No Executive Director has the benefit of provisions in their service contract for the payment of pre-determined compensation in the event of termination 
of employment.

Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The policy of the Board is that the  
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors should be consistent with the levels of remuneration paid by companies of a similar size and  
complexity. Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee and are reimbursed expenses incurred in performing their duties. They do not  
receive any performance related remuneration or pension contributions. Current fee levels are as follows:

The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have contracts of service but their terms are set out in letters of appointment. 
Bonus
The group’s remuneration policy caps bonuses payable to Executive Directors at 100% of base pay. In practice, bonuses will only exceed 50% of base 
pay in exceptional circumstances (for example completion of major strategic projects). For the year to 30 June 2015 the minimum bonus target was 
to achieve underlying PBT from continuing operations of £7.2 million. On the basis of actual underlying PBT from continuing operations achieved of 
£8.4 million a maximum 50% profit linked bonus was payable. Each of the Executive Directors earned additional exceptional bonuses of £50,000 on 
the successful disposals of the Alumasc Precision Components and Pendock Profiles businesses. Therefore a total bonus payment of £171,000 was 
made to the Chief Executive and £134,000 to the Group Finance Director. 
For 2015/16 the annual bonus for Executive Directors will be determined by growth in group underlying profit before tax relative to targets set at the 
beginning of the financial year.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Each award is dependent partially on an EPS performance condition and partially on total shareholder return (“TSR”), meaning a measure of 
the growth in value of the ordinary shares of the company over the performance period, assuming that all dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional shares. The relative weighting to be attributed to EPS and TSR in a particular award is decided upon by the Remuneration Committee.
2011 LTIP award
No proportion of the 2011 LTIP award vested during the year and the award has now lapsed. 
2012 LTIP award
The performance metrics used for the 2012 LTIP award were stretching to incentivise a significant recovery in the group’s profitability following the 
2011/12 financial year. They comprised an earnings target based on Underlying Profit Before Tax (UPBT), which was used by the Committee as a 
proxy for growth in earnings per share, and a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target.
A minimum UPBT of £7 million was set as the threshold level of performance for the 2014/15 financial year, below which no part of the LTIP award 
would vest. At this level, 25% of the award would vest. An additional 37.5% of the award would vest if UPBT of £9 million was achieved, with pro 
rata vesting between £7 million and £9 million.
With regard to the TSR performance metric, provided the minimum earnings threshold had been achieved, then up to 37.5% of the award would 
vest if Alumasc’s TSR over the performance period was between median and the upper quartile performance when measured relative to the FTSE All 
Share Index. None of the TSR element of the award would vest for a below median performance, rising to 37.5% for upper quartile performance, 
pro rata in between.
The group’s UPBT for the 2014/15 year was £8.4 million. The Committee used its discretion to adjust this figure downwards, principally in respect  
of the trading results of businesses discontinued during the year, in determining that the threshold level of £7 million UPBT had been achieved.  
This resulted in a 25% award in respect of the earnings target. 
In order to align the performance period for the TSR metric with the earnings metric, the Committee amended the original TSR performance period, 
being the three years to 3 September 2015, to the three years to 30 June 2015. During the revised performance period, the group achieved top 
quartile relative TSR performance, but in view of the amendment to the performance period, the Committee reduced the TSR element of the award 
to 25%.
The Committee determined that 50% of the full LTIP award should vest, comprising 25% in respect of the earnings element and 25% in respect  
of the TSR element. Therefore, in March 2016, 87,259 shares will vest in respect of Mr Hooper and 36,538 shares in respect of Mr Magson. 
The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2015
36 2014 LTIP award
In respect of the 2014 LTIP award, granted in March 2015, the Chief Executive was awarded 140,154 shares and the Group Finance Director 64,865 
shares, which equated to 75% and 50% of their base salaries respectively. 
• The threshold level for any of the 2014 LTIP award (granted in March 2015) to vest will be growth in 2013/14 underlying earnings per share 
from continuing operations (15.4 pence) of at least the growth in the retail prices index (“RPI”) plus 2.5% per annum over the three year 
performance period, being the three years to 30 June 2017. At this level 25% of the total LTIP award will vest. Underlying earnings per share is 
calculated prior to the deduction of pension interest and the amortisation of acquired intangible assets. The Committee will apply its discretion 
to adjust, as appropriate, should there be any changes to the group’s structure during the remaining performance period;
• Below this threshold level no LTIP awards will vest; and
• Above the threshold level, half of the remaining 75% of the award will vest based on underlying earnings per share growth above the 
threshold level and half based on relative TSR performance as follows:
(a) maximum vesting of the earnings per share element of the award would require growth in 2013/14 underlying earnings per share from 
continuing operations (15.4 pence) by the growth in RPI plus 10% per annum over the three year performance period. Vesting will be 
straight line between threshold EPS performance and maximum EPS performance.
(b) the TSR element of the award will vest if the group achieves at least median performance, relative to the FTSE All Share Index. Maximum 
vesting of the TSR element of the award would require the group to achieve top quartile performance relative to FTSE All Share Index.  
The TSR element of the award will vest pro-rata between median and upper quartile performance. 
LTIP to be granted in 2015
It is intended that awards will be made in October 2015 to the Chief Executive, to the extent of 75% of base salary, and to the Group Finance 
Director, to the extent of 50% of base salary. The performance measures for these awards over the three year period will be:
• The threshold level for any of the 2015 LTIP award (expected to be granted in October 2015) to vest will be growth in 2014/15 basic earnings 
per share from continuing operations (15.0 pence) of at least the growth in the retail prices index (“RPI”) plus 2.5% per annum over the three 
year performance period, being the three years to 30 June 2018. At this level 25% of the total LTIP award will vest;
• Below this threshold level no LTIP awards will vest; and
• Above the threshold level, two thirds of the remaining 75% of the award will vest based on earnings per share growth above the threshold 
level and one third based on relative TSR performance as follows:
(a) maximum vesting of the earnings per share element of the award would require growth in 2014/15 basic earnings per share from continuing 
operations (15.0 pence) by the growth in RPI plus 10% per annum over the three year performance period. Vesting will be straight line 
between threshold EPS performance and maximum EPS performance.
(b) the TSR element of the award will vest if the group achieves at least median performance, relative to the FTSE All Share Index. Maximum 
vesting of the TSR element of the award would require the group to achieve top quartile performance relative to FTSE All Share Index.  
The TSR element of the award will vest pro-rata between median and upper quartile performance. 
Pension provision
The defined benefit pension schemes are closed and neither Mr Hooper nor Mr Magson have benefits provided under these schemes. The group 
makes provision to pay 20% of Mr Hooper’s base salary and 15% of Mr Magson’s base salary into a defined contribution pension scheme of each 
executive’s choosing or as a cash alternative.

Executive Share Option Scheme
Executives have in the past, been able to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme approved by shareholders in 2004. This scheme is 
designed to encourage the matching of interests between management and shareholders. No awards under the scheme were made to Executive 
Directors during the year. The Chief Executive continues to participate by virtue of an award made in 2006, which may be exercised until 2016 on 
condition that the growth in earnings per share (EPS) exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by 7.5% over the course of a continuous 
three year period.

40 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Alumasc Group Plc for the year ended 30 June 2015 set out on pages 44 to 86. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2015 and  
of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were  
as follows:
Carrying value of goodwill associated with Alumasc’s Roofing business (£3.8m)
Refer to page 29 (Audit Committee Report), page 49 (accounting policy) and page 64 (financial disclosures).
• The risk: As set out in the Audit Committee Report both Roofpro and Blackdown became fully integrated within the existing Alumasc Roofing 
business in the year. Goodwill of £0.6 million and £3.2 million was previously directly attributed to Blackdown and Roofpro respectively 
however, following the integration profits and cash flows are now measured and managed at an overall Roofing business level only. It is 
no longer possible to attribute cash flows to the specific Blackdown and Roofpro divisions and accordingly, goodwill of £3.8 million is now 
attributable to the Roofing business. There is a risk of impairment of the group’s goodwill balance in relation to the Roofing business due to the 
historical trading of the two divisions, which resulted in a partial impairment of goodwill in relation to Blackdown in a previous year. The group 
uses a discounted cash flow model to support the carrying value of goodwill for the Roofing business. Should the forecasts that underpin these 
discounted cash flows not be achieved, this could result in the recoverable amount of goodwill falling below the respective carrying amount. 
The model uses certain key assumptions including revenues, margins, cost base forecasts and the discount rate. Due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting future cash flows, which are the basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the key judgemental areas that 
our audit is focussed on.
• Our response: Our audit procedures included testing the principles and integrity of the group’s forecasts and the discounted cash flow model. 
We critically assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions and methodology used by the group. The assumptions relating to the forecast 
revenue growth and profit margins within the Roofing business were assessed by reference to historical profit margins of the individual divisions 
and our expectations, based on our knowledge of the trading of the Roofing division and external market. The discount rate was assessed 
against those used by other comparable companies and with externally derived market data. We performed sensitivity analysis on the key 
inputs such as projected economic growth, cost inflation and the discount rate. We also assessed whether the group’s disclosures, including 
about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill.
Contract revenue recognition (£17.6m) 
Refer to page 30 (Audit Committee Report), page 53 (accounting policy) and page 54 (financial disclosures)
• The risk: The recognition of profit on long-term contracts is based on the stage of completion of work performed. This is assessed by reference 
to the proportion of contract costs incurred for the work performed at the balance sheet date relative to the estimated total costs of the 
contract at completion. Revenue is recognised with reference to the value of work done. Forecast profit or loss on contracts is a key risk for  
our audit because of the judgement involved in preparing suitable estimates of the forecast costs and revenue on contracts. An error in the 
contract forecast could result in a material variance in the amount of profit or loss recognised to date and therefore also in the current period. 
The forecast profit on contracts includes key judgements over the expected recovery of costs arising from variations and claims. The inclusion  
of these amounts in the contract forecast where they are not recoverable could result in a material error in the level of profit or loss recognised 
by the group.
• Our response: Our audit procedures included selecting those contracts that could have the greatest impact on the group’s financial results 
to assess whether the amounts recognised in the financial statements were in line with the group’s accounting policy, and whether they 
represented a balanced view of the risks and opportunities in respect of the forecast profit to completion. We challenged management’s 
judgement by obtaining and assessing information to support the forecast assumptions, including correspondence with customers regarding 
contract variations and claims. We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting by comparing the historical financial performance of 
completed contracts with the original budgets and forecast margins for those contracts. We evaluated a sample of forecast costs to complete 
for reasonableness by reviewing the basis of their calculation, which included supplier quotes, and considered the performance of those 
contracts and costs incurred post-period end. We also considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures about the degree of judgement 
involved in arriving at the contract revenues.

Refer to page 30 (Audit Committee Report), page 51 (accounting policy) and pages 71 to 73 (financial disclosures)
• The risk: Due to the materiality of the defined benefit pension obligation, small changes in the key assumptions, being the discount rate, 
inflation and mortality rates, can have a significant effect on the group’s results and financial position.
• Our response: In this area our audit procedures included challenging the key assumptions used in the group’s valuation of the defined benefit 
pension obligation, with the support of our own actuarial specialists. This included critically assessing the key assumptions against those used 
by other comparable companies and with externally derived market data. We also considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures of the 
assumptions and the sensitivities of these.
Carrying value of inventory (£10.6m) 
Refer to page 30 (Audit Committee Report), page 50 (accounting policy) and page 66 (financial disclosures)
• The risk: The specialist nature of the group’s inventory means that it can be slow moving and therefore the group’s inventory provision is an 
inherently judgmental area. In addition, changes in production volume and mix, and in the cost base of raw materials, impact the carrying 
amount of work in progress and finished goods as these drive the allocation of labour and production overheads within the inventory valuation. 
Due to the level of judgment involved in determining the labour and production overheads to be absorbed, there is also a risk that the carrying 
value of inventory could be mis-stated.
• Our response: Our procedures included testing the adequacy of the group’s provision against inventory by assessing the assumptions applied by 
the group in providing against aged/obsolete items. We did this by assessing the historical accuracy of the group provisioning policy. As part of 
our attendance at the year-end inventory counts we challenged the inventory provisioning in line with our observations of potentially obsolete 
inventory. We tested a sample of inventory, comparing the carrying value to recent sales invoices to ensure provisions were appropriately applied.  
 
We tested the calculation of labour and production overhead absorption by critically assessing the method of calculation and challenging  
the levels of overhead absorbed compared to actual overhead costs incurred and in comparison to prior year levels.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £400,000, determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit  
before tax, normalised to exclude the loss of £3.0 million on the sale of Alumasc Precision Components as disclosed in note 6, the one-off profit  
of £0.8 million on the sale of Pendock Profiles, as disclosed in note 6 and the net pension cost of £1.2 million, as disclosed in note 24, of £8.2 million,  
of which it represents 4.9%.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £20,000, in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s eleven reporting components we subjected eight to audits for group reporting purposes and three to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures. The latter was not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present a specific 
individual risk that needed to be addressed. The work on all the reporting components was performed by the group audit team.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the group’s results:
   Audits for Specified
   group reporting risk-focused 
   purposes audit procedures Total
Group revenue   94.3% 5.7% 100%
Group profit before tax   76.4% 23.6% 100%
Group assets   95.2% 4.8% 100%
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the key reporting components of the group were all performed to materiality levels set by the 
group audit team. These materiality levels were set individually for each component and ranged from £93,000 to £360,000.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2015
1 Basis of preparation
The Alumasc Group plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s ordinary shares are traded on the  
London Stock Exchange.
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the 
European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the year ended 30 June 2015, and the Companies Act 2006.
The prior year cost of sales have been increased by £1,532,000, with gross margins decreasing correspondingly, to reflect a re-classification of 
costs relating to the management of construction contracts that were previously disclosed within operating expenses. The reclassification has 
arisen due to improved analysis and greater consistency of reporting across the group to better reflect the nature of the underlying costs. Gross 
margin has decreased by a further £1,016,000 due to the results of Alumasc Precision Components and Pendock Profiles being restated as 
discontinued operations as a result of the disposal of those businesses.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 19. The financial position of the group, its cashflows and liquidity position are set out in these financial 
statements. Details of the group’s borrowing facilities are described within note 22.
Following the year end the group signed a new five year £30 million revolving credit banking facility consisting of a £12.5 million committed 
element and a £17.5 million uncommitted accordion element. In addition, the group has recently renewed overdraft facilities totalling  
£3 million for another year. At 30 June 2015 the group’s net cash was £0.9 million (2014: net debt £7.7 million).
On the basis of the group’s financing facilities and current operating and financial plans and sensitivity analyses, the Board is satisfied that the 
group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for the period beginning on or after 1 July 2014 and have been 
adopted for the group financial statements where appropriate with no material impact on the disclosures made by the group:
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011);
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011);
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements; 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements; and
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and each of its subsidiaries made up to 30 June each year. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control in this context means the power to govern the financial and operating policies  
of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All inter-
company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated.

Report and Accounts 2015
48 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Judgements and estimates
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and valuation of goodwill and brands, the measurement and valuation of defined 
benefit pension obligations and the recognition of revenues and profit on construction contracts. 
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection 
of a suitable discount rate. 
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash 
generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate 
(see note 14). 
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in inflation, mortality rates and the selection  
of a suitable discount rate (see note 24).
Revenue recognised on construction contracts is determined by the assessment of the stage of completion of each contract. The requirement 
for Directors’ judgement is limited in most cases due to the involvement of quantity surveyors during the assessment process, as detailed within 
the revenue recognition accounting policy.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
As part of its transition to IFRS, the group elected to re-state only those business combinations that occurred on or after 1 July 2004. In respect 
of acquisitions prior to 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the group’s previous accounting framework, UK GAAP. 
For acquisitions on or after 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. When the excess is negative (negative goodwill), it is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for 
impairment at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The carrying 
amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit,  
or of an operation within it. 
Other intangible assets
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination 
is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured 
reliably. Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the income statement in the year  
in which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after all the following criteria are met:
– the project’s technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated;
– the availability of adequate technical and financial resources and an intention to complete the project have been confirmed; and 
– the correlation between development costs and future revenues has been established.
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives, as follows:
Computer software  – 2 to 5 years
Development expenditure  – up to 10 years
Brands    – 3 to 20 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. In addition, the carrying value of capitalised development expenditure is reviewed for impairment annually and before being 
brought into use.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2015
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to 
making the asset capable of operating as intended. Under IFRS transitional provisions, the group elected to bring in previous valuations of 
freehold and long leasehold land and buildings at a valuation frozen under FRS15, and these amounts are carried forward at deemed cost.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The cost of other property, plant and equipment is written off by equal monthly instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings   – 25 to 50 years
Long leasehold property   –  over the period of the lease to a maximum of 50 years
Short leasehold improvements – over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment   – 3 to 15 years
Motor vehicles    – 4 to 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, each part is accounted for as a separate item. Useful lives 
and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
Impairment of fixed assets
The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business 
segment level or business level as the case may be. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leased assets
Assets held under leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the group are classified as finance 
leases and are capitalised with a corresponding liability being recognised for the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income  
in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals 
payable are charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Financial assets
When financial assets are recognised initially under IAS39, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable 
transaction costs.
The group’s investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. As there is no active market for these investments their fair value 
cannot be reliably measured subsequent to initial recognition, and they are therefore held at cost less impairment.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in first out basis after making due allowance for any obsolete  
or slow moving items. In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate 
proportion of manufacturing overheads. The allocation of manufacturing overheads has regard to normal production.
The group holds certain raw materials from suppliers on an inventory held on consignment basis, which are accounted for as consumed.  
This inventory remains the property of the supplier until used.

Biological assets
Biological assets relate to the value of horticultural inventories at Blackdown greenroofs, which form part of the green roof systems supplied. 
The assets are measured at fair value, being discounted market value less estimated point-of-sale costs, with any change therein recognised  
in the statement of comprehensive income. Point-of-sale costs include all costs that would be necessary to sell the assets. 
Pension costs
The group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes as follows:
(i) Defined benefit pensions
The group operates two principal defined benefit schemes which require deficit reduction contributions to be made to separately administered 
funds. One of the schemes was closed to future benefit accrual in 2009, the other in 2010, with neither closure resulting in a curtailment gain 
or loss. Prior to this, benefits were accrued under the career average revalued earnings (CARE) basis.
Prior to the closure of these schemes to future benefit accrual, the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans was determined 
separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine 
current service cost) and is based on actuarial advice.
The group determines finance income/expense for the period relating to defined benefit pension schemes by applying the discount rate used 
for valuing the schemes’ liabilities to the value of the net pension liability at the beginning of the year.
The net pension scheme finance costs are charged to finance costs within the statement of comprehensive income.
The expense of administering the pension schemes is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. These comprise, for scheme assets, 
the difference between the expected and actual return on assets, and, for scheme liabilities, the difference between the actuarial assumptions 
and actual experience, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the statement of financial position comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds), and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the 
obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid 
price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any 
amount the group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
(ii)  Defined contribution pensions
The pension cost charge to the statement of comprehensive income of the group’s defined contribution schemes represents the contributions 
payable by the group to the funds. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax 
rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
–  where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
–  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
–  deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the year end  
date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised in the consolidated  
income statement.
Own shares
The Alumasc Group plc shares held by the group are classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘own shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being 
taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Equity settled share based payment transactions
The fair value of long term incentive awards and share options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense from the date  
of grant, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.  
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares for which the related service and non-market  
vesting conditions are met.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the 
nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity 
profiles.
The fair value of interest rate cap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. 
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how 
effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such items are expected at inception to be highly effective.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, the hedges used by the group are classified as cash flow hedges, as they hedge exposure to variability  
in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge is initially recognised directly in equity,  
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement at the time when the underlying transaction being hedged affects profit  
or loss, such as when the forecast sale or purchase of the hedged item occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset  
or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction being hedged occurs and are transferred to the income 
statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur,  
the amount is taken to profit or loss.
Information regarding both the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the group’s treasury activities is presented to enable the improved 
evaluation of the group’s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments.

52 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, and is stated net of rebates, and before VAT and other sales 
taxes or duty. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, 
usually on despatch of the goods.
Tooling
Revenue generated on tooling work is recognised when work on the tool has been completed and it has been accepted by the customer.
Construction contracts
Contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments to the 
extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. As soon as the outcome of a construction contract can 
be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in proportion to 
the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion, in most cases, is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. When the outcome of a contract cannot be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss 
on a contract is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when there 
is objective evidence that the group will not be able to recover balances in full. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance 
revenue and finance costs. Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense over the period to the maturity of the underlying instrument.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow  
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Where the group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example 
under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain. The expense relating 
to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. 
New standards and interpretations not applied
The group has considered all new standards and interpretations that are endorsed but not effective at the year end and views that there will  
be no significant impact on the financial statements next year.

4 Segmental analysis – continuing operations 
In accordance with IFRS8 “Operating Segments”, the segmental analysis below follows the group’s internal management reporting structure. 
The Chief Executive reviews internal management reports on a monthly basis, with performance being measured based on segmental operating 
result as disclosed below. Performance is measured on this basis as management believes this information is the most relevant when evaluating 
the impact of strategic decisions.
Inter-segment transactions are entered into applying normal commercial terms that would be available to third parties. Segment results, assets 
and liabilities include those items directly attributable to a segment. Unallocated assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, 
income tax recoverable and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a reportable segment. Unallocated liabilities 
comprise borrowings, employee benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities, income tax payable and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated 
on a reasonable basis to a reportable segment.

The group’s total tax charge in 2014/15 of £446,000 (2013/14: £1,048,000) benefited from the impact of business disposals where capital 
gains on sale of assets were shielded by indexation allowances and capital losses brought forward.

(c) Unrecognised tax losses
Following utilisation of £1 million of capital losses brought forward, the group has agreed tax capital losses in the UK amounting to  
£20 million (2014: £21 million) that relate to prior years. Under current legislation these losses are available for offset against future  
chargeable gains. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses, as they do not meet the criteria for recognition.
Revaluation gains on land and buildings amount to £1 million (2014: £1 million). These have been offset against the capital losses  
detailed above, therefore net capital losses carried forward amount to £19 million (2014: £20 million). The capital losses are able  
to be carried forward indefinitely.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as non-current in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets of £3.8 million (2014:  
£4.0 million) have not been recognised in respect of net capital losses of £19 million (2014: £20 million).
(e) Factors affecting the tax charge in future periods
In the Budget on 8 July 2015, the UK Government announced its intention to further reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% with 
effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. Existing temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided 
may therefore unwind in future periods at these reduced rates. These rate changes were included in the Summer Finance Bill 2015 but this was 
not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated based on the rate of 20% 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit 
attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, after 
allowing for the exercise of outstanding share options. The following sets out the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings

Impairment testing of acquired goodwill
The group considers each of the operating businesses that have goodwill allocated to them, which are those units for which a separate 
cashflow is computed, to be a cash generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. In assessing whether 
an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of 
its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is 
deemed to be its value in use. Each of the CGUs are either operating segments as shown in note 4, or sub-sets of those operating segments.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of CGUs is based on value in use calculations. The value in use is derived from 
discounted management cash flow forecasts for the businesses, based on budgets and strategic plans covering a five year period. 
The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond this period was 1% (2014: 1%) for each CGU.
Key assumptions included in the recoverable amount calculation include:
(i) Revenues
(ii) Gross margins
(iii) Overhead costs
Each assumption has been considered in conjunction with the local management of the relevant operating businesses who have used their  
past experience and expectations of future market and business developments in arriving at the figures used.
The range of pre-tax rates used to discount the cash flows of these cash generating units with on balance sheet goodwill was between 10% 
and 13% (2014: between 10% and 13%). These rates were based on the group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital (W.A.C.C.), 
which was risk-adjusted for the specific circumstances of each CGU. The group’s W.A.C.C. in 2015 was similar to the rate used in 2014. 
The surplus headroom above the carrying value of goodwill at 30 June 2015 was significant in the case of Timloc, Levolux and Rainclear 
Systems, with no impairment arising from either a 2% increase in the discount rate; a growth rate of -1% used to extrapolate the cash flows; 
or a reduction of 25% in the cash flow generated in the terminal year for any CGU. 
The carrying value of acquired goodwill in the cases of Blackdown and Roof-Pro was highlighted in the group’s 2014 annual report as being at 
ongoing risk of impairment. Both businesses began to be restructured in the 2013/14 year to improve their performance and reduce cost, 
including sharing external sales and overhead functions with Alumasc’s wider Roofing business. During the 2014/15 financial year both 
Blackdown and Roof-Pro became fully integrated within Alumasc’s Roofing business and, as a result, profits and cash flows are now measured 
and managed at an overall Roofing business level only. Accordingly, testing for impairment of goodwill is now also carried out at the Roofing 
business level, this being the smallest cash generating unit in the organisation that relevant cash flows are measured. In respect of Alumasc’s 
Roofing business as a whole there is significant headroom above the carrying value of goodwill at 30 June 2015, with no impairment arising 
from either a 2% increase in the discount rate; a growth rate of -1% used to extrapolate the cash flows; or a reduction of 25% in the cash 
flow generated in the terminal year for that CGU.

The bank loan outstanding at 30 June 2015 was part of an unsecured committed £20 million revolving credit facility (“RCF”) drawn  
down against one month LIBOR. The following financial covenants applied to the facility: group interest cover, based on underlying EBITDA  
(i.e. from continuing operations and before non-recurring items), to be at least four times; and net debt as a multiple of underlying EBITDA  
(i.e. from continuing operations and before non-recurring items) to be below three times. Group interest cover was 17.3 times at 30 June 2015 
(2014: 17.2 times) whilst the net debt multiple (net debt plus contingent liabilities) was 0.1 times at 30 June 2015 (2014: 1.0 times). At 30 
June 2015 the group also had £3 million (2014: £3 million) of bank overdraft facilities repayable on demand.
Following the year end the group signed a new five year £30 million RCF, which consists of a £12.5 million committed element and a £17.5 million 
uncommitted accordion element. The group has the option to cancel and repay elements of the committed facility at short notice should it wish  
to do so and the associated financial covenants are the same as those in the previous facility, as detailed above. The facility has a final maturity 
date of 13 August 2020.

Financial risk management 
The group’s treasury activities are carried out in accordance with policies set by the Board. The purpose of treasury policies is to ensure that 
adequate, cost effective funding is available to the group at all times and that exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty 
risks are managed within acceptable levels. The group uses derivative financial instruments as economic hedges to manage foreign exchange 
and interest rate risks. It is the group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments is undertaken. Hedge accounting treatment has been 
applied to all of these hedging activities. All derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Available-for-sale financial assets have been valued at cost. Market values have been used to determine the fair value of bank borrowings.  
The fair value of interest rate cap transactions has been determined by marking those contracts to market against prevailing/forecast future 
interest rates. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market against 
prevailing forward foreign exchange rates.
Trade and other payables balances do not include other taxation and social security costs or construction deposits received on account,  
as these balances do not meet the definition of financial liabilities in IAS39.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities at 30 June 2015 and 2014 based on contractual 
undiscounted payments. The total interest bearing loans and borrowings value in the table below includes future unaccrued interest,

Liquidity risk management
The group manages liquidity risk by monitoring its net debt position regularly and ensuring that committed and uncommitted banking facilities 
are in place to provide adequate headroom for anticipated future cash flows. Details of the facilities are given in note 22. The group’s net cash 
position at 30 June 2015 was £0.9 million (2014: net debt £7.7 million). 
Details of the group’s policies and procedures for managing capital are given within the Financial Review on page 15.
The maturity profile of the group’s interest bearing financial liabilities is as follows:
    2015 2014
    £000 £000
Floating rate interest bearing financial liabilities:  
In less than one year    5,000 –
In two to five years    – 9,890
    5,000 9,890
Interest rate risk management
The group had no net indebtedness at 30 June 2015. It is the group’s policy and intention to hedge against significant upwards movement  
in LIBOR, typically using interest rate Caps or Swaps should the income statement become exposed to material interest rate risk in future.
The group’s marginal pre-tax cost of debt finance at interest rates in place at 30 June 2015 under the banking facilities in existence at that  
time was approximately 3.7% (2014: 3.7%).
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise the revolving credit facility in existence at the balance sheet date that bears interest based on LIBOR. 
Following the sale of Alumasc Precision Components, the impact of a reasonable possible change in interest rates on the group’s profit before 
tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings is not considered material.
Credit risk
The risk of financial loss due to a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations arises principally in relation to transactions where the group 
provides goods and services on deferred terms. There are no concentrations of credit risk which amount to more than 10% of group revenues. 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by its carrying value less amounts recoverable from credit insurance 
contracts, where applicable, as at the balance sheet date and is limited to the value of trade and other receivables. In addition the group may 
from time to time have credit exposures relating to bespoke inventories. The group’s cash deposits are only lodged with approved institutions 
that have strong credit ratings.
Group policies are aimed at minimising credit losses, and require that deferred terms are granted only to customers who demonstrate an 
appropriate payment history and satisfy creditworthiness procedures. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit  
terms to ensure that the group’s exposure to bad debts is minimised. Goods may be sold on a payment with order basis to mitigate credit risk. 
Most group businesses purchase credit insurance and the group increased its overall levels of credit insurance during the prior financial year.
At 30 June, the analysis of trade and other receivables that were past due but not impaired is as follows:

Foreign currency risk
The group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than 
the companies’ operating currency (mainly Pounds Sterling). Transactional currency risks are managed by offsetting as far as possible purchases 
and sales by group companies in the same currency. A proportion of the residual risk is managed, where appropriate, through the use of 
forward currency contracts. 
None of the derivative financial instruments held at 30 June 2015 or 30 June 2014 related to derivative trading activity. Where cash flow hedge 
accounting is applied, gains or losses on the financial instrument hedges are held in equity and only recognised in the consolidated income 
statement when the losses or gains on the hedged transactions are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The following shows the amounts of foreign currency denominated receivables, payables and cash balances at 30 June stated in local currency:

Forward foreign exchange contracts    (247) (68)

At 30 June 2015 the group had forward foreign exchange contracts with principal amounts equivalent to £3,636,000 (2014: £2,599,000).  
The forward foreign exchange contracts hedge foreign currency price risks of various currency purchases and sales across the group. The cash 
flows associated with the forward foreign exchange hedges are generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
At 30 June 2014 the group had two interest rate caps, one with a notional principal amount of £7.5 million and a maturity date of 23 June 
2016, another with a notional principal amount of £5.0 million and a maturity date of 18 May 2015. The unamortised premium of the 
unexpired interest rate cap at 30 June 2015 was written off following the sale of Alumasc Precision Components as the group no longer had 
net indebtedness at that point.
The derivative financial instruments carried at fair value have been valued using directly observable market inputs and therefore they are all 
considered to have been valued at Level 2, as described in the amendments to IFRS7.

70 24 Retirement benefit obligations
(a) The group’s pension schemes
The group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes, funded by the payment of contributions into 
separately administered funds. The defined benefit schemes, which have been closed to future accrual since 2010, provide defined benefits 
based on a career average revalued earnings (CARE) basis.
Defined contribution schemes
Of the amount charged to operating profit in the statement of comprehensive income for pension contributions, £676,000 (2014: £584,000) 
was in respect of defined contribution schemes. At 30 June 2015 there was an accrual of £17,000 payable in respect of defined contribution 
schemes (2014: £21,000).
Defined benefit schemes
The two principal defined benefit schemes are The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme and The Benjamin Priest Group Pension Scheme. The rate 
of contributions to fund the deficits in the schemes is assessed by the schemes’ actuary on a triennial basis. 
The base level of deficit reduction contributions agreed with the Pension Trustees is £2.5 million per annum. For the 2015/16 financial year 
only, the group has agreed to pay £2.5 million plus 25% of the amount (if any) by which the group’s underlying profit before tax exceeds  
£8.4 million.
Disclosures in accordance with IAS19 are set out below in respect of the defined benefit schemes.
Pension charges are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit 
credit method. Under the projected unit method, for closed schemes the amounts allocated to service cost in future periods will tend to be 
higher as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the IAS19 valuations are set out below.

Future pensioners at 65 in 2035 – female  25.6 24.5 24.8 23.9
A discount rate of 3.7% has been used in calculating the present value of liabilities of the pension schemes at 30 June 2015. A 0.1% change 
to this rate would have changed the present value of the pension fund liabilities at that date by approximately £1,735,000 before tax. 
A Retail Price Index inflation rate of 3.3% and a Consumer Price Index inflation rate of 2.3% have been used in calculating the present value  
of liabilities of the pension schemes at 30 June 2015. A 0.1% change to these rates would have changed the present value of the pension 
fund liabilities at that date by approximately £757,000 before tax.
In valuing the liabilities of the pension schemes at 30 June 2015, mortality assumptions have been assumed as indicated above. If life 
expectancy had been changed to assume that all members of the schemes live for one year longer on average, the value of the reported 
liabilities at 30 June 2015 would have increased by approximately £4,233,000 before tax.

For the year ended 30 June 2015
1  Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The accounts are prepared under UK GAAP using the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of the investment in certain 
subsidiaries, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and 
loss account is not presented.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 20 of FRS29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and has not disclosed 
information required by that standard, as the group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the company is included, provide equivalent 
disclosures for the group under IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 19. The financial position of the group, its cashflows and liquidity position are set out in the consolidated 
financial statements. Details of the group’s borrowing facilities are described within note 22 of the group financial statements.
Following the year end the group signed a new five year £30 million revolving credit banking facility consisting of a £12.5 million committed 
element and a £17.5 million uncommitted accordion element. In addition, the group has recently renewed overdraft facilities totalling  
£3 million for another year. At 30 June 2015 the group’s net cash was £0.9 million (2014: net debt £7.7 million).
On the basis of the group’s financing facilities and current financial plans and sensitivity analyses, the Board is satisfied that the group and 
company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets
Freehold land is not depreciated. The cost or valuation of other tangible fixed assets is written off by equal monthly instalments over their 
expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings   – 25 to 50 years
Long leasehold property   –  over the period of the lease to a maximum of 50 years
Plant and equipment   – 3 to 15 years
Valuation of fixed assets
The company elected to adopt the transitional provisions of FRS15 under which previous valuations of freehold and long leasehold land and 
buildings are retained and treated as ‘cost’ for future accounting purposes. The majority of the company’s properties have been acquired as a 
result of the acquisition of related businesses; in these cases, the fair value of the freehold and long leasehold land and buildings at acquisition 
is already treated as ‘cost’ for all purposes.
Leased assets
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals 
payable are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pensions
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which is constituted as a separately administered fund and which is closed to future 
accrual. Deficit reduction contributions are agreed with the pension trustees on the basis of actuarial advice to fund this scheme. The company 
also operates a defined contribution scheme where agreed contractual contributions are paid into a separately administered fund.
In accounting for defined benefit schemes under FRS17, the pension scheme assets are measured using fair values whilst the pension scheme 
liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The company’s share of the 
pension scheme deficit is recognised net of the related deferred tax asset on the face of the balance sheet. The movement on the deficit is split 
between operating and finance charges in the profit and loss account and also in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Prior to  
The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme closure to future accrual in April 2010, the employer’s portion of the current service cost was charged to 
operating profit. The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets is charged or credited to other financing costs.
The actuarial gain or loss is charged directly to equity through the statement of total recognised gains and losses. This arises from the difference 
between the expected return on assets and those actually achieved, and also any changes in the assumptions and experiences used in the valuations.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the plans in the 
accounting period. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments in the balance sheet.  
The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2015
78 1  Accounting policies (continued)
Deferred taxation
Provision is made for deferred taxation in accordance with FRS19.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the 
following exceptions:
– provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal  
of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding 
agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance 
sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the 
replacement assets are sold; and
– deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Own shares
The Alumasc Group plc shares held by the group are classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘own shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being 
taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity 
shares.
Equity settled share based payment transactions
The fair value of long term incentive awards and share options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense at the date of 
grant, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are 
met. Awards granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings are treated as capital contributions within investments.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, or revalued amount, less provisions for impairment where appropriate.
Dividends
Under FRS21, final ordinary dividends payable to shareholders are recognised in the period that they are approved by the shareholders. Interim 
ordinary dividends payable are recognised in the period that they are paid. Dividends receivable are recognised when the company’s right to 
receive payments is established.
Financial assets
When financial assets are recognised initially under FRS26, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable 
transaction costs.

Defined benefit schemes
The company participates in a defined benefit scheme, The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme, which has been closed to future accrual  
since 2010.
The defined benefit scheme maintained by the company is a multi-employer scheme. For the purpose of allocating the total assets and liabilities 
of the scheme between the various group companies, the Directors have used as a basis the existing participating employer or the participating 
employer at the point of the employee leaving employment.
Following the conclusion of the 2013 triennial actuarial review in the 2013/14 financial year, deficit reduction contributions will increase from 
£90,000 to £110,000 per year, with effect from 1 July 2014.

The company has not presented its own profit and loss account in accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006. The loss for the year after tax was £5,421,000 (2014 profit: £3,781,000).
Capital reserve – own shares
The capital reserve – own shares relates to 485,171 (2014: 485,171) ordinary own shares held by the company. The market value of shares at 
30 June 2015 was £802,958 (2014: £565,224). These are held to help satisfy the exercise of awards under the company’s Long Term Incentive 
Plans. A Trust holds the shares in its name and shares are awarded to employees on request by the company. The company bears the expenses 
of the Trust.
Distributable reserves
In connection with the capital reorganisation in 2007, the company reached agreement with the Pension Trustees that £14 million of the  
profit and loss account reserve shown above would be retained as a non-distributable reserve until the group’s pension deficits reduced below 
£14 million (as determined by full actuarial valuations). Therefore the directors consider that £14 million of the company profit and loss account 
reserve remains non-distributable. 
In addition, cumulative actuarial losses relating to defined benefit pension Schemes of £1,100,000 within the profit and loss account reserve are 
non-distributable (2014: losses of £854,000).
15 Share based payments
The company operates two types of share based payment schemes, the main features of each scheme as detailed in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 33 to 40.

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
1. Holders of ordinary shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders 
are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A shareholder 
can appoint the Chairman of the meeting or anyone else to be his/her proxy at the meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder. More than 
one proxy can be appointed in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached 
to a different ordinary share or shares held by that shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, the Proxy Form should be photocopied and 
completed for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be written on the Proxy Form together with the number of shares in relation 
to which the proxy is authorised to act. The box on the Proxy Form must also be ticked to indicate that the proxy instruction is one of multiple 
instructions being given. All Proxy Forms must be signed and, to be effective, must be lodged with the Company’s registrar Capita Asset Services,  
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU so as to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting,  
or in the case of an adjournment 48 hours before the adjourned time.
2. The return of a completed Proxy Form or other such instrument will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting  
and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
3. Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information 
rights (a Nominated Person) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right 
to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy 
appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder  
as to the exercise of voting rights.
4. Only shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the meeting shall be 
entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered in their respective 
names shall determine the number of votes such persons are entitled to cast on a poll at the Annual General Meeting.
5. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 1 does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights 
described in that note can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
6. As at 2 September 2015, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document, the Company’s issued share capital consists 
of 36,133,558 ordinary shares with voting rights. 
7. Copies of the Directors’ service contracts with the Company will be available to members for inspection at the registered office during business 
hours on any week day (public holidays excepted) and will be available at the place of the Annual General Meeting for fifteen minutes prior  
to and during the Annual General Meeting.

The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2015
90 Explanatory notes to Resolutions 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
(1) Resolution 4 – Re-election of Andrew Magson
Your Board recommends that Andrew Magson be re-elected as a Director.
(2) Resolution 5, 6 and 7 – Re-election of Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn and Richard Saville
Your Board recommends that Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn and Richard Saville be re-elected as Directors of the Company. As they have served on the 
Board for longer than nine years, and in order to comply with the best practice provisions of The Code, they offer themselves for re-election. 
The board has concluded that the retiring four Directors are effective, committed to their role, and subject to shareholder approval, 
should continue in office. The biographical details of each Director is set out on pages 20 and 21 of the Annual Report 2015. 
(3) Resolution 9 – Renewal of Directors’ authority to allot shares
By virtue of Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 the Directors require the authority of shareholders of the Company to allot shares or  
other relevant securities of the Company, Resolution 9 authorises the Directors to make allotments of up to an additional 12,044,519 shares 
(being approximately one third of the issued share capital of the Company as at 2 September 2015). This authority will lapse at the conclusion  
of the next Annual General Meeting, unless renewed earlier. The Directors have no present intention to exercise the authority proposed  
to be conferred by Resolution 9.
(4) Resolution 10 – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
By virtue of Section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 any issue by the Company of equity capital for cash made otherwise than to existing 
shareholders on a proportional basis requires the consent of the shareholders of the Company unless the Company has obtained the authority  
of the shareholders under Section 571 of the Act. The purpose of Resolution 10 is to authorise the Directors to allot shares by way of rights  
or pursuant to an open offer or otherwise than strictly pro rata when they consider it expedient to do so and allows them to issue for cash  
up to 1,806,677 shares other than on a pre-emptive basis (representing 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 2 September 2015).
(5) Resolution 11 – Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
The Directors consider it desirable that the Company should have the authority to make market purchases of its own shares. The purpose  
of Resolution 11 is to authorise the Directors generally to purchase up to 5,383,900 ordinary shares in the market (being 14.9% of the issued 
share capital of the Company as at 2 September 2015). The Directors will only exercise the authority granted by Resolution 11 (if passed) if to  
do so would result in an increase in earnings per share and is in the best interests of shareholders generally.

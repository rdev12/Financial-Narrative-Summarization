Notes to the financial statements 
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises all 
direct attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare 
the intangible asset to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management. Directly attributable costs comprise 
employee salary and other employment costs incurred, on a time 
apportioned basis, as well as a proportion of attributable overhead 
costs. These costs are recognized as intangible assets. Development 
costs previously recognized as an expense are not included in the 
amount recognized as an asset. Until completion of the project, 
these assets are subject to impairment testing only. Amortization 
commences upon completion of the asset, and is shown within 
administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. 
3.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its property, plant and equipment and individual intangible assets 
for any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss, if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. Until completion of the 
development project, when amortization can be charged on the 
intangible asset, the assets are subject to an annual impairment test. 
3.6 Loans and receivables 
a) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank 
deposits available on demand, together with other short term highly 
liquid investments. 
b) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and 
are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. 
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of 
impairment is recognized in profit or loss. 
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to 
it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The 
amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between 
the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
3.7 Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective 
interest rate method. 
3.8 Income taxes 
Current income tax liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal 
authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are 
unpaid at the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to 
the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which 
they relate, based on the taxable profit for the year. All changes to 
current tax assets or liabilities are recognized as a component of tax 
expense in the income statement, except where it relates to items 
recognized outside profit or loss. Tax relating to items recognized in 
other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive 
income, and tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is 
recognized directly in equity. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on 
temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements with their respective tax bases. In addition, tax losses 
Bango PLC Annual Report 2013 
available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to 
the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets. 
However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of 
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless 
the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or 
accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated 
with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal 
of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it 
is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In 
addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other 
income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as 
deferred tax assets. 
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax 
assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset 
against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply 
to their respective period of realization, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognized as a component of tax expense in the 
income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to other comprehensive income, when it is recognized in other 
comprehensive income. Deferred tax relating to items recognized 
directly in equity is recognized directly in equity. 
3.9 Operating lease agreements 
Rentals applicable to operating leases where the risks and rewards of 
ownership are not transferred are charged to profit or loss net of any 
incentives received from the lessor on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the lease. 
3.10 Finance lease agreements 
Assets held by the group under leases which transfer to the Group 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at 
an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of 
minimum lease payments. 
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned 
between the financial expense and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the 
lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. 
3.11 Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration 
receivable by Bango for services provided, excluding VAT. 
3.11.1 End user activity 
End user activity arises from the provision of mobile internet content to 
end users facilitated through mobile network operators and other 
payment providers. Some end users make a prepayment to Bango 
prior to accessing chargeable mobile internet content. 
Revenue is recognized as turnover at the time at which end users 
access chargeable mobile internet content. 
Where there has been no activity on an end user account for a period 
of 60 days, the balance remaining is released as turnover, in 
accordance with the end user terms and conditions. 
3.11.2 Judgements on end user activity 
When applying the revenue recognition policy consideration is given to 
whether Bango acts as principal or agent in providing content to the 
end user.  Notes to the financial statements 29 
Notes to the financial statements 
The nature of Bango's business is that it facilitates a large volume 
of transactions in which content developed by a range of digital 
merchants is delivered to end users, payment for which is made 
via a number of potential payment routes. 
The assessment as to whether Bango is principal or agent in the 
supply of content to an end user is highly judgemental and in most 
cases, gives rise to mixed indicators under lAS 18. This is because 
the terms and conditions between the numerous transacting 
parties vary significantly, giving rise to many dissimilar 
configurations of risk and rewards attributable to Bango. 
Risks and rewards typically include, to varying degrees, digital 
merchant rate card price variance; payment provider refund risk; 
end user credit risk; foreign currency exposure and dormant 
balance returns. 
In view of the volume and variety of transactions in question, 
management disclose in the turnover figure a blend of end user 
activity as both agent and principal, depending on the substance 
of the underlying contracts. Where Bango is principal the gross 
value of the transaction is shown , with the associated amounts 
due to digital merchants and payment providers separately 
detailed. Under the agency relationships only the margin is 
reported in the turnover figure, therefore there are no associated 
costs displayed. 
Management do not consider accounting as either principal or 
agent for all transactions faithfully presents Bango's role in these 
transactions. Presentation simply as agent would not adequately 
communicate the exposure to the risks and rewards associated 
with all transactions. Conversely, if Bango presented itself as 
principal, this may overstate the risks and rewards to which Bango 
is exposed. If Bango were entirely principal, revenue would be 
turnover, if Bango were entirely agent, revenue would be the net 
amount. 
3.11.3 Platform fees 
Platform fees includes revenue from the sale of access licences to 
digital merchants and is recognized evenly over the period of the 
contract since the services are provided evenly over this period. 
Platform fees includes revenue from service contracts and is 
recognized in the financial statements over the contract period. 
Platform fees also includes revenue from services provided to 
mobile phone operators and digital merchants and is recognized 
in the financial statements over the period of the contract in 
proportion to the element of the services provided at the balance 
sheet date. 
3.12 End user spend 
In order to assist users of the financial statements there has been 
a change in presentation with end user spend in the year being 
reported. This is reported in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, because end user spend is the key 
performance indicator that management use to monitor 
transactions. The end user spend represents the gross end user 
activity through the Bango system, excluding VAT and is the key 
measurement for transactions processed by Bango in a year. 
3.13 Employee benefits 
All accumulating employee-compensated absences that are 
unused at the balance sheet date are recognized as a liability. 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are 
charged as an expense in the period to which they relate. 
3.14 Share-based payment transactions 
Bango issues equity settled share-based compensation to certain 
employees (including Directors). Equity settled share based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share­
based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in equity, 
based upon the Bango's estimate of the shares that will eventually 
vest. These estimates are subsequently revised if there is any 
indication that the number of options expected to vest differs from 
previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognized in the current period. No adjustment is made to any 
expense recognized in prior periods. 
Fair value is measured by an external valuer using the Black­
Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral 
considerations. No adjustment is made for performance conditions 
as these do not form a condition of the option agreement. 
If the terms of an equity-settled transaction were to be modified, 
as a minimum an expense is recognized as if the terms had not 
been modified. In addition, an expense would be recognized for 
any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the 
modification, as measured by the date of modification , over the 
remaining vesting period. 
Where an equity-settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as if 
it had vested on the due date of the cancellation, and any expense 
not yet recognized for the transaction is recognized immediately. 
However, if a new transaction is substituted for the cancelled 
transaction, and designated as a replacement transaction on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and new transactions are 
treated as if they were a modification of the original transaction, as 
described in the previous paragraph. 
Share-based payment transactions are shown separately in the 
statement of comprehensive income. Additional information is 
provided in note 7. 
3.15 Foreign currencies 
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the rate of exchange preva iIi ng at the date of the 
transaction. Exchange gains and losses are included in the profit 
or loss for the period. 
3.16 Segment reporting 
In identifying Bango operating segments the chief operating 
decision maker reviews two service lines. These are the provision 
of a mobile payment platform allowing end users to purchase 
content, and the provision of services to digital merchants and 
other organisations. The turnover and margin generated from each 
of these segments is separately reported but where costs and 
assets are managed and utilized on a group basis, these are not 
allocated to a segment. 
3.17 Financial instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial 
I ia bi I ities. 
Bango PLC Annual Report 2013   
30 Notes to the financial statements 
Notes to the financial statements 
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments 
(including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt 
instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial 
liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance 
sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating to financial 
liabilities are included in profit or loss. Finance costs are 
calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on the 
outstanding liability. 
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any 
terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is 
classed as an equity instrument. 
Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are 
debited direct to equity. 
Interest income and expenses are reported on an accrual basis 
using the effective interest method. 
3.18 Share capital and reserves 
Share Capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued 
by Bango Pic are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. 
Share premium 
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the 
fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue. 
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve represents the difference between the parent 
company's cost of investment and a subsidiary's share capital and 
share premium where a group reorganisation qualifies as a 
common control transaction. 
Other reserve 
The other reserve represents equity-settled share-based employee 
remuneration recognized over the vesting period. 
Retained earnings 
Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained 
profits. 
3.19 Significant accounting estimates and judgements 
Revenue recognition 
As discussed in policy note 3.11 there are a number of key 
judgements taken by management in determining the most 
appropriate presentation of revenues generated from services to 
end users. Income has been reported gross with the separate 
disclosure of amounts attributable to digital merchants. As set out 
in 3.11.2, due to the variety and complexity of transactions, 
presentation of revenue as simply principal or agent does not 
adequately communicate the role of Bango in the transactions. 
Deferred tax 
A deferred tax asset is recognized where Bango considers it 
probable that a tax credit will be received in the future. This 
specifically applies to tax losses and to outstanding vested share 
options at the balance sheet date. No deferred tax asset is 
currently being recognized due to the unpredictability of future 
taxable trading profits from which these differences may be 
deducted (note 15). 
Bango PLC Annual Report 2013 
Development costs 
Judgement is applied when deciding whether the recognition 
requirements for development costs have been met. Judgements 
are based on the information available at each balance sheet date. 
Economic success of any product development is uncertain at the 
time of recognition as it may be subject to future technical 
problems and therefore impairment reviews are completed by 
project each balance sheet date. The carrying value of capitalized 
development costs is £3,377,872 (2012: £3,277,947). 
No impairment is recognised based on current estimates of future 
revenue streams expected to be derived from the development 
work that has been capitalized. Development costs have been 
derecognised relating to a specific project because no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use beyond 2014. 
3.20 Standards and interpretations not yet applied by the 
Group 
The following new Standards and Interpretations, which are yet to 
become mandatory, have not been applied in the Bango's 
financial statements. 
I FRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective date 
financial year commencing on/after 1 January 2014). 
lAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements (effective date 
financial year commencing on/after 1 January 2014). 
Amendments to lAS 32 offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities (effective date financial year commencing on/after 1 
January 2014). 
Amendments to I FRS 10 transition guide (effective date financial 
year commencing on/after 1 January 2014). 
Amendments to lAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for non­
financial assets (effective date financial year commencing on/after 
1 January 2014). 
All standards and interpretations are not expected to have any 
significant impact on the financial statements when applied. 
3.21 Related party transactions 
Bango's related parties include its directors and key management 
personnel. Unless otherwise stated, none of the transactions 
incorporate special terms and conditions and no guarantees were 
given or received. Outstanding balances are usually settled in 
cash. 
The only transactions with directors are noted in the directors 
remuneration note in the accounts, see note 13. There was 
minimal trading in the year with Psonar Ltd whose board includes 
some of the directors of Bango Pic.  Notes to the financial statements 31 
Notes to the financial statements 
4 Segment reporting 
(a) End user spend 
Bango has identified End user spend a non I FRS alternative performance measure as its key performance indicator on which all management 
decisions surrounding investment in the platform and development of intangible assets is based. Due to the complex contracts in place the 
turnover figure in the accounts is a mixture of gross transaction value where Bango is principal and margin only where Bango is the agent. 
This is to comply with relevant accounting rules, however, the key business decisions are based on the total value and volume of transactions 
that Bango has processed in each month through its payment platform. Therefore, to give additional information to key stakeholders of our 
accounts, we have included this additional reporting in order to assist users of our financial statements.

Bango, based on the information reviewed by to the chief operating decision maker, identifies two operating segments. Management reporting 
is based principally on the type of customer and strategic decisions are made on the basis of the gross profit generated from each segment. 
The segments are not separately managed and therefore Bango's headquarters and its research and development activity are considered 
group operations and are not allocated to any operating segment. Segment information can be analyzed as follows for the reporting periods 
under review.

Included within the end user segment turnover is £6.33m (9 months ended 31 December 2012 £4.02m) relating to a major strategic partner, 
whilst there were two partners who contributed £0.28m (9 months ended 31 December 2012 £0.16m) and £0.81m (9 months ended 31 
December 2012 £0.44m) to platform fees revenue. 
End user activity is the content access fees paid by end users for accessing chargeable content provided by digital merchants, adjusted to 
take account of whether Bango is agent or principal in the transactions. Gross profit for this segment is after both digital merchant and 
payment provider charges. Assets for this segment are amounts due from payment providers. Liabilities for this segment are mainly fees 
payable to payment providers for provision of services and fees payable to digital merchants for provision of content sold by Bango to end 
users. 
Platform fees are the amounts paid to Bango by digital merchants and others for package fees and other services including analytics and 
operator connections. Assets for this segment are amounts due for package fees and other services. Liabilities for this segment represent 
deferred income for package fees. Group assets include non-current assets and cash and cash equivalents. Group liabilities relate to 
administrative expenses. 
(c) Geographical analysis 
Bango's turnover from external customers is divided into the following geographical areas. Non-current assets are based in the UK, except for 
£8,462 of property, plant and equipment held at the New York office.

Amortization is shown within administrative expenses in the income statement. The company regularly reviews its intangible assets to ensure 
that they are not impaired through regular impairment testing in line with I FRS 34. Assets are reviewed in relation to the revenue that will be 
generated from them as a discreet product. They are therefore separately assessed for signs of impairment. 
During the year Bango accelerated amortization and derecognized some older intangible assets that related to specific developments to the 
Bango payment platform for customers that are not expected to contribute to revenue significantly beyond 2014.

Trade and other receivables are usually due within 30-60 days and do not bear any effective interest rate. All trade receivables are subject to 
credit risk exposure. 
Trade receivables from digital merchants consist of numerous accounts with no significant individual balances. Provision for impairment has 
been made where the debt is not considered likely to be recoverable. 
The fair value of these short term financial assets is not individually determined as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair 
value. There is no material difference between fair value and book value.

During the year 627,326 share options were exercised at exercise prices between 29 pence and 202 pence and a par value of 20 pence per 
share. The total proceeds were £477,477 of which £125,465 was recognized as share capital and £352,012 as share premium. 
In February 2013 Bango PLC issued 3,250,000 ordinary shares of 20 pence each at market price of 200 pence per share with existing 
investors raising £6.5m gross and £6.1m net of expenses of £0.4m. 
The Group issues share options to Directors and to employees under either an HM Revenue and Customs approved Enterprise Management 
Incentive (EM I) scheme or an unapproved scheme. Employees resident overseas are eligible to participate in the scheme but their options do 
not qualify as HM Revenue and Customs approved. 
The grant price for share options is equal to the average quoted market price of the company shares on the date of grant. Options vest evenly 
over a period of one to three years following grant date. The options lapse if share options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from 
the date of grant or if the employee leaves the Group. 
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

The weighted average share price at date of exercise of options exercised during the year was 181.14 pence (2012: 182.91 pence). 
The fair value of options granted during the year, determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, were between 54.25- 91.13 pence. 
Significant inputs into the model include a weighted average share price of 186.05 pence (31 December 2012: 181.52 pence) at the grant 
date, the exercise prices, volatility of 52.46-54.87% (31 December 2012: 54.81-55.38%), dividend yield of nil (31 December 2012: nil), an 
expected option life of five years (31 December 2012: five years) and an annual risk-free interest rate of 0.75-1.60% (31 December 2012: 
0.63-0. 78%). 
For the most recent share awards there was sufficient share price data for Bango PLC to calculate the company's volatility, which is based on 
five years historical, compounded daily share price variances.

At 31 December 2013 options over 2,844,996 (31 December 2012: 2,745,361) ordinary shares were outstanding. Given the loss for the year, 
these options are considered to be anti-dilutive. Such options could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the future.

Bango's exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets and cash and cash equivalents recognized at the balance 
sheet date, as summarized in note 18. 
Bango continuously monitors defaults of customers and other counterparties, identified individually or by group, and incorporates this 
information into its credit risk controls. Where available at reasonable cost, external credit ratings and I or reports on customers and other 
counterparties are obtained and used. Bango's policy is to deal only with creditworthy counterparties. 
Bango's management considers that all the financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are of good 
credit quality including those that are past due. See note 6 for further information on trade receivables that are past due. The only other 
financial asset that is not cash are tax credits due from HMRC 
None of Bango's financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements. 
In respect of trade and other receivables, Bango is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group 
of counterparties having similar characteristics. Bango completes regular credit checks on those payment providers accounting for significant 
individual balances. In addition, the terms and conditions of trade with some digital merchants allow the group to withhold payment of the 
relevant part of the digital merchant earnings until payment is received from the payment provider. 
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks 
with high quality external credit ratings.

1 Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of Bango PLC are presented as 
required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and law. 
The principal accounting policies are summarized below. They 
have all been applied consistently throughout the year. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for 
impairment. 
Share based payments 
Bango PLC issues equity settled share-based compensation to 
certain employees (including Directors) of its trading subsidiaries. 
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of 
the equity-settled share-based payment is credited to reserves on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, together with a 
corresponding increase in the book value of Bango PLC's 
investment in subsidiaries, based upon the estimate of the shares 
that will eventually vest. These estimates are subsequently revised 
if there is any indication that the number of options expected to 
vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment 
prior to vesting is recognized in the current period. No adjustment 
is made to any expense recognized in prior periods. 
Fair value is measured by an external valuer using the Black­
Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the 
model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioral considerations. 
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, as 
a minimum an expense is recognized as if the terms had not 
been modified. In addition , an expense is recognized for any 
increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the 
modification, as measured by the date of modification, over the 
remaining vesting period. 
Where an equity-settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as if 
it had vested on the due date of the cancellation, and any 
expense not yet recognized for the transaction is recognized 
immediately. However, if a new transaction is substituted for the 
cancelled transaction, and designated as a replacement 
transaction on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new 
transactions are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original transaction, as described in the previous paragraph. 
Related party transactions 
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard Number 8: 
Related Party Disclosures, the company is exempt from disclosing 
transactions with wholly owned entities that are part of the Group 
headed by Bango PLC as it is a parent company publishing 
consolidated financial statements. 
2 Loss for the year 
Bango PLC has made full use of the exemptions as permitted by 
Section 408(1) of the Companies Act 2006 and accordingly the 
profit and loss account of the entity is not presented as part of the 
accounts. The Bango PLC loss for the year ended 31 December 
2013 of £191,803 (9 month period ended 31 December 2012: 
£134,431) is included in the Group result for the financial period. 
The auditor's remuneration for audit and non-audit services to the 
Company was borne entirely by Bango. net Limited, a wholly 
owned subsidiary. 
3 Directors and employees

PLC are provided in the Directors' report on page 18.

December 2012: £37,301) has been recognized within the parent 
company's own figures relating to wages and salaries.

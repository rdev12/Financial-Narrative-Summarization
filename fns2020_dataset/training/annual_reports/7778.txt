Public Sector Software Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 04
2013 was a disappointing year for Idox, following 
an outstanding 2012. Our core Public Sector 
Software Division (PSS) has continued to 
perform strongly, but our Engineering Information 
Management Division (EIM) failed to complete 
the required number of large scale Enterprise 
software sales in the period, although most of 
these prospects remain to be completed in what 
continues to be a substantial pipeline. Therefore 
profit before tax from continuing operations fell 
by £429,000 on a modest £1.9 million rise in 
continuing Group revenues. 
As a result we have taken a number of positive 
actions including strengthening and deepening 
our senior management team overall where there 
have been a number of significant changes, 
particularly in the EIM division which begins the 
year under new leadership. This includes adding to 
the group management capability by recruiting a 
corporate lawyer. This process will culminate in the 
appointment of a new Group CFO to the Board.
During the year we have also taken the 
opportunity to restructure and simplify Idox by 
disposing of the non-core recruitment division 
TFPL Limited. We have refocused the business 
on our core two divisions; Public Sector Software 
(PSS) and Engineering Information Management 
(EIM). Our Information Solutions business which 
largely supplies the public sector with content 
has been absorbed and integrated into the PSS 
division. This continuing integration process 
together with the termination period of a number 
of UK building leases will afford us considerable 
cost rationalisation opportunities in the current 
financial year. 
We continue to place greater emphasis on 
longer term customer relationships in our PSS 
division and increasingly in EIM as well, through 
managed service and “zero infrastructure” 
client agreements utilising our data centres and 
cloud based solutions. In PSS we have been 
successful in winning a number of notable clients 
from our competition on this basis and we are 
now adopting this model for EIM which has 
already proven successful, with the award of 
long-term extensions to two existing document 
management managed service contracts, worth 
over USD 3 million in total for the first year.
The extension of the business into international 
markets has continued and now includes the 
PSS division where we have won a significant 
portion of the Norwegian government election 
management business. We now have an 
EIM presence in Africa’s fast growing energy 
sector via our acquisition of Artesys, and the 
large Enterprise sale we secured with PSEG 
Nuclear in New Jersey, USA has deepened our 
increasing involvement with the nuclear industry 
in three continents. Despite the disappointments 
in EIM, the division has increased its overall 
significance to the Group accounting for 34% of 
revenues (2012: 32%), with EMEA sales enjoying 
positive momentum. We remain confident that 
opportunities in North America, where the historic 
focus of our business is, as well as across the rest 
of the world, will come through this year and in 
the future as large organisations start committing 
greater amounts of their generally improving cash 
reserves to corporate asset infrastructure renewal 
and development. 
“ …we have taken a 
number of positive actions 
including strengthening 
and deepening our senior 
management team…”
Chairman’s Statement
Strategic Report Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 05
In terms of governance and risk management, 
we took on board that we needed to strengthen 
and deepen our management capability as we 
are now a much larger global organisation than 
we were last year, with our clients operating 
across many industries and across much of the 
developed and developing world. Idox has had a 
long tradition of running a very lean business in 
terms of costs and people and we now recognise 
that we need more depth and capability across 
the Group to manage our newer activities 
around the world and provide more cover and 
support when needed in critical management 
positions. In addition, the complexities of the 
sales process for both software and services in 
large global organisations means we need to be 
more competitive in terms of management skills. 
We have achieved this during the last year by 
external recruitment, internal promotion and some 
departures which will put us in a much stronger 
position for 2014. 
We have also continued to add to the capability 
and independence of our board by recruiting 
Jeremy Millard of Smith Square Partners and 
lately of Rothschild as a financially and technically 
experienced Chartered Accountant and City 
professional in the TMT sector. Jeremy joins 
the board as a non-executive director. Jeremy 
was awarded a first class honours engineering 
degree at Cambridge and honed his operational 
management skills at Mars and the Ministry of 
Defence before moving into corporate finance. 
During the year Christopher Wright stood down 
as our longest serving non-executive director 
having joined the board ahead of Idox’s flotation. 
Christopher‘s international investment banking 
and management background, together with 
his advice on the board has been of great value 
and we wish him well for the future. This board 
development process will continue in the current 
financial year with the further appointment of an 
experienced non-executive director familiar with 
the larger size of organisation to which we aspire.
Notwithstanding the disappointing trading year, 
the board proposes subject to shareholder 
approval a final dividend of 0.4p, resulting in a 
total of 0.7p for the year, a modest 3.7% increase 
over 2012, in line with maintaining our progressive 
dividend policy.
I would like to thank our staff, advisers and 
shareholders for their support in what has been 
a challenging year for the Group. Such difficult 
times require that extra degree of fortitude, but 
the board believes that, following the streamlining 
of the business and operational and management 
changes that have been implemented, the Group 
is now better positioned to build on its underlying 
strengths and high market share in its two chosen 
markets to deliver an improved 2014.

We are disappointed to report a set of results 
for the Group for the year which are below our 
expectations at the start of 2013, although 
they do not truly represent the substantial 
improvements that have been made this year. 
We do believe we have made good progress 
and are laying good foundations to make further 
progress in the years ahead.
We started the year with some challenging, 
and over optimistic goals and objectives, and 
immediately met some head winds that blew 
us off course. Illness, macro-economic and 
market factors, growth pains from the merger 
of several businesses, and the loss of key 
staff all contributed to a slow start to the year. 
The recovery has been challenging alongside 
addressing a number of issues in the business, 
but the strong second half performance attests 
to resolving those issues.
The PSS division started the year slowly but 
gathered momentum throughout the period 
resulting in our most successful year yet in 
market share gains with over 108 new systems 
(2012: 76) won in the year. The challenge in 
2013 which depressed revenues, came from the 
change in mix away from software purchases to 
more managed and hosted solutions. Although 
signed order value was 69% up on the previous 
year, recognisable revenue is only marginally 
up. The division ended the year with over 90% 
market share in its core target markets and with 
encouraging wins in other local government 
departments where we have been asked to assist 
in delivering improved services at lower cost. 
This year has seen the division begin to expand 
into overseas territories, winning its first frame 
work agreement for elections in Norway and 
supplying to 30% of the Norwegian market. 2014 
will see further investment to sow the seeds for 
overseas expansion in 2015. The division has 
continued to improve its operational efficiency 
as well as successfully deliver all its services on 
time, thus building on our goal to be the partner 
of choice for local government.
The EIM division had a challenging year. The 
31% growth in revenues in 2012 which added 
size and complexity to the business, the roll-
out of large contracts, the addition of two 
acquisitions, and the impact of large macro-
economic factors deferring decisions in the 
customer base, caused a few problems which 
it has taken time to respond to. The expected 
growth in Asia and the execution of large 
enterprise deals were delayed due to customer 
nervousness around economic factors and a 
focus to improve return on existing assets, rather 
than to invest in the future. The integration of 
our acquisitions have proven challenging both in 
cultural fit and language issues, but this is close 
to being behind us. We started the year looking 
to strengthen the management team and this 
has taken the whole year to achieve with new 
management in professional services, and the 
appointment of a new divisional CEO. 
In spite of all of this the division still managed to 
introduce new mobile Apps, web-based enquiry 
tools, communication and interoperability 
interfaces between the various systems, 
“ We started the year  
with some challenging,  
and over optimistic goals 
and objectives…”
Chief Executive’s Report
Strategic Report Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 07
internationalisation of the products, Building 
Information Management (BIM) compliance 
for Architectural Engineering and Construction 
(AEC) customers, integrated document and 
facilities management, as well as upgrades 
to the customer interfaces, and to broaden 
the ability of the systems to extend from feed, 
design, deliverables, into operations with the 
acquisition of Artesys. Artesys is also close 
to delivering an upgrade to their solution in 
collaboration with Documentum using their D2 
platform. New contract wins were disappointing 
as they were in line with the previous year’s 
activity levels, excluding last year’s two large 
enterprise sales wins.
McLaren also launched its first BPO service in 
the year and it has subsequently expanded this 
by the year end.
The Information Solutions division was merged 
into the PSS division to streamline the business 
and drive further operating efficiencies. Its 
project work continued to be adversely affected 
by government cut backs and it did not manage 
to increase its managed content service 
revenues. The Dutch business grew market 
share but this was offset by the reduction in  
the Dutch government grant rate. 
Outlook 
The focus for 2014 and beyond is on  
improving organic growth, operational 
improvement and innovation. 
We will continue to concentrate on growing top 
line revenue in both parts of the business which 
is now refocused on our two core activities, and 
look to expand our public sector business into 
new areas both in the UK and overseas. We also 
expect to close a large proportion of the EIM 
pipeline deals, now we have bolstered the senior 
management team and improved the way we 
respond to our customers’ requirements.
Our aim is to continue to grow our non UK 
revenues and to invest to strengthen our domain 
specific expertise in our chosen markets.
We believe the Group is well placed to benefit 
from an improving economic outlook and today 
has the technical capability to deliver unique 
solutions to its customers and future proof their 
investment and commitment in Idox’s solutions. 
Financial Review
Group revenues from continuing operations 
grew by 3% to £57m (2012: £55m) due to 
organic growth in the PSS division and the 
impact of the three acquisitions made during 
2012. The Group maintained the geographical 
split of its revenues with 33% generated outside 
of the UK (2012: 33%). Gross profit earned 
was 4% higher at £52m (2012: £50m) and the 
Group saw an increase in gross margin from 
90% to 91% as a result of an increased mix 
of higher margin software business. Earnings 
before goodwill, amortisation, depreciation, 
restructuring, acquisition and share option 
costs (“Adjusted EBITDA”) decreased by 9% to 
£15m (2012: £16.6m) with EBITDA margins of 
26% (2012: 30%).
Performance by segment
The Group made a significant step forward to 
increase the focus of the business with the sale of 
its recruitment business at the half year. Following 
the disposal, the Group has been reorganised 
into two operating segments; Public Sector 
Software, the merger of the original public sector 
business and Information Solutions divisions, and 
Engineering Information Management.
The PSS division, which accounted for 66% of 
Group revenues (2012: 68%), delivered revenues 
of £38m (2012: £37.6m). Product and services 
revenue grew organically by 10% on the previous 
year. Election revenue remained stable at £2.4m, 
reflecting a real decrease from 2012. It benefited 
from the full year impact of the acquisition of 
Opt2Vote election managed services business in 
March 2012, and the expansion of that business 
into Norway, but this was offset by the absence 
of revenue from fewer local elections in 2013. 
Solutions project income fell by 54% (£0.4m) due 
to a lack of tenders in poor market conditions. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 08
Recurring revenues within the PSS division were 
61% (2012: 62%) excluding election revenue. 
The decrease in recurring revenues is due to the 
wind down of the capital value of the managed 
service contracts acquired in March 2010 for 
the provision of land and property information 
solutions. Renewal rates on grant subscriptions 
performed well in poor market conditions and 
remained consistent with prior years. Divisional 
Adjusted EBITDA fell by 5% to £10.6m (2012: 
£11.3m), delivering a 28% margin, a 2% drop 
on 2012 due to the inclusion of the lower gross 
margin e-learning and solutions training and 
information projects business. 
The EIM division accounted for 34% of Group 
revenues (2012: 32%) and had revenue growth 
of 8% to £19.2m (2012: £17.7m). This growth 
represents a full year of FMx and seven months 
of Artesys acquired on 9 April 2013. Visibility of 
revenue in the EIM business has also increased 
during the year with 51% (2012: 48%) of 
revenues coming from recurring maintenance 
and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) contracts. 
The business is also becoming increasingly 
international within 76% of revenues generated 
outside the UK; 46% USA, 22% Europe and 
Asia, and 8% from Australia.
EBITDA for the EIM business decreased to 
£4.4m (2012: £5.3m), 29% of the Group total. 
The decrease represents the reduction in licence 
deals in comparison to 2012 offset by additional 
contributions from FMx and Artesys plus cost 
synergies. Margins decreased to 23% (2012: 
30%) reflecting the absence of organic growth 
on licence sales and the impact of integration 
costs relating to the acquired businesses. 
Profit before tax
Within the income statement, we present both 
profit before tax and adjusted profit before tax 
which is a performance measure that is not 
defined by GAAP but which the directors believe 
provides a reliable and consistent measure of 
the Group’s underlying financial performance. 
Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted EPS 
excludes amortisation, restructuring, acquisition 
and share option costs. 
Adjusted profit before tax decreased 10% to 
£13.2m (2012: £14.8m). Staff costs increased by 
8% to £28m (2012: £26m). The £2.5m increase 
in staff costs was due to 12 months of the 2012 
acquisitions and 7 months of Artesys. Real 
staff costs fell as a result of cost savings. Other 
administrative expenses increased by 18% to 
£8.9m (2012: £7.5m). 48% of the increase was 
due to a full year of acquisitions and the new 
acquisition in 2013. Travel costs increased due 
to increased revenues in new territories with the 
elections and EIM businesses.
Financing costs reduced from £1.3m to £1.2m 
and includes interest payable of £0.9m (2012: 
£0.9m) and amortisation of the loan facility fees 
of £0.16m (2012: £0.2m). 
Reported profit before tax decreased by 5% to 
£7.5m (2012: £7.9m). Amortisation of intangibles 
increased from £4.6m to £5.3m as a result of 
acquisitions made during the year and a full year 
of 2012 acquisitions. Restructuring charges of 
£0.5m (2012: £0.4m) relate to the integration of 
acquisitions made during the year plus internal 
reorganisations. There was a one off benefit of 
£0.8m included in acquisition costs related to the 
release of earn-out obligations on the Opt2Vote 
acquisition which did not become payable. 
Excluding this £0.8m benefit acquisition costs 
reduced to £0.2m (2012: £1.1m) representing 
£0.64m acquisition costs for Artesys and other 
aborted acquisition fees.
Chief Executive’s Report continued
Strategic Report Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 09
The Group continues to invest in developing 
innovative technology solutions and has 
incurred capitalised Research and Development 
costs of £1.3m (2012: £0.8m). Research and 
development costs expensed in the year were 
£3.8m (2012: £3.2m).
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year 
was -12.75% compared to 3% in 2012. The 
reduction in the effective rate of tax is the result 
of recognition of a deferred tax asset in relation 
to previously unrecognised losses within the 
EIM business and recognition of a deferred tax 
asset in respect of share options. Excluding the 
effect of recognising the deferred tax asset the 
effective tax rate was 13%. Unrelieved trading 
losses of £2,652,000 in the UK remain available 
to offset against future taxable trading profits. 
Unrelieved trading losses arising overseas of 
£3,286,000 have been recognised during the 
year. The board believe the Group will benefit 
from these tax losses in the future.
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share fell 8% to 3.53p 
(2012: 3.83p). Diluted adjusted earnings per 
share fell 7% to 3.38p (2012: 3.63p). 
Basic earnings per share were up 12% to 
2.17p (2012: 1.94p). Diluted earnings per share 
increased by 13% to 2.07p (2012: 1.84p). 
The Board proposes a final dividend of 0.4p, to 
give a full year dividend of 0.7p (2012: 0.675p). 
Subject to approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 
25 April 2014 to shareholders on the register  
at 11 April 2014. 
Balance sheet and cashflows
Idox’s balance sheet continued to strengthen 
during the year and at 31 October 2013 net 
assets were £44.7m compared to £38.9m at 
31 October 2012. 
Cash generated from operating activities before 
tax as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA was 
79%, up from 75% in the previous year. 
The Group ended the year with net debt of 
£19.8m (2012: £21.5m) after making acquisition 
related payments (net of cash acquired) of £1.8m 
and after total dividends of £2.4m. The Group’s 
total signed debt facilities at 31 October 2013 
stood at £30.4m, a combination of a term loan 
and flexible working capital and acquisition 
revolving credit facilities. The working capital 
facility of £8m is due to expire during the next 
12 months, however this is expected to be 
renegotiated with the bank on similar terms; the 
Company have not sought written confirmation 
that the facility will be renewed. The board has 
considered the headroom in the bank facilities 
and are comfortable that unless there was 
a substantial deterioration in trading, Group 
budgets do not indicate any covenant breaches 
on the bank facilities currently in place.
Deferred income, representing invoiced 
maintenance and SaaS contracts yet to be 
recognised in revenue stood at £13.9m at 
31 October 2013 (2012: £13.5m), increasing 
visibility of revenue in the new financial year.

Our business model
To provide specialist document management collaboration solutions and services to the UK  
public sector and highly regulated asset intensive industries around the world and in the wider 
corporate sector.
Our strategy is to become the partner of choice due to our domain expertise, continued innovation, 
quality of service and guaranteed delivery. Through this focus on quality and delivery we expect to 
demonstrate to our customers’ improvements in operational efficiency and return on investment  
which will in return result in us increasing our market share, growing organically and internationally.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Board review the principal risks and uncertainties on a regular basis. The principal risks and 
uncertainties affecting the Group include the following:
Principal risks Management of risks
Economic conditions in markets suppress  
organic growth
Diversification of customers and  
geographical markets
Competitor products deliver increased capabilities Investment in research and development 
Barriers to entry in new markets Strategic partnerships
Loss of skills and knowledge Investment in and consultation of staff
Product failure Robust market research, product testing  
and competitor awareness 
Performance management
Failure to complete sales pipeline Robust process in place to fully qualify orders
The principal risks involved in delivering our strategy are actively managed and monitored against our 
risk appetite.
• Political – the Group has a large customer base in local government. A change in spending 
priorities by the current or a future Government could materially impact the Group. However this 
risk is mitigated due to the contractual nature of the recurring revenue in the Group. The Group has 
increased diversification of its customer base through acquisitions to mitigate against political risks.
• Economic – the software area of the business could be adversely affected if the government 
reduces the grants to local authorities in an economic downturn. However, all indications are that 
the government will maintain and may increase the grants during such a period. The Group has 
increased diversification through acquisitions to mitigate against economic risks.
• Competitors – the Group has certain competitors for its software products. To mitigate this risk, the 
Group continues to invest in and develop its software. Competitor risk is also mitigated through the 
long term nature of customer relationships and recurring software maintenance revenue.
• Acquisitions – the Group could be materially impacted if an acquisition does not perform in line 
with expectations. To mitigate this risk, for each acquisition due diligence and integration planning 
is undertaken and all potential synergies identified.

Health, Safety and Environmental Policies
The Group recognises and accepts its responsibilities for health, safety and the environment (H,S&E) 
and has a dedicated team which provides advice and support in this area. The team members 
regularly attend external H,S&E courses and internal reviews are performed on a regular basis to 
ensure compliance with best practice and all relevant legislation.
Disabled Employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes and abilities of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their 
employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of 
the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled employees should, as  
far as possible be identical with that of other employees. 
Employee Consultation
The Group consults employees through the National Company Council (NCC). The NCC sits  
regularly during the year and is made up of representatives voted on the Council by employees.  
An employee consultation policy is also in place. Employees are encouraged to present their views 
and suggestions in respect of the Group’s performance and policies. In addition, the Group has an 
intranet which facilitates faster and more effective communication.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of investing in 
the Company. The Company purchases matching shares which become the property of the employee 
after a three year vesting period. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 16

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group uses various financial instruments which include cash, equity investments, bank loans 
and items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, exchange 
rate risk and interest rate risk. The Directors review these risks on an ongoing basis. This policy has 
remained unchanged from previous years.
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors. The credit risk associated with 
cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from its trade debtors. 
In order to manage credit risk, the management review the debt ageing on an ongoing basis,  
together with the collection history and third party credit references where appropriate. 
Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Exchange Rate Risk
The Group monitors its exposure to exchange rate risk on an ongoing basis. The Group has  
minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of natural hedges arising between sales  
and cost transactions.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s bank borrowings bear interest at rates linked to the LIBOR. To protect cash flows against 
movements in LIBOR the Group entered into an interest LIBOR swap agreement.
Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash flows for 2013 and 2014 in the context of 
the Group’s banking facilities and covenants, the level of recurring revenue within the business, the 
outlook for our chosen markets, and our current working capital resources, and are satisfied that it is 
appropriate to prepare accounts on a going concern basis. The Group have a working capital facility 
which continues to be made available. There are no events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
The working capital facility of £8m is due to expire during the next 12 months, however this is 
expected to be renegotiated with the bank on similar terms; the Company have not sought written 
confirmation that the facility will be renewed. The board has considered the headroom in the bank 
facilities and are comfortable that unless there was a substantial deterioration in trading, Group 
budgets do not indicate any covenant breaches on the bank facilities currently in place.

Disclosure of Information to Auditor
In so far as each of the Directors is aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of  
any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee operates within defined terms of reference. The Remuneration 
Committee comprises the Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors and normally meets twice a 
year. It was chaired by Christopher Wright until his retirement date of 28 February 2013 and it is now 
chaired by Peter Lilley.
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Group is to set levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors and key staff. The packages are designed to be competitive in value to those offered to 
the Directors of similar sized public companies in related sectors. It is the Board’s policy to align the 
interests of managers with those of our shareholders in the grant of option and other equity rewards 
which underlying securities grantees are very much encouraged to retain over the longer term.
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are currently a basic salary, 
bonus, money purchase pension contributions and benefits in kind. The benefits include car 
allowance, private medical cover, life cover and critical illness cover. The bonus elements are 
dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance criteria set out by the Remuneration 
Committee. The criteria include targets for revenue and profits as well as for cash balances. In 
addition, the Group operates share option schemes for the Executive Directors.

Corporate Governance
As the Group is listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market it is not required to comply 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) issued in 
September 2012. We do not comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. However, we 
have reported on our Corporate Governance 
arrangements by drawing upon best practice 
available, including those aspects of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code we consider to be 
relevant to the company and best practice.
Board of Directors
The Code requires the Group to have an effective 
Board whose role is to develop strategy and 
provide leadership to the Group as a whole, as 
well as ensuring a framework of controls exist 
which allow for the identification, assessment and 
management of risk, ultimately taking collective 
responsibility for the success of the Group.
The Board is responsible for the overall 
strategy and direction of Idox Group plc as well 
as for approving potential acquisitions, major 
capital expenditure items, disposals, annual 
budgets, annual reports, interim statements 
and financing matters. 
The Board considers the appropriateness of 
its accounting policies on an annual basis. The 
Board believes that its accounting policies are 
appropriate in particular in relation to income 
recognition and research and development.
Financial results with comparisons to budget 
and forecast results are reported to the Board 
on a monthly basis together with a commercial 
report on operational issues. Significant 
variances from budget or strategy are 
discussed at Board meetings and actions  
set in place to address them.
The Board met eight times throughout the year 
to discuss a formal schedule of business with all 
Directors in attendance. The Board is supplied 
in a timely manner with information in a form and 
of a suitable quality appropriate to enable it to 
discharge its duties. Advice from independent 
sources is available if required. The Group has a 
highly committed and experienced Board, which 
is supported by a senior management team, with 
the qualification and experience necessary for 
the running of the Group.
Role of Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
The Code requires that there should be a clear 
division of responsibilities between the running of 
the Board and the executive responsible for the 
Group’s business, so as to ensure that no one 
person has unrestricted powers of decision.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership 
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and 
setting its agenda. Once strategic and financial 
objectives have been agreed by the Board, it 
is the Chief Executive Officer’s responsibility to 
ensure they are delivered upon. To facilitate this 
the Chief Executive Officer regularly meets the 
Executive Management Team which additionally 
comprises the other executive Directors and 
senior members of the management team. The 
day to day operations of the Group are managed 
by the Executive Management Team.
Composition of and Appointments  
to the Board
The Code requires that there should be a 
balance of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors and when appointing new Directors  
to the Board there should be a formal, rigorous 
and transparent procedure. 
The Board comprises the Non-Executive 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Chief Financial Officer and three Non-Executive 
Directors. Short biographies of the Directors  
are given on pages 12 to 13.

Governance
Composition of and Appointments  
to the Board continued 
Martin Brooks served as Chairman to the 
Group having previously served as an executive 
director. The Board acknowledge that this 
does not meet the definition of independence 
as defined by the Combined Code, however, 
all Non-Executives at the year end, with the 
exception of Martin Brooks as explained above, 
are considered to be independent.
The Board is satisfied with the balance 
between Executive and Non-Executive Directors.  
The Board considers that its composition is 
appropriate in view of the size and requirements 
of the Group’s business and the need to maintain 
a practical balance between Executive and  
Non-Executive Directors.
Each member of the Board brings different skills 
and experience to the Board and the Board 
Committees. The Board is satisfied that there is 
sufficient diversity in the Board structure to bring 
a balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Group. 
The Code requires that the Board undertake 
a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its committees 
and individual Directors. The Board continue to 
annually review the composition of the Board to 
ensure there is adequate diversity to allow for 
the proper functioning of the board and that the 
board works effectively together as a unit. 
When a new appointment to the Board is 
made, consideration is given to the particular 
skills, knowledge and experience that a 
potential new member could add to the 
existing Board composition. A formal process 
is then undertaken, which may involve external 
recruitment agencies, with appropriate 
consideration being given, in regards to Executive 
appointments, to internal and external candidates. 
Before undertaking the appointment of a Non-
Executive Director, the Chairman establishes that 
the prospective Director can give the time and 
commitment necessary to fulfil their duties, in 
terms of availability both to prepare for and attend 
meetings and to discuss matters at other times.
Board Committees
The Board has established two committees 
to deal with specific aspects of the Board’s 
responsibilities: Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. The Report of the Audit Committee 
can be found on page 26. The Audit Committee 
is chaired by Peter Lilley and included Wendy 
Hall, Christopher Wright until 28 February 2013 
and Jeremy Millard from 13 June 2013. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by 
Peter Lilley and includes Wendy Hall and Jeremy 
Millard. This Committee has responsibility for 
making recommendations to the Board of 
the remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors which includes:
• making recommendations to the Board  
on any changes to service contracts;
• approving and overseeing any share 
related incentive schemes within the Group;
• ensuring that remuneration is in line with 
current industry practice; and
• ensuring remuneration is both appropriate  
to the level of responsibility and adequate  
to attract and/or retain Directors and staff  
of the calibre required by the Group.
The Audit Committee met three times in the year 
and the Remuneration Committee met twice.
The Board has also established a Nominations 
Committee which is chaired by Peter Lilley and 
includes Wendy Hall and Jeremy Millard.
Re-election
Under the Code, Directors should offer themselves 
for re-election at regular intervals and, under 
the Company’s Articles of Association, at every 
Annual General Meeting at least one third of the 
Directors who are subject to retirement by rotation 
are required to retire and may be proposed for re-
election. New Directors, who were not appointed at 
the previous AGM, automatically retire at their first 
AGM and if eligible, can seek re-appointment.
Three Directors will retire from office at the 
Company’s forthcoming AGM and stand for 
re-appointment.

Internal Control
The Board takes responsibility for establishing 
and maintaining reliable systems of control in all 
areas of operation. These systems of control, 
especially of financial control, can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system of internal 
control are set out below:
• Idox plc has established an operational 
management structure with clearly  
defined responsibilities and regular 
performance reviews;
• the Group operates a comprehensive system 
for reporting financial and non-financial 
information to the Board including preparation 
and review of strategy plans and the 
preparation and review of annual budgets;
•  financial results are monitored against 
budgets, forecasts and other performance 
indicators with action dictated accordingly  
at each meeting;
•  a structured approval process based on 
assessment of risk and value delivered; and
•  sufficient resource is focused to maintain  
and develop internal control procedures  
and information systems, especially in 
financial management.
The Board considers that there have been no 
substantial weaknesses in internal financial 
controls that have resulted in any material losses, 
contingencies or uncertainties which need to be 
disclosed in the accounts.
The Group supports an internal audit function 
that performs annual audits on its management 
systems. This function is supported by a 
management review of the audit findings. 
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group, and 
that this process has been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and Accounts. This process is 
regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have to prepare the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). The 
Directors have elected to prepare the company 
financial statements under UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”). 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and parent company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group and parent 
company for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs and UK 
accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the  
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the company will continue  
in business. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 24
Governance
Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities continued 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Group’s transactions, 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that 
the Directors’ Report and other information 
included in the Annual Report is prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom company law. 
They are also responsible for ensuring that the 
Annual Report includes information required by 
the AIM Market Rules. 
The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s 
web site is the responsibility of the Directors; 
the work carried out by the auditors does not 
involve consideration of these matters and, 
accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility 
for any changes that may have occurred to the 
information contained in the accounts since they 
were initially presented on the web site. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and the dissemination of the 
accounts and other information included in 
annual reports may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions. 
Information and Development
The Code requires that the Board should be 
supplied in a timely manner with information in a 
form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to 
discharge its duties.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that 
all the Directors continually update their skills, 
their knowledge and familiarity with the Group 
in order to fulfil their role on the Board and the 
Board’s Committees. Updates dealing with 
changes in legislation and regulation relevant to 
the Group’s business are provided to the Board 
by external advisors, the Chief Financial Officer 
and Company Secretary.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, who is 
responsible to the Board for ensuring the Board 
procedures are properly complied with and that 
the discussions and decisions are appropriately 
minuted. Directors may seek independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense in 
furtherance of their duties as Directors.
Training in matters relevant to their role on the 
Board is available to all Board Directors. New 
Directors are provided with an induction in 
order to introduce them to the operations and 
management of the business.
Shareholder Relations
Idox plc is committed to open communication 
with all its shareholders. The Directors hold 
regular meetings with institutional shareholders 
to discuss and review the Group’s activities 
and objectives. Communication with private 
shareholders is principally through the Annual 
General Meeting, where participation is 
encouraged and where the Board is available to 
answer questions. Idox plc maintains up-to-date 
information on the Investor Relations section of 
its website www.idoxplc.com.
Every shareholder has access to a full annual 
report each year end and an interim report at 
the half year end. Care is taken to ensure that 
any price sensitive information is released to all 
shareholders, institutional and private, at the 
same time in accordance with London Stock 
Exchange requirements. 
Corporate Governance Report continued
For the year ended 31 October 2013 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 25
Idox plc strives to give a full, timely and realistic 
assessment of its business in a balanced way, in 
all price-sensitive reports and presentations. 
AIM Rule Compliance Report
Idox plc is quoted on AIM and as a result the 
Group has complied with AIM Rule 31 which 
requires the following:
• sufficient procedures, resources and controls 
to enable its compliance with the AIM Rules;
• see advice from Nominated Advisor 
(“Nomad”) regarding its compliance with the 
Rules whenever appropriate and take that 
advice into account;
• provide the Nomad with any information it 
reasonable requests in order for the Nomad 
to carry out its responsibilities under the 
AIM Rules for Nominated Advisors, including 
any proposed changes to the Board and 
Provision of draft notifications in advance;
• ensure that each of the Directors accepts full 
responsibility, collectively and individually, for 
compliance with the AIM rules; and
• ensure that each Director discloses without 
delay all information which the Group 
needs in order to comply with AIM Rule 17 
(Disclosure of Miscellaneous Information) 
insofar as that information is known to the 
Director or could with reasonable diligence 
be ascertained by the Director. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 26
Governance
Membership and Meetings
The Audit Committee is a committee of the 
Board and is comprised of two Non-Executive 
Directors: Peter Lilley and Wendy Hall. 
Christopher Wright was a member until his 
retirement date of 28 February 2013.
The Audit Committee invites the Executive 
Directors, the external auditor and other senior 
managers to attend its meetings as appropriate. 
The Company Secretary is also the Secretary of 
the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is considered to have 
sufficient, recent and relevant financial 
experience to discharge its functions.
During the period under review, the Audit 
Committee met three times.
Role, Responsibilities  
and Terms of Reference
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board 
in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for 
financial reporting and internal control.
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include:
• to review the integrity of the annual 
and interim financial statements of the 
Group ensuring they comply with legal 
requirements, accounting standards and AIM 
rules, and any other formal announcements 
relating to the Group’s financial performance; 
• to review the Group’s internal financial  
control and risk management systems;
• monitor and review the requirement for  
an internal audit function;
• to review the arrangements for staff to 
whistle-blow on financial reporting and  
other matters;
• safeguard the auditor’s objectivity and 
independence when non-audit services  
are provided; and
• oversee the relationship with the external 
auditor, including approval of their 
remuneration, agreeing the scope of the  
audit engagement, assessing their 
independence, monitoring the provision  
of non-audit services, and considering their 
reports on the Group’s financial statements.
The Audit Committee operates within agreed 
terms of reference, which can be found on the 
Company’s website.
Independence of External Auditor
The Committee keeps under review the 
relationship with the external auditor including:
• the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor, taking into account the 
relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements and the relationship with the 
auditor as a whole, including the provision  
of the non-audit services; and
• the consideration of audit fees and any  
fees for non-audit services.
The Audit Committee develops and 
recommends to the Board the Group’s policy 
in relation to the provision of non-audit services 
by the auditor, and ensures that the provision 
of such services does not impair the external 
auditor independence.

Financial Statements
Independent auditor’s report to the 
members of Idox plc
We have audited the group financial statements 
of Idox plc for the year ended 31 October 2013 
which comprise the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 
and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of  
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 
23 and 24, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the  
financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of 
financial statements is provided on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
apb/scope/private.cfm
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s affairs as at 31 October 2013 and  
of its profit for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the 
group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required  
to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of  
the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information  
and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent 
company financial statements of Idox plc for  
the year ended 31 October 2013.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience  
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable  
under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting 
estimates and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The Group has 
evaluated the estimates and assumptions that have been made in relation to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in these financial statements. The estimates and assumptions which have the 
most significant impact on the financial statements which are recognised in the financial statements 
are as follows:
(i) Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the 
date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement 
and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by 
the assets and selection of an appropriate cost of capital. Furthermore, management must estimate 
the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on those assets accordingly. 
In determining the useful economic life of the intangible software assets, management has given 
consideration to the length of time that its own software is typically used within its market. In addition, 
management reviewed competitor products and the length of time they had also been in use.
Consideration was also given as to the likelihood that a new competitor could enter the market with 
a new product. This was considered unlikely due to the up-front capital investment which would be 
required to develop a new product, the requirement for reference sites to demonstrate the product, 
and the long life cycles which products have in the market. For details on the estimates made in 
relation to intangible assets, see note 12.
(ii) Development costs
The Group reviews half yearly whether the recognition requirements for development costs have 
been met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and 
may be subject to future technical problems at the time of recognition. Judgements are based on 
the information available at each balance sheet date. In addition, all internal activities related to the 
research and development of new software products are continuously monitored by the Directors. 
See note 12 for further information. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 37
(iii) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, as least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.  
The recoverable amount is determined based upon value-in-use and net realisable value calculations. 
The value-in-use method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. Pre-tax discount rates  
have been applied and are based on WACC calculations. See note 12 for further commentary.
(iv) Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue on certain contracts such as service agreements, prior to an invoice 
being raised, where work has been completed and there is a high degree of certainty of the contract 
being completed and the invoice raised and cash received. See paragraph headed ‘Revenue’ below 
for more detail on how the Group accounts for revenue. 
(v) Contingent consideration
The contingent consideration provision is the maximum undiscounted amount which will be paid, 
which represents fair value. Where an acquisition involves a potential payment of contingent 
consideration the estimate of any such payment is based on its fair value. To estimate the fair value 
an assessment is made as to the amount of contingent consideration which is likely to be paid having 
regard to the criteria on which any sum due will be calculated. 
(vi) Deferred tax
The Group has tax losses available to offset future taxable profits. In estimating the amount of 
deferred tax to be recognised as an asset the Group estimates the future profitability of the relevant 
business unit.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn 
up to 31 October each year. Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power 
to control the financial and operating policies. Idox plc obtains and exercises control over all of its 
subsidiaries through ownership of 100% of the voting rights.
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
For business combinations occurring since 1 November 2009, the requirements of IFRS 3R have 
been applied. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is 
calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and 
the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 38

Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts receivable in respect of goods and services provided during  
the year, stated net of value added tax. Where work has been done, but a billing milestone has 
not been reached, the income has been accrued and included in amounts recoverable within trade 
and other receivables. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration. The Group derives its revenue 
streams from software solutions, information solutions and recruitment services. 
Continuing operations:
Software licence revenue is recognised when the licence is despatched to the customer. Where 
the licence is bespoke, revenue is recognised when the licence is delivered and the customer has 
accepted the licence as fully functional.
Software consultancy revenue is recognised on a stage of completion basis. Stage of completion is 
determined by time spent by service delivery consultants or by reference to the project milestones 
either included in the contract itself or included within a separate detailed project delivery plan. 
Revenue relating to goods delivered as part of software solutions provided is only recognised once 
the goods have been received by the customer.
Revenue relating to goods delivered for elections is recognised when the goods have been received 
by the customer. Consultancy revenue for elections is recognised on a stage of completion basis. 
The revenues for maintenance and managed service contracts are spread evenly over the life of the 
agreement, which is typically one year. 
Revenue derived from information solutions content is recognised over the life of the subscription, which 
is typically one year. Revenue from projects is recognised over the life of the project in accordance with 
the stage of completion which is determined by reference to the project delivery plan.
Revenue relating to grant applications is recognised on a ‘no win-no fee’ basis. Revenue is only 
recognised when confirmation that the grant application has been successful is received. 
Discontinued operations:
Recruitment revenue from permanent placements was recognised in the month when the placement 
started. Revenue from contract recruitment was recognised as the service was performed.
Contract revenue
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised only 
when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Management make a 
judgement on the fair value of the work completed to enable revenue on long term contracts to be 
recognised in the correct periods. Stage of completion is determined based on management’s best 
estimate of effort expended and progress against project plans at the year end. Provision is made for 
any losses as they are foreseen. 
The contracts for software solutions often contain multiple elements such as software, consultancy 
and maintenance. Management make appropriate judgements and estimates in relation to the fair 
value of each of these elements in accordance with IAS 18. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 39
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the 
steering committee, which comprises the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the 
excess of the sum of a) fair value of consideration transferred, b) the recognised amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest in 
the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain 
purchase) is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least 
annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Unallocated goodwill on acquisitions 
relates mainly to workforce valuation, synergies and economies of scale obtained on combining 
acquisitions with existing operations.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to the date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves. There is no 
re-instatement of goodwill that was amortised prior to transition to IFRS. Goodwill previously written 
off to reserves is not written back to profit or loss on subsequent disposal.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised to the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on an annual 
basis. Amortisation commences when the asset is available for use. The residual values of intangible 
assets are assumed to be zero.
(i) Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised in profit or loss 
in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred are capitalised when all the following 
conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this 
requires that there is a market for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset 
itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in generating such benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to 
use or sell the intangible asset; and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 40

Other intangible assets continued
(i) Research and development continued
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed in profit or loss as incurred. 
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary 
to create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management. Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset, and is shown separately  
on the statement of comprehensive income.
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements 
for development costs have been met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product 
development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the time of recognition. 
Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date. In addition, all 
internal activities related to the research and development of new software products are continuously 
monitored by the Directors.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method over a period of 5 years.
(ii) Customer relationships
Customer relationships represent the purchase price of customer lists and contractual relationships 
purchased on the acquisition of CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, J4B Software and 
Publishing Limited, Strand Electoral Management Services Limited, Grantfinder Limited, McLaren 
Software Limited, Lalpac Limited, Interactive Dialogues NV, Opt 2 Vote Limited, Currency Connect 
Holding BV, FMx Limited, Artesys International SA and the CTSpace Group. These relationships are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight line method over a period of 20, 10 and 5 years.
(iii) Trade names
Trade names represent the named intangible asset recognised on the acquisition of CAPS Solutions 
Limited, Plantech Limited, J4B Software and Publishing Limited, Strand Electoral Management 
Services Limited, Grantfinder Limited, McLaren Software Limited, Lalpac Limited, Interactive 
Dialogues NV, Opt 2 Vote Limited, Currency Connect Holding BV, FMx Limited, Artesys International 
SA and the CTSpace Group. These trade names are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method over a 
period of 20, 10 and 5 years.
(iv) Software
Software represents the UNI-form, ACOLAID, Enterprise Engineer, CAFM Explorer, electoral and 
licensing software purchased on the acquisition of CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, 
McLaren Software Limited, Strand Electoral Management Services Limited, Lalpac Limited, Interactive 
Dialogues NV, Opt 2 Vote Limited, Currency Connect Holding BV, FMx Limited, Artesys International 
SA and the CTSpace Group. The software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method over a 
period of 5 and 10 years. Software also includes software licences purchased which are amortised 
using the straight line method over a period of 3 years. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 41
(v) Database
Database represents the grant information database purchased on the acquisition of J4B Software 
& Publishing Limited and Grantfinder Limited. The database is carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 5 years.
(vi) Order backlog
Order backlog represents the managed service contracts and subscription deferred revenue 
purchased on the acquisition of 11 land and property information solution contracts and Grantfinder 
Limited. Amortisation on the managed service deferred revenue is calculated based on the weighting 
and length of each contract purchased. Subscription deferred revenue is calculated using the straight 
line method over a period of 5 years.
Impairment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested 
individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated 
to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business 
combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors the 
related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible 
assets with an indefinite useful life, and those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested 
for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, 
reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal discounted cash 
flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been 
allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is 
charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all 
assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised 
may no longer exist.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement using the following rates and bases so as to write  
off the cost or valuation of items of property, plant and equipment over their expected useful lives.  
The rates that are generally applicable are:
Computer hardware 50% and 100% straight line 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% straight line 
Library books and journals 33 1/3% straight line 
Motor vehicles 25% straight line
Useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed annually. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 42

Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions paid to private pension plans of certain employees are charged to the income statement 
in the period in which they become payable. Contributions paid to the Group personal pension plans 
of employees are charged to the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Share-based payment transactions
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to  
1 November 2006 are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured 
at their fair values. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of 
employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted 
to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the income 
statement with a corresponding credit to the share option reserve.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the 
vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to 
vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number of share options 
expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods  
if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are 
credited to reserves.
Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
• “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration 
received for equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue.
• “Capital redemption reserve” represents when the entire deferred ordinary share capital was 
bought in exchange for one ordinary 1p share. 
• “Merger reserve” which arose as a result of a Group reconstruction that occurred on 17 November 
2000. This represents the issued share capital and share premium account in the Company’s 
subsidiary undertaking, Idox Software Limited.
• “Share options reserve” represents shares to be issued on potential exercise of those share 
options that have been accounted for under “IFRS 2 Share Based Payments”.
• “ESOP trust” represents share capital purchased to satisfy the obligation of the employee share 
scheme. Purchased shares are classified within the ESOP trust reserve and presented as a 
deduction from total equity.
• “Retained earnings” represents retained profits.
• “Treasury reserve” represents shares repurchased by the company to be held for redistribution  
as share options.
• “Foreign currency translation reserve” represents exchange gains and losses on retranslation  
of foreign operations.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 43
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged to 
profit or loss except where it relates to tax on items recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, in which case it is charged to equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred 
tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and 
their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination 
or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in 
subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available 
to be carried forward as well as other income credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as 
deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be 
offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at 
tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in profit or 
loss, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive 
income or equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to other 
comprehensive income or equity.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as operating leases. All leases held by the Group are operating in nature. Amounts paid under 
operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis 
over the lease term.
Dividend distributions
Interim dividends in respect of equity shares are recognised in the financial statements in the period  
in which they are paid.
Final dividends in respect of equity shares are recognised in the financial statements in the period  
that the dividends are formally approved.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentation currency of Idox plc and its United Kingdom subsidiaries is the  
pound sterling (£). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency  
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance  
sheet date. All differences are taken to profit or loss.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-sterling functional currency 
subsidiaries, are translated into pound sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. The results of non-sterling functional currency subsidiaries are translated into pound sterling 
using average rates of exchange. Exchange adjustments arising are taken to a separate component  
of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 44

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Capital policy
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain a capital structure that optimises the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital  
to shareholders or issue new shares. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group 
has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially stated at their fair value, as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. All receivables are considered for 
impairment. Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those 
receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the assets 
carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on deposit and are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in 
the assets of the Group after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct transaction 
costs. Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are recognised in profit or loss over the 
term of the instrument using an effective rate of interest.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest-bearing, are initially stated at their fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 45
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose the entity primarily to interest rate risk. The Group uses interest rate 
swap contracts to manage these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved 
by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives. Derivative 
financial instruments are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The Group does not apply 
hedge accounting. 
Restatement of comparative figures 
The Group have restated the 2012 comparative figures to show the results of TFPL Limited as a 
discontinued operation. 
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue 
recognised in excess of payments on account. Amounts recoverable on contracts of £1,863k have 
been restated for the prior year to disclose this balance as being a non-current asset. This was 
previously disclosed in the notes to the financial statements as a long term debtor however it had 
been disclosed within total current assets on the balance sheet. This has now been restated for 
comparative purposes.
2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
As at 31 October 2013, the Group is primarily organised into two main operating segments, which  
are detailed below. On 1 July 2013 the recruitment segment was sold. As Recruitment was a 
separately identifiable operating segment the results for the period ended 31 October 2013, and 
comparative periods, have been reclassified as a discontinued operation. On 1st September 2013 
following an internal reorganisation, the Information Solutions segment was combined with Public 
Sector Software. The results for the period are included within the Public Sector Software segment 
and the comparative periods have been restated. 
Financial information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, which comprises the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, monthly on a business unit basis with revenue and 
operating profits split by business unit. Each business unit is deemed an operating segment as each 
offers different products and services.
• Public Sector Software – delivering software and information service solutions to local  
government customers and public sector organisations across a broad range of departments 
• Engineering Information Management – delivering engineering document management  
and control solutions to asset intensive industry sectors
Segment revenue comprises sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal 
of assets and finance income. Segment profit reported to the Board represents the profit earned by 
each segment before the allocation of taxation, Group interest payments and Group acquisition costs. 
The assets and liabilities of the Group are not reviewed by the chief operating decision maker on a 
segment basis.
The Group does not place reliance on any specific customer and has no individual customer that 
generates 10% or more of its total Group revenue. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 46

The unrelieved trading losses of £2,652,000 in the UK remain available to offset against future taxable 
trading profits. Given the high probability that the Group will continue to benefit from these tax losses 
in the future, the deferred tax asset continues to be recognised. The unrelieved trading losses arising 
overseas of £2,943,000 have been recognised during the year with the anticipation that the Group will 
benefit from these tax losses in future. The foreign losses recognised during the year arise mainly in 
the US, with a small element arising in France. Across the year the total deferred tax asset in respect 
of unrelieved trading losses has increased £235,000 to £1,175,000.
The effective tax rate was (12.75%). The decrease is due to the recognition of historic deferred tax 
assets within the US entities of the EIM business in relation to losses and other timing differences of 
£4,492,000. Other factors in the decrease of the tax rate include the origination of tax losses within 
the EIM business in the UK of £2,439,000, which originated on confirmation of the formalisation of 
a pre-acquisition intercompany creditor, and an increase in the deferred tax asset recognised in 
respect of share options of £508,000. A deferred tax asset of £495,000 is recognised at the year-end 
in relation to share options, based on the expected vesting period and exercise price. These factors 
combined resulted in a credit to the corporation tax charge of £1,733,000. Without these factors, the 
effective rate of tax is 13%.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 56

Impairment test for goodwill
For this review goodwill was allocated to individual Cash Generating Units (CGU) on the basis of 
the Group’s operations as disclosed in the segmental analysis. As the Board review results on a 
segmental level the Group is monitoring goodwill on the same basis. 
During the year the Group disposed of the non-core recruitment division TFPL Limited. The CGU’s 
were then reorganised into two main divisions; Public Sector Software (PSS) and Engineering 
Information Management (EIM). The former Information Solutions business which largely supplies  
the public sector with content has been absorbed and integrated into the PSS division.
The carrying value of goodwill by each CGU is as follows:

2013 
£000
2012

Public Sector Software 26,487 19,954
Idox Information Solutions – 5,966
TFPL Recruitment – 957
Engineering Information Management 15,996 14,489
42,483 41,366
The recoverable amount of all CGU’s has been determined using value-in-use calculations. These 
calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management 
covering the next five financial years. The key assumptions used in the financial budgets relate to 
revenue and EBITDA growth targets. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the 
estimated growth rates stated below. Growth rates are reviewed in line with historic actuals to  
ensure reasonableness and are based on an increase in market share. 
For value in use calculations, the growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are 
based on management’s best estimate of short term performance based on an assessment of market 
opportunities and macro-economic conditions. In the year to 31 October 2013 the Weighted Average 
Cost of Capital for each CGU has been used as an appropriate discount rate to apply to cash flows.  
In 2012 the Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital was used as an appropriate discount rate.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 66

TFPL Recruitment – – 13.0% 0%
Engineering Information Management 10.24% 2% 12.5% 2%
Individual Weighted Average Cost of Capital were calculated for each CGU and adjusted for the 
market’s assessment of the risks attaching to each CGU’s cash flows. The Weighted Average  
Cost of Capital is recalculated at each period end. 
An impairment charge of £457,000 (£1,018,000) has been recorded in the year against goodwill 
in relation to the disposal of TFPL Recruitment. This has been disclosed within the discontinued 
operation results. 
Sensitivities have been run on cash flow forecasts for all CGU’s. Management are satisfied that the 
key assumptions of revenue and EBITDA growth rates are achievable and that reasonable possible 
changes to those key assumptions would not lead to the carrying amount of the relevant CGU 
exceeding the recoverable amount. A 0% growth rate would result in the following headroom:

exceeding the recoverable amount.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 67

are considered irrecoverable and are written off against the trade receivable directly. Where trade 
receivables are past due an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding 
balance. No provision is required in respect of amounts owed by Group undertakings.

Fair value:
Interest rate swap – Fair value hierarchy level 2 66 136

The fair value of the contract has been estimated using relevant market interest rates.
In the current year the Group has used interest rates swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate 
movements on its bank borrowings. Contracts with notional values of £12m fix interest payments at  
an average rate of 1.33% for periods up until 2015. 
The fair value of the interest rate swap liability at 31 October 2013 is estimated at £66,000 
(2012: £136,000).  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 73

Total borrowings 23,194 25,179
At the balance sheet date the Group had three loan facilities in place with Bank of Scotland Plc 
consisting of one term loan and two revolving credit facilities. 
At the balance sheet date, the amortised cost of the term loan was £7,317,000 and during the period 
the loan was held the average interest rate paid was 3.14%.
The Group has a revolving credit facility to fund working capital requirements. At the balance sheet 
date, the amortised cost of this facility was £1,964,000 and during the period the facility was held the 
average interest rate paid was 3.13%.
The Group has a revolving credit facility of £15m which was made available in order to finance 
business acquisitions. In November 2012, £1.8m of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the 
acquisition of FMx Limited. In April 2013, £2.1m of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the 
acquisition of Artesys International. The total amortised cost of the acquisition revolving credit facility 
at the year end was £13,795,000 and the average interest rate paid during the period the facility was 
held was 3.15%. 
As security for the above loans, the Bank of Scotland Plc holds a bond and floating charge over the 
assets of the Group, a composite guarantee supported by each Group company and a share pledge 
in respect of the entire issued share capital of each subsidiary company.
The Group also has two term loans in place with Oseo, France. At the balance sheet date the total 
outstanding amount was £118,000 and the average interest rate paid during the period the facility  
was held was 5.58%.

22 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits, 
bank borrowings and interest rate swaps. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to 
finance the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments which mainly comprise 
trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the Board of 
Directors. The Group finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. The Board 
provides guidance on overall risk management including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, 
credit risk, and investment of excess liquidity.
The impact of the risks required to be discussed under IFRS 7 are detailed below:
Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities 
are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operations. The Group has 
minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of natural hedges arising between sales and 
cost transactions.
(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of cash balances held with banks and other 
highly rated counterparties.
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable 
rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the 
Group to fair value interest rate risk. During 2013 and 2012, all the Group’s borrowings at variable  
rate were denominated in UK Sterling. To protect cash flows against movements in interest rates 
the Group entered into an interest LIBOR swap agreement.
Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets 
recognised at the reporting date, as summarised below:
Classes of financial assets – carrying amounts
2013 
£000
2012 
£000
Cash and cash equivalents 3,399 3,640
Trade receivables 9,541 11,186
Amounts recoverable on contracts 7,642 4,045
Other receivables 377 228
Financial assets at fair value 20,959 19,099 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 75
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risks arise from cash and cash equivalents and 
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including 
outstanding receivables and committed transactions. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. It is the policy of the Group to 
present the amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the 
Group’s management based on prior experience and the current economic environment. The Group 
reviews the reliability of its customers on a regular basis, such a review takes into account the nature 
of the Group’s trading history with the customer.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the majority of funds are held with two UK banks with 
high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Management does not expect any 
losses from non-performance of these counterparties.
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Liquidity risk
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its 
outstanding commitments on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet obligations 
of the Group as they fall due.
The Board receives regular debt management forecasts which estimate the cash inflows and 
outflows over the next twelve months, so that management can ensure that sufficient financing is in 
place as it is required. Surplus cash within the Group is put on deposit in accordance with limits and 
counterparties agreed by the Board, the objective being to maximise return on funds whilst ensuring 
that the short-term cashflow requirements of the Group are met.
Detailed analysis of the debt facilities taken out and available to the Group are disclosed in note 21.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 76

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital  
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debts.

shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is quarterly from the date of grant. Per the  
contractual agreements, the options are settled in equity once exercised.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of investing in 
the Company. The Company purchases matching shares which become the property of the employee 
after a three year vesting period. 
Details of all share options over 1p Ordinary shares, falling within the measurement and recognition 
criteria of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”, including their contractual life and exercise prices are

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share 
price over the previous 3 years. The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on the 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a total charge of £511,000 (2012: £731,000) related to equity-settled share-
based payment transactions during the year. A charge of £495,000 (2012: £568,000) related to share 
options granted and £16,000 (2012: £163,000) related to share options exercised. In 2013, a charge of 
£12,000 (2012: £24,000) relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions were in respect 
of discontinued operations. These charges all related to share options granted.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 80

25 ACQUISITIONS
Artesys International 
On 9 April 2013 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Artesys International for a total 
consideration of €2.4m (£2.1m) in cash. Artesys International provides engineering document 
control solutions and applications supporting the efficient and safe operation of processing plants. 
Opidis, an intelligent P&ID and 3D Plant model navigation tool is used by over 8,000 engineering 
operations and maintenance professionals to locate validated plant documents and data. The 
acquisition of Artesys International adds extended geographic coverage in Europe, Africa and the 
Middle East and a complementary portfolio of products, customers, professional services and 
industry partners to the Group. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Artesys has been capitalised and consists largely of the workforce 
value, synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of Artesys with Idox. 
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The purchase  
of Artesys has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.

The fair values stated above are provisional. The fair value adjustment for the intangible assets relates 
to customer relationships, trade names and software. A related deferred tax liability has also been 
recorded as a fair value adjustment.
The fair value of trade debtors is equal to the gross contractual amounts receivable. All debts have 
been reviewed and are considered recoverable.
The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 9 April 2013, 
contributed by Artesys was £892,000. Artesys also made a loss of £311,000 for the same period. If 
Artesys had been included from 1 November 2012, it would have contributed revenue of £1,894,000 
and a loss after tax of £437,000. 
Acquisition costs of £64,000 have been written off in the consolidated statement of  
comprehensive income.
Innovation Connect (formerly trading as Currency Connect)
There have been additional fair value adjustments in respect of the acquisition of Innovation 
Connect on 3 May 2012. Since 31 October 2012, management have aligned the company’s revenue 
recognition policy with those of the Group. This change has meant that accrued income is now only 
recognised when performance obligations have been met and the right to receive the revenue can be 
measured reliably dependent upon the nature of the individual grant applications. This has resulted in 
an additional fair value adjustment which has reduced accrued income by £446,000 and increased 
goodwill by a corresponding amount. 
There was a fair value adjustment of £46,000 to tangible fixed assets to align the depreciation policy of 
the company to the Group policy.
A final fair value adjustment of £58,000 was made to the bad debt provision to align the provision  
with the Group.
There will be no further fair value adjustments and all opening balances for Innovation Connect are 
now final.
Opt2Vote 
During the year a fair value adjustment of £13,000 was made in respect of the acquisition of Opt2Vote 
Limited on 27 March 2012. The adjustment was made to remove an other receivable balance which 
was deemed to be non-recoverable. 
There will be no further fair value adjustments and all opening balances for Opt2Vote are now final.
FMx
There have been two fair value adjustments during the year in respect of the acquisition of FMx 
Limited on 18 October 2012. An adjustment of £182,000 was made to align the deferred income 
policy with the Group policy. A further adjustment of £15,000 was made in respect of taxation  
timing differences. 
There will be no further fair value adjustments and all opening balances for FMx are now final. 
No additional fair value adjustments have been made in the year in respect of prior year acquisitions. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 82

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting 
standards and under the historical cost convention.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act, 2006. A cash flow statement has not been provided as permitted by FRS1 
(Revised) Cash Flow Statements.
FRS 20 Share based payment
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior  
to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured 
at their fair values. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of 
employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted 
to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
Employees to whom share options have been granted provide their services in subsidiary 
companies of Idox plc. All equity settled share-based payments are recognised as an expense  
in the profit and loss account of the relevant subsidiary company. In Idox plc, the cost is allocated  
to investments in subsidiaries.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the 
vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to 
vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number of share options 
expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods 
if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are 
credited to reserves.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the 
company an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have 
occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than 
not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 87
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in 
the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent 
to a similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial 
liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating to 
financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance costs are calculated so as to 
produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a 
financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating  
to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
Interest and expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis  
and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.  
The company does not apply FRS 26.
2 DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES
There are no wages and salaries paid by the parent company.
The company has no employees and Directors are remunerated by other Group companies. Details 
of the remuneration for each Director are included in the Report on Remuneration which can be found 
on pages 18 to 20 but which do not form part of the audited accounts.

At the balance sheet date the Company had three loan facilities in place with Bank of Scotland Plc 
consisting of one term loans and two revolving credit facilities. 
At the balance sheet date, the amortised cost of the term loan was £7,317,000 and during the period 
the loan was held the average interest rate paid was 3.14%.
The Company has a revolving credit facility to fund working capital requirements. At the balance sheet 
date, the amortised cost of this facility was £1,964,000 and during the period the facility was held the 
average interest rate paid was 3.13%. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 91
The Company has a revolving credit facility of £15m which was made available in order to finance 
business acquisitions. In November 2012, £1.8m of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the 
acquisition of FMx Limited. In April 2013, £2.1m of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the 
acquisition of Artesys International. The total amortised cost of the acquisition revolving credit facility 
at the year end was £13,795,000 and the average interest rate paid during the period the facility was 
held was 3.15%. 
As security for the above loans, the Bank of Scotland Plc holds a bond and floating charge over the 
assets of the Company, a composite guarantee supported by each Group company and a share 
pledge in respect of the entire issued share capital of each subsidiary company.
The Directors’ estimate that the fair value of the Company’s borrowing is not significantly different  
to the carrying value.

10 SHARE OPTIONS 
The company has an unapproved share option scheme for all employees (including Directors). All 
share options are exercisable at a price equal to the average market price of the company’s shares 
on the date of grant. The vesting period is quarterly from the date of grant. The options are normally 
settled in equity once exercised.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of investing in 
the Company. The Company purchases matching shares which become the property of the employee 
after a three year vesting period. 
Details of all share options over 1p Ordinary shares, falling within the measurement and recognition 
criteria of FRS 20 “Share-based Payment”, including their contractual life and exercise prices are

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share 
price over the previous 3 years. The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on the 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £511,000 (2012: £731,000) related to equity-settled share-

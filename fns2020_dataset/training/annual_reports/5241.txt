Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
I am pleased to be able to report another successful year for 
eg. The business has built upon the solid foundations 
established between 2007 and 2009 to deliver strong 
profitable growth and further strengthened our platform for 
future expansion. As anticipated, the past year has seen the 
full potential of the back office optimisation market starting to 
emerge, in both the UK and overseas. At the same time 
financial institutions have continued to focus on minimising 
back office costs and improving operational control. This has 
translated into strong demand for eg’s products and services 
with trading in the second half of the year continuing the 
momentum of the first half. 
The growth in revenue achieved reflects contract wins from 
both new and existing customers, with a strong performance 
by our South African business which reported more than £1.2 
million of revenues during the full year (2010: £0.35 million). 
The UK business benefited from significant repeat business 
from existing customers as well as the order pipeline of XTAQ, 
acquired in March 2010, converting according to plan. 
We have continued to maintain tight control over costs, taking 
action in the second half following the acquisition of XTAQ to 
reduce the overall cost base. This resulted in improved 
margins and strong operational cash flow.
Financial results
Our financial performance demonstrates our success in 
creating a business platform that can consistently generate 
and sustain high quality revenue. Last year total revenues 
increased by 24% to £5.1 million (2010: £4.2 million), with 
software licences, maintenance and software services 
contributing 68% of revenues (2010: 70 per cent) and the 
balance coming from implementation and training services. 
Overall gross margin for the year was maintained at 63% 
(2010: 63 per cent) although, excluding sales of third party 
licences by XTAQ, underlying gross margin on our core product 
sales improved.
Underlying profit before tax and costs relating to the XTAQ 
acquisition increased by 355% to £0.5 million (2010: £0.1 
million), demonstrating the scalability of the business, with 
strong revenue growth being achieved on a well managed cost 
base. Costs relating to the XTAQ acquisition comprises 
£96,000 (2010: nil) consisting of £67,000 professional services 
costs and £29,000 management costs. 
After a tax credit of £127,000, underlying profit after taxation 
and costs relating to the XTAQ acquisition was up 535% to 
£0.6 million (2010: £0.1 million). 
Operating cash flow was £814,000 (2010: £728,000). The 
Company has a healthy financial position with cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 January 2011 of £0.5m (2010: £0.4 million).
The Board is not recommending the payment of a final 
dividend as we continue to re-invest profits in expanding the 
business. 
Current trading and outlook
The momentum of last year has continued into the start of this 
year. We have a strong sales pipeline and expect to continue 
to win new contracts from new and existing customers, as well 
as benefiting during 2011/12 from contracts won last year. 
Current trading is positive with contracted and recurring 
revenues accounting for 54% of our forecast revenues for the 
year (2010: 52 per cent). 
The Board plans to build on this success and we are confident 
of further profitable growth in the current year.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Introduction
The increasing momentum in eg’s financial performance over 
the past year reflects strong underlying demand for our 
products and services, together with our focus on developing 
and delivering back office optimisation solutions that deliver 
tangible cost savings for our customers. This has enabled us 
to grow revenues from existing users as well as expand our 
customer base both organically and through the acquisition of 
XTAQ Limited. 
eg’s financial performance follows management’s decision 
three years ago to restructure the fundamentals of the 
business. This involved focusing on building recurring and 
repeatable revenues, changing the implementation model to 
enable clients to do more of the implementation work 
themselves, reducing direct and overhead costs and investing 
in product development. Our success in selling eg’s products 
and services more widely and deeply to existing customers has 
also enabled us to deliver strong recurring and repeatable 
revenues and the product development undertaken has 
ensured that the Company’s technology platform is both 
robust and scalable as well as compatible with the ‘cloud’ and 
other technologies used in enterprise management systems. 
The Nuqleus product set, acquired with XTAQ, provides 
real-time data capture capability that reduces manual data 
entry routines. For our customers this provides an alternative 
integration mechanism with incumbent IT platforms without 
diverting their IT resources from other priorities. We are also 
addressing the growing demand from organisations seeking to 
combine the provision of real-time and historic management 
information from the back office with more advanced 
forecasting and planning capabilities usually found in the front 
office. This is achieved using our own products as well as by 
exporting data into the solutions either of other vendors or 
developed by our customers. 
Internationally, the growth and profitability achieved in South 
Africa was encouraging and validates the Company’s decision 
to invest in that market. Following this success, and with 
opportunities identified with a number of customers and other 
business partners, we are planning to expand selectively into 
other new territories. 
During the year, we have continued to maintain tight cost 
control and achieved annual savings of approximately 
£165,000 following the acquisition of XTAQ Limited.
Business development and operations
Market development
The growth potential of the back office optimisation market is 
increasingly being recognised. DMG Consulting estimated in its 
2010 Workforce Management Market Report, that the back office 
market has the potential to become at least three to seven times 
the size of the contact centre segment of the workforce 
management market. Other analysts have also forecast that 
demand for new types of software that continuously monitor and 
analyse people and process could have a value of approximately 
$3.5 billion over the next few years.
For eg this will mean new sales opportunities as workforce 
management vendors increase their marketing of ‘back office’ 
solutions. We are well placed to capitalise on the significant 
growth in market demand we expect over the next few years. 
The range of eg’s products and services addresses all of the 
key aspects of back office optimisation requirements, including 
resource forecasting and planning, end-to-end as well as 
intra-day and intra-process work allocation and tracking, and 
operational management and reporting, all in real-time.
Growing industry recognition of eg as the provider of the most 
comprehensive back office optimisation software functionality will 
be a significant factor in our future success and it is encouraging, 
as we move forward, that we have strong endorsement of our 
products through our growing customer base.
Customer base growth
During the past year the total number of eg customers 
increased from 29 to 42. The expansion of our customer base 
reflects the growing recognition of eg’s leading position in the 
back office optimisation market, our strong long-term 
customer relationships, the measurable value added by our 
products and services and the benefits of the Company’s 
technology and product development programme.
 “Internationally, the growth 
and profitability achieved in 
South Africa was encouraging 
and validates the Company’s 
decision to invest in that 
market.”

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued
New projects undertaken during the year included 
implementations of Nuqleus in the UK for Aviva, Bradford & 
Bingley and Citibank, with a further contract signed at the end 
of the year with Produban UK, part of the Santander group. 
Other projects included the roll-out of eg work manager
®
 for 
Vital, a Norwegian life and pensions insurance company, and 
services relating to the implementation of licences bought by 
Nationwide and a major UK life and pensions company in 
2009/10. Wins in South Africa included implementations for 
one of South Africa’s largest healthcare Administrators is in the 
open and closed medical scheme markets, Silica (an 
outsourcing company) and a pilot implementation for 
Alexander Forbes (provider of financial and risk services).
During 2010 eg’s Professional Services team undertook over 
20 fee earning projects for existing customers looking to 
leverage their investments in our products. Significantly a 
number of these projects involved customers migrating their 
systems onto new virtualised server platforms and we believe 
such projects will be a trend through 2011. Custom reporting 
projects were also significant as customers looked to publish 
increasingly sophisticated operational management 
information across their enterprises. Significant projects 
included;  
  A First Contact Resolution Reporting project for a major 
outsourcer
  A Virtual Server Migration project for a major building 
society
  Development of a real-time Customer Experience 
Management enquiry tool for the call centre of a major 
outsource provider 
  A Field Sales New Business reporting project for a major UK 
insurer, and 
  A major platform migration project for a customer 
centralising and virtualising their eg servers.
Underpinning our growth is a high level of repeat business, 
with approximately 60% of revenues last year coming from 
existing customers who provide strong endorsement of eg’s 
products and services. Customer service remains a key priority 
for eg and in a recent survey, 100% of eg’s customers said 
that they would recommend the Company to others, the 
majority because of the results achieved. Also in the bi-annual 
customer satisfaction survey of our Helpdesk and Software 
Support service, covering 41,000 software users, the Company 
scored an average of 8.4 out of 10 for the quality of service 
provided.
Technology and product development
During the year the Company continued to enhance and 
develop both its technology platform and its products to 
improve performance, add functionality and enable delivery 
across any enterprise system. 
Key product developments included:
  Completion of eg work manager
®
 v6.0, a ‘thin client’ web 
browser version of eg’s core eg work manager
®
 product, 
built using the latest Microsoft Silverlight and Windows 
Communication Foundation technologies. This latest product 
has been designed to enable customers to deploy and 
extend the use of eg work manager
®
 more easily, 
providing a lower total cost of ownership for deployments ‘on 
premise’ or ‘on the cloud’. The product has been designed to 
work with the existing eg work manager
®
 database, 
enabling both new and existing customers to use the new 
version without the need for existing product upgrades; 
 Enhancement to the eg integration framework™, an 
open, standards based Software Development Kit (SDK) 
designed to simplify and shorten integration project 
timescales;
  Enhancement to Nuqleus to enable integration with Verint
®
 
Impact 360
®
 Recording™ system for call centres and for 
compatibility with zero footprint Citrix environments;
  Further releases of eg operational intelligence
®
 and  
eg operational intelligence
®
 data views; 
  The release of a new product, eg operational 
intelligence
®
 data views for BusinessObjects enabling 
customers with SAP BusinessObjects business intelligence 
platforms to interrogate eg’s operational data via a 
BusinessObjects universe; and
  Certification of eg work manager
®
 and eg operational 
intelligence
®
 for Microsoft Server 2008 and SQL Server 
2008 platforms. 
Acquisition
The integration of the operations and products of XTAQ, 
acquired in March 2010, was completed as planned along with 
approximately £165,000 of cost savings achieved by 
centralising operations at eg’s office and streamlining the 
XTAQ business.
“We are well placed to 
capitalise on the significant 
growth in market demand we 
expect over the next few years. 
The range of eg’s products and 
services address all of the key 
aspects of back office 
optimisation requirements”
 “A significant focus for  
the UK business in 2010 was 
converting XTAQ’s pipeline . . . 
Orders for Nuqleus won during 
the year had a total value of 
approximately £1.1 million” 11 eg solutions plc www.eguk.co.uk
Our Business Our Governance Our Accounts
20218.04  27/04/2011 Proof 7
The addition of the Nuqleus software into the eg product set 
extends our ability to meet the back office optimisation 
requirements of our customers. Nuqleus is the logical entry 
product for customers who want to begin the measurement, 
management and improvement stages to transform their 
operational performance.
Against this background, a significant focus for the UK 
business in 2010 was converting XTAQ’s pipeline and 
implementing the projects concerned. Orders for Nuqleus won 
during the year had a total value of approximately £1.1 
million. The first project, with Aviva, moved to further roll-outs 
having successfully completed the pilot stage prior to 
acquisition. Other wins include contracts from Citibank and 
Bradford & Bingley, with a contract with Produban UK, part of 
the Santander group being closed at the end of the year.
The final consideration for XTAQ was £175,893 comprising 
£33,333 in cash and £142,560 in 5% Convertible Unsecured 
Loan Notes 2012, convertible at 82.5 pence per share. Since 
completion, options for 1.13 million eg shares, with a 4-year 
vesting period and an exercise price of 55 pence, have been 
awarded to key XTAQ employees on achievement of agreed 
sales targets. 
Industry recognition
In July eg achieved ICT certification from Accredit UK in 
recognition of the high standard of our software product 
design and development. In September eg won the 
International Trade & Export category of the inaugural 
Birmingham Post Business Awards 2010.
People
eg is fortunate in being able to attract and retain good quality 
people and the Company is committed to providing training 
and career development programmes to enable this to 
continue.
At the end of 2010, 72% of eg employees had been with the 
Company for 5 years or more with the Staff Satisfaction 
Survey for 2010 showing an overall satisfaction score of 8.3 
out of 10. 
The Board would like to thank everyone at eg for their efforts 
during the past year. 
Future priorities
eg has demonstrated through the momentum achieved over 
the past year, that it has the management, products and 
scalable business model to capitalise on the substantial 
opportunities available in the emerging back office 
optimisation software market. 
Following the successful integration of XTAQ and, with 
customer demand continuing to be strong, the Company will 
continue to grow its order pipeline in both the UK and 
overseas.

Corporate Social Responsibility
eg is committed to managing  
its business in a socially 
responsible manner. 
eg’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) policy has 
been produced in collaboration 
with employees and reflects the 
areas the Company feels are 
most closely aligned to its 
business operations.
Employees
eg’s intention is to listen to and involve staff — employee 
feedback is an important way of ensuring the continuous 
improvement of the business and can help improve staff 
satisfaction. Employees are fully supported by the Company 
should they choose to undertake further study and training.
Environment
Our offices are energy efficient offices and in utilising the 
latest technology we are endeavouring to minimise our impact 
on the environment. It is Company policy that all waste 
materials are recycled. Wherever possible eg uses FSC-
certified paper products and sustainable suppliers. We 
introduced ethical external Christmas cards in 2008 and a 
digital card for employees to reduce waste.
Company charity
Since establishing a subsidiary in Johannesburg in 2007, eg 
has chosen the Doornkop Needy Children’s Centre as its 
Company charity. The centre provides safety and shelter for 
orphaned or fostered children aged 1 to 5 years old, some of 
whom are HIV positive. eg supports fundraising activities with 
staff and clients, as well as making its own financial 
contributions to the charity. The Company organise annual 
educational outings for the children and has provided items 
from a “wish list” of educational items using some of the 
funds raised to expand the facilities they have available and 
contribute towards the children’s education.
South Africa
The South African government has introduced a 
comprehensive system to help integrate black people into 
society, post-apartheid, and therefore encourage and assist 
the transition of economic empowerment. Companies 
operating in South Africa have to achieve Broad Based Black 
Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) accredited status in support 
of these objectives. Businesses are classified by their size and 
measured in terms of how successfully they comply with a 
range of seven measures.
For the third year running eg have been accredited with level 
3 status (out of 10, 1 is the highest score). 15 eg solutions plc www.eguk.co.uk

expenditure are as extracted from the financial statements. 
B Revenue growth/reduction compares the change in revenue from one year to the next expressed in percentage terms.

outstanding balance for trade debtors and trade creditors with the average value of sales or purchases for the previous 
12 months respectively, inclusive of VAT, and multiplying by the number of days in the year. 
Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year the Group made charitable donations to UK 
registered charities of £54,000 (2010: £15,000), including the 
Elton John Aids Foundation and The Caudwell Charitable Trust. 
No political donations were made.
Research and Development
The Group invests in new product development and the 
continual modification and improvement of its existing 
products to meet technological advances, customer and new 
market requirements.
Employee Involvement and Disability
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees 
any matters likely to affect their interests. Information on 
matters of concern to employees is provided in order to 
achieve a common awareness of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Group’s performance.
The Group’s policy is to recruit disabled workers for those 
vacancies that they are able to fill. All necessary assistance 
with initial training courses is given. Once employed, a career 
plan is developed so as to ensure suitable opportunities for 
each disabled person. Arrangements are made, wherever 
possible, for retraining employees who become disabled to 
enable them to perform work identified as appropriate to their 
aptitudes.
Risks and Uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance and cause actual results to differ materially from 
expected and historical results. Management seeks to identify 
material risks and put in place contingency plans to mitigate 
the Group’s potential exposure. 
Competitor Risk
The market for operations management improvement is 
becoming increasingly competitive. To mitigate this risk, 
management works to build strong customer relationships and 
develop the Group’s product offering. 
Commercial Relationships
Some of the products utilise interfaces with proprietary 
software licensed by independent, third party software 
developers. Any absence of key third party products could 
have a material impact on the business.
To mitigate this risk, all key commercial relationships and 
developments in technology in the marketplace are kept under 
review. The Group also works with a diversity of partners to 
mitigate the risk inherent in working with a single partner.
Operations
The Group’s facilities could be disrupted by events beyond its 
control such as fire or other issues.
The Group prepares recovery plans for most foreseeable 
situations so that our business operations would continue 
should these situations occur. 
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the risk 
of default to financial transactions by customers, availability of 
funds to meet the Group’s needs and fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates. Annual Report & Accounts 2011 www.eguk.co.uk 18 Our Governance
20218.04  27/04/2011 Proof 7
The Group manages these risks through an effective risk 
management programme. Exposures to financial risks are 
monitored by management and they are required to produce a 
quarterly risk report comprising all risks and an indication of 
the business impact of those risks.
The risk reports are provided to the Board of Directors in 
advance of the Board meetings and are discussed by the 
Board to ensure that the risk mitigation procedures are 
compliant with the Group policy and that any new risks are 
appropriately managed.
Credit Risk
The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default 
to financial transactions by customers. The Group has focused 
on selling to a “blue chip” customer base thereby minimising 
the risk of incurring bad debts. The Group’s positions with 
these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely 
monitored.
Liquidity
At the year end the Group had £0.49m in net cash balances. 
The objective is to ensure that operating profits are turned 
into cash balances during the year. The policy is to monitor the 
cash balance and keep a positive balance.
The Group finances its operations through retained profits and 
has an overdraft facility to provide additional liquidity if 
required.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to minimal foreign currency risk through 
transactions with overseas customers.
The Group is also exposed to exchange fluctuations which 
affect the value of its overseas subsidiary. The Group’s 
objective is to minimise exchange risks and the policy is to 
match cash payments and receipts in each currency wherever 
possible. Currency fluctuations are regularly monitored but the 
Group does not use any hedging instruments.

Policy on Payment of Creditors 
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in 
accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between 
the Group and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms 
and conditions have been complied with. 
Trade creditor days based on creditors at 31 January 2011 
were 31 days (2010: 35 days).
Statement as to disclosure of information to Auditors
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval of 
these financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they 
are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Auditors are unaware. Each of the Directors have confirmed 
that they have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that it has been 
communicated to the Auditor.
Going Concern
The Group manages its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through a combination of cash inflows from 
sales, tight management of expenses and when required an 
overdraft facility. The overdraft facility has recently been 
extended to 16 March 2012.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, which take account of 
both positive and negative variations in trading performance, 
show that the Group has sufficient headroom to operate within 
the level of its current facility. Should the facility be required 
beyond 16 March 2012 the Directors currently have no reason 
to believe that it will not be extended or that the Group could 
not obtain other sources of funding.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation, based on both 
recent past performance and the current pipeline of possible 
future business, that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and accounts.
Annual general meeting
A resolution to reappoint Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP as Auditors 
will be put to the members at The annual general meeting of 
the Company which will be held at 10.30am on 8 June 2011 at 
2nd Floor, 22 Soho Square, London, W1D 4NS.

Directors’ Responsibilities in the Preparation 
of the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial year.  The 
Directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)  as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected under 
company law to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the 
Group and the Company and the financial performance of the 
Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such 
financial statements that references in the relevant part of that 
Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are 
references to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
c. state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs adopted by the EU;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the eg solutions plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 21 eg solutions plc www.eguk.co.uk

Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/
private.cfm.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion:

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
  the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.

 Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of eg solutions plc and the enterprises controlled by 
the Group (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 January each year. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
and have been rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
 Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries used in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company and 
are based on consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits 
arising from them, are eliminated.
 Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated 
residual value over its expected useful life, as follows:
Computer Equipment —  50% straight line
Office Equipment —  15% reducing balance
Fixtures and Fittings — 15% reducing balance
Motor Vehicles — 25% reducing balance
Leasehold Improvements — 20% straight line

 Impairment of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or that has not yet been brought into use is tested 
for impairment annually.
 Intangible Assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s software development is recognised only when all of the 
following conditions are met:
y y an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
y y it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
y y the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;
y y the product or process is technically and commercially viable; and
y y sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which it is incurred.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives (6 years). The 
amortisation is charged to cost of sales in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date and 
amortised over the estimated life of the asset. These assets include intellectual property relating to the Nuqleus product set and 
customer relationships which eg would continue to benefit from. These are amortised over their useful economic lives (5 years).
 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
 Retirement Benefits
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of 
the Company in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in 
respect of pension costs and other post retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments at the reporting date.
 Foreign Currencies
Transactions in currencies other than sterling, the presentational and functional currency of the Group, are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on 
the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s foreign exchange reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at the monthly weighted average rate of exchange for 
the period. Rand denominated assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at the reporting 
date of £1 = R11.4301. (2010: £1 = R12.2749). Annual Report & Accounts 2011 www.eguk.co.uk 32 Our Accounts
20218.04  27/04/2011 Proof 7
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred 
tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither 
the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items credited or charged 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.
 Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of provision is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short term deposits held by the Group with 
maturities of less than three months.
 Trade Payables
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
 Share-based Payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 
2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 February 2006.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
 Employee Share Ownership Plans
The Company operates an ESOP trust and has de facto control of the shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and 
risks. The Group records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and administrative expenses are 
charged as they accrue.

 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group has no finance 
leases.
 Convertible Debt Instruments
Instruments where the holder has the option to redeem for cash or convert into a pre-determined quantity of equity 
instruments are classified as compound instruments and presented partly as a liability and partly as equity.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a 
similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the proceeds of issue and the fair value assigned to the liability 
component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar 
non-convertible debt to the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying 
value of the convertible loan note.
 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of Group financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires the use 
of accounting estimates and judgements in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. These judgements and 
estimates are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions.
 Impairment of intangible assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date.  
Intangibles are tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist.  Intangible assets are also 
tested for impairment where an asset has an indefinite useful life or where it has not been brought into use. Recoverable 
amounts are based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which includes management assumptions and estimates 
of future performance.
 Intangible Asset Valuations
The measurement of fair values on a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. The key judgements involved are the identification of which intangible assets 
meet the recognition criteria as set out in IAS38, the fair values attributed to those intangible assets and the useful lives of 
individual intangible assets. The useful lives of intangible assets relating to customer relationships involves judgement as to 
customer retention rates applicable. Fair values are based on the calculation of expected future cash flows, which include 
management assumptions and estimates of future performance.
 Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised when revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably and future economic benefits are 
probable. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, 
VAT and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
 Maintenance Contracts
Income in respect of maintenance contracts is invoiced on an annual basis and recognised as earned. Annual Report & Accounts 2011 www.eguk.co.uk 34 Our Accounts

 Software Licences
For perpetual licences revenues are recognised once the software has been fully installed.
For fixed term licences revenues are recognised on a straight line basis.
 Implementation and software services
Revenues in respect of implementation and software services are recognised on a percentage of completion basis calculated 
pro rata on the number of man days completed to the estimated total project man days.
2. BUSINESS COmBINATIONS
 Acquisition of XTAQ Ltd
On 11 March 2010, the Group announced the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of XTAQ Limited, a developer and 
supplier of business performance measurement software and associated services.
The consideration paid by the Company for XTAQ comprised of £33,333 in cash and the balance by the issue of £142,560 
in 5% Convertible Unsecured Loan Notes 2012 (‟Loan Notes”). On the second anniversary of their issue the Loan Notes are 
repayable or convertible into New Ordinary Shares at a share price of 82.5p. The Company may require holders to convert 
if, for at least 20 consecutive business days, the average share price of an ordinary share in the Company shall be 82.5p. 
The Noteholder Majority shall have the right to serve a Conversion Notice on the Company (not less than 7 Business Days 
prior to the second anniversary of the creation and issue of the Notes) to convert all of the Notes outstanding into fully paid 
Ordinary Shares at a price of 82.5p per Share. No premises or property lease liabilities were acquired.
Following completion of the acquisition of XTAQ its employees were granted options to subscribe for an aggregate of up to 
1,393,938 new ordinary shares in the Company, at an exercise price of 55p, the closing mid-market price of an ordinary 
share in the Company on 10 March 2010, being the last business day prior to the acquisition. The number of options that 
may be exercised will depend, on a sliding scale, on the achievement of pre-determined XTAQ revenue performance in the 
12 months ending 31 March 2011 and are subject to a 4 year vesting period from the date of issue. The grant of these 
share options are not treated as part of the consideration.
Founded in 1993 XTAQ was a privately owned business based in Bristol employing eight people. The business had 
developed its Nuqleus business performance measurement software which it distributed with support services to deliver 
improved operational performance and effectiveness. Customers can deploy Nuqleus strategically throughout the enterprise 
or as a point solution to address particular operational management information requirements. XTAQ’s customers included 
Barclaycard, Citibank, GE Capital, Principality Building Society as well as a number of public sector clients.
In the year to 31 March 2009 XTAQ’s audited turnover was £0.55 million, on which it incurred a loss before tax of £0.15 
million. As at the same date XTAQ had a deficit on net assets of £0.05m.
The primary reason for acquisition was to acquire the intellectual property relating to the Nuqleus product set. Also 
acquired were a number of customer relationships which eg would expect to continue to benefit from.
The trade and net assets of XTAQ Ltd were hived up to the Parent Company on 1 June 2010.

The fair value of trade payables and receivables is estimated to be in line with its book value and which reflects the gross 
contractual amounts recoverable.
XTAQ Limited contributed £1,088,000 to Group revenue for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance 
sheet date. If this acquisition had occurred on 1 February 2010 Group revenue would have been £1,109,000. As all trade 
and net assets were hived into the parent company on 1 June 2010 and synergy savings have since been made, it is 
impractical to disclose the profit XTAQ has contributed in a similar way.

4.  OPERATING SEGmENTS
eg solutions plc provides IT and software support services by operating two distinct companies in the United Kingdom 
(“EGUK”) and in South Africa (“EGSA”). Financial information is reported to the Board for both companies individually with 
revenue and operating profits split by geographical location. Segment revenue comprises of sales to external customers and 
excludes finance income. Segment profit reported to the Board represents the profit before tax earned by each segment.
For the purposes of assessing segment performance and for determining the allocation of resources between segments, the 
Board reviews the non-current assets attributable to each segment as well as the financial resources available. All assets 
and liabilities are allocated to reportable segments. Information is reported to the Board of Directors on a Company basis as 
management believe that each company exposes the Group to differing levels of risk and rewards due to local economic 
conditions. The segment profit or loss, segment assets and segment liabilities are measured on the same basis as amounts 
recognised in the financial statements, as set out in the accounting policies. Annual Report & Accounts 2011 www.eguk.co.uk 36 Our Accounts

Basic earnings per share  3.7p 0.7p
Diluted earnings per share  3.5p 0.6p
EPS has been calculated using the following methodology:
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the number of 
weighted average ordinary shares during the period. The number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit 
Trust (see note 27 Share-based Payments).
For diluted earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees and 5% Convertible Loan Notes.

The options outstanding at 31 January 2011 had an exercise price between 3.5 pence and 161.5 pence, and a weighted 
average remaining contractual life of 8.55 years (2010: 8.18 years).
The inputs into the Black–Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
   2011
Weighted average share price   £0.42
Weighted average exercise price   £0.46
Expected volatility   72%
Expected life   4 years
Risk-free rate   5.5%
Expected dividend yield   1.0%
Weighted average exercise price of options granted during the year   £0.54
  
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of a comparable business, prior to the period when 
the Company’s shares were listed on the AIM market. Volatility since listing has been calculated using the daily mid market 
share price. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based upon the management’s best estimate for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Share options are available to all employees who have completed their probation period.
eg solutions plc Employee Benefit Trust Ltd holds 1,036,470 ordinary shares of 1p, being 7.3% of the called up capital.

Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures. Any proposed changes will be 
considered by the Board prior to such changes being implemented.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are on the next page:

 Liquidity Risk
Cash flow is managed on a daily, short-term and longer-term basis and management is therefore able to ensure that the 
Group has sufficient cash and facilities to meet all its commitments. The Group ensures that there is sufficient cash and 
working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group from the current business plan.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed weekly by management.
The Group has an agreed overdraft facility to the 16 March 2012.
Banking covenants are monitored on a weekly basis to ensure that there are no current or potential future breaches. There 
have been no breaches of covenants during the reporting period and no breaches are foreseen over the next twelve 
months.
 market risk
Market risk includes foreign currency risk, price risk and interest rate risk.
Financial instruments affected by market risk are cash and cash equivalents. The following analysis, required by IFRS 7 
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables being UK interest 
rates and foreign exchange risk.
 Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to minimal foreign currency risk through transactions with overseas customers.
The Group is also exposed to exchange fluctuations which affect the value of its overseas subsidiary.
The impact on the Group’s financial instruments from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity below.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net assets and the proportion of financial 
instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments 
held at the reporting date. It does not reflect any change in revenue or costs that may result from changing interest or 
exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
y y UK interest rates are forecast to increase by 1%
y y South African Rand will convert at 14 rand to the British Pound.
Using the above assumptions the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and equity that would result from changes in UK interest rates and in exchange rates:
 2011 2010
 Income Equity Income Equity  
 gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss)

 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and is not considered to be a significant risk for the Group. The 
only interest bearing assets relate to cash and cash equivalents exposed to a floating interest rate. All other assets and 
liabilities are non interest bearing.
 Price risk
The Group’s products are tailored to realise benefits for customers and to meet individual requirements. Prices are 
negotiated with each customer on the basis of their specification of the product.
 Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. With eg’s exposure to the Financial 
services sector detailed reporting is provided weekly on the debt position and if required the Group will resort to legal 
action to recover any monies due after a sufficient period of time.
 Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and 
operate within current available facilities. This is reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis.
The Group manages its share capital and reserves as its Group capital.
The following table is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial 
instruments at 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2010.

The Group has not recognised impairment provisions against the trade receivables past due summarised on page 44 as 
they are considered to be recoverable based on previous trading history and there is no objective evidence that the 
amounts will not be collected.
The Group has £14,000 provided in respect of amounts for bad debts. (2010: £NIL)
The Directors believe the quality of outstanding receivables which are neither past due nor impaired to be fully collectible.
 Fair value assumptions
The fair value of all financial instruments approximate to their carrying value.
Short-term deposits – the fair value of short-term deposits and overdrafts approximates to the carrying value because of 
the short maturity of these instruments.

32.  POST EmPLOYmENT BENEFITS
Employees are offered membership of the eg solutions Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension arrangement. The cost 
of contributions to the scheme is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period that they arise. The 
contributions to the scheme for the period amounted to £155,000 (2010: £145,000) representing 3%-10% of pensionable 
salaries. The amounts outstanding at the year end were £13,000 (2010: £15,000)
33.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A Director’s loan of £272,000 (2010: £118,000) was due from EA Gooch at 31 January 2011. The loan is interest free with 
no specific repayment terms and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was £272,000 (2010: £118,000). 
During May 2011 EA Gooch will sell shares to the eg solutions Employee Benefit Trust which fulfils a need within the trust 
for oversubscribed share options. EA Gooch has agreed that these proceeds will be used to repay in full the Director’s loan 
outstanding.
In the ordinary course of business, sales and purchases of services take place between EGUK and EGSA. Sales of software, 
consultancy and management services from EGUK to EGSA totalled £668,000 (2010: £145,000). Sales of software services 
from EGSA to EGUK totalled £42,000 (2010: £61,000). All transactions are recorded on an intercompany account.
At 31 January 2011 EGUK had a balance receivable from EGSA of £817,000 (2010: £757,000). This inter company balance 
is interest free and has no fixed repayment date.
EA Gooch is the ultimate controlling party. Annual Report & Accounts 2011 www.eguk.co.uk 56 Our Accounts

34. CONvERTIBLE LOAN NOTES
5% Convertible loan notes were issued at par on 5 October 2010 for £142,560.
On the second anniversary of their issue the Loan Notes are repayable or convertible into New Ordinary Shares at a share 
price of 82.5p. The Company may require holders to convert if, for at least 20 consecutive business days, the average share 
price of an ordinary share in the Company shall be 82.5p. The Noteholder Majority shall have the right to serve a Conversion 
Notice on the Company (not less than 7 Business Days prior to the second anniversary of the creation and issue of the 
Notes) to convert all of the Notes outstanding into fully paid Ordinary Shares at a price of 82.5p per Share.
If the notes are not converted they will be redeemed on the redemption date at par.
These instruments have been treated as compound financial instruments with the net proceeds received from the issue 
being split between the liability and equity. The equity component represents the fair value of the embedded option to 
convert the liability into equity of the Group.

The Directors estimate the fair value of the convertible loan notes to be approximately £143,000 (2010: £NIL).
The Directors estimate the fair value of the liability element to be approximately £137,000 (2010: £NIL) based on the 
present value of future cash flows discounted at 8%.

Chairman’s statement
“ The total dividend  
in respect of 2010 is  
23 pence per share, an 
increase of 7 per cent.”
Lars Emilson
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that in 2010 Charter achieved improved 
results with revenue, adjusted operating proﬁt and adjusted 
earnings per share all well ahead of 2009. 
A particular feature of the year was the divergence in the 
performance of different regions and industries. Despite the 
success that Charter has had in growing its businesses globally, 
Europe remains the region where most proﬁt is generated.  
Here, conditions were mixed and while some countries and 
industries performed well, others remained in recession which 
undoubtedly impacted Charter’s overall performance in the year. 
It is by no means certain how quickly there will be a more 
general return to economic growth across all the regions  
in which Charter operates, and we are very aware that the 
economies and ﬁnancial systems in Europe and across  
the world remain vulnerable to further shocks. 
The Board believes that the continuation of the measures  
taken by the Company in recent years to strengthen and 
improve its businesses are crucial to its ability to grow 
proﬁtability in the future. Key parts of this are to invest in 
efﬁcient plants and systems, to continue a strong research  
and product development programme and to make selective 
acquisitions where there are opportunities to do so. 
For these reasons, the Board believes that Charter should  
seek to maintain the balance sheet strength which has been 
successfully built up in recent years and which continued in 
2010, so that at the end of the year, shareholders’ funds stood 
at £636 million, an increase of £86 million during the year. 
The Board pays close attention to the Company’ s funding position. 
At 31 December 2010, net cash stood at £2 million. The net cash 
outﬂow for the year of £49 million reﬂects the re-absorption of cash 
into working capital as ESAB’ s business recovered, as well as 
capital expenditure and the payment of dividends to shareholders. 
It is a strategic objective to tighten ESAB’ s working capital whilst 
continuing to grow its revenue and proﬁt.
Shareholder value and dividend
The Board’s review of the Company’s strategy conﬁrmed that 
Charter will continue to focus on the development of both 
ESAB and Howden as a means of generating long-term  
value for shareholders.
The Board recognises that an important component of 
shareholder value is the dividend paid to the Company’s 
shareholders. 
In recognition of the Company’s improved performance in 
2010, the Board has declared an increased second interim 
dividend of 15.5 pence per share (2009: 14.5 pence per  
share), making a total dividend in respect of 2010 of 23 pence 
per share (2009: 21.5 pence per share), an increase of 7 per 
cent. It is anticipated that the dividend will be paid on 6 May 
2011 to holders of ordinary shares registered on 15 April 2011.
Going forward, the Board intends to continue to grow the dividend 
in a way that reﬂects the overall performance of the Company and 
the general economic and ﬁnancial conditions in the principal 
markets in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.
Corporate governance
We assessed the performance and effectiveness of the Board 
and its Committees during the year and action was taken to 
address the key points coming out of the review.
Corporate governance is monitored by the Board on an 
ongoing basis to ensure the policies and procedures we have  
in place continue to be effective and appropriate and that key 
risks are kept under review. In 2010 we updated our policies  
on anti-bribery and corruption and whistleblowing and reissued 
our Code of Conduct and equal opportunity policy. 
I am very pleased to note that we have seen further good 
progress in our health and safety performance. On the 
environmental side, the beneﬁts from the projects we have 
undertaken to improve environmental efﬁciency are now being 
seen in the business.
Employees
On behalf of the Board and shareholders I would like to thank 
all Charter’s employees for their hard work and the contribution 
they made to the Company in the year. I continue to be 
impressed with the quality and dedication of the people we 
have in our businesses around the world. 
Concluding comments
By focusing on proﬁt and cash generation, and through 
maintaining a strong balance sheet, the Board believes that the 
Company has the opportunity to make further progress in 2011 
in what is likely to continue to be an uncertain economic and 
ﬁnancial environment.

Chief Executive’s statement
“ Charter beneﬁted from its 
global presence, including 
its strong positions in the 
BRIC economies and 
emerging markets.”
Michael Foster
Charter’s results for 2010 were an improvement over 2009, 
with revenue, adjusted operating proﬁt and adjusted earnings 
per share all increasing. These results were achieved against  
an economic backdrop that was better than that experienced  
in 2009, but which remained varied with some regions and 
end-user segments continuing to be weak.
ESAB saw much improved revenue, adjusted operating  
proﬁt and adjusted operating margin, although its overall 
performance was held back as the welding segment  
recorded lower margins in the second half of the year and,  
as anticipated, the cutting & automation segment made an 
operating loss for the year as a whole and only returned to 
proﬁt in the second half. Howden’s performance was ahead  
of our previous expectations, with excellent contract execution 
and continued growth in its aftermarket business. It achieved 
an adjusted operating margin of 12.1 per cent, compared with 
11.4 per cent in 2009. 
In 2010, revenue was £1,719.6 million (2009: £1,659.2 million), an 
increase of 3.6 per cent and adjusted operating proﬁt was £145.9 
million (2009: £125.6 million), an increase of 16.2 per cent.
The Board considers that the best measure of the extent to 
which Charter is generating shareholder value is adjusted 
earnings per share, which excludes exceptional and other items 
considered by the Board to not directly relate to underlying 
performance. Adjusted earnings per share in the year were 
66.1 pence (2009: 55.0 pence), an increase of 20.2 per cent. 
The Board is also focused on the cash generated from 
operations which during the year amounted to £85.5 million 
(2009: £171.5 million), a reduction of 50.1 per cent, which 
reﬂects, in particular, the absorption of cash into ESAB’s 
working capital as volumes recovered. It is a strategic objective 
to tighten ESAB’s working capital whilst continuing to grow its 
revenue and proﬁt. During a period when Howden’s order book 
reduced in size, cash ﬂow from operations, at approximately  
80 per cent of operating proﬁt, continued to be excellent.
During 2010, Charter maintained investment in improving the 
effectiveness of its plants and systems. Capital expenditure was 
once again well ahead of depreciation, with the major project 
completed during the year being Howden’s new factory in 
Brazil. Investment in research and development continues to 
support future growth. ESAB made substantial improvements 
to its distribution network in Europe, completed the restructuring 
of its cutting business and more than restored the capacity 
closed during the recession. It also introduced new lines of 
consumables and equipment. Howden increased its presence 
in the important Indian power market, through entering into a 
joint venture with one of India’s leading boiler-makers, and also 
made an acquisition in Australia. 
Charter’s strategy
A key part of Charter’s strategy is to build upon the market 
leading positions both ESAB and Howden have achieved, 
which are based on brand, technology and customer service. 
ESAB and Howden are focused on serving their customers’ 
requirements, with emphasis being placed on continuing product 
development, increasing operational efﬁciency, improving 
customer service and maintaining effective cost management. 
Geographical coverage will continue to expand as strength is built 
in high growth regions. A crucial part of this will be to build upon 
our existing presence in the BRIC economies, and our approach 
will recognise the diverging requirements of different regions. 
Acquisitions are an important means of achieving our objectives, 
especially where they bring a presence in a region or technology 
that would take time and expense to build organically and 
provided they generate sufﬁcient risk-weighted return. Capital 
expenditure will be maintained at levels in excess of depreciation 
and investment in research and development and in development 
of our employees will continue. A strong balance sheet will help 
to ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial resources are available to 
achieve these goals.

Review of 2010
Economic and ﬁnancial conditions generally improved in 2010, 
as the global economy recovered from the depths of recession, 
although the recovery was uneven. 
The BRIC economies and emerging markets showed higher 
levels of growth and in some cases achieved record levels of 
output. However, across developed economies, conditions 
were patchy and more subdued. In Western Europe and North 
America, after a slow start to the year due to severe weather, 
economic conditions showed strong improvement in the ﬁrst 
half of the year, although the second half proved tougher. In 
Southern Europe, some countries continued to decline.
Within this economic environment, Charter beneﬁted from  
its global presence including its strong positions in the BRIC 
economies and emerging markets, which partly offset softer 
conditions in its markets in the developed world. Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 06
Chief Executive’s statement (continued)
The impact of the global recovery was more immediately seen in 
ESAB, which recorded higher volumes in its welding business 
despite some end-user segments such as construction, being 
ﬂat or declining. With its later cycle, Howden experienced lower 
sales of new equipment, but, partly assisted by continuing 
growth in its aftermarket business, was able to improve margins. 
ESAB
ESAB’ s results were up on 2009, as the business beneﬁted from 
an improved trading environment and the recent restructuring. 
Revenue for the year was £1,157.6 million (2009: £1,031.4 million), 
an increase of 12.2 per cent, and adjusted operating proﬁt was 
£89.3 million (2009: £66.0 million), an increase of 35.3 per cent. 
ESAB’s adjusted operating margin for the year increased to  
7.7 per cent (2009: 6.4 per cent), which reﬂected higher 
volumes. The improvement in operating margin in the ﬁrst  
half of the year was not maintained in the second half, due to 
usual seasonal factors, adverse changes in mix and, in certain 
instances mainly in Europe, increases in steel prices not being 
fully recovered through higher selling prices.
The total volumes of welding consumables sold during the year 
were 465k-tonnes (2009: 405k-tonnes), an increase of 15 per 
cent. Within this, volumes of solid welding wire increased by  
30 per cent as ESAB increased its market share in the 
recovering vehicle segment.
By comparison, the volume of electrodes, which are a higher 
margin product, only grew by 7 per cent. This was as a 
consequence of certain important users of electrodes, such as 
the general industrial and construction sectors, being less strong. 
In most European markets, electrode volumes were static or 
showed only modest growth. Those regions in which electrodes 
did show higher growth were generally emerging markets where 
selling prices and, in some cases margins, are lower. 
ESAB was able to deliver higher volumes of welding wire by 
re-commissioning certain equipment capacity that had been 
taken out of service during the recession, and by making 
selective additions to capacity where necessary to alleviate 
potential shortages. ESAB also out-sourced the production  
of certain types of welding wire. 
Revenue from sales of standard equipment increased by  
28 per cent as volumes beneﬁted from higher levels of steel 
consumption, and also from a new range of equipment 
introduced during the year. There was a particularly strong 
performance in South America, with other regions, including 
Europe and North America, starting to show improvement as 
the year progressed. 
ESAB’s overall proﬁtability was also constrained by the cutting 
& automation segment, which suffered from low new 
equipment sales during the year, as traditional customers, such 
as shipbuilding, remained depressed and as the wind energy 
industry, which had been an important customer of the 
automation business in 2009, faced increased uncertainty. 
Having recorded a loss in the ﬁrst half of the year the segment’s 
ﬁnancial performance improved during the second half, as the

“ In 2010, ESAB’s revenue 
and operating proﬁt  
were up on 2009, and  
the adjusted operating 
margin increased to  
7 .7 per cent. We expect 
higher consumables 
volumes in 2011 with 
strong growth in 
emerging markets.”
World Trade Center
ESAB has been chosen to supply the welding 
consumables for Tower 1 (107 stories) and Tower 4  
(65 stories) at the World Trade Center complex, which  
is under construction in New York. A wide range of 
ESAB’s welding consumables are being used including 
ESAB’s Seismic Certified products which were 
specifically developed for the construction of this  
type of building.
restructuring measures completed during the year delivered 
cost savings and as aftermarket revenues increased. As 
anticipated, by the year-end the segment had returned to 
proﬁtability and higher levels of enquiries and order intake 
suggest that this improvement will be sustained into 2011. 
Howden
As anticipated, Howden recorded reduced revenue and proﬁt as 
the impact of lower orders placed during 2009 came through. In 
2010, revenue was £562.0 million (2009: £627.8 million) and 
adjusted operating proﬁt was £67.8 million (2009: £71.5 million), 
representing decreases of 10.5 and 5.2 per cent respectively.
Howden’s adjusted operating margin was 12.1 per cent  
(2009: 11.4 per cent), an increase of 0.7 percentage points,  
as a result of increased higher-margin aftermarket revenues  
and strong contract execution. 
Revenue from the sale of new equipment was £358.0 million 
(2009: £438.6 million), a reduction of 18.4 per cent, which 
reﬂected lower sales of new equipment into the coal-ﬁred 
power generation industry of £137 million, which represented 
24 per cent of Howden’s revenue for the year. This proportion  
is much reduced from previous years, also reﬂecting Howden’s 
strategic success in diversifying its business. Slightly over half 
of sales of new equipment into the coal-ﬁred power generation 
industry arose in China and other emerging markets.
Howden’s aftermarket revenues continued to grow as planned 
and increased by 8 per cent to £204 million, representing  
36 per cent of Howden’s total revenues, with a particularly strong 
performance in China. The aftermarket business accounted for 
nearly one-half of the total gross proﬁt generated by Howden. 
Howden’s compressor business continued to make progress, 
and accounted for around 15 per cent of Howden’s total 
revenue, a proportion which has risen steadily in recent years.  
A signiﬁcant order was won to supply compressors to the 
coal-bed methane industry in Australia, and Howden is aiming 
to establish itself as the leader in this high-potential market. 
Also during the year, Howden continued its expansion in 
emerging and resource rich markets. A joint venture was formed 
with Larsen & Toubro, the major Indian engineering group with a 
view to taking about 30 per cent of the market in supplying fans 
and heaters to the rapidly growing coal-ﬁred power industry in 
India. Howden also commissioned its new manufacturing facility 
in Brazil during the year and acquired AustCold, a compressor 
packaging company located in Australia.
Order intake during the year was £533 million (2009: £503 
million), an increase of 6.0 per cent. Particular features were the 
recovery in orders from customers in the power industry in China 
and the much higher level of orders from India, reﬂecting 
Howden’s enhanced market presence. As anticipated, order  Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 08
Chief Executive’s statement (continued)
intake from the power industry in Europe and North America 
remained at relatively subdued levels. During 2010, the order 
book again proved to be robust, with minimal order cancellations. 
The level of order intake increased towards the end of the year, 
positioning Howden well for 2011.
At 31 December 2010, Howden’s order book was £424 million, 
of which £331 million is scheduled for delivery in 2011 and  
£93 million thereafter. Customers in emerging markets  
account for 60 per cent of Howden’s order book.
Balance sheet and cash ﬂow
As at 31 December 2010, shareholders’ funds were £635.7 
million (2009: £549.9 million), an increase of 15.6 per cent. 
At that date, Charter had net cash balances of £1.8 million (2009: 
£50.9 million), representing a net outﬂow of £49.1 million during 
the year. Cash inﬂow from operations was £85.5 million (2009: 
£171.5 million), a reduction of 50 per cent, primarily reﬂecting  
the absorption of cash into ESAB’s working capital as turnover 
increased. Other major outﬂows of cash were capital expenditure 
and capitalised development costs (£62.1 million, representing 
173 per cent of associated depreciation and amortisation), 
taxation (£36.5 million) and dividends (£36.7 million). 
The Company will seek to maintain its strong ﬁnancial position 
as it continues to invest in both businesses and looks to grow 
through acquisitions. 
2011 outlook
Looking forwards into 2011, further recovery in the macro-
economic environment is expected, although, as in 2010, this  
is unlikely to be smooth or uniform across regions and end-user 
industries. For Europe, which remains Charter’s most important 
region in terms of proﬁt generation, economic growth is 
expected to average no more than 1 per cent across the 
region, with Germany and Central Europe performing above 
average but Southern Europe stagnating or declining further. 
The BRIC economies and emerging markets will generate 
stronger growth. Commodity price inﬂation and government 
deﬁcits are amongst the principal threats to economic recovery 
and ﬁnancial stability.
ESAB
Early indications suggest that the general trends seen in the 
second half of 2010 have continued into early 2011. 
For the year as a whole, we expect higher consumables 
volumes compared to 2010, with strong growth in emerging 
markets but with a subdued performance in ESAB’s important 
European markets where growth is likely to be lower than it  
was in 2010. Growth will be stronger in solid welding wire  
as the vehicle segment remains strong. Construction and 
infrastructure markets in Europe will be slower to recover 
“ In 2010, Howden’s 
performance was ahead 
of previous expectations 
with excellent contract 
execution and continued 
aftermarket growth. We 
expect to see progressive 
improvement in 201 1 and 
onwards.”
Coal bed methane
Howden has been awarded a contract to supply 72 of  
its largest rotary twin screw compressors for a major  
coal bed methane project in Queensland, Australia.  
The compressors will be used to gather and compress 
coal bed methane which will then be converted to LNG 
and exported. Howden believes that there will be 
significant further opportunities for it to supply its 
compressors into other coal bed methane projects  
in Australia and elsewhere. Charter International plc

against the background of government austerity measures 
leading to reduced infrastructure investment. Overall, we expect 
markets to continue to strengthen but in a two-speed world 
with higher growth rates in BRIC and emerging markets and 
slower growth in developed markets, particularly Europe. 
Assuming the world economy continues to strengthen, market 
growth should be stronger in the second half of the year. 
Against this background, ESAB will beneﬁt from the continuing 
measures undertaken to improve its business, including new 
ranges of welding consumables and standard equipment, a 
much improved distribution network in Europe and a 
rationalised manufacturing footprint. The continued expansion 
into new geographies will enhance ESAB’s presence in 
emerging markets.
The cutting & automation segment returned to proﬁt in the 
second half of 2010 and we are looking forward to an improved 
result in 2011. Cutting has started the year with a positive trend 
in orders. In automation, the prospects are very strong and it is 
expected that customers will start placing orders by mid-year.
As importantly, ESAB will continue to re-position itself to be 
more customer focused, with a number of projects underway 
throughout the business aimed at simplifying the ways in which 
ESAB deals with its customers. ESAB has established business 
teams focused on particular regions, industries or processes. 
ESAB’s LEAN initiatives form a crucial part of the process to 
deliver consistent operational excellence and ‘best in class’ cost. 
Investment will continue in ESAB’s future development, with 
capital expenditure expected to remain in excess of depreciation. 
Additions to capacity will be selective and will support clear 
market opportunities. New products and leading edge product 
service offering will continue to be brought to market.
Howden
Overall, the year should improve progressively, with stronger 
economic activity in the second half particularly in the BRIC 
economies. We believe that Howden’s trading bottomed out 
during 2010 and that, in 2011 and onwards, we will start to see 
progressive improvement. In January 2011, Howden booked 
orders in excess of £70 million, taking the order book at the 
end of the month to over £470 million.
Howden is now a genuinely global company, with over half its 
revenues in emerging markets. The proportion derived from 
emerging markets is expected to progressively increase. 
The coal-ﬁred power industry remains Howden’s largest 
customer, although as Howden continues its diversiﬁcation,  
its relative importance will continue to reduce. Signiﬁcant new 
build programmes are expected to continue well into the  
future in China, India and South Africa, where Howden is well 
positioned. Russia will develop in the next few years and we 
have agreed in principle to enter into a joint venture with a 
leading supplier of equipment to the Russian power industry. 
Whilst we expect little new build in developed economies, the 
prospects for further installations of emission control equipment 
in the USA are improving. 
Howden has successfully grown its compressor business and 
is expected to continue to do so in 2011, as the high oil price 
encourages more capital expenditure in the energy industry, 
and as Howden continues to develop further applications  
for its compressors, with coal-bed methane being the 
outstanding example. 
Aftermarket growth of around 10 per cent continues to be 
expected, beneﬁting in particular from the Howden equipment 
installed in China in recent years. The aftermarket business  
is expected to continue to contribute around one-half of 
Howden’s gross proﬁt in the next few years. 
Howden’s pursuit of these opportunities will be supported by  
it maintaining its commitment to technological leadership and 
engineering excellence. Product development programmes are 
actively focused to enable the available market, particularly in 
compressors, to increase signiﬁcantly.
Concluding comments
In 2010, there was a recovery from the effects of the global 
recession. Whilst a number of regions and segments rebounded 
quickly, others, including some which are important to ESAB or 
Howden, remained at levels of activity well below those seen 
before the on-set of the recession. Against this background,  
we believe that both ESAB and Howden performed well. 
Despite the continuing economic uncertainties in Europe, 
further progress in 2011 is expected as a result of the on-going 
investment and improvements made in both businesses, with  
a faster pace in emerging markets. 
For the longer term, our conﬁdence in Charter’s ability to 
generate additional shareholder value is high. ESAB and 
Howden both have established strong market positions, spread 
across developed and emerging economies, which will beneﬁt 
from the rising demand for energy and increasing steel usage 
foreseen over the coming years.

We use a variety of ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial measures to assess 
the performance of our business.
During the year under review, the Company focused on the adjusted operating  
margin of both ESAB and Howden rather than on revenue as a key ﬁnancial  
measure as it believes that this measure provides greater visibility of the Company’s  
overall performance.
Adjusted operating proﬁt
Adjusted operating proﬁt measures the 
success we are having at increasing 
revenues net of increases in the cost  
of employees, goods and other services 
which we are incurring. We adjust operating 
proﬁt to exclude the impact of unusual or 
non-recurring items, such as restructuring 
costs, which we believe is appropriate to give 
a truer picture of underlying performance.
Performance
In 2010, adjusted operating proﬁt increased 
compared with 2009, as ESAB recovered 
well from the generally difﬁcult trading 
conditions which it encountered in 2009, 
whilst Howden’s proﬁt fell slightly.
Adjusted operating margin – ESAB
Adjusted operating margin measures the rate 
at which revenue changed relative to the rate 
at which adjusted operating proﬁt changed. 
Movements in ESAB’s margins reﬂect the 
cyclical nature of its business, longer term 
trends and also action taken to eliminate 
costs in 2009 as volumes and revenue fell. 
Performance
In 2010, ESAB’s adjusted operating margin 
was 7.7 per cent, which compares with 6.4 
per cent in 2009 and a recent high of 13.1 
per cent in 2007. We believe that, through  
the business cycle, ESAB is capable of 
generating an adjusted operating margin  
in excess of 10 per cent.
Adjusted operating margin – Howden
In recent years, Howden’s margins have 
been comparatively stable, reﬂecting the 
less cyclical nature of its business and 
Howden’s success at diversifying its 
business.  
 
Performance
In 2010, Howden’s adjusted operating  
margin was 12.1 per cent. We envisage 
Howden’s adjusted operating margin  
being between 11 and 12 per cent for  
the foreseeable future.
 
 
Howden order book
Howden’s order book gives good visibility of 
new equipment sales and also gross margin 
for the following 12 to 18 months. Movements 
in the order book can be used as a leading 
indicator of Howden’s performance relative  
to the market, and also to manage changes 
in capacity levels. 
Performance
At 31 December 2010, Howden’s order  
book stood at £424 million, compared with  
£441 million at 31 December 2009. The 
impact of this modest fall on the outlook for 
Howden’s business in 2011 is reduced by the 
expectation of further growth in aftermarket 
revenues.
Cash ﬂow from operations
We monitor cash ﬂow from operations, but  
in doing so, we set targets which recognise 
that, as businesses grow, they tend to 
absorb cash into working capital. Our 
measure of cash ﬂow from operations takes 
into account certain non-recurring items 
including expenditure on restructuring. 
 
Performance
During 2010, the amount of cash generated 
from operations fell as the recovery in ESAB’s 
business led to absorption of cash into 
working capital. It is a strategic objective  
to tighten ESAB’s working capital whilst 
continuing to grow its revenue and proﬁt.
Howden’s cash generation was in line  
with its adjusted operating proﬁt.  Charter International plc

Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share shows the  
net proﬁt generated for shareholders in an 
accounting period, after taking into account 
ﬁnancing and tax. The measure is deﬁned so 
as to exclude exceptional charges or income 
and other items considered by the Board to 
be not directly related to the underlying 
performance of our businesses. 
Performance
In 2010, adjusted earnings per share were 
66.1 pence, an increase of 20 per cent 
compared with 2009. Adjusted earnings  
per share increased strongly between 2006 
and 2008 but fell in 2009.
 
Equity shareholders’ funds
Equity shareholders’ funds reﬂect the value  
of net assets available to shareholders, and 
an increase in this measure means that 
Charter’s balance sheet and ﬁnancial  
position are strengthening.
Performance
As at 31 December 2010, equity 
shareholders’ funds stood at £635.7 million. 
Charter’s balance sheet has strengthened 
considerably over the last ﬁve years, with 
equity shareholders’ funds having more  
than doubled without any signiﬁcant  
issues of new shares.
Capital expenditure
The absolute level of capital expenditure and 
its relationship to the depreciation charge are 
indications of the extent to which Charter is 
maintaining and increasing in the productive 
capacity of its businesses.
Performance
Capital expenditure in 2010 was £62.5 million, 
representing 174 per cent of associated 
depreciation. It is estimated that capital 
expenditure needs to be at least 110 per cent 
of depreciation in order to maintain a steady 
state. Capital expenditure has been higher in 
ESAB than in Howden, reﬂecting in part their 
respective business models and relative sizes.
Research and development expenditure
Charter recognises that its technology is an 
important factor in maintaining the leadership 
of its products in the competitive markets in 
which it operates. Research and development 
expenditure is written off as incurred, except 
that certain development expenditure is 
capitalised as required by IAS 38.
Performance
Research and development expenditure has 
increased throughout the period. The majority 
of this expenditure has been in ESAB. Howden 
engineers bespoke solutions for particular 
customers’ air and gas handling requirements 
but this expenditure is generally not classiﬁed 
as ‘research and development’.
Lost time injury frequency rate
Charter recognises that ﬁnancial performance 
is not a sufﬁcient measure on its own. We 
operate in heavy engineering environments 
where there is considerable inherent risk and 
the safety of our employees is a key priority. 
We use a variety of measures, including  
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’),  
to assess the effectiveness of our health  
and safety performance.
Performance
LTIFR fell by over one-half during the  
period from 2007 to 2010 in which data has 
been systematically collected and veriﬁed, 
underlining Charter’s commitment to 
employee welfare. Further information on  
our health and safety performance is set  
out in the Corporate responsibility report  
on pages 30 to 35. Page heading (continued)

ESAB – “the welding authority”
ESAB is a world-leading international welding and cutting 
company, with a heritage in welding dating back to the 
invention of the welding process.
ESAB is the world’s premier welding brand, with its  
brand values emphasising integrity, innovation, experience  
and partnership. 
ESAB is the clear market leader in Europe, South America  
and India, and is amongst the top four welding companies in 
North America. It is the largest international welding company  
in Russia and is developing its market positions in Africa, the 
Middle East, China and elsewhere in Asia. ESAB’s sales are 
split broadly evenly between the developed economies of 
Western Europe and North America, and emerging markets. 
ESAB’s comprehensive range of welding consumables includes 
electrodes, cored and solid wires, and ﬂuxes. ESAB’s welding 
and cutting equipment ranges from standard equipment to 
large bespoke plant used in industrial applications.
In 2010, ESAB derived over 80 per cent of its sales from 
welding consumables and standard welding equipment.  
The energy sector, including oil and gas, nuclear and 
renewables, is the largest user of ESAB products and is 
estimated to account for around one-quarter of revenue.
ESAB’s leadership of the worldwide welding industry is 
conﬁrmed by independent research which has shown that  
the ‘ESAB’ brand is almost universally recognised, and is  
the one which customers are most likely to recommend. 
ESAB’s position is supported by continued investment in 
research and product development which is highly focused  
on speciﬁc customer requirements. During 2010, there were 
important new products and processes introduced for users  
in the vehicle industry and in the off-shore and wind-tower 
segments of the energy industry. In addition, ESAB’s world-
leading technical expertise enabled it to establish strong 
positions in more recently established markets, for example  
the supply of specialist consumables for the construction of 
LNG facilities and nuclear power stations in China, as well as 
reinforcing its traditional areas of strength.
ESAB’s manufacturing facilities are located predominantly  
in low cost locations, in particular in Central Europe, South 
America and Asia. During 2010, capacity was progressively 
restored as levels of demand recovered, most notably in its 
consumables business. 
Market size and end-user segments
In 2010, the global welding and cutting industry had total 
revenue estimated at $13.6 billion; this compares with  
$12.8 billion in 2009, reﬂecting recovery from the economic 
downturn in developed economies and continuing economic 
growth in emerging markets. The market is divided 
approximately equally between welding consumables  
and welding and cutting equipment. 
The major global end-user segments are as follows:
    the energy sector, which includes the oil and gas industries 
and electricity generation (from conventional, nuclear and 
renewable sources) and transmission (estimated to account 
for 26 per cent of industry revenue);
   vehicles, which includes cars, commercial vehicles, ‘off road’ 
vehicles and railway rolling stock (15 per cent); and 
   construction, in particular relating to infrastructure (24 per cent).
General industrial users are estimated to account for  
26 per cent of the industry’s revenues and shipbuilding  
for the remaining 9 per cent.
During 2010, the outstanding end-user segment was vehicles, 
with strong growth being seen in the production of cars in all 
regions. Commercial vehicles also showed strong recovery 
from 2009 levels. This led to signiﬁcant increases in the volume 
of welding wire sold, with ESAB gaining market share in the key  
European market, assisted by innovations in solid wire process 
and further enhancements to its ﬂagship ‘AristoRod’ product.
Demand from the energy industry was generally solid. However, 
there was relative weakness in the wind-tower and off-shore 
segments, both of which are important users of ESAB’s  
higher value-added consumables and automation equipment, 
reﬂecting general economic uncertainty and ﬁnancing 
constraints which led to postponing of projects, although the 
long-term prospects of both segments remain strong. 
Shipbuilding was generally weak, although there were pockets 
of strength. Construction deteriorated in many European 
countries. The mixed performance of these industries meant 
that demand for electrodes lagged the growth seen in  
solid wire. Charter International plc

Demand outlook
Demand for welding and cutting products is predominantly 
determined by the consumption of steel. Information on historic 
and future levels of steel consumption is set out above.
Against this background, ESAB expects that growth in the 
demand for its welding consumables and standard equipment 
will also slow compared with 2010. Demand for its cutting and 
automated welding equipment is seen as later-cycle, and the 
improving prospects seen during the second half of 2010  
should be reﬂected in higher revenues in 2011. 
ESAB’s demand environment will vary from region to region.  
In the EU, economic growth is generally expected to be around 
1 per cent in 2011, but certain economies, such as Germany 
and Poland, are expected to grow appreciably faster, whilst 
others, mainly in Southern Europe, are expected to see little  
if any growth. The USA is expected to see growth running 
around its trend rate of 2.5 per cent. Developing economies, 
including Brazil, India and Russia where ESAB is well 
represented, are expected to grow more quickly.
ESAB is also impacted by the relative performance of the 
different end-user segments which its supplies. In 2011, ESAB 
expects to see continued growth in the vehicle segment, 
although not necessarily at the rates seen in 2010, whilst there 
are as yet no clear signs that segments such as off-shore and 
wind-towers, which are important users of higher value welding 
consumables but which were relatively subdued in 2010, will 
show a sustained recovery.
Competitive environment
Globally, ESAB is the leading supplier of welding consumables.  
It is the only worldwide, full-service welding and cutting company, 
with leading market positions in many regions. 
ESAB operates in a competitive environment, consisting  
of a relatively small number of companies that operate on a 
multinational basis and a much larger number of smaller 
companies which operate in regional or product niches. 
ESAB estimates that it has a 12 per cent share, by value, of the 
available global welding and cutting market. This share reﬂects 
The World Steel Association (‘WSA’) estimates that worldwide 
consumption of steel in 2010 was 1,272 mmt (2009: 1,125 mmt), 
an increase of 13.1 per cent.
For 2011, the WSA forecasts that global steel consumption  
will be 1,340 mmt, an increase of 5.3 per cent. Consumption  
in EU (27) and the USA is expected to increase by 6 per cent 
and 9 per cent respectively compared to 2010 but will remain 
well below 2008 levels. The growth of steel consumption  
in China is forecast to slow to 4 per cent.
Strategy
ESAB’s strategic objective is to generate signiﬁcant growth in revenue and proﬁt over the next ﬁve years through  
building upon its position as the world’s leading company in welding consumables and its strong global positions  
in welding and cutting equipment. In pursuit of this strategic objective, ESAB has formulated speciﬁc objectives  
as set out below.
Objective
   To enhance market leadership by leveraging its broad 
product range in all its markets globally as well as by further 
investment in brand recognition and customer service.
   To use its research and development facilities to develop 
highly customer-focused products to enhance its leading 
position in welding technology.
   To build upon its leading position in Europe and other 
developed markets to achieve growth at above market rates.
   ESAB will continue to build upon its positions in developing 
markets around the world. 
 
 
   ESAB will target specifically welding-intensive end-user 
segments which are seen as offering particular growth 
opportunities.
   ESAB will look to act as a consolidator in the global welding 
industry.
What we’ve achieved 
   ESAB continues to be recognised as the welding authority 
with, according to independent research, almost universal 
brand recognition in the welding industry.
   ESAB has developed new welding materials processes and 
equipment with particular examples for use in the automotive 
and energy industries.
   ESAB increased its market share in solid wire by 4 percentage 
points and continued to invest in its supply infrastructure.
   ESAB remains the clear market leader in South America 
and India. It continues to grow in Russia where it is the 
leading international welding company, and to develop its 
presence in China and other markets in Asia, and elsewhere, 
such as Africa.
   ESAB has built up specialist teams to service customers 
in industries such as nuclear, wind energy, off-shore  
and vehicles.
   ESAB will continue to target acquisitions which enable it 
to strengthen market positions, enter new markets and 
improve its technology base. Charter International plc

under-weight position in China, where the market is intensely 
price competitive and a small number of producers account for 
over one-half of total industry sales of welding consumables. 
ESAB aims to maintain and progressively strengthen its global 
market share, despite the threat of low cost manufacturers 
looking to increase their shares of markets in which ESAB has 
an established position, through continued investment in and 
attention to:
   its brand;
   its industry-leading technology;
    its extensive product portfolio covering consumables 
and equipment;
    the governmental and other certiﬁcations it possesses 
for many different specialist and demanding applications;
    its manufacturing facilities which are generally well-invested 
and located in low cost areas;
   its well-established and wide-ranging distribution network 
and supply chain; and
   the ﬁnancial strength of Charter. 
ESAB aims to be a consolidator in the relatively fragmented 
worldwide welding industry and will look to make acquisitions 
which build its geographic strength, increase its presence in 
markets where it is currently under-represented or give access 
to new technologies, provided that the terms of the acquisition 
are expected to be value accretive for Charter shareholders.

During 2010, ESAB achieved revenue and adjusted 
operating profit of £1,157.6 million and £89.3 million (2009: 
£1,031.4 million and £66.0 million), representing increases 
of 12.2 and 35.3 per cent respectively. The adjusted 
operating margin was 7.7 per cent (2009 6.4 per cent). 
During 2010, the increase in ESAB’s revenues was driven 
by the welding division in which revenue increased by  
19.9 per cent, but this was partly offset by the cutting  
& automation segment. The increase in revenue in the 
welding division was primarily attributable to higher 
volumes of consumbles which rose 15 per cent during  
the year, with price movements leading to a small  
positive variance.

Howden (continued)
Howden – a world leading  
applications engineer
Howden’s engineering heritage stretches back over 150 years 
since it was founded in Glasgow, Scotland. Howden became  
a member of the Charter group of companies in 1997. 
Howden’s principal products are fans, heat exchangers and 
compressors. The fans and heat exchangers are used mainly  
in the generation of electricity by coal-ﬁred power stations,  
both in combustion and the control of emissions, and other 
large scale industrial plant. Howden compressors are mainly 
used by the oil, gas and petrochemical industries. Overall, the 
energy sector is estimated to account for some two-thirds of 
Howden’s revenues. 
Other applications for Howden products are in the mining,  
iron and steel, tunnel ventilation and waste water industries.
As illustrated on page 22, Howden has made considerable 
progress in diversifying its business away from its traditional 
markets.
The supply of new equipment to the coal-ﬁred power industry 
represented 24 per cent of Howden’s revenue in 2010, 
compared to 42 per cent in 2005. The supply of other new 
equipment, including fans for use in other industries and 
compressors, has increased in both absolute terms and as  
a proportion of Howden’s revenue.
Howden now has signiﬁcant market positions in Europe, North 
America, China, South Africa and Australia. During 2010, 
Howden signiﬁcantly increased its presence in India, and also 
opened a much enhanced factory in Brazil. Overall, around 
one-half of Howden’s sales are made in emerging markets and 
this proportion is expected to progressively increase over time.
Howden has also successfully grown its aftermarket business, 
which, in 2010, accounted for 36 per cent of revenue and, 
because of the higher margin which it generates, nearly 
one-half of gross proﬁt. The aftermarket is seen as one aspect 
of Howden’s business which can grow consistently through the 
economic cycle. 
Industry overview
Fans and heat exchangers
Demand for new Howden equipment is strongly inﬂuenced  
by the construction of new coal-ﬁred power stations and 
environmental legislation which impacts demand for emission 
control equipment for coal-ﬁred power stations and other  
heavy industrial plant. 
The International Energy Agency (‘IEA’) expects, under its 
‘current policies’ model, that worldwide construction of new 
coal-ﬁred generating plant will average 56 GW per annum over 
the next 20 years, of which more than half will be built in China. 
India is also expected to add signiﬁcantly to its coal-ﬁred 
generating capacity. Howden has established leading positions 
in both China and India and is therefore well placed to supply 
signiﬁcant amounts of new-build equipment over this period.
For Europe and North America, the IEA expects little change  
in the aggregate ﬂeet of coal-ﬁred generating capacity for the 
foreseeable future. On this basis, Howden expects most work 
in these regions to be retroﬁts, upgrades and maintenance. 
There is some expectation of signiﬁcant new build activity in 
Russia, although not in the immediate future.
Governments generally recognise the need to limit the 
environmental impact of generating plant. If there were to be 
concerted international action to restrict the emission of carbon 
dioxide, this would reduce the rate at which new coal-ﬁred power 
plant is constructed. It could also require increased adoption of 
carbon capture and storage, which is an emerging technology 
which represents a new opportunity for Howden. 
In relation to other emissions, uncertainty over the policies to be 
adopted and the nature and timing of legislation somewhat 
slowed the market for Howden’s emission control equipment 
during 2010. In the USA, new regulations governing the 
emission of polluting gases are expected and, when they come 
into force, are likely to lead to increased demand for Howden 
fans and heat exchangers as utility companies install additional 
exhaust gas scrubbers. In the EU, the previous deadline of 
2016 for NOx reduction from large power plants has been 
relaxed, meaning that utilities will be able to defer the placing of 
orders for this equipment.
In May 2010, Howden signed  
a joint venture agreement with 
Larsen & Toubro, a major Indian 
engineering and construction 
company, that will give it greater 
access to the rapidly growing 
power generation market  
in India.
Under the agreement, Howden 
and L&T will collaborate in the 
supply of fans and heat 
exchangers to customers  
in India engaged in the 
construction of coal-fired power 
stations. A new manufacturing 
facility is being constructed in 
Hazira, Gujarat and this is 
expected to start production  
by the end of the year. Charter International plc

(%)
Other large scale industrial plant which uses Howden fans and 
heaters includes reﬁneries, steel mills and cement factories. 
Construction of this plant is expected to be concentrated in 
emerging markets. In addition, Howden fans are used to 
ventilate sub-surface mines and tunnels, and also for 
specialised cooling applications, such as the traction  
motors of high-speed trains. 
Compressors
The compressor industry is large and covers many different 
applications. Howden has developed various niches for its 
range of compressors.
Howden compressors are mainly sold into the oil and gas,  
petrochemical and refrigeration industries. Howden’s order 
bookings and sales stand to beneﬁt from higher levels of  
capital expenditure forecast in other industries.
Howden has also successfully penetrated other growing 
markets for its products, most particularly, the coal-bed 
methane industry in Australia. These also include waste-water 
treatment, where Howden has recently won a major order to 
supply compressors for what will be Turkey’s largest facility,  
and the manufacture of solar panels.
Howden compressors are supplied to customers worldwide, 
with notable sales having been made to customers in Europe, 
China, the Middle East and South America. 
Strategy
Howden’s strategic objective is to generate signiﬁcant growth in revenue and proﬁt over the next ﬁve years through 
building upon its current world-leading position as an applications engineer which designs, manufactures, installs  
and maintains performance-critical equipment for air and gas handling.
Objective
   Howden will maintain and enhance its position in all those 
regions where there is expected to be significant amounts  
of coal-fired generating capacity and related emission  
control equipment being used or installed.
   As part of its objective of reducing its dependence on 
coal-fired power, Howden will develop further its position in 
the oil and gas and petrochemicals industries. 
   Howden will also develop new products and services to enter 
growth industries where its technology and expertise  
can be used to its advantage.
   Howden will continue to develop its aftermarket business, 
in particular in China. 
 
   Where appropriate, Howden will grow its business through 
acquisitions that strengthen its market position and improve 
its technology base. 
   Howden will continue to develop its supply chain to 
accommodate higher levels of activity in both new  
equipment and aftermarket.
What we’ve achieved 
   Howden already has strong market positions in Europe, 
China, North America and South Africa, and during 2010  
it significantly increased its market position in India. 
   Howden has continued to enhance its position in the 
compressor industry and has won notable new orders, for 
example to supply compressors to the coal-bed methane 
market in Australia.
   Howden has increased its presence in bio-fuels, solar energy 
and waste-water treatment industries. 
   In 2010, Howden’s aftermarket revenues were £204.0 
million, an increase of 8 per cent, representing 36 per cent of 
Howden’s total revenues. The aftermarket business in China 
continued to grow and achieved its objectives for the year.
   During 2010, Howden acquired Austcold, a screw 
compressor packager, which increases its presence in 
the compressor industry in Australia and South-East Asia. 
Howden continues to review other acquisition opportunities.
   Howden has increased plant utilisation, undertaken capital 
expenditure on plant expansion and IT, continued initiatives to 
ensure that it has access to sufficient trained engineers, and 
extended use of LEAN techniques across all aspects of its 
business. Howden is continuing to develop a global network 
of sub-contractors.
Over the last ﬁve years, Howden has successfully diversiﬁed 
away from coal-ﬁred power into other businesses. In 2010,  
24 per cent of revenue came from the sale of new equipment 
to the coal-ﬁred power industry, of which slightly over half was 
to customers in China and other emerging markets, whereas  
in 2005 this ﬁgure was 42 per cent. In 2010, the sale of new 
compressors generated 13 per cent of revenue, and the 
aftermarket accounted for 36 per cent of revenue and 
approximately one-half of gross proﬁt. Charter International plc

Aftermarket
Each delivery of Howden equipment creates a potential 
aftermarket revenue stream over the operating life of the 
equipment which is typically 30 to 40 years for fans. Generally, 
a piece of equipment starts to generate meaningful aftermarket 
revenues some four to six years after its installation. The 
prospects for Howden’s aftermarket business in China, where 
signiﬁcant amounts of new equipment have been installed in 
recent years, are seen as being particularly strong. 
Aftermarket services are provided by Howden to the equipment 
operator (usually an electricity utility in the case of the power 
industry). Whilst there is generally no contractual obligation on 
the operator to employ Howden to provide aftermarket services  
on equipment which it originally supplied, Howden believes  
that it is able to optimise the long-term performance of  
equipment which it continues to service. Howden also  
provides aftermarket services on equipment supplied  
by other manufacturers. 
Competitive environment
Howden is the world’s leading supplier of engineered fans to 
the power and other specialised markets that it serves. It is the 
only truly global company in the industry, with its competitors 
tending to be regionally based. The strength of its market 
position is based on the accumulated technical expertise  
which it has built up over many years, which is reﬂected in  
the strength of its brand, and also the cost-effectiveness of  
its product offering and its customer service. In addition to its 
strong global position, Howden is one of three market leaders  
in China, where it has been established for many years. 
Howden’s participation in the compressor industry is built 
around strong positions in a number of specialised niches, 
including being one of the ﬁve leading worldwide suppliers  
of process gas screw compressors for use in the oil and  
gas industry.
Howden’s share of the aftermarket varies between regions.  
In some locations, such as the United Kingdom and Southern 
Africa, where Howden supplied a high proportion of the original 
equipment, and Australia, where recent new build activity has 
been low, its share is relatively high. In China, Howden is aiming 
to capture a signiﬁcant proportion of aftermarket business on 
the equipment it has installed in recent years.
As at 31 December 2010, the order book stood at  
£424 million (31 December 2009: £441 million), a decrease  
of 4 per cent. Customers in emerging markets accounted for 
60 per cent of total orders.
The order book at 31 December 2010 included some £331 
million for delivery in 2011 and £93 million for delivery in 2012 
or beyond. 
Net orders booked in the year were £533 million (2009: £503 
million), an increase of 6 per cent, and in excess of £70 million 
of orders were booked in January 2011.
During 2010, Howden achieved revenue and adjusted 
operating profit of £562.0 million and £67.8 million (2009: 
£627.8 million and £71.5 million), representing decreases 
of 10.5 and 5.2 per cent respectively. 
The adjusted operating margin was 12.1 per cent (2009: 
11.4 per cent), an increase of 0.7 percentage points.
During 2010, the decline in Howden’s revenue was due to 
lower sales of new equipment, which fell by 18 per cent to 
£358 million, reflecting the lower order book at the start of 
the year. Aftermarket revenues increased by 8 per cent to 
£204 million, and as such represented 36 per cent of 
Howden’s total revenue. There was a small impact on 
revenue from currency factors.

Trading results
A detailed review of the trading results for the year is set out in the Chief Executive’s statement. 
Basic and adjusted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 63.9 pence (2009: 38.1 pence). Adjusted earnings per share were 66.1 pence (2009: 55.0 pence). A 
reconciliation between basic and adjusted earnings per share is set out in note 9 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 79.
Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude items not relating to underlying business performance, are considered to provide a better 
indication of Charter’ s underlying performance. The items excluded are exceptional items, amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangibles and goodwill, acquisition costs, the non-cash net ﬁnancing costs attributable to retirement beneﬁt obligations and 
exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including in each case attributable tax and non-controlling interests.
Net exceptional costs in the year were £1.5 million, comprising restructuring costs of £9.9 million, of which £8.3 million relates to 
ESAB and £1.6 million relates to Howden, and a curtailment gain on cessation of certain US post employment medical beneﬁts in 
ESAB of £8.4 million. In 2011, it is anticipated that there will be a further charge in respect of the restructuring of ESAB.
Amortisation and impairment of acquired goodwill and intangibles in the year was £5.8 million and includes an impairment charge 
of £3.2 million against the balance sheet carrying value of the Romar brand due to increasing sales by Romar under the ESAB 
brand. Amortisation of acquired goodwill and intangibles was £2.6 million in the year, of which £1.4 million relates to ESAB and 
£1.2 million relates to Howden. Charter International plc

The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to remain at a similar level in the medium term.
The total tax charge in the year of £25.2 million compares with tax paid of £36.5 million. The tax charge is lower than the actual 
tax paid in the year primarily due to the net recognition of additional deferred tax assets in the year and the settlement of prior 
year tax liabilities.

If the average rates of exchange in 2010 had prevailed in 2009, revenue and adjusted operating proﬁt for 2009 would have been 
higher by £47.8 million (2.9 per cent) and £7.5 million (6.0 per cent), respectively. However, this is only the translation impact of 
currency movements. It excludes the impact of currency movements on transactions when products are manufactured in one 
currency zone and sold in another. The transaction impact of currency movements is not believed to have had a signiﬁcant impact 
on the results for the year. 
Trading results and cash ﬂows of overseas operations have been converted into sterling at average rates of exchange whereas 
the balance sheets were converted at period-end rates. The most signiﬁcant rates used were as follows:

Cash ﬂow from operations during the year generated £85.5 million (2009: £171.5 million), representing cash conversion of  
61.8 per cent (2009: 178.6 per cent) of operating proﬁt. 
Cash, borrowings and facilities
The net cash balance at 31 December 2010 of £1.8 million comprised cash balances of £83.3 million (31 December 2009:  
£75.6 million), and gross borrowings of £81.5 million (31 December 2009: £24.7 million). Certain amounts of cash were held in 
various overseas jurisdictions for local working capital purposes or pending dividend payments and the remainder was held with  
a range of banks in the United Kingdom. The credit status of institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits 
being set and monitored accordingly. 
At 31 December 2010, in addition to net cash balances of £1.8 million, Charter had undrawn centrally-held committed borrowing 
facilities of £116.0 million. These facilities, which total £170.0 million, are due to expire (unless otherwise extended or renewed) 
between 2011 and 2013. Two of these facilities have been renewed since the year-end such that the total amount of facilities has 
increased to £185.0 million. One facility for £25.0 million is due to expire in 2011. The remaining facilities of £160.0 million have 
maturity dates that range between 2012 and 2015. All these facilities are unsecured. Whilst these facilities have certain ﬁnancial 
and other covenants, the ﬁnancial strength of Charter means that the covenants attaching to these facilities are not expected to 
prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required. 
In addition, various other subsidiary undertakings have uncommitted and committed bank facilities in place, some of which are 
secured, to meet local funding requirements. 
At 31 December 2010, Charter had £282.7 million of uncommitted bonding facilities, of which £141.1 million were provided by its 
principal bankers. Bonds and guarantees totalling £120.7 million had been issued under these facilities. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing both the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the ﬁnancial statements of the Company.
In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered carefully the risks to Charter’s trading performance and cash ﬂows as  
a result of the current global economic and ﬁnancial environment. The Directors have also had regard to Charter’s operating plan 
and budget for 2011 and have considered the principal risks and uncertainities to which Charter is exposed.
The Directors monitor the expected outturn for the full year on an ongoing basis both in terms of proﬁt and cash and appropriate 
mitigating action would be taken if it became apparent that there was a risk that Charter might miss its previous forecasts. 
Signiﬁcant accounting policies
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the accounting policies set out in note 1 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 65. Applying accounting policies requires the use of certain judgements, assumptions 
and estimates. The following accounting policies have been identiﬁed as being the most signiﬁcant and where there is most risk of 
material adjustment to the carrying value of Charter’s assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year:
   goodwill impairment;
   construction contracts;
   deferred tax;
   warranty and legal liabilities; and
   retirement beneﬁts. Charter International plc

Risks
Risks and uncertainties
Charter, both directly and through ESAB and Howden, is exposed to a wide variety of markets and geographies and seeks to 
manage the risks and uncertainties that arise from this. Charter manages these risks on a continuous basis via processes of 
identiﬁcation, evaluation, reporting and monitoring. 
Risk reporting is carried out quarterly across the businesses at a regional level and the Board reviews the principal risks that have 
been identiﬁed by the businesses every six months.
In certain instances, and where it is cost-effective to do so, exposures are transferred to third parties, for example through 
insurance or currency hedging.
The table below identiﬁes the principal risks and uncertainties faced by Charter, and the management response taken to minimise 
the adverse effects against the Company. It is possible, given the nature of risk, that other risks may arise, or risks not considered 
currently as ‘principal risks’ may become so in the future. 
Principal risks
Economic uncertainty
Changes in the global economic 
environment could have a negative  
impact on ﬁnancial performance and 
strategic growth. 
Management response
–  Increasingly ﬂexible business model with a global manufacturing base, 
mainly in low cost countries, supplying a wide range of industrial end-users, 
with expanding geographical coverage and being responsive to diverging 
requirements of different regions.
–  Restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and improve efﬁciencies including: 
supply chain rationalisation in both ESAB and Howden, R&D consolidation  
in ESAB’s equipment business and the creation of a shared service centre  
for ESAB Europe.
Actions of competitors 
Exposure to aggressive pricing behaviour  
of competitors seeking to enter new 
markets, maintain sales or increase  
sales in weakening markets.
 
–  Maintaining and growing market-leading positions based on brand, technology 
leadership and customer service. 
–  Continual review of competition and market trends. 
–  ESAB has an extensive product portfolio in both consumables and equipment; 
R&D is directed towards maintaining a technological lead; consumable product 
certiﬁcation for different specialist and demanding applications; generally 
modern facilities in low cost areas with teams following established LEAN 
techniques; well established and wide-ranging distributor network.
–  Howden’s in-house manufacturing is undertaken at centres of excellence with 
signiﬁcant use of sub-contractors generally located in low cost areas; increasing 
resources to pursue aftermarket opportunities globally; reducing dependency on  
new coal-ﬁred power generation by growing compressor business.
 
Raw material prices
Products manufactured by ESAB and 
Howden contain steel or other metals 
whose prices are generally determined  
on world markets, which ﬂuctuate 
unpredictably and with regional 
differences.
 
–  Strengthening procurement structure and supply chain management. 
–  ESAB aims to optimise its purchasing and selling prices in a market where prices 
generally follow steel costs.
–  Howden make use of forward purchase contracts to lock in margins on orders  
from customers.
Changing technology 
Customers transfer to automated welding 
processes faster than anticipated with 
consequent change in mix and price from  
higher margin stick electrodes to lower  
margin solid wires.
 
–  Developing an efﬁcient, consistent, best practice supply chain.
–  Continuing with LEAN manufacturing programmes and focused capital 
expenditure to reduce manufacturing cost of solid wires.
–  Increase supply of higher margin stainless steel wires. Charter International plc

Capital structure and ﬁnancing
Excessive gearing or lack of sufﬁcient 
ﬁnance on acceptable terms could  
hinder the funding of future growth  
and investment.
Human resources
Failure to attract, motivate, develop 
and retain key employees could restrict 
Charter’s achievement of strategic goals.
 
–  Maintaining a strong balance sheet by ensuring that the ratio of net debt  
to underlying EBITDA remains within a maximum of 1.0 when considering 
business projections and acquisition opportunities.
–  Committed credit facilities are maintained on acceptable terms to provide 
sufﬁcient headroom on top of medium-term projections of business 
requirements. Facilities are negotiated on a bilateral basis with overlapping 
maturities to mitigate the risk of short-term unfavourable market conditions.
–  Charter offers competitive beneﬁts packages within the regions that it operates. 
–  Annual succession planning and performance management for key executives  
is reviewed by the Board. 
–  Howden operates the Howden Academy, a partnership with Glasgow 
Caledonian University, to attract new engineers to its operations.
–  ESAB operates the ESAB University which focuses on developing leadership 
and technical abilities.
Legal and regulatory
Charter is subject to the laws and 
regulations of many jurisdictions including 
regulations relating to anti-bribery and 
corruption, competition law, tax and 
export controls. Non-compliance with 
laws, regulations and restrictions could 
expose the Company to ﬁnes, penalties, 
suspension or debarment, which could 
have a material adverse effect on its 
reputational and ﬁnancial position.  
In addition, Charter, ESAB and Howden  
are subject to litigation and other forms  
of legal actions in the ordinary course  
of their business.
 
 
–  Charter has a code of conduct applicable to all employees across its companies, 
which is supported by additional policies including a whistleblowing policy.
–  Charter’s legal and company secretarial functions, together with advisers as 
appropriate, monitor legal and regulatory requirements across the jurisdictions  
in which the Company operates to ensure that appropriate procedures are  
in place.
–  A Charter Compliance Ofﬁcer was appointed during the year and a number 
of initiatives have been implemented to respond to new or updated laws and 
regulations including the UK Bribery Act 2010 anticipated to come into force 
during 2011.
Product quality
Failure to maintain high standards of 
quality could affect ESAB and Howden’s 
ability to maintain their reputation and 
could lead to potential liabilities for defects 
in products or warranty claims.
 
–  Maintaining existing product certiﬁcations from a range of different authorities, in 
particular for products used in high risk areas such as the nuclear market sector.
–  Extending local product quality management systems to a full ESAB Group 
certiﬁcate.
–  Continuing a dialogue with key customers to ensure that products meet their 
requirements and complaints are dealt with expeditiously. 
–  Maintaining product liability insurance (including cover for reworking welds)  
as well as appropriate protection from contractual terms.
Pension funding
Signiﬁcant increases in the funding 
obligation in respect of post-retirement 
beneﬁt schemes in place across Charter, 
ESAB and Howden.
 
–  The majority of ﬁnal salary schemes are closed to new entrants, future accrual 
and salary increases, limiting the potential liability.
–  Maintain strong covenant of the employing company.
–  The assets that are held by the various schemes are invested by the Trustees 
primarily in equities and bonds to spread the risk.
–  Periodic negotiations between the pension trustees and the relevant subsidiaries 
to determine cash contribution levels.

Corporate responsibility report 
Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 30
1. Approach and governance
The Board considers social, environmental and ethical matters 
in the context of the overall business environment. Charter is 
committed to understanding and managing responsibly 
signiﬁcant risks to the environment and the communities in 
which it has a presence and where it has operational control  
or signiﬁcant inﬂuence. They are managed as part of the overall 
corporate governance and risk management framework.  
Charter’s policies and management approach can be seen in 
the Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) section of the Charter 
website www.charter.ie.
The operational heads of all Charter businesses have 
responsibility for implementing the policies and are accountable 
for CR performance. CR is being integrated within risk 
management practices. The Head of Risk Management has an 
overall coordinating role in areas of CR to improve the sharing 
of best practice, collection of data and consistency of reporting.
The Board and the senior management receive a monthly 
performance report on environmental, health and safety (‘EHS’) 
performance and formal reviews of major risks are undertaken 
by the senior management (quarterly) and by the Board (every 
six months). These include consideration of the signiﬁcance of 
environmental, social and governance matters to the business.
In 2010 Charter re-organised its public reporting on corporate 
responsibility to bring it in line with the management structure  
of ESAB and Howden. The Charter website (www.charter.ie) 
therefore presents the top-level approach, policies and 
performance review, whilst the Howden and ESAB websites will 
in future be presenting more detail on speciﬁc aspects relating 
to their businesses.
Charter’s Code of Conduct was re-communicated in 2010, 
along with its policies on Anti Bribery and Corruption, and  
Equal Opportunities.
2. Environmental, health and safety
a. Management approach
Responsibility for environmental, health and safety performance 
rests with the management of Howden and ESAB. Charter 
requires compliance with its EHS Policy, which was re-issued in 
2009, as well as implementation of EHS management systems 
that are externally certiﬁed. In 2010, ESAB maintained its 
group-wide ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation, and 
ensured that Terni, a consumables factory in Italy that was 
acquired in 2009, also complied with these. Howden extended 
ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation to all its 
manufacturing locations with the exception of a new factory in 
Brazil, which became operational in October 2010. Certiﬁcation 
is expected at this factory in the ﬁrst half of 2011. 
Charter has also established a core set of EHS Key Performance 
Indicators (‘KPIs’) – for safety, energy, greenhouse gas emissions 
and waste. The Board and the senior management receive a 
monthly summary of EHS performance worldwide, presenting 
KPI data, including lost time injury cases, any signiﬁcant 
unplanned environmental releases or infringements, results of 
incident analyses and corrective actions taken. It also reports 
the number of near misses, progress on key activities and  
plans for the next quarter, enabling issues most relevant to  
the business to be prioritised and resources to be focused. 
b. Compliance and incidents
During 2010 no major on-site environmental incidents  
were reported. 
ESAB North America’s Hanover facility received a penalty 
totalling $7.35k (£4.6k) following an OSHA (Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration) inspection in April. The seven 
citations have all been complied with. 
Following a visit by the Ohio EPA (Environmental Protection 
Agency) to Howden North America’s New Philadelphia facility, 
discussions ensued with regard to what permits were required 
for the paint spraying operations. A penalty of $110k (£59k) 
was paid as a result of the historic failure to maintain all 
requisite permits and operations altered to restrict future  
paint usage to ensure full compliance. 
No other ﬁnes or penalties relating to environmental or health 
and safety matters were reported by any Charter companies 
during the year.
c. Regulatory issues
Charter Limited is registered as a full participant in the  
UK’s Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy  
Efﬁciency Scheme.
d. Safety performance
During 2010 ESAB regrets that one of its employees was killed 
in a road accident in Mexico, whilst travelling from his home 
ofﬁce to the Monterrey facility on 19 July. There were no on-site 
fatalities during the year.
Charter set targets in 2009 for improvements in safety 
performance. The table on the next page summarises the 
targets and how Charter performed and the Company is very 
pleased to have exceeded all the targets set.
Michigan OSHA awarded AlcoTec Wire Corporation  
(a subsidiary of ESAB) a Platinum Award, the highest  
award a company can receive for achieving outstanding 
safety and health performance and implementing an 
effective safety and health management system. Charter International plc

Since 2008, Charter has been encouraging sites to report all 
ﬁrst aid injuries, near misses and unsafe conditions to enable 
actions to be taken before more serious injuries occur. In 2010 
10,195 such incidents were reported, more than doubling the 
2009 ﬁgure. 
The safety data above refers to employees only. Charter also 
records and investigates lost time injuries to contractors, of 
which there were six reported in 2010.
e. Health and safety awards and recognitions
Howden’s UK Construction and Maintenance Division retained 
its British Safety Council 5-star rating for its safety practices on 
customers’ sites. 
Since 2007 the total number of lost time injuries (any injury that 
results in an employee being unable to return to work the following 
shift/day) has fallen from 232 to 99 in 2010, a 53.3 per cent 
decrease. The hours worked have increased during the same period 
resulting in the frequency rate, which is calculated per 200,000 
hours worked, falling from 2.31 to 0.79, a 65.9 per cent decrease. 
In order to continue to maintain this downward trend, work has 
been gathering pace on developing a safety culture aimed at 
achieving zero lost time injuries. Charter’ s aim is to embed 
consistent, visible leadership and commitment from all employees, 
such that they are mindful of EHS matters, including responsibility 
for their own personal safety as well as protecting their co-workers 
and others who could be affected by our operations.
Charter continues to invest in employee training and is  
planning to extend leadership training and safety observation 
programmes beyond North America where they have been 
piloted. These programmes have become an important factor 
in improving performance.
Since 2007 the total number of days lost as a result of injuries 
has fallen from 5,718 to 3,153 in 2010, a 49.5 per cent decrease. 
Weekends and holidays are included within this total. The 
severity rate, calculated per 200,000 hours worked has fallen 
from 57.1 to 25.3, a decrease of 55.7 per cent. However, during 
2010 the rate of improvement has decreased for various reasons.
A key contributing factor to the decreasing rate of improvement 
in the severity rate is the long absence from work associated 
with musculoskeletal injuries, an issue which has not, so far, 
been tackled as successfully as others. There are also wide 
variations in the way injured workers are treated in the various 
countries where Charter has operations, which can affect the 
ease of rehabilitation. 
Where Charter can inﬂuence severity performance, action is 
being taken. For example, Charter has already completed a 
£1million capital expenditure project on a semi-automated 
packaging line for 50lb cans of electrodes in ESAB Hanover 
USA. Further ergonomic programmes are planned for 2011.

Annual Report 2010 32
f. Environmental performance
To measure the impact of its operations on the environment, 
Charter uses as KPIs energy consumption and greenhouse gas 
(‘GHG’) emissions, for both direct and indirect energy usage, 
and waste sent to landﬁll. To provide an indication of changes 
in the environmental efﬁciency of our operations the KPIs are 
normalised by turnover.
ESAB also has the volume of water used in its operations as  
a KPI and report their performance on their website. Since 
Howden do not use water in production processes, it is not set 
as a KPI for them and so it is not consolidated by Charter.
As a result of the timetable for production of this Annual Report, 
the latest full year for which environmental data is available is 
2009, and this is summarised below. More up to date and 
comprehensive information for ESAB and Howden is available 
on their respective websites.
The tables opposite show substantial reductions in 2009 in all 
KPI measures of environmental impact – energy consumption, 
greenhouse gas emissions and waste sent to landﬁll. These 
reﬂect partly lower levels of operational activity. However, even 
when normalised by turnover, the target of a 5 per cent 
reduction was exceeded in all three KPIs. 
This demonstrates the success of initiatives to reduce 
environmental impacts, including some of the projects that arise 
out of the roll-out of LEAN manufacturing processes. Such 
processes involve a systematic approach to identifying and 
eliminating waste through the continuous improvement of the 
manufacturing process. Charter expects to see further 
environmental efﬁciency gains in 2010 and 2011 as the impact of 
numerous projects started in the second half of 2009 are seen.
g. Quality & product integrity
ESAB products are used in a wide variety of engineering 
structures across the world, requiring the highest levels of 
technology and manufacturing precision to provide assurance 
of weld integrity. In addition to ESAB’s internal quality 
management, many of its products are certiﬁed by external 
laboratories to provide the highest possible level of conﬁdence.
ESAB is committed to objective disclosure of the quality and 
safety of our products, including real or perceived hazards 
relating to substances in the product, the product itself, or 
product use. During 2010 safety data sheets have been 
updated to include national occupational exposure limits  
and packaging and labelling reviewed to ensure they meet the 
requirements of the UN’s initiative for global harmonisation  
of the classiﬁcation and labelling of chemicals.
ESAB Middle East’s business moved to new purpose-built 
premises in Dubai. This is a contender for ‘Best Green 
Building in the Middle East.’ The 6,500m
2
 facility’s design, 
construction and sourcing of raw materials adhered strictly 
with the United States Green Building Councils requirement 
under its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) programme, achieving the platinum standard.

 * 2008 Energy and GHG data have been corrected from previous disclosure in the 2009  
Annual Report following identiﬁcation of errors in the ESAB dataset. The reason for these 
errors was a miscalculation of the energy content of the coal used in the steam generating 
boilers at Vamberk in the Czech Republic. There were also some inconsistencies in how  
ESAB accounted for the energy used in generating steam that is sold (this error is isolated  
to Vamberk since that is the only location where ESAB generates and sells energy).

In 2010 ESAB’s quality management team was strengthened 
with the appointment of a group quality director who is 
implementing global standards to ensure that its products 
continue to meet the high speciﬁcations demanded by its 
markets. ESAB hopes to achieve a Group ISO 9000 standard 
in the next 18 months. 
3. Our people
a. Human resources management
The human resources (‘HR’) agenda through 2010 has been to 
develop management capability. In 2009 Charter designed a 
comprehensive HR plan, which it has continued to implement 
across the organisation. It has been positively received by 
employees and managers across the world. Managers are 
showing greater conﬁdence in their abilities in performance 
management, LEAN production, policy deployment, ﬁnancial and 
business judgment, communication and engagement, coaching 
and development, employee relations, planning and budgeting.
Signiﬁcant investment in Charter’s future was made in 2010 
through training and development, both to improve productivity 
and to maintain the respect and trust of retained employees. 
Charter’s people development programmes were seen as key 
retention tools during a very challenging year. As signs of 
recovery appeared, managers were equipped with employee 
engagement skills to motivate and drive performance.
b. Employee numbers
The average number of persons employed by Charter in 2010 
was 12,313 (2009: 12,451) and was 12,407 at the year end 
(2009: 11,982).
c. Non-discrimination
Charter and its subsidiaries recognise and value diversity in  
the workforce and are equal opportunities employers. All 
recruitment, selection, reward, deployment, development and 
promotion decisions are made solely on the basis of individual 
qualiﬁcations, skills, experience and merit, regardless of gender, 
race, colour, nationality, ethnic or racial origins, marital status, 
sexual orientation, age, religion or disability. Charter’s Equal 
Opportunities policy was re-communicated in 2010.
The Company and its subsidiaries give full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment made by disabled 
people, having regard to their aptitudes and abilities. Should 
employees become disabled during employment, they would 
be considered for any necessary retraining and available work 
within their capabilities. For the purposes of training, career 
development and promotion, disabled employees are treated in 
the same way as other employees.
With one exception no reports have been received of any 
breaches of anti-discrimination laws in all relevant jurisdictions 
concerning matters of gender, ethnic origin, age, religion, 
sexual orientation, or disability. There is one alleged breach of 
gender-discrimination law, which arose in Scotland and is 
currently in the process of being investigated internally.
d. Training & development 
Charter businesses invest in employee skills and capabilities 
through a variety of programmes, including training and 
succession planning. Charter continues to invest in developing 
skills across both ESAB and Howden.
The rationale for continued investment in training and 
development of its people remains a priority for ESAB as the 
need to drive business excellence and performance continues. 
ESAB has three talent groups:
   Leadership talent – senior people believed to have the 
capability, ambition and performance to lead a signiﬁcant  
part of the business in the future (~100 people).
   Developing talent – managers with the capability, ambition 
and performance to move to more senior roles in future  
(~170 people).
   Technical talent – individuals who have considerable skill 
and knowledge in welding, cutting, process and systems 
(~160 people).
ESAB’s talent management process put nearly 100 executives 
through its key developmental programmes including: 21st 
Century Leadership Development; Developing Excellence and 
the Technical Talent Expo. Since September 2009:
   60 executives have been through 21st Century Leadership 
programmes
   32 managers have been through developing talent 
programmes
   24 individuals attended ESAB’s ﬁrst technical talent Expo
   four post-course projects have been completed, with two 
presented to the CEO
   12 Brunel University assignment briefs from ESAB’s 
Developing Talent Programme have been published
   over 75 individual development plans are being worked on 
and over 100 mentoring sessions have taken place, using 
senior ESAB executives as mentors. 
   online training continued, with 1,731 hours delivered to nearly 
800 users. Divisional and ﬁnancial review 
Corporate responsibility report (continued)
Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 34
There have been two signiﬁcant business outcomes from  
the talent processes so far. Firstly there has been a tangible 
improvement in individual engagement and commitment to 
ESAB. Secondly, succession and senior appointments are  
now better informed.
ESAB’s LEAN manufacturing programme has continued with 
Bootcamps in Mor (Hungary), Chennai (India) and Monterrey 
(Mexico), involving 64 people. One non-manufacturing LEAN 
Bootcamp took place with 23 attendees. Howden has run 
three LEAN Leadership Courses during 2010 with 54 attendees 
and a LEAN Bootcamp was held in Weihai, China, which 
trained 21 attendees. These continue the drive to implement 
LEAN principles throughout Charter.
The Howden Academy has continued as a three-week 
induction course for new engineers. Two additional Howden 
Academies were run this year, attended by 68 engineers.
The Howden Management Development programme, which 
was piloted in 2009, was rolled out in 2010 to South Africa, 
China, Germany, France and Spain, with 60 managers 
attending. This is an eight-day programme which aims to equip 
managers with key skills and tools to develop themselves  
and their teams.
Howden’s Talent Management Programme has continued  
and following 100 per cent completion rate for Senior 
Management appraisals, over 110 managers were identiﬁed as 
either ‘core’, ‘key’ or ‘developing’ talent within the business. All 
key and developing talent have been assessed and a 
development plan linked to succession planning is currently 
being ﬁnalised.
The Engineering Career ladder was piloted in South Africa, 
aiming to identify skills, behaviours and competencies and 
deliver development plans for engineers. This will be rolled  
out in China next and then globally throughout Howden over 
the coming three years.
During 2010, Howden North America implemented a 
Management Mastery Program (‘MMP’), which is designed  
to include basic management skills with an expectation that  
all Howden North America managers and supervisors will 
participate, regardless of background or experience. The pilot 
cohort was held in May, followed by the senior management 
cohort in June/July. Howden will complete three additional 
cohorts by the end of Q1 2011. 
e. Employee communications and relations
The Company’s policy is to encourage effective communication 
and consultation between employees and management.  
ESAB has continued with its Monthly Cascade, an internal 
newsletter, which is now widely established as the primary 
vehicle for global employee communication. Throughout  
the year, regional business reviews have conﬁrmed its use as  
a brieﬁng tool in every operation visited. Managers developed  
a much deeper understanding of the importance of 
communication and major change projects have incorporated 
greater communications content than ever before.
Howden continues to use the Team Brief newsletter, which is 
issued every two months, in addition to the important activities 
of works councils to ensure a two-way ﬂow of information.  
This augments local newsletters and communications/team 
meetings. Further, in order to assess effectiveness and identify 
improvement opportunities, Howden will begin a thorough 
review of its internal communications in Q1 2011 with 
recommendations and an action plan being developed in  
Q2 2011.
4. Sub-contractors and suppliers
The Company wants to work with product suppliers that meet 
its own standards of safety, environmental and quality 
management. ESAB has a Code of Ethics for purchasing and 
has in place a self-assessment procedure through which about 
1,900 suppliers have been surveyed since 1997. The self-
assessment questionnaire, which includes a list of banned and 
hazardous substances, must be signed by suppliers, as well as  
a declaration of legal compliance. Non-compliance is 
addressed by the ESAB local business units.
During 2010, the self-assessment programme has been 
strengthened with the introduction of on-site environmental, 
health, safety and quality audits for ﬁnished goods suppliers. 
Four audits were completed in 2010 and further audits planned  
for 2011.
As part of shaping its business in a sustainable and competitive 
way, Howden is continuing with its strategy to build 
constructive relationships with sub-contractors in low  
cost countries, particularly in India and Russia. In so doing,  
Howden aims to ensure that high ethical standards are 
observed, taking into account guidance issued by relevant 
trade associations and other organisations.
In line with this commitment, standard procedures for vendor 
audit of suppliers and sub-contractors have now been rolled 
out to all Howden Business Units and appropriate training for 
its supply chain staff is being provided to enable effective policy 
implementation. A procedure for supplier performance and 
assessment, which includes aspects of EHS, is in the 
development stage and is being piloted in Howden UK and 
North America.
Howden’s business has replaced the cooling fans at 
Connah’s Quay Power Station in the UK to improve reliability, 
availability and efﬁciency whilst also bringing enhanced 
environmental protection. The power station is close to local 
residential areas and noise attenuation equipment limited the 
thermal efﬁciency of the cooling tower. By using Howden’s 
ultra low noise fans water/air ratios can be improved and the 
incidence of low level plumes dropped from around 142 
days a year to around 23 days. Improvements in turbine 
efﬁciency as a result will lead to less gas being consumed 
and a reduction in 7,500 tonnes CO2 per year for the same 
level of power generation. Charter International plc

5. Code of conduct
The Charter Code of Conduct was re-communicated across 
the businesses during 2010.
Charter has appointed a Compliance Ofﬁcer with global 
responsibilities to ensure that Charter businesses not only 
comply with relevant legislation but also implement fully the 
requirements of our Code of Conduct.
Charter reviewed and revised its Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
(‘ABC’) policy which was communicated to all Charter, ESAB 
and Howden employees. This is now being followed by a 
multi-stage training programme to ensure ongoing compliance.
Senior Charter, ESAB and Howden Directors, as well as senior 
managers in countries considered to have the highest potential 
exposure, received face-to-face training during 2010. Following 
on from the success of the e-learning program for Competition 
Law, which was launched in 2009, an e-learning module has 
been developed on ABC in ten languages. This is being rolled 
out initially to all ofﬁce-based individuals as a priority in 2011. It 
will reach 35 per cent and 54 per cent of ESAB and Howden 
employees respectively. Risk assessments have been 
undertaken and used as the basis of prioritising further 
face-to-face training for those working in higher risk territories 
and/or job functions. All new employees will go through the 
training as part of their induction process.
A whistleblowing process, which involved the implementation  
of a new third-party reporting mechanism called 
‘MySafeWorkPlace’ was approved at the end of 2010  
and launched in January 2011. This is a conﬁdential and 
anonymous telephone hotline and web-enabled reporting 
service that makes it easy to report ﬁnancial irregularities, 
harassment, theft, substance abuse, unsafe conditions, or any 
other violation of the Code of Conduct. It provides a convenient 
mechanism and protected environment for letting the right 
people within the organisation know about concerns so that 
action can be taken where appropriate.
19 events involving allegations of fraud, theft or other possible 
breaches of the Code of Conduct were investigated in 2010,  
of which nine were reported via our whistleblowing system. Of 
these, 11 resulted in dismissal, resignation or formal warnings, 
seven required no further action, and one is still under 
investigation.
6. Communities
Many Charter businesses support local charities through 
fundraising or other forms of assistance. In addition, local 
voluntary initiatives and community investment serve to build 
stakeholder relations and enhance our reputation as an 
employer of choice and a good ‘corporate citizen’.
Details of charitable donations are reported on page 55.
As a reﬂection of ESAB Brazil’s concern for the education of 
children and adolescents, in 2010 it adopted the Professora 
Ligia Magalhes Municipal School, a public institution serving 
an underprivileged community in Contagem, Minas Gerais. 
To educate and raise awareness the company carried out 
various activities with students and teachers. An interactive 
educational activity trained 35 teachers (78 per cent) to help 
achieve sustainability in the community. The course dealt 
with topics such as environmental education, sustainable 
communities and consumer awareness. Three of the 
projects submitted by the teachers were sponsored by 
ESAB for introduction at the school. The Board believes that its structure  
provides the correct balance of skills  
and experience for the business

Corporate governance
The Company monitors its compliance with the requirements of 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Combined 
Code’) on a continuous basis. The Combined Code was revised 
during the year under review and the revisions became effective 
from 1 January 2011, after which it was called the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Board is of the opinion that in respect  
of the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 the 
Company has been in compliance with the provisions of the 
Combined Code with only one exception. The service contracts 
of Michael Foster and Robert Careless contain liquidated 
damages clauses, which are in contrast to requirement B.1.5 of 
the Combined Code for outgoing directors to mitigate their loss. 
The Board feels that these arrangements are not excessive and 
serve to balance the interests of shareholders with the need to 
ensure the retention of these individuals. The policy has been 
revised with regard to the service contracts of new Executive 
Directors and hence the service contract of James Deeley 
contains no such provision.
1 Directors
(a) The Board
The Board conducts itself in such a way as to provide 
leadership to the Company and its subsidiaries and their 
respective employees. It is committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance and to the delivery of enhanced 
shareholder value in a manner consistent with sound business 
practices and proper standards of the Company’s Corporate 
Responsibility Report (‘CR’). In providing such leadership, the 
Board focuses on integrity and personal responsibility with the 
overriding objective of creating shareholder value. The Board 
operates in accordance with a Management and Governance 
Framework (the ‘Framework’). This has been approved and 
adopted by the Board, and consolidates those policies which 
govern the management and governance of the Company and 
its subsidiaries. The Framework contains details of: (a) the 
speciﬁc powers that the Board has retained (b) the authority 
that has been delegated to the Board Committees and their 
terms of reference and (c) the role of the Board, the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. The Framework is kept under regular 
review and modiﬁed as and when new situations, requirements 
or developments in best practice arise. The Board ensures that 
the membership of its committees is refreshed so that undue 
reliance is not placed on individual Directors. The Board meets 
regularly and there are seven scheduled meetings for 2011.  
The Board holds an annual strategy conference at which it 
considers and determines the strategic plans for the Company’s 
businesses. No individuals other than the Committee chairman 
and the members are entitled to be present at meetings of the 
Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees, although 
others including the Executive Directors and the external 
Auditors may attend at the prior invitation of the relevant 
committee chairman.

experience required and setting a job description for speciﬁc 
appointments. In fulﬁlling its role in respect of new appointments, 
the Committee generally seeks advice and assistance from 
external search consultants to identify, benchmark and select 
appropriate candidates. The Board of Charter International plc 
reviewed plans for orderly management succession in relation 
to both Board and senior management appointments at its 
annual strategy conference in September 2010. The Board 
believes that this provided the necessary reassurance that 
appropriate plans have been adopted to ensure that the  
correct balance of skills and experience are maintained  
on the Board and within the senior management of the 
Company and its subsidiaries.
(iii) Remuneration Committee
Details regarding the membership, role, responsibilities and 
work of the Committee during the year under review can be 
found in the Remuneration Committee report on page 46.
(iv) Disclosure Committee
Composition: The Committee comprises the three 
Executive Directors.
Role: The Committee is primarily responsible for the creation 
and maintenance of appropriate procedures, systems and 
controls to ensure compliance by the Company with its 
obligations under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
(‘DTR’) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
In particular, it has responsibility for the determination, on a 
timely basis, of the disclosure treatment of material information 
and designing, implementing and evaluating disclosure controls 
and procedures that operate within the Company and its 
subsidiaries. The Committee also has responsibility for 
identifying inside information, for the purpose of maintaining  
the Company’s insider lists as required by the DTRs.
(v) Audit Committee
Details regarding the membership, role, responsibilities and 
work of the Committee during the year under review can be 
found in the Audit Committee report on page 44.
(c) Chairman and Chief Executive
Lars Emilson is Chairman and Michael Foster is Chief Executive 
of the Company. The Board believes that there is a deﬁned 
division of responsibilities between both roles. The Chairman 
has primary responsibility for leading the Board, for ensuring its 
effectiveness, and for ensuring that good communications are 
maintained with shareholders, while the Chief Executive has 
responsibility for running the Company’s businesses. Lars 
Emilson has no signiﬁcant commitments that require disclosure 
in relation to his Chairmanship. The Chairman periodically 
meets with the Non-Executive Directors without the other 
Executive Directors present as well as maintaining contact 
should they wish to raise any issues with him outside the formal 
setting of the Board meetings. At least once a year the Senior 
Non-Executive Director chairs a meeting of the Non-Executive 
Directors without the Chairman present.
(d) Board balance and independence
The Board believes that its current structure provides the 
correct balance of skills and experience for the business  
and would allow for any changes to the Board’s composition  
to be managed without undue disruption, whilst ensuring  
that the presence of six Non-Executive Directors prevents a 
concentration of power and inﬂuence in a small number of 
individuals. The Board has determined that, with the exception 
of John Neill who is no longer considered to be independent by 
virtue of his combined length of service on the Boards of the 
Company and Charter plc and his relationship with the Unipart 
Group of Companies, all of the Non-Executive Directors 
including the Chairman are regarded as independent. The 
Board does not consider that there exist any relationships  
or circumstances likely to affect the judgement of any Non-
Executive Director. The Board greatly values the contribution 
and experience of John Neill and recommends his re-election  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) as a 
Non-Executive Director. No Executive Director currently holds  
a non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company.
(e) Information and professional development
The Company Secretary, under the guidance of the Chairman, 
is responsible for ensuring good information ﬂows within the 
Board and its committees. All Directors of the Company have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
and may take independent professional advice on any matter 
relating to the Company at the Company’s expense. In advance 
of Board and committee meetings, Directors and relevant 
committee members receive detailed papers on the matters  
to be considered, enabling them to request further clariﬁcation 
or additional information and to participate fully in discussions. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on all governance matters and best 
practice. The Company has a comprehensive induction process 
for all Directors when they join the Board. This includes a 
detailed information pack, which combines publicly available 
information, such as the Annual Report and product 
information, with conﬁdential brieﬁng notes on the Company’s 
ﬁnancing arrangements, corporate structures, management 
accounts, advisers and other relevant information. In addition 
brieﬁng meetings are organised with key members of the  
Board and senior management and visits are arranged to  
the Company’s businesses. Where appropriate, Directors  
meet with major shareholders in the Company as part of the 
induction process. Directors are also provided with details  
of relevant external courses, which they can attend on an 
ongoing basis. Charter International plc

(f) Performance evaluation
Evaluation of the Board and its principal committees is 
conducted by gathering feedback from the relevant Board 
members. This feedback is gathered from two sources: a) a 
conﬁdential questionnaire eliciting both measurable data and 
free-format responses and b) individual interviews. The process 
is run by the Charter HR Director who collates the results and 
presents them to the Chairman and the Board. The individual 
interviews are between the Chairman and Board members who 
give their feedback on Board performance against a structured 
agenda. Board members also give more general comment  
on the performance of the Board and its committees. The 
Chairman is responsible for conducting the Chief Executive’s 
performance review. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the 
Senior Independent Director, are responsible for evaluating the 
performance of the Chairman. In doing so, they also take 
account of the views of the Executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive conducts individual evaluations of the Executive 
Directors as part of the Company’s formal performance 
management process. Performance is assessed against  
written objectives. The results of the 2010 questionnaire and 
the individual meetings were summarised in a paper submitted 
to the Board by the Charter HR Director on 2 December 2010. 
This considered the areas that the Directors identiﬁed for 
improvement and set out the way in which they will be 
addressed. In addition, careful attention was given to those 
areas that recorded different ratings since the similar exercise  
in 2009. The Board was unanimous in its agreement with the 
assessment that the Board, its committees and individuals 
continued to be effective and that there had been an overall 
improvement in effectiveness in 2010. The Board valued  
the continuity of approach and the total conﬁdentiality of  
the questionnaire. 
The Board has noted the recommendation of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that the evaluation of the Board of FTSE 350 
companies should be externally facilitated at least every three 
years and it will undertake further consideration of this position 
in 2011.
(g) Re-election
In accordance with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance code, the Board has resolved that all  
Directors should stand for re-election annually at each  
AGM. Accordingly, all of the Directors will stand for  
re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
(h) Directors’ conﬂicts of interest
The Company has procedures in place to deal with  
Directors’ conﬂicts of interest and these procedures  
have operated effectively.
2 Accountability and Audit
(a) Financial reporting & Directors’ responsibilities
The following paragraphs set out the responsibilities of the 
Directors in relation to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 
the Group and the ﬁnancial statements for the Company. The 
reports of the external Auditors, shown on page 59, set out 
their responsibilities in relation to those ﬁnancial statements. 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (as amended) (the 
‘Jersey Companies Law’), the Directors are responsible for 
preparing ﬁnancial statements for the Company in respect of 
each of its ﬁnancial periods. The Company’s ﬁnancial 
statements are required to show a true and fair view of, or be 
presented fairly in all material respects, so as to show: (i) the 
proﬁt or loss of the Company for the ﬁnancial period covered  
by such ﬁnancial statements; and (ii) the state of affairs of the 
Company at the end of such ﬁnancial period. The Company’s 
ﬁnancial statements for each of its ﬁnancial periods are required 
to be prepared in accordance with the generally accepted 
accounting principles adopted by the Company and to specify 
such generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s 
ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with UK 
generally accepted accounting principles (‘UK GAAP’).
Although the Company is not required to prepare consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements for the Group under the Jersey Companies 
Law, it is required to prepare them under the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority. The consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements for the Group are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
by the European Union.
In preparing both the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for  
the Group and the ﬁnancial statements for the Company,  
the Directors were required to:
(1)  select appropriate accounting policies and apply  
them consistently;
(2)  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
(3)  state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures being disclosed 
and explained; and
(4)  prepare those ﬁnancial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless they consider them to be inappropriate. Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 42
Corporate governance (continued)
The Directors are responsible under the Jersey Companies Law 
for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which 
are sufﬁcient to show and explain its transactions and that are 
such as to disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the 
ﬁnancial position of the Company and to enable the Directors  
to ensure that the Company’s ﬁnancial statements comply with 
the Jersey Companies Law. The Directors are required to have 
the Company’s ﬁnancial statements for each of the Company’s 
ﬁnancial periods audited, and for this purpose, to provide the 
Auditors with a right of access to the Company’s records and  
to provide them with such information and explanations as they 
think necessary for the performance of their duties as auditors. 
The Directors are also responsible for taking reasonable steps 
to safeguard the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries 
and, in that context, to have proper regard to the establishment 
of appropriate systems of internal control with a view to the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and  
integrity of the Company’s website. The requirements of  
Jersey Companies Law and UK legislation which govern  
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements  
may differ from the requirements of applicable legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that they have taken the actions 
necessary to meet their responsibilities as set out in the 
paragraphs above.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing both the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements for the Group and the ﬁnancial statements 
for the Company.
(b) Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the maintenance of  
a system of internal control. The Audit Committee has been 
formally delegated responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control. The processes to manage the 
key risks to the success of the Company and its businesses are 
reviewed and improved as necessary. There is an organisational 
structure with clearly deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority and there are also established policies and procedures 
for monitoring each business. While the operational control is 
largely de-centralised and responsibility is delegated, the 
businesses are subject to the overall internal control framework. 
This, by its nature, can provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Detailed 
policies and procedures have been established by the Board 
dealing with numerous issues including internal controls. 
Examples of internal control procedures are summarised  
as follows:
(i) Assessment of business risk
A system of risk identiﬁcation, assessment and evaluation  
of controls is embedded within the Company’s management 
processes. Strategic risks and opportunities arising from 
changes in the business environment are regularly reviewed  
by the senior management and formally discussed by the 
Board. Risks relating to key activities within the operating 
businesses and at the Company’s head ofﬁce are assessed on 
a continuous basis and reported to the Board as appropriate.
(ii) Control environment
Under the Framework described on page 39, the Board sets 
overall policy and approves the core policies and procedures  
to be adopted by all of its subsidiaries. A well-deﬁned 
organisational structure with clear operating procedures  
and lines of responsibility and delegated authority has been 
established. There are procedures for appraisal, review and 
authorisation of matters of signiﬁcance, including investments, 
capital expenditure, borrowings, guarantees, indemnities and 
material contracts.
(iii) Information and communication
The Company’s operating procedures include a comprehensive 
system for reporting ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information to 
the Board, including:
   the preparation and review of annual budgets and monthly 
results and forecasts;
   a review of the businesses at each Board meeting, focusing 
on any new risks arising (for example, those relating to 
proposed major investments and key changes in the 
markets); and
   meetings between various Executive Directors and 
operational management.
(iv) Control procedures
Detailed operational procedures are developed for each  
key business activity embodying appropriate controls. The 
implications of changes in law and regulations, including those 
for ﬁnancial reporting, are taken into account within these 
procedures. Procedures are established to safeguard the 
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and to ensure that 
all ﬁnancial transactions are properly recorded. Consolidated 
data, reconciled to the underlying ﬁnancial systems, is reviewed  
to ensure that the true position and results of the Group  
are reﬂected in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Accounting policies and practices are widely disseminated 
throughout the Company’s subsidiaries and its afﬁliates. Control 
processes are dynamic. Continuous improvements are made to 
adapt them to the changing risk proﬁle of operations and 
whenever a weakness in the internal control system is identiﬁed 
appropriate remedial action is taken.
The Company is committed to the highest ethical standards. 
The Company has an established code of business conduct 
and a number of supporting policies that require that all of its 
businesses and employees act with integrity at all times and 
that there is strict compliance with applicable laws. Employees 
have also been provided with a whistleblowing hotline known  
as ‘MySafeWorkPlace’ allowing them to raise concerns 
anonymously. All occurrences of whistleblowing are  
investigated and reported to the Audit Committee.  Charter International plc

During the year under review a Compliance Ofﬁcer was 
appointed with responsibility for monitoring compliance with the 
Company’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and Competition 
Policy and investigating any potential breaches of the policies. 
Work is currently in hand to ensure that the Company has 
adequate procedures in place to comply with the Bribery Act 
2010, when it comes into force. This includes a detailed review 
of agents and intermediaries used by Howden and ESAB and 
the existing controls in place.
(v) Monitoring process
There are clear procedures for monitoring the system of internal 
controls. The signiﬁcant components of these are:
   the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of each 
operating company are required to review internal controls 
and to return a self-certiﬁed internal control questionnaire 
conﬁrming the effectiveness of internal control systems;
   each operating company deploys a variety of risk 
identiﬁcation and assessment processes and develops 
mitigating actions. Major, high or medium risks are escalated 
and progress on action plans is reviewed at least quarterly as 
part of management meetings. The Board reviews every six 
months the major and high risks and monitors progress 
against action plans;
   as part of its audit visits to operating companies, the 
internal audit function evaluates the effectiveness of internal 
controls. The Audit Committee reviews the ﬁndings of the 
internal audit process;
   the Audit Committee has speciﬁc responsibility for reviewing 
the effectiveness of internal controls and monitors the 
process of assessing the internal controls on behalf of  
the Board; and
   the Audit Committee reviews the process by which risks 
are identiﬁed and assessed by operating units, operational 
management and the Board. The Board conﬁrms it has 
carried out a review of the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls described above for the ﬁnancial year ended 
31 December 2010 and up to the date of this Report in 
accordance with the guidance set out in Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code  
(the ‘Turnbull Guidance’). The review encompassed 
operational, ﬁnancial and compliance controls as well  
as risk management.
The system used included the following elements: (i) as part of 
their ongoing reviews of the business, the Executive Directors 
and Key Management reviewed the effectiveness of strategic, 
operational and compliance internal controls and risk 
management. This involved considering reports on key  
risk areas (concentrating on signiﬁcant changes in the risk 
proﬁle) and in the light of such reviews making appropriate 
amendments to policies and procedures to control risks; and  
(ii) the Board considered reports from the Audit Committee  
and the Executive Directors on these areas during the year  
and, at the time of approving the Annual Report, considered  
a summary of the assessments of the effectiveness of the 
controls on the key risks identiﬁed.
3 Relations with shareholders
The Company has a policy of maintaining an active dialogue 
with institutional shareholders through individual meetings. 
Communications with private shareholders are conducted 
through the Annual Report, Company announcements, the 
AGM and the Company’s website which, includes descriptions 
of the Company’s business operations. The Board receives 
regular updates on all meetings and communications with 
major shareholders and major shareholders are offered the 
opportunity to meet with the Non-Executive Directors from  
time to time.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that cannot be addressed 
through regular channels such as the Chairman, Chief 
Executive or Finance Director.
The share capital structure can be found on page 55, in the 
Directors’ Report.

prepared in accordance with the Combined Code and the rules 
of the UKLA.

The members of the Audit Committee (the ‘Committee’) are 
considered independent Non-Executive Directors pursuant to 
the Combined Code. Their biographical details are set out on 
pages 36 to 37 and their remuneration on pages 46 to 53. The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The 
Board has satisﬁed itself that both John Biles and Andrew 
Osborne have recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience, as 
required by the Combined Code.
In addition to the abovementioned management attendees, 
senior representatives of the external Auditors, the Head of 
Internal Audit and senior ﬁnancial executives from head ofﬁce 
and the businesses attend meetings by invitation as required.
Role of the Committee
The Committee is a sub-committee of the Board, to whom  
it reports its ﬁndings. Its primary role is to ensure the integrity  
of the ﬁnancial reporting and audit processes, and the 
maintenance of a sound internal control and risk  
management system.
In pursuing these objectives, the Committee:
   monitors the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the 
Company and any formal announcements relating to  
the Company’s ﬁnancial performance;
   makes recommendations to the Board regarding the 
adoption of annual and half yearly ﬁnancial reports and the 
approval of any other formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s ﬁnancial performance;
   reviews the Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls and internal 
control and risk management systems;
   monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit function;
   makes recommendations to the Board regarding the external 
Auditors and their terms of appointment;
   reviews and monitors the external Auditors’ independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;
   is responsible for developing and implementing a policy on 
the engagement of the external Auditors to supply non-audit 
services; and
   reviews reports from the Compliance Ofﬁcer and monitors 
the Group’s whistleblowing policies and procedures.
In the performance of its duties, the Committee has 
independent access to the internal audit function and to the 
external Auditors; and may obtain outside professional advice 
as necessary. Both the Head of Internal Audit and the external 
Auditors have direct access to the Chairman of the Committee 
outside formal Committee meetings. The Committee has 
written terms of reference that outline its authority and 
responsibilities and the terms of reference are available for 
download at www.charter.ie. These are considered annually  
by the Committee and any proposed changes are referred to 
the Board for approval.
Report on the Committee’s activities in 2010
Meetings and attendance
Meetings of the Committee are timed to coincide with the 
ﬁnancial and reporting cycles of the Company. The Committee 
met on ﬁve occasions in 2010 and attendance by Committee 
members is set out in the table on page 39. In addition, the 
members of the Committee met separately with the external 
Auditors and the Head of Internal Audit to discuss matters 
without the Executive Directors being present. The Chairman of 
the Committee reports to the subsequent meeting of the Board 
on the key issues covered by the Committee and the Board 
also receives copies of the minutes of each meeting. During the 
year the Chairman of the Committee has had additional 
meetings with the Company’s senior ﬁnancial managers to 
review a range of ﬁnancial matters, and has also met with the 
external and internal Auditors prior to Committee meetings.
Financial reporting
During 2010 the Committee reviewed a wide range of ﬁnancial 
reporting and related matters including the half yearly and annual 
ﬁnancial statements prior to their submission to the Board and 
the assessment of ‘going concern’ and liquidity risk. The 
Committee focused in particular on key accounting policies and 
practices adopted by the Company and its subsidiaries and 
signiﬁcant areas of judgment that impacted reported results 
including litigation and taxation matters. In respect of the 2010 
year-end review, the Committee has taken into account the key 
questions posed by the Financial Reporting Council in their 
paper ‘Challenges for Audit Committees arising from current 
economic conditions’ and satisﬁed itself that the Company has 
taken the appropriate actions and has adequate resources and 
systems in place to deal with current trading conditions.

External Auditors
The Committee annually performs a review of the effectiveness of 
the Company’s external Auditors, and has recommended to the 
Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , who have been the 
Company’s auditors for a number of years, be re-appointed as 
the external Auditors of the Company. The Committee remains 
satisﬁed as to the independence of the external Auditors 
following a review at its meeting on 2 December 2010 and has 
received written conﬁrmation from the external Auditors to this 
effect. The external Auditors are required to rotate the Group 
audit partner every ﬁve years and other key partners every  
seven years. There are no contractual obligations restricting  
the Company’s choice of external auditor. In accordance with  
its remit, the Committee reviewed and adopted the external 
Auditors’ plans for the audit of the Company’s 2010 ﬁnancial 
statements. In approving the terms of engagement for the  
audit, the Committee considered the proposed audit fee  
and associated expenses.
The Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policies on 
external audit and the provision of some other appropriate 
services by the external Auditors. The Committee has reviewed 
those non-audit services provided by the external Auditors 
throughout the year in accordance with the Company’s policy 
on the provision of other services by the external Auditors.  
This policy notes that such services are likely to fall within  
the following types:
   ﬁnancial statements and external reports;
   acquisitions;
   disposals;
   taxation; and
   other services.
It identiﬁes three categories of non-audit services: permitted 
engagements that require no speciﬁc approval; permitted 
engagements requiring the approval of the Committee 
Chairman; and engagements that are not permitted. The 
Company’s policy does not permit the engagement of the 
external Auditors for work on commercial due diligence in 
connection with acquisitions.
The total fees paid to the external Auditors were £3.9 million of 
which £3.0 million related to the statutory audits of the parent 
Company, consolidated accounts, subsidiary undertakings and 
other assurance-related services. The non-audit fees of 
£0.9 million represent 23 per cent of the total fees paid to the 
external Auditor. Further details of the fees paid to the external 
Auditors of the Company can be found in note 4 to the ﬁnancial 
statements on page 75.
Internal audit and monitoring of internal control issues
The Committee has reviewed the results of the audits 
undertaken by the internal audit function and considered the 
adequacy of management’s response to the matters raised, 
including the implementation of recommendations made by the 
function. It also reviewed and approved the internal audit plan 
for the coming year and the level of resources allocated to the 
internal audit function.
During 2010 internal audit tracked the status of work done 
throughout the Group in response to external Auditors’ 
management letter recommendations. The annual review of the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function was conducted in 
2010 and was based primarily on guidelines issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The 
Committee reviewed the reports from the internal audit function 
and the external Auditors on the Company’s systems of internal 
control and reported to the Board on the results of these 
reviews. During the year, internal audit carried out audits  
at companies accounting for 36 per cent of turnover and  
81 per cent of proﬁt. Fewer signiﬁcant and important points 
have been identiﬁed which demonstrates an improving trend  
of internal control.
Further details of the Company’s system of internal control and 
its policies and procedures can be found in the Corporate 
Governance report on pages 39 to 43.
Whistleblowing
The Company’s whistleblowing policy was monitored by the 
Committee at its meetings throughout the year. All issues raised 
through the Company’s whistleblowing procedures during the 
year were considered and follow-up actions were taken as and 
when required. Most whistleblowing issues were subject to 
independent follow-up by internal audit, the exceptions mainly 
being human resources-related issues.
At the end of 2010 a new whistleblowing mechanism, 
‘MySafeWorkPlace’, was approved and has subsequently  
been launched, allowing employees to anonymously report  
any suspected workplace incidents.

17 February 2011 Remuneration report
Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 46
I am pleased to present the Company’s Remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 December 2010, which has been 
prepared in accordance with the Combined Code (‘the 
Combined Code’) and the rules of the UKLA.
The key activities of the Remuneration Committee (‘the 
Committee’) in 2010 included: a review of Remuneration policy 
for 2011 following the introduction of the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code, published in May 2010 (the ‘UK Corporate 
Governance Code’) and consideration and approval of salary 
reviews, bonuses and long-term incentives awarded to the 
Executive Directors and key and senior management. 
The Committee also consulted with major shareholders 
regarding the amendments to the rules of the Company’s  
Long-Term Incentive Plan that were put to the 2010 AGM  
and associated changes to remuneration policy. I would like  
to thank those shareholders who participated in the 
consultation process. 
In 2011, the main change to the policy is that, in response to  
the principle set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code,  
a clawback provision has been added to the Company’s 
performance-related incentive plans. The operation of this  
is set out in further detail below. 
The Committee remains committed to setting a fair and 
competitive remuneration policy, which provides a positive  
link between reward and strategy and alignment of interest 
between senior executives and shareholders.

The Committee members and management attendees did not 
participate in any discussions directly relating to their own 
remuneration or performance during the year. 
The Committee held four meetings during the year and a 
summary of each member’s attendance at those meetings can 
be found on page 39 of the Corporate Governance report. 
External advisers
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’) were 
reappointed to provide independent advice to the Committee on a 
wide range of issues, including benchmarking, implementation of 
reward policy for 2010 and a review of remuneration policy for 
2011, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Company consulted Aon Hewitt, an afﬁliated company of 
HNBS, on actuarial advice in relation to its subsidiaries’ pension 
schemes and the insurance brokerage division of Aon 
Corporation in the USA. These services were agreed prior to 
the merger of Aon Corporation and Hewitt Associates during 
2010 and the services provided by the two businesses are 
considered to be entirely independent. 
The Company also consulted Mercer and Lane Clark & 
Peacock during the year in relation to its subsidiaries’ 
pension schemes.
Governance and the role of the Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for  
the following: 
   Formulation of the remuneration policy for senior executives; 
   Determining the remuneration and other terms and 
conditions of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and  
the Company Secretary; 
   Reviewing the remuneration and other terms and conditions 
of those individuals identiﬁed as key and senior managers; 
   Setting stretching but achievable performance targets for 
incentive plans; 
   Approving share incentives for the Executive Directors, the 
Company Secretary and key and senior management and 
the operation of share plans throughout the Company; 
   Reviewing remuneration trends across the Company, its 
major businesses and the market as a whole; and
   Determining the relevant pay benchmarking comparator 
group for the Company.
The Committee conducts its duties within its terms of 
reference, a copy of which is available on the Company’s 
website at www.charter.ie, and has regard to the Combined 
Code, the UK Corporate Governance Code and any other 
relevant governance publications such as the ABI guidelines 
and RREV policies on remuneration.
Key activities of the Committee in 2010 
During the year under review the Committee undertook the 
following key activities: 
Shareholder consultation
Consultation with the Company’s major shareholders 
regarding the proposal to amend the rules of the Charter 
International plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘CI LTIP’) at the 
2010 AGM to increase the maximum market value of shares 
over which awards may be made in any ﬁnancial year from 100 
per cent to 150 per cent of annual salary.
The consultation also included the consideration of the 
introduction of an Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) element for the 
performance criteria for future LTIP awards. Previously the 
performance criteria had been based on Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’). Following the consultation, the Committee 
recommended that the TSR and EPS elements be split 60:40. 
2009 Remuneration report
Approved the 2009 Remuneration report contained in the Annual 
Report and the elements of the Shareholder circular that related to 
remuneration. 
Assessed the performance of the Executive Directors
Reviewed the performance of the Executive Directors compared with  
the individual objectives set for each Director in 2009 and the 
performance targets set. 
Approval of bonuses and potential bonuses
Considered and approved the proposed bonuses and deferred 
bonuses for 2009 and the potential awards available in respect of 
2010 including the performance conditions applying to those awards.
Review of Remuneration advisers
Conducted a competitive tender process for the provision of 
independent advice to the Committee, following which the Committee 
concluded that it was appropriate to reappoint HNBS.  Charter International plc

Terms of Reference
Reviewed and approved amended terms of reference to reﬂect the 
adoption of the UK Corporate Governance Code with effect from  
1 January 2011.
Review of policy and introduction of clawback in line with UK  
Corporate Governance Code
Reviewed the remuneration policy for 2011 and approved 
amendments to ensure that risk is taken into account when setting 
personal objectives and performance targets and when determining 
the level of awards under variable reward schemes for the Executive 
Directors. The policy was also amended to reﬂect the introduction 
of clawback provisions into the Company’s existing bonus and  
long-term incentive plans in the event of ﬁnancial misstatement  
or misconduct.
Remuneration policy and packages
Remuneration policy
The Company seeks to attract, motivate and retain exceptional 
executives who have experience of operating in geographically 
complex, international engineering and manufacturing 
companies; in order to achieve these aims the Committee 
keeps the remuneration packages of Executive Directors under 
regular review.
The policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors is 
designed to ensure that their total reward is competitive and 
linked both to individual and business performance. Risk is 
taken into account when setting personal objectives, 
performance targets and when determining the level of awards 
under variable reward schemes; this is done by ensuring that 
targets, whilst stretching, are realistic, attainable and for the 
long-term beneﬁt of the Company and that they are achievable 
without taking inappropriate business risks.
The salaries paid to Executive Directors are dependent on the 
experience and capabilities of the individual and are determined 
after having regard to the salaries paid by similar complex or 
geographically diverse businesses.
The Committee considers that a substantial portion of 
remuneration should be linked to performance. When setting 
remuneration levels for the Executive Directors, the Committee 
has regard to general pay and employment policies across the 
Company as a whole as well as the wider market, in order to 
ensure that a coherent policy applies across the Group.
With effect from 1 January 2011, all bonus and long-term 
incentive payments will be subject to a clawback provision in 
the event of any ﬁnancial misstatement or misconduct for up  
to two years after payment.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
The key components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages are: 
   Base salary and beneﬁts; 
   Annual cash bonus with 25 per cent compulsory deferment 
in shares; and 
   Long-term incentives.
The charts below illustrate the proportionate breakdown of the 
various elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages at target performance, which assumes bonus and 
LTIP awards pay out at a 50 per cent level and stretch 
performance, which assumes full payout of both bonus and 
LTIP .

Fixed elements
1. Base salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries are reviewed annually  
and following any exceptional one-off events where the 
responsibilities of individual Executive Directors have changed 
signiﬁcantly. Salaries are benchmarked against those paid to 
directors in companies in comparable sectors which are of  
a similar size and international complexity. The base salaries  
of the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect from  
1 January 2011 and increases awarded are as follows:
Annual salary 
£’000
Fees  
£’000
Total  
£’000 % increase
Michael Foster 490 60 550 3.8
Robert Careless 255 60 315 2.3
James Deeley 245 60 305 5.2
The increase in the salaries of Michael Foster and Robert 
Careless are less than the weighted average increase for the 
overall workforce across the Group. The increase in James 
Deeley’s salary, which was slightly higher than the weighted 
average increase for the overall workforce, reﬂects the 
additional management responsibilities assumed in 2010. 
2. Pensions
All of the Executive Directors are members of the Charter  
HM Revenue & Customs-approved pension scheme. Michael 
Foster’s accrual rate is one-thirtieth of base salary, and Messrs 
Careless and Deeley’s accrual rates are one forty-ﬁfth of base 
salary, for each year of service as an Executive Director. They 
are all subject to a cap on pensionable earnings of £105,600 
per annum and are entitled to receive, in lieu of pension over 
the cap, an allowance to the value of 25 per cent of the excess 
of base salary over the cap. Remuneration report (continued)
Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 48
These payments are included in their emoluments shown on page 
51. James Deeley has elected that, from this amount, 9 per cent 
of his base salary in excess of the cap is paid to the Company’ s 
deﬁned contribution stakeholder pension scheme. Details of 
pension entitlements can be found in the table on page 51.
To the extent Executive Directors are impacted by the annual or 
lifetime allowance, a salary supplement in lieu of pension 
provision will be offered.
3. Other benefits
The Executive Directors’ remuneration packages also comprise 
tax-assessable beneﬁts arising from employment and include 
car and petrol allowances, medical insurance for the Executive 
Directors and their immediate dependants and life assurance.
Variable elements
4. Bonus
The maximum potential bonus available in 2010 was 125 per 
cent of salary for Michael Foster and 100 per cent of salary for 
Robert Careless and James Deeley. The bonuses payable  
to Executive Directors are not pensionable. For 2011, these 
caps will remain unchanged. 
The Committee believes that bonuses (i.e. short-term 
incentives) should reward high performance and deliver higher 
reward on the achievement of signiﬁcant performance above 
expectation. Annual bonus targets include separate elements 
for performance against both ﬁnancial criteria (ordinarily 
calculated at constant currency rates) and personal objectives. 
The targets set aim to address the issues facing the business 
over the coming year. It is the Committee’s view that the bonus 
plan design should remain ﬂexible and, where appropriate, be 
adjusted to reﬂect economic conditions. The Committee retains 
its discretion to adjust the amount of bonus paid if it believes 
the amount payable to be inappropriate in the light of 
underlying ﬁnancial performance or economic circumstances. 
However, the Committee will consult the Company’s major 
shareholders in future if it contemplates making bonus awards 
at above 125 per cent of salary. 
Actual bonus payouts in respect of 2010 were dependent on the 
achievement of a number of corporate and individual targets as 
set out below. In order to align the interests of Directors with those 
of the Company’ s shareholders, it is the Company’ s policy that 
bonuses are only payable for the achievement of stretching 
performance targets, the majority of which are linked to the 
Company’ s ﬁnancial performance. For the year ended 
31 December 2010, these targets were as follows:
Performance  
target
Level of  
payment
Maximum 
percentage of  
bonus payable
Percentage  
out-turn in 2010
EPS relative  
to budget
50% of maximum 
payable for meeting 
budget
64% 64%
Cash ﬂow relative 
to budget
50% of maximum 
payable for meeting 
budget
16% 0%
Personal 
performance
20% 15%
The maximum bonus would only become payable for a 
performance that was substantially in excess of budget and 
personal objectives set at the start of the year. The Committee has 
reserved the overriding discretion to review aggregate bonus levels 
payable to Executive Directors based on the above criteria to 
ensure that they are appropriate taking into account the underlying 
ﬁnancial performance of the Company and other factors. 
Following a review of the Executive Directors’ performance and  
the ﬁnancial performance of the Company during the year ended 
31 December 2010, the Committee determined that the 
threshold EPS target had been achieved, which resulted in a 
payment of 64 per cent of the maximum bonus. The threshold 
cash ﬂow target was not achieved and accordingly, no payment 
was made in respect of this element of the bonus. In recognition 
of individual performances in respect of objectives set to 
strengthen and rationalise the Company, payments were made 
at 15 per cent of the maximum bonus in respect of the personal 
performance element. Details of the bonuses paid to the 
Executive Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2010 are set out on page 51.
In respect of the year ending 31 December 2011, bonuses 
payable to the Executive Directors will be measured against the 
same performance categories and on the same basis as those 
used in 2010. The Committee believes that EPS and cash 
remain the Company’s most important ﬁnancial metrics for 
2011. The maximum bonus will only become payable for a 
performance that is substantially in excess of budget and the 
threshold above which a percentage of the bonus ﬁrst 
becomes payable (zero is payable at threshold) has been set at 
an EPS level above that achieved by the Company in 2010.
The Committee has agreed that performance under the EPS 
element of the bonus will be measured on a constant currency 
basis. The Committee believes that this approach is a better 
reﬂection of management’s underlying performance since  
exchange rates are not within management’s control.
5. Share incentives
   Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
One quarter of any bonus paid to the Executive Directors will be 
paid in shares acquired in the market and compulsorily deferred 
for three years under the DBP . If Executive Directors leave 
voluntarily or for cause during this deferral period, their awards 
will normally lapse. 
   Charter International plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘CI LTIP’)
Under the CI LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other 
members of key management are eligible to receive awards  
of shares which vest three years after grant, subject to the 
satisfaction of certain performance conditions. Currently, an 
individual may not receive awards in any ﬁnancial year over 
shares having a market value in excess of 150 per cent of salary, 
except in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or 
retention, where an individual may receive an award over shares 
worth up to 200 per cent of their annual salary.
In 2010 awards were granted to the Executive Directors worth the 
equivalent of 125 per cent of annual salary. The Committee will 
consult major shareholders in future if it contemplates making 
awards at above 125 per cent of salary. Vesting is currently based 
on the following performance criteria, measured over a three-year 
period:
TSR relative to the 
companies comprising 
the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts) 60%  
of overall award
EPS 40% of  
overall award
Percentage of 
award vesting

12% per annum

In addition, for the TSR condition, awards may only vest if the Committee is satisﬁed with the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial 
performance over the performance period. 
Awards normally only vest on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided that the individual remains an employee  
of the Company and the performance conditions have been satisﬁed. 
The Committee recognises that relative TSR aligns management reward with returns to investors, but considers that the 
introduction of an EPS-related element provides a good balance and a clear connection between ﬁnancial performance and 
rewards. Overall, the two measures provide a good balance between incentivising executives to improve ﬁnancial performance 
and deliver above median stock market returns.
The Committee considers the EPS range for every award and the range for 2010 was set following consultation with the 
Company’s major shareholders and independent advice received from the Company’s brokers. The range of targets for the 2010 
awards was set at RPI plus an average of 6 per cent p.a. to RPI plus an average of 12 per cent p.a., which the Committee 
considers to be a demanding range. The Committee intends to consult the Company’s major shareholders in future if it considers 
it appropriate to alter the current 60:40 mix of the TSR and EPS elements of the performance condition. 
The Committee has considered the EPS growth range to apply to the awards granted in 2011 and has concluded that the same 
RPI plus 6 per cent to 12 per cent p.a. range should apply. In making this decision the Committee recognised that the 2010 EPS, 
from which the growth would be measured, was signiﬁcantly ahead of the 2009 EPS ﬁgure.
TSR calculations are carried out independently by HNBS by monitoring the percentage change in the Company’s share price plus 
dividends reinvested over a period of time. The chart below shows the performance of the Company relative to the FTSE 250 
Index (excluding investment trusts) index over the past ﬁve years. The Company was a member of the FTSE 250 during the year.

The graph shows the value by 31 December 2010, of £100 invested in Charter plc on 31 December 2005 and re-invested in  
Charter International plc on 22 October 2008 as compared with £100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment 
trusts) on the same date. 
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the 
TSR of Charter should be measured because it is an index of similar-sized companies.
Share ownership guidelines
The Executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain a holding of 100 per cent worth of salary in shares in the Company 
via the retention of at least 50 per cent of the net gain on vested awards under the Company’s share incentive schemes until the 
guideline has been achieved. Remuneration report (continued)
Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 50
Service contracts
The Executive Directors each have a service agreement with Charter Central Services Limited (‘CCSL’), a subsidiary of the Company.
Executive Director Company notice period Individual notice period
Michael Foster 12 months 9 months
Robert Careless 12 months 6 months
James Deeley 12 months 6 months
If the service agreement of either Michael Foster or Robert Careless is terminated by CCSL except with notice, on retirement or 
for cause, then CCSL shall pay as liquidated damages an amount equal to the value of each Executive Director’s annual salary, 
including both pension allowance and the value of the Executive Director’s lost pension beneﬁts. In respect of the service 
agreement of James Deeley, and for Directors appointed in the future, the Committee will look to apply the principles of  
mitigation following termination. The normal retirement age of all the Executive Directors is 65.
CCSL has agreed ‘tax equalisation’ arrangements with each Executive Director under which, if the amount of any remuneration 
paid by CCSL or any Associated Company to that Director is taxed in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, CCSL or the 
Director will make a balancing payment so that the amount received by the Director after tax in respect of that remuneration is the 
same as it would have been had he only been subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of it. 
The Executive Directors entered into letters of appointment in respect of their duties as Directors of the Company on 22 October 
2008. Each appointment is subject to termination by either party giving the other party not less than one month’s notice in writing 
and automatically ceases if that Executive Director ceases to be an employee of CCSL.
An Executive Director may not accept an appointment as a director or ofﬁcer of another company (including a charitable 
organisation or trade or professional association) without the prior approval of the Board. No Executive Directors currently hold 
any external directorships of listed companies.
Dilution
In the period to 31 December 2010 the Company has remained within the headroom limits set out in the ABI Guidelines 
‘Executive Remuneration – Policies and Practices’, for the Company’s existing share plans as set out below:
Total issued share capital at 31 December 2010 167,021,060
Total utilised share capital – all schemes (10% in any rolling 10-year period) 2,008,361
Remaining headroom under all schemes 14,693,745
Total utilised share capital – discretionary schemes (5% in any rolling 10-year period) 2,008,361
Remaining headroom under discretionary schemes 6,342,692
The Committee has the ﬂexibility to satisfy awards pursuant to the CI LTIP by either a market purchase or new issue of the 
Company’s shares. To date the Company has not bought shares to hedge the exposure to the Company’s share price; however, 
the Committee keeps its hedging policy under review. Awards granted under the DBP will be satisﬁed by shares purchased on 
the market.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Responsibility for determining the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors, the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees and the Senior Independent Director has been delegated to the Standing Committee by the Board. The responsibility 
for determining the fees payable to the Non-Executive Chairman has been delegated to the Committee but the Chairman does 
not participate in any discussions relating to his own remuneration. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of 
the Company’s bonus, pension or share incentive schemes. They do not have service contracts but their terms of engagement 
are regulated by letters of appointment that comply with the recommendations of the Combined Code, details of which are set 
out below:

The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors during 2010 were as follows: 
Position Fees (£)
Non-Executive Chairman 202,750
Non-Executive Director fee (not Chair of committee) 60,250
Additional fee for Chair of Audit Committee 6,000
Additional fee for Chair of Remuneration Committee 4,000
The additional fees payable to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees reﬂect the increased duties attributable 
to fulﬁlling those roles. It is standard practice for the Committee to consider the fees payable to the Chairman on an annual basis 
but the fees are not necessarily revised annually. Similarly the Standing Committee considers the fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors on an annual basis. 
The Remuneration Committee has considered the fee level payable to the Chairman and has concluded that this should be 
increased from £202,750 to £215,000 with effect from 1 March 2011. This increase takes account of the increased scope and 
complexity of the role since the date of his fee being last reviewed in 2008. The Chairman did not participate in the decision-
making process of this review. 
T ax equalisation arrangements have been in place for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors since the time of the Corporate 
Head Ofﬁce move to Ireland, with the exception of Manfred Wennemer, who is a German resident and was not previously on the board  
of the former Charter plc.
The Non-Executive Directors’ appointment letters are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce and copies will 
be made available at the AGM.

Notes to (a)(ii) 
1.  The accrued entitlement includes that earned by Robert Careless as an employee, prior to becoming a Director, as well as that earned for 
qualifying services after becoming a Director.
2.  The pension entitlement shown in the ﬁrst row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on 
service to the end of 2010 under the approved scheme.
3. The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
4.  The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another 
pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liabilities in respect of the Director’s pension beneﬁts. It does not represent sums payable to the 
individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
5.  The transfer value of the increases in accrued beneﬁts, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued 
beneﬁts that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in its transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the 
absolute increase or decrease in its transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued beneﬁts that results from market volatility 
affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

Notes to (b)(ii) 
1.  The value of the awards under the LTIP shows the number of the awards held multiplied by the market price of the Company’s shares at 
31 December 2010. The assumption is that the maximum number of awards vested in accordance with the performance conditions 
described on pages 48 to 49. It should be noted that the actual value may be less than the maximum, including zero if performance 
conditions are not met.
2.  The number of shares granted on 30 April 2010 is the share equivalent of 125 per cent of the base salary based on a share price of 
818.0 pence. The mid-market closing value of the Company’s shares on 29 April 2010, being the last dealing day before the grant date.
3.  These awards under the DBP represent 25 per cent of the bonus payable to the Executive Directors, in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2009. The awards were calculated by reference to the average share price of the Company over the ﬁve dealing days ending 
on 6 April 2010, being 759.5 pence.
4.  Shares granted in lieu of dividend reﬂects the dividend equivalents granted on the DBP awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The number 
of dividend equivalent shares awarded is calculated based on the gross dividend rate (inclusive of tax credit) and the mid-market share price 
on the dividend payment date. The share price on the dividend payment date of 7 May 2010 was 717.0 pence per share and the price on 
the dividend payment date of 10 September 2010 was 671.5 pence per share. 
5.  On 5 May 2010 Messrs Foster, Careless and Deeley exercised their awards under the LTIP granted on 22 March 2007. The assessment of 
the TSR performance condition produced a vesting of 58.5 per cent of the original award. Michael Foster sold 13,836 shares to meet the 
tax and NI liabilities and retained 13,467 shares. Robert Careless sold 8,648 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities and retained 8,416 
shares. James Deeley sold 6,918 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities and retained 6,733 shares. The market price on the date of 
exercise was 752.25 pence.
6.  During the year, the range of share prices was 567.0 pence to 848.5 pence, with the price on 31 December 2010 being 844.5 pence.
7.  The performance conditions applying to any of the above awards are as described on pages 48 to 49 except for the awards granted in 
2008 and 2009 which are based exclusively on the TSR performance condition.
8.  The accrued cost of Directors’ long-term incentive awards outstanding at 31 December 2010, calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 
‘share-based payment’ was £1.7 million (2009: £1.4 million).

Annual Report 2010 54
Directors’ report
Principal activities and review of operations
Charter International plc (‘the Company’) is the ultimate owner 
of two international engineering businesses, being ESAB a 
world leading welding and cutting business and Howden a 
leading applications engineer. The Company is registered in 
Jersey and has its headquarters and tax residence in the 
Republic of Ireland. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
A review of the activities and operations of the Company and  
its subsidiaries is given in the Chief Executive’s statement and 
the Divisional and ﬁnancial review on pages 12 to 35. These 
sections, together with the other sections of the annual report 
referred to in the Directors’ report are incorporated, by 
reference, into and form part of the Directors’ report.
Divisional and ﬁnancial review
The Divisional and ﬁnancial review is a review of the 
development, the operational and ﬁnancial performance of,  
and key trends and factors within, the business during the  
year ended 31 December 2010 and contains a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business.
Proﬁts
The proﬁt after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010  
was £118.9 million (2009: £74.8 million).
Dividends
On 17 February 2011 the Directors declared a second interim 
dividend of 15.5 pence per ordinary share (2009: 14.5 pence 
per ordinary share) to be paid on 6 May 2011 to holders  
of ordinary shares registered on 15 April 2011. An interim 
dividend of 7.5 pence per ordinary share was paid on  
10 September 2010 in respect of the six months ended  
30 June 2010 (2009: 7 pence).
Payment of dividends 
Subject to the provisions of Jersey Companies Law, the 
Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends up  
to the amount recommended by the Directors and the Board 
may authorise the payment of dividends of such amount and 
on such dates as it thinks justiﬁed by the ﬁnancial position of 
the Company. The Board may, if authorised by an ordinary 
resolution of the Company, offer any holder of shares  
(excluding treasury shares) the right to elect to receive  
a dividend in the form of fully-paid ordinary shares.
The Company operates Income Access Share Arrangements 
(‘IAS’) that enable shareholders to elect to receive either their 
dividends direct from the Company, which is tax resident in  
the Republic of Ireland, or from a subsidiary company which  
is resident for tax purposes in the UK.
A general summary of the tax implications of receiving 
dividends from an Irish source or receiving them from a UK 
source under the IAS, together with a copy of the IAS election 
form, is available on the Company’s website at www.charter.ie. 
If a shareholder who holds at least 0.25 per cent in nominal 
value of the ordinary shares is in default of an Article 15  
notice, then the Directors may also withhold the payment  
of any dividend to and restrict the transfer of shares held  
by that shareholder.
Directors
The names and brief biographical details of the Directors and 
key management of the Company appear on pages 36 to 38. 
There were no changes to the Board of Directors during the 
year. At the Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) all of the Directors will offer themselves for re-election  
in accordance with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which is applicable to the Company  
from 1 January 2011.
Powers of Directors
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of 
the business, and may exercise all the powers of the Company, 
subject to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of 
Association, the Jersey Companies Law and any directions 
given by a special resolution of the Company passed at a 
general meeting. In particular, the Board may exercise all the 
powers of the Company to borrow money, to guarantee, to 
indemnify, to mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, 
property, assets (present and future) and uncalled capital and, 
subject to the Jersey Companies Law, issue debentures and 
other securities and give security for any debt, liability or 
obligation of the Company or of any third party.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board and unless otherwise determined by 
ordinary resolution, the number of Directors shall not be less 
than two. A Director appointed by the Board holds ofﬁce until 
the next following AGM of the Company and is then eligible for 
re-election. The Board or any committee authorised by the 
Board may from time to time appoint one or more Directors to 
hold any employment or executive ofﬁce for such period and on 
such terms as they may determine and may also revoke or 
terminate any such appointment.
The Company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director 
before the expiration of his period of ofﬁce. The ofﬁce of a 
Director shall be vacated if: (i) he resigns or offers to resign and 
the Board resolves to accept such offer; (ii) his resignation is 
requested by all of the other Directors and all of the other 
Directors are not less than three in number; (iii) he is or has 
been suffering from mental or physical ill health and the Board 
resolves that his ofﬁce be vacated; (iv) he is absent without the 
permission of the Board from meetings of the Board (whether 
or not an alternate director appointed by him attends) for six 
consecutive months and the Board resolves that his ofﬁce is 
vacated; (v) he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his 
creditors generally; (vi) he is prohibited by law from being  
a Director; (vii) he ceases to be a Director by virtue of the 
provisions of Jersey Companies Law; or (viii) he is removed 
from ofﬁce pursuant to the Company’s Articles. Charter International plc

Directors’ indemnities
Each of the Directors has been granted an indemnity by the 
Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in respect 
of certain liabilities that may arise as a result of the Director 
acting as a Director or employee of the Company or an 
associated company.
Under the terms of each indemnity, the relevant Director is 
indemniﬁed against liability to third parties excluding the liability 
to pay criminal ﬁnes and regulatory penalties and certain other 
liabilities. In relation to any third-party claim, the Company may 
loan funds to a Director to allow him to fund his legal costs.  
Any such loan must be repaid by the Director if the Director is 
convicted of an offence, judgment is given against the Director 
or the Director’s application for relief is refused by the court.
Related party transactions
ESAB Holdings Limited, Howden Group Limited and The ESAB 
Group Inc., subsidiaries of the Company, are party to arms 
length consultancy agreements with Unipart Logistics Limited 
(‘Unipart Logistics’) for the provision of LEAN manufacturing 
and other consultancy services to ESAB, Howden and 
Anderson Group Inc. respectively. John Neill, a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company, is currently Group Chief Executive of 
the Unipart Group of Companies. The total charges paid to 
Unipart Logistics during the year amounted to £1.5 million 
(2009: £2.3 million). The amount payable to Unipart Logistics as 
at 31 December 2010 was £0.2 million (2009: £0.2 million).
Corporate governance
A review of the Company’s application of the principles and 
provisions of the Combined Code can be found on pages  
39 to 43. The Combined Code can be viewed online at 
www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm
Financial instruments
The ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies of  
the Company including interest rate, currency and credit  
risk can be found in note 21 to the Company’s consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements on pages 97 to 100.
Employees
The Company’s policy is to encourage effective communication 
and consultation between employees and management. 
Subsidiaries develop their own consultation and communication 
procedures as part of their employment practices. Further 
details on the Company’s employment policies, including details 
of the considerations given to disabled employees, can be 
found in the Corporate responsibility report on pages 33 to 34 
of the Divisional and ﬁnancial review. 
Creditor payment policy
Due to the global spread of the Company’s operations,  
Group companies are responsible for establishing terms  
and conditions with their suppliers. The Company’s creditor 
payment policy is to settle amounts due to creditors in 
accordance with agreed terms. The policy provides that local 
practice must be observed in the countries in which they 
operate and that standard payment terms in each country may 
be varied by negotiation with individual suppliers. The Company 
had no trade creditors at the year-end.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year the Company donated £161,000 (2009: 
£113,000) to charities of which £18,000 (2009: £9,000) was to 
charities in the UK. Within the UK, donations were made in the 
year to support charities working in medical research/support 
£15,000 (2009: £6,000) and community support £2,000  
(2009: £3,000). There were no political donations made  
during the year (2009: £nil).
Research and development
The Company continues to place strong emphasis on research 
and development to meet the changing needs of the markets 
they serve, further details of which can be found in the 
Divisional and ﬁnancial review on pages 12 to 35. Research  
and development expenditure, which excludes engineering and 
production support costs, totalled £20.5 million (2009: £17.1 
million) for the year of which £14.7 million (2009: £11.4 million) 
has been charged to the income statement for the year and 
£5.8 million (2009: £5.7 million) has been capitalised as 
intangible assets.
Share capital structure
As at 17 February 2011, the Company had 167,021,060 fully 
paid ordinary shares of £0.02 each in issue which are listed on 
the London Stock Exchange. The Company has a single class 
of shares.
The Directors have the power to issue, buy back, grant options 
over or otherwise dispose of unissued shares in the Company, 
to such persons, at such times and on such terms as deemed 
appropriate. 
Powers for the Company issuing and buying back its  
own shares
At the AGM shareholders will be asked to grant a further 
authority to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights 
to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the 
Company (i) up to a nominal amount of £1,113,473 and (ii) 
comprising equity securities (as deﬁned in the Articles) up to a 
nominal amount of £2,226,947 (after deducting from such limit 
any allotments or grants made under (i)) in connection with an 
offer by way of a rights issue (the ‘allotment authority’), such 
allotment authority to apply until the end of next year’s AGM (or, 
if earlier, until 30 June 2012). 
This resolution will also provide a further authority to allot shares in 
the Company (up to a maximum nominal amount of £2,226,947) 
pursuant to the exercise of a right to subscribe for, or convert any 
security into, shares in the Company in circumstances where the 
Company had the requisite authority to grant such right at the time 
it was granted. This authority is required due to provisions 
contained in the Company’ s Articles as a result of it being 
incorporated in Jersey and provides the Directors with the same 
authority they would be entitled to under section 549(3) 
Companies Act 2006 if the Company were incorporated in the 
United Kingdom. 
A special resolution will also be proposed to renew the Directors’ 
power to make non-pre-emptive issues for cash in connection with 
rights issues and otherwise up to a nominal amount of £167,021. 
Again, this resolution will also provide a further authority to make 
non-pre-emptive issues pursuant to the exercise of a right to 
subscribe for, or convert any security into, ordinary shares in the 
Company in circumstances where the Company had the requisite  Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 56
authority to grant such right at the time it was granted. This 
authority is required due to provisions contained in the Company’ s 
Articles as a result of it being incorporated in Jersey and provides 
the Directors with the same authority they would be entitled to 
under section 561(3) Companies Act 2006 if the Company were 
incorporated in the United Kingdom. 
No market purchases were made by the Company during the 
year ended 31 December 2010. 
A special resolution will also be proposed to renew the 
Directors’ authority to repurchase the Company’s ordinary 
shares in the market. The authority will be limited to a maximum 
of 16,702,106 ordinary shares and sets the minimum and 
maximum prices which may be paid.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares 
are contained in the Articles of Association, a copy of which  
is available on the Company’s website www.charter.ie. The 
Articles may only be changed by a special resolution passed at 
a general meeting of the Company. Holders of ordinary shares 
are entitled to receive notice of, attend, speak and vote at any 
general meeting of the Company, except as described below.
Voting by way of a poll
In line with growing market practice, voting at the 2011 AGM 
will be conducted by way of a poll. Shareholders will be entitled 
to one vote for each ordinary share of £0.02 held. This reﬂects 
best practice and allows those shareholders who are not able 
to attend the AGM to have their votes fully recognised. Any 
Directors appointed as proxies will cast their votes as directed 
by shareholders.
Holders of ordinary shares have the right to appoint a proxy or 
proxies (who need not be members of the Company) or, where 
appropriate, a corporate representative, to attend and vote on 
their behalf. Further details about the right to appoint a proxy  
or a corporate representative are set out in the Notice. 
The Directors may make calls on shareholders in respect of 
monies unpaid on their shares. If any call is not complied with, 
the Directors may serve a notice requiring payment with interest 
and expenses. Failure to comply with this may result in forfeiture 
of any share the subject of the notice. The Company has a lien 
on any share which is not fully paid.
Voting restrictions
No member shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine,  
be entitled to vote at a general meeting either personally or by 
proxy, or to exercise any other right conferred by membership 
in relation to meetings of the Company, if any call or other sum 
presently payable by him to the Company in respect of such 
shares remains unpaid. Further, a shareholder is not, unless the 
Directors otherwise determine, entitled to attend or vote at any 
general meeting if the shareholder has failed to comply with a 
notice under the Articles (an ‘Article 15 notice’) to investigate 
interests in the Company’s shares within 14 days. The Company 
is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that 
may result in restrictions on voting rights of securities.
Transfer restrictions
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any 
certiﬁcated share which is not fully paid and refuse to register 
any transfer in favour of more than four persons jointly. The 
Directors may also refuse to recognise any instrument of 
transfer unless it is in respect of any one class of share, is 
lodged at such place as they may determine and, where 
appropriate, is accompanied by any relevant share certiﬁcates 
and such other evidence as they may reasonably require to 
show the right of the transferor to make the transfer. The 
Directors may also suspend transfers where a shareholder  
has failed to comply with an Article 15 notice, in the manner 
noted above.
Certain restrictions on transfers of shares may from time to  
time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws) and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority whereby certain employees of the Company 
require the approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s 
ordinary shares. The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities.
Securities carrying special rights
No shares have been issued that carry any special rights with 
regard to the control of the Company.
Variation of rights
Subject to the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law and to 
any rights attached to existing shares (and except in the case 
where there is only one holder of the issued shares of a class  
of shares, in which case any and all of the rights attached to 
that class of shares may be varied only with the consent in 
writing of that holder), rights attached to any class of shares 
may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not 
less than two-thirds in nominal value of the issued shares of 
that class (calculated excluding any shares held as treasury 
shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at  
a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.  
At every such separate general meeting (except an adjourned 
meeting) the quorum shall be two persons holding or 
representing by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value  
of the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any 
shares held as treasury shares).

Signiﬁcant agreements
The Company acts as guarantor in respect of ﬁve multi-
currency revolving facility agreements entered into by Charter 
Central Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, with 
Bank of China (UK), Barclays Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds 
TSB Bank plc and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. Each of 
these agreements contain a change of control provision which, 
if triggered, could restrict further utilisations and/or require the 
repayment of all outstanding utilisations. In such circumstances, 
HSBC Bank plc and Lloyds TSB Bank plc may also call for 
cash collateral for outstanding utilisations under separate 
documentary credit facilities that are provided to subsidiaries  
of the Company. 
The Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan contains provisions 
that allow outstanding awards to vest in certain circumstances 
upon a change of control of the Company. Conditional awards 
made pursuant to the Charter International plc Deferred Bonus 
Plan will automatically vest on a change of control of the 
Company. Further details concerning the above can be found  
in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 53.
Rights under the employee share schemes
Under the rules of the Charter International Long-Term Incentive 
Plan and the Charter International Deferred Bonus Plan eligible 
employees are awarded shares in the Company. As at  
17 February 2011, Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited as trustee of  
the Charter Employee Trust holds 0.053 per cent of the issued 
share capital of the Company on trust for the beneﬁt of the 
Executive Directors, senior executives and managers of the 
Group. The voting rights in relation to these shares have been 
waived by the Trustee.
Corporate responsibility (‘CR’)
The Company’s report on CR, including its approach to health 
and safety, human resources, social, environmental and other 
related environmental issues, can be found on pages 30 to 35.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
The Directors (whose names and functions are set out on 
pages 36 and 37) conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge, 
the ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the 
Company and the Group taken as a whole; and the Directors’ 
report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Statement of disclosure of information to Auditors
So far as the Directors each are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information (that is, information needed by the Company’s 
Auditors in connection with preparing their report) of which the 
Company’s Auditors are unaware, and each Director has taken 
all reasonable steps that he ought to have taken as a Director  
in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s Auditors are aware of  
that information.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
Auditors to the Company and a further resolution to authorise 
the Board to ﬁx the Auditors’ remuneration will be proposed at 
the AGM.
Annual General Meeting

Audit opinion – Group ﬁnancial statements
Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Charter 
International plc
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Charter 
International plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 which 
comprise the consolidated income statement, consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement 
of changes in equity, consolidated balance sheet and 
consolidated cash ﬂow statement and the related notes. The 
ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’ s members as a body in accordance with Article 
113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial 
statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements:
    give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2010 and of the Group’s proﬁt and cash 
ﬂows for the year then ended; 
   have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards; and
   have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Opinion on other matters
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for  
the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
   proper accounting records have not been kept; or
   the ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records; or
   we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
   the Directors’ statement, set out on page 42, in relation to 
going concern; 
   the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
2008 Combined Code speciﬁed for our review.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements of Charter International plc for the year ended 
31 December 2010.

the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented 
on the website.

Annual Report 2010 65
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2010
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies
(i) Corporate information
Charter International plc (‘ the Company’), which is the ultimate parent company of the Charter Group, is incorporated and 
registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law as a public company limited by shares. The Company is tax resident in the 
Republic of Ireland and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange’s market for listed securities (‘the London Stock 
Exchange’).The consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the Group were approved by the Board on 17 February 2011.
(ii) Accounting policies
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the Group have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the United Kingdom (‘UK’) and in 
compliance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Although Charter International plc is incorporated and registered in Jersey 
under the Jersey Companies Law, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements include disclosures sufﬁcient to comply with those parts 
of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by the revaluation of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (including 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments) at fair value.
In compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the ﬁnancial 
statements of Charter International plc are included within the Group Annual Report. These are presented in sterling as that is the 
functional currency of that company. The Company has elected to prepare its ﬁnancial statements under UK accounting standards.
Use of adjusted measures
In order to help provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance the following adjusted measures have  
been presented. 
Adjusted operating proﬁt is after excluding acquisition costs, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill 
and exceptional items from operating proﬁt. Items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after excluding acquisition costs, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 
and goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans and non-cash net ﬁnancing 
costs attributable to retirement beneﬁt obligations, including attributable tax and minority interests, from basic earnings per share.
Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise 
stated, in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS requires the 
Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements. On an ongoing basis, estimates are 
evaluated using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the 
particular circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS. Actual results may differ signiﬁcantly from these estimates, the effect of 
which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Should circumstances change, 
such that different assumptions, estimates and judgements are considered to be more appropriate, this may give rise to material 
adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next ﬁnancial year particularly in respect of the key estimates, 
judgements and assumptions outlined below.
Construction contracts
Revenue and proﬁt on construction contracts are usually recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract  
calculated by reference to estimates of contract revenue and expected costs including provisions for warranty and product 
liability. At 31 December 2010, amounts receivable/payable under construction contracts were £42.5 million (2009: £41.9 million) 
and £57.7 million (2009: £45.5 million) respectively. Contract retentions held by customers at 31 December 2010 in respect of 
construction contracts amounted to £28.1 million (2009: £32.4 million). Warranty and product liability provisions at 31 December 
2010 of £28.5 million (2009: £30.5 million) mainly relate to construction contracts.
Employee beneﬁts
Provisions for deﬁned beneﬁt post-employment obligations are calculated by independent actuaries. The principal actuarial 
assumptions and estimates used are based on independent actuarial advice and include the discount rate and estimates of life 
expectancy. Other key assumptions for deﬁned beneﬁt post-employment obligations are based in part on market conditions at 
the balance sheet date. Further information is disclosed in note 20. At 31 December 2010, the net retirement beneﬁt obligation 
was £138.7 million (2009: £162.2 million).
Goodwill impairment testing
Capitalised goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Should the carrying value of the goodwill exceed its recoverable amount an 
impairment loss is recognised. The recoverable amounts are calculated based on the estimated value in use of cash-generating 
units. These calculations require estimates of cash ﬂows, growth rates and discount rates based on the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital, adjusted for speciﬁc risks associated with particular cash-generating units. Further information regarding 
these assumptions is set out in note 10. At 31 December 2010, the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill was £99.6 million 
(2009: £92.7 million). Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 66
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Provisions
Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement. These include provisions for legal and 
environmental claims. Calculations of these provisions are based on cash ﬂows relating to these costs estimated by management 
supported by the use of external consultants, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material.  
At 31 December 2010, these provisions amounted to £21.9 million (2009: £30.6 million).
Tax estimates
The Group’s tax charge is based on the proﬁt for the year and tax rates in effect. The determination of appropriate provisions for 
current and deferred income taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate 
the Group’s ability to utilise tax beneﬁts through future earnings, based on approved budgets and forecasts, and tax planning. 
These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events. At 31 December 2010, net income tax liabilities provided were 
£15.6 million (2009: £23.4 million) and net deferred income tax assets recognised amounted to £57.8 million (2009: £58.8 million).
Changes to accounting policies 
Revised standards mandatory for the ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 January 2010 adopted by the Group:
IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business combinations’. The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business 
combinations, with some signiﬁcant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value 
at the acquisition date, with contingent consideration measured at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently remeasured 
through the income statement. There is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-
related costs are required to be expensed. The Group has applied IFRS 3 (revised) prospectively to transactions from 1 January 
2010. Acquisition costs of £0.2 million that would have previously been included as part of the consideration have been expensed 
in the period in accordance with the revised standard.
IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements’. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions 
with non-controlling (termed ‘minority’ under the previous standard) interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in 
control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also speciﬁes the accounting 
when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in proﬁt or 
loss. The Group has applied IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010. 
There has been no impact of IAS27 (revised) on the current period.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 January 2010 and not  
early adopted.
   IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’
   IAS 24 (revised) ‘Related party disclosures’
   Amendment to IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a deﬁned beneﬁt asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction’
These changes are currently being assessed but are unlikely to have a signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnancial statements.
(iii) Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the entity.  
A shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control. The existence and effect of 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls 
another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-
consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s  
net assets.
The excess of the cost of acquisition, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value 
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired, 
including all separately identiﬁable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill and capitalised as an intangible asset (see (ix) (a) 
Goodwill below). As noted above with effect from 1 January 2010 acquisition-related costs are expensed.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intercompany transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 2010 review

(b) Transactions and non-controlling interests
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from 
non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net 
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. 
When the Group ceases to have control or signiﬁcant inﬂuence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with 
the change in carrying amount recognised in proﬁt or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or ﬁnancial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in 
other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or 
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss. If the 
ownership interest in an associate is reduced but signiﬁcant inﬂuence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss where appropriate.
(c) Associates and joint ventures
Associates and joint ventures are entities over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control, normally on the basis of a 
shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights. Investments in associates and joint ventures are 
accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Group’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’ post-acquisition proﬁts or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in 
the income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Accounting policies of 
associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent 
of the Group’s interest in the associates and joint ventures. 
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
(iv) Segmental reporting 
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal purposes by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.  
Revenue by geographic segment is allocated based on the country in which the customer is located. Non-current assets and 
capital expenditure by geographic segment are allocated based on where the assets are located.
(v) Foreign currencies
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements for each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which that entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are 
presented in sterling, the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter International plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying 
cash ﬂow hedges. The results and net assets of all Group companies that have non-sterling functional currency are included in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date;
(b) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period; and
(c) all resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to 
shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in 
the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
(vi) Financial assets
The classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classiﬁcation of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates its designation at each reporting date. Assets are classiﬁed as: 
loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets; or ﬁnancial assets where changes in fair 
value are charged (or credited) to the income statement. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets include non-derivatives not classiﬁed in 
any of the other categories.
The subsequent measurement of ﬁnancial assets depends on their classiﬁcation. On initial recognition loans and receivables and 
held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets and 
ﬁnancial assets where changes in fair value are charged (or credited) to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value.  Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2010

Annual Report 2010 68
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
(vi) Financial assets (continued)
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt and 
loss’ category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes 
in the fair value of non-monetary securities classiﬁed as available for sale are recognised in equity. When securities classiﬁed as available 
for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash ﬂows from the assets has expired or has been transferred, and 
the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets classiﬁed as loans and receivables comprise ‘Trade and other receivables’ and ‘Cash and cash equivalents’. 
They are classiﬁed as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
(vii) Financial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, that are used as 
hedges in the ﬁnancing and ﬁnancial risk management of the Group are categorised as hedges. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
categorised as hedges are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date. 
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument 
and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. When derivatives are designated as hedging instruments these are classiﬁed as 
either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities (fair value hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions (cash ﬂow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedge). 
For cash ﬂow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to 
be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement 
generally as part of ﬁnancing. When hedged cash ﬂows result in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset or liability, the associated 
gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders’ equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all 
other cash ﬂow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the income statement in 
the same period in which the hedged cash ﬂows affect the income statement. For net investment hedges gains and losses 
accumulated in shareholders’ equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The designation of hedging instruments, and their relationship to hedged items, is documented as appropriate at the time of 
designation. Assessments of whether designated hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or 
cash ﬂows of hedged items are documented at designation and periodically thereafter.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of other derivative ﬁnancial instruments, including fair value hedges, are 
recognised in the income statement.
(viii) Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses 
except that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004. These revaluations are treated as deemed 
cost as at 1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable 
to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment that ﬁrst commenced after 1 January 2009 are 
capitalised (see (xvi) Borrowings below). Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the 
Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other 
repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method spreading the difference 
between cost and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings  30-50 years
Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years
Vehicles  5 years
IT equipment  3-5 years
Asset lives and residual values are re-assessed at least annually.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
recoverable amount (see (x) Impairment of assets below). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the  
income statement. 2010 review

(ix) Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identiﬁable 
assets of the subsidiary or associate acquired. 
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Group’s previous accounting policy together with 
additional amounts arising since that date, is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates and joint 
ventures in relation to associates and joint ventures. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classiﬁcation 
and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves. Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 
to 31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years, or included as part of the carrying value of associates 
and joint ventures. 
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units 
(‘CGUs’) that are expected to beneﬁt from the business combination.
(b) Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition 
criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between 3 and 10 years. 
(c)  Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the licence, usually between 3 and 7 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in 
the year in which it is incurred, except for such costs that are directly associated with the production of identiﬁable and 
unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate beneﬁts exceeding costs beyond 1 year which 
are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less 
than 7 years.
(d) Intangibles arising on acquisitions
In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identiﬁes the fair values attributable to 
intangible assets. The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property 
rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how. All intangibles recognised on 
business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives, usually between 3 and 10 years.
(x) Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. Assets that are subject to 
depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows (cash-generating units).
(xi) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out (‘FIFO’) basis or 
the average cost basis. Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to 
its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred. 
(xii) Assets held for sale
Assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is 
highly probable within one year from the date of classiﬁcation.
Assets classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be 
depreciated from the date of classiﬁcation. Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)

Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 70
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
(xiii) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. Trade 
receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material. Amounts due after more than 12 months from 
the balance sheet date are classiﬁed in the balance sheet as ‘non-current’.
(xiv) Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts
For the purposes of the cash ﬂow statement, cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank 
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
(xv) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(xvi) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. 
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Group’s interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the foreign 
exchange gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity. Gains 
and losses accumulated in shareholders’ equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to expenditure that ﬁrst commenced after 1 January 2009 on a qualifying asset (one that 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) is included in the cost of that asset. Capitalisation ceases when the 
qualifying asset is substantially complete. Borrowing costs in relation to inventories and construction contracts that are 
manufactured in large quantities on a repetitive basis are not capitalised.
Borrowings are classiﬁed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
(xvii) Taxation
Taxation is that chargeable on the proﬁts for the period, together with deferred income taxation. Tax is recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, including actuarial gains and losses on 
retirement beneﬁt obligations (see (xviii) Employee beneﬁts below) and share-based payments (see (xix) Share-based payments 
below), in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 
basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
resulting temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future or where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
(xviii) Employee beneﬁts
The Group accounts for pensions and similar post-retirement beneﬁts (principally healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee beneﬁts’.
In respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans, where the amount of pension beneﬁt that an employee will receive on retirement is 
deﬁned by the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the deﬁned obligation at that date less the 
fair value of the plan assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised past service costs. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur directly in 
equity, in the statement of comprehensive income. Taxation attributable to actuarial gains and losses is taken to equity.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the 
employees remaining in service for a speciﬁed period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the amount charged to operating proﬁt in the income statement comprises the current service cost, 
past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments. Interest on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan 
assets is included within ﬁnancing in the income statement. For deﬁned contribution plans, where the Group pays a ﬁxed 
contribution into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether  2010 review

(xviii) Employee beneﬁts (continued)
or not the fund has sufﬁcient assets to pay all employees the beneﬁts relating to service in the current and prior periods, the 
contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other deﬁned beneﬁt post-employment obligations, principally post-employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar 
accounting methodology to that for deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is used. Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme 
demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can beneﬁt in future, for 
example by refunds or a reduction in contributions. Movements in the amount of any irrecoverable surplus are recognised 
directly in equity, in the statement of comprehensive income.
(xix) Share-based payments
The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the  
income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted. This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. 
Taxation attributable to the excess of the fair value over the charge to the income statement is taken to equity. The liability for 
social security costs arising in relation to the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the 
reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability  
will arise.
Cash-settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date,  
with changes recognised in the income statement. For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
(xx) Government grants
Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions 
relating to the grant are met. Where they relate to speciﬁc assets they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the same 
period as the asset is depreciated. Where they relate to revenue expenditure and/or non-asset criteria they are taken to the 
income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
(xxi) Provisions for other liabilities
Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability , and legal and environmental liability are recognised when  
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outﬂow of resources  
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If all these conditions are not met then no provision is 
recognised. Incurred but not reported (‘IBNR’) amounts are included in provisions. Provisions are not recognised for future operating 
losses. If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability . 
(xxii) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Share issue costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as 
a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid is deducted 
from Group equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
(xxiii) Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work 
executed during the year in respect of construction contracts. Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and 
discounts, and after eliminating intra-group sales, is recognised as follows:
(a) Sales of goods and services
The majority of the Group’s revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a Group entity 
has fulﬁlled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration. In respect of the 
sale of goods this is usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a 
customer.
(b) Construction contracts
Revenue is recognised by a Group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the 
customer. The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected 
costs to complete the contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of 
the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss ﬁrst becomes foreseeable. Contract losses are 
determined to be the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total 
revenues that will be generated by the contract. Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)

(xxiv) Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leasing agreements which transfer 
to the Group substantially all the beneﬁts and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased 
outright. The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown 
as an obligation under ﬁnance leases. The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements. The 
capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a 
constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period. Assets held under ﬁnance 
leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
(xxv) Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the accounts in the period when paid.
2 Segment analysis
The Group is organised into two principal businesses: ESAB (welding, cutting and automation) and Howden (air and gas 
handling). For the purposes of IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’, ESAB is split into two segments: (i) welding; and (ii) cutting and 
automation. Inter-segmental revenue is not signiﬁcant. Amounts included under the heading ‘Other’ comprises central operations.

9 Earnings per share
Basic headline earnings per share are calculated on an average of 166.9 million shares (2009: 166.8 million shares) representing 
the average number of shares in issue after excluding 0.1 million (2009: 0.1 million) shares held by the Charter Employee Trust.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of  
0.4 million (2009: 0.7 million) dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: 
those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s 
ordinary shares during the year and the potentially issuable shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plans.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after certain adjustments to basic earnings per share so as to help provide a better 
indication of the Group’s underlying business performance as set out in the table below. 
It should be noted that the term ‘adjusted’ is not deﬁned under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled 
proﬁt measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or be superior to, IFRS measures of proﬁt.

99.6 92.7
(ii) The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
  The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-
use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁc to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts. Selling prices and 
direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
  The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts derived from the most recent ﬁnancial budgets approved by management for the 
next year and extrapolates cash ﬂows for the following years based on estimated growth rates detailed in the table below. 
These do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
 The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash ﬂows are detailed in the table below.

(i)  The impairment charge of £2.1 million in 2009 relates to exceptional restructuring costs (note 5) in the welding segment of 
£1.6 million and £0.5 million in the cutting and automation segment. Of this amount £0.3 million, £1.5 million and £0.3 million 
has been charged to cost of sales, selling and distribution costs and administration expenses respectively.
(ii)  The Group tests for impairment of property, plant and equipment when there are indications that such assets might be 
impaired. In view of the trading performance, start-up costs and challenging economic environment in China, the Directors 
have conducted an impairment review in respect of the property, plant and equipment of ESAB China and, as a result, 
continue to believe that the fair value of these tangible assets is in excess of carrying value.
  When determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment, independent third party advice was obtained. Where no 
such evidence existed, a value-in-use calculation was performed. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are 
those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales values and direct costs during the period. Management 
estimates discount rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the 
CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts. 
  The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts from the most recent budgets approved by management for the next year and 
extrapolates cash ﬂows for the following years based on estimated growth rates. These rates do not exceed the average 
long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
  In respect of ESAB China, the forecast cash ﬂows cover a period of ten years (being the remaining estimated useful life of the 
property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2010), have been based on growth rates of 8 per cent (2009: 10 per cent) per 
annum and have been discounted at a rate of 11 per cent (2009: 11 per cent) per annum. Selling prices and direct costs are 
based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
(iii) Assets in the course of construction as at 31 December 2010 were £19.1 million (2009: £20.2 million).
11(b) Assets held for sale
As at 31 December 2010 a property within the welding, cutting and automation business with a carrying value of £6.1 million  
was reclassiﬁed from ‘property, plant and equipment’ to ‘assets held for sale’. The estimated net sale proceeds are in excess  
of the carrying value. Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)

(i)  Disposal and restructuring costs include £3.5 million (2009: £7.3 million) in respect of employee severance costs, of which £2.7 
million (2009: £6.6 million) is in the welding, cutting and automation business and £0.8 million (2009: £0.7 million) is in the air 
and gas handling business, £0.7 million (2009: £nil) in respect of property costs in the welding, cutting and automation business 
and £0.4 million in respect of other closure costs in the air and gas handling business (2009: £0.6 million in the welding, cutting 
and automation business). This is expected to result in cash expenditure in the next one to two years. The effect of discounting 
these provisions is not material.
(ii)  Warranty and product liability provisions relate to continuing businesses and are expected to be utilised over a period of one to two years 
dependent on the warranty period provided but will also be replaced by comparable amounts as they are utilised. The effect of 
discounting these provisions is not material.
(iii)  Provision has been made for the probable exposure arising from legal and environmental claims and disputes, both existing and 
threatened, in some cases arising from warranties given on disposal of businesses. Provisions have been made representing 
the best estimate of the outcome of the claims including costs before taking account of insurance recoveries. Where the 
outcome of a claim is uncertain the legal costs of defence have been provided for to the extent that they are reliably 
measurable. Where appropriate, insurance recoveries are recognised in ‘receivables’. At 31 December 2010, these receivables 
amounted to £5.6 million (2009: £7.9 million). If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected value of future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability. Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely when 
these provisions will be utilised, though most are expected to be utilised over the short to medium term with utilisation in the 
next year expected to be in the region of £9 million (2009: £12 million) before taking account of insurance recoveries. 
(iv)  Other provisions include various amounts which are not individually material. Due to their nature it is not possible to predict 
precisely when these provisions will be utilised but utilisation in the next year is expected to be in the region of £2 million (2009: 
£2 million). Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)

proﬁts. Unrecognised tax losses of £57.4 million (2009: £49.2 million) have no expiry date and £42.6 million (2009: £35.0 million) 
in respect of China, Italy and the Netherlands expire as follows:

In addition the Group has an unrecognised deferred income tax asset in respect of its provision for post-retirement beneﬁts under 
IAS 19 of £19.5 million (2009: £20.7 million).
No deferred income tax is provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings as the Group is able to 
control the remittance of such earnings and has no intention of making any such remittance.
A deferred income tax liability of £1.5 million (2009: £1.4 million) is provided in respect of the tax that would be payable on the 
remittance of the retained earnings of associates and joint ventures.

Of the deferred income tax asset recognised during the year £4.1 million (2009: £3.1 million) was recognised in relation to  
tax losses that arose in businesses that generated taxable losses in 2010. At 31 December 2010 an asset for tax losses of  
£9.2 million (2009: £7.0 million) was recognised in relation to businesses that generated taxable losses in either the current  
or preceding year. These losses are expected to be recovered from taxable proﬁts arising from improved trading and new 
contractual arrangements that were entered into in November 2009. The majority of the tax losses recognised as at 31 December 
2010 and 2009 are expected to be recovered within ﬁve years.  Charter International plc

20 Retirement beneﬁt obligations
The major pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and are of the deﬁned beneﬁt type, the assets of 
which are held in trustee-administered funds. The Group also provides post-employment medical beneﬁts in the United States.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes and the liability for United States post-
employment medical beneﬁts are assessed by professionally qualiﬁed independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 
 2010 2009
UK Overseas UK Overseas
%%%%
Discount rate 5.40 5.25 5.70 5.60
Inﬂation rate 3.60 2.70 3.60 2.80

   – bonds 4.60 5.20 4.90 5.30
   – property 7.25 7.50
   – other 3.70 5.20 4.25 5.60

Future salary increases 4.60 5.00 4.60 4.00
Future pension increases 3.55 2.30 3.55 2.30
Medical costs inﬂation (ultimate rate) 4.50 5.00
The UK government announced in July 2010 that it will in future use the Consumer Price Index rather than the Retail Prices Index 
for the purposes of determining statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes. Most of 
the Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme rules specify that pensions in deferment and certain guaranteed minimum 
pensions in payment will increase in accordance with the annual statutory orders published by the UK government. The scheme 
rules also specify that the majority of increases to pensions in payment are linked to the Retail Prices Index and are therefore 
unaffected by the change. The Trustees of these schemes have not yet notiﬁed the affected members of this change. Accordingly 
the inﬂation assumption used to determine the pension liability as at 31 December 2010 has been based on the Retail Prices 
Index. It is estimated that had the inﬂation assumption been based on the Consumer Prices Index, where applicable, scheme 
liabilities would have been reduced by approximately £8 million as at 31 December 2010.
The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on either the PA92, PA00 or SN1A standard mortality tables after 
retirement with allowance for future mortality improvements or on scheme-speciﬁc factors. Based on the rates used, a member 
currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 29 years (2009: 27 years) after retirement if they are male 
and for a further 31 years (2009: 30 years) after retirement if they are female. A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live 
on average for a further 27 years (2009: 26 years) if they are male and for a further 29 years (2009: 29 years) if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States. The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been 
derived from the RP-2000 table with allowance for future mortality improvements. Based on the rates used, a member currently 
aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 25 years (2009: 24 years) after retirement if they are male and for a 
further 26 years (2009: 26 years) after retirement if they are female. A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on 
average for a further 23 years (2009: 23 years) if they are male and for a further 25 years (2009: 25 years) if they are female. 
Mortality assumptions for schemes in Sweden and Germany have been derived from the FFFS 2007 tables and the Heubeck 
2005 G tables respectively.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term results for the various asset classes. Equity returns 
are developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the 
yield on government bonds. Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate 
to the schemes’ holdings of these instruments. Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience. 
The estimated impact on the liability for deﬁned beneﬁt pensions and post-employment medical beneﬁts as at 31 December 2010 
resulting from changes to key assumptions is set out below:
 Estimated increase in liability
2010
£m
2009
£m
Discount rate – 0.25 per cent decrease 24 23
Mortality – one year increase in life expectancy after retirement 22 19
A 1 per cent increase in the inﬂation assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by  
£0.1 million (2009: £0.1 million) and the liability by £0.8 million (2009: £1.9 million). A 1 per cent decrease in the inﬂation 
assumption on medical costs would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by £0.1 million (2009: £0.1 million) and the 
liability by £0.8 million (2009: £1.8 million). Charter International plc

21 Financial instruments and risk management
(i) Financial risk management
The international proﬁle of Charter’s operations exposes it to ﬁnancial risks including the effects of changes in foreign exchange 
rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks. The Board sets policies to address these risks and there is a speciﬁc treasury 
policy setting out guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of ﬁnancial instruments.
Charter’s central treasury department is responsible for ensuring there are appropriate funding arrangements to meet the ongoing 
requirements of the Group and for managing effectively liquid funds held in the Group. Regular cash ﬂow forecasts are prepared 
by subsidiaries and reviewed by management. In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks and balance sheet 
foreign currency translation risks of the Group within guidelines agreed by the Board. Foreign currency transaction risks are 
generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines and controls deﬁned in the treasury policy. 
(a) Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations mainly from its own cash resources. It is the Group’s objective to minimise the cost of 
borrowings and maximise the value from cash resources, whilst retaining the ﬂexibility of funding opportunities. If considered 
appropriate, the Group would use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the 
desired interest proﬁle and to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations.
(b) Currency risk
The Group has signiﬁcant investments in overseas operations, particularly in Europe and America, and recurring exposures to 
exchange rate ﬂuctuations in respect of foreign currency transactions. As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the 
Group’s balance sheet and income statement. The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where 
considered appropriate.
Subject to Board approval, balance sheet translation exposures may be mitigated through the use of currency borrowings, 
forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives.
Foreign currency transaction exposures result from sales or purchases by subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional 
currency. Forward foreign exchange contracts may be used to hedge the net cash ﬂows resulting from these transactions to the 
extent these are certain or highly probable. 
(c) Financial credit risk
The principal credit risks relate to the failure of dealing counterparties for foreign currency transactions and ﬁnancial institutions 
with whom surplus funds are deposited in the short term. Charter’s central treasury department monitors regularly the credit 
status of such counterparties and ﬁnancial institutions, as well as the location of surplus cash worldwide with credit limits being 
set and subject to regular review.
(d) Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to maintain committed facilities to ensure that, together with cash ﬂows generated from operations, there 
are sufﬁcient funds for current operations and their future requirements. At 31 December 2010, the Group’s centrally held 
committed facilities totalled £170 million with maturity dates between 2011 and 2013. Two of these facilities have since been 
renewed such that the total has increased to £185 million with maturity dates that range between 2011 and 2015. One facility for 
£25 million is due to expire in 2011. The remaining facilities of £160 million have maturity dates that range between 2012 and 
2015. These facilities are unsecured. Whilst these facilities have certain ﬁnancial and other covenants, the ﬁnancial strength of the 
Charter Group means that the covenants attaching to these facilities have not been breached and are not expected to prevent 
the full utilisation of the facilities if required in the future.
Charter’s central treasury department is responsible for monitoring current and future requirements. It reviews annual strategy 
plans, budgets and forecasts, as well as weekly cash balances held worldwide to ensure that optimal use is made of liquid funds 
within the Group and to avoid unnecessary borrowing.
(e) Capital management
The Group aims to manage its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and to provide returns for 
shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders. The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets. 
Capital is monitored primarily by reference to the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, which also assists in ensuring the Group 
maintains the current strength of its consolidated balance sheet as represented by the level of net debt to equity shareholders’ 
funds. Although net cash is reported at year end, it is considered appropriate that the Group would operate up to a maximum 
ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA of 1.0. This maximum takes into account the proﬁle of gross cash and gross debt across 
the Group’s worldwide operations, the ongoing level of net retirement beneﬁt obligations (2010: £138.7 million, 2009: £162.2 
million), and the bonds and guarantees issued on behalf of the Company and its subsidiares in the normal course of business. Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)

fair values were derived from observable market data and are considered to be level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. 
(iii) Market price risk
(a) Interest rate risk
On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that a rise/fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to  
which the Group’s cash balances are exposed would increase/decrease proﬁt before tax by approximately £0.5 million  
(2009: £0.4 million).
On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that a rise/fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which 
the Group’s borrowings are exposed would decrease/increase proﬁt before tax by approximately £0.8 million (2009: £0.2 million).

It is estimated that the impact of every 10 per cent strengthening/weakening of the exchange rates of the principal currencies  
to which the Group’s receivables are exposed would increase/decrease proﬁt before tax by approximately £2.8 million  
(2009: £3.2 million). 
It is estimated that the impact of every 10 per cent strengthening/weakening of the exchange rates of the principal currencies  
to which the Group’s payables are exposed would decrease/increase proﬁt before tax by approximately £4.2 million  
(2009: £2.5 million).
(iv) Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to ﬁnancial assets is represented by the amount of cash and cash 
equivalents, trade and other receivables and derivative ﬁnancial instruments. Details of the credit risk relating to ﬁnancial assets 
are given in note 14 and note 15 in relation to trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents respectively.
(v) Liquidity risk
Financial liabilities included within trade and other payables (note 17) have a contractual maturity date within twelve months of

In 2010, 65,893 (2009: 54,497) ordinary shares were issued for nil consideration on the vesting of awards under the CI LTIP . In 
2009, 149,089 ordinary shares were issued for consideration of £324,999 on the vesting of awards under the MF Plan. As a 
result a total of £0.4 million (2009: £0.8 million) share premium arose.
At 31 December 2010 and 2009, one participant held options over a total of 66,413 ordinary shares of the Company. These 
options were granted under an employee share option scheme and are exercisable up to 29 March 2011 at a price of  
139.9 pence. Details of awards of contingent rights to the allotment of ordinary shares in the Company under long-term incentive 
plans are given in the Remuneration report on pages 46 to 53.

Deferred Bonus Plan has been deducted from retained earnings. The consideration paid was £0.1 million (2009: £0.2 million). At 
31 December 2010 the Charter Employee Trust held 88,790 (2009: 74, 120) ordinary shares with a market value of £0.7 million 
(2009: £0.5 million). The dividends receivable on these shares have been waived.

2010 and 2009 awards
The awards granted under the CI LTIP were valued using the Stochastic (‘Monte Carlo’) model as follows:
Grant date

Number of shares 245,380 396,537
Fair value – £ 1,679,800 1,174,700

Expected volatility % 64.9 58.7
Risk-free interest rate % 1.7 1.8
Dividend yield % – –
Expected volatility is calculated based on historical volatility for the Company. The total shareholder return performance condition 
of the awards has been incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent at the end of the vesting period therefore a dividend yield is not included in  
the valuation.
Deferred bonus plan
On 7 April 2010 awards over 9, 133 shares were made under the Deferred Bonus Plan at a fair value of 777.5 pence per share 
based on the share price at the date of grant.
On 9 March 2009 awards over 44,236 shares were made under the Deferred Bonus Plan at a fair value of 387.5 pence per share 
based on the share price at the date of grant. Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (continued)

27 Contingent liabilities 
(i) Central operations
Since about 1985, certain subsidiaries of Charter have been named as defendants (the ‘defendants’) in asbestos-related actions 
in the United States. These lawsuits have alleged that the defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partly-owned 
subsidiary of Charter Limited. Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in the 
defendants’ favour either at trial or on appeal. In subsequent years, the defendants have continued to be named in 
asbestos-related lawsuits. The defendants have contested these actions and, in most cases, have obtained dismissals. The 
defendants have settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi. Currently, the only pending cases against the defendants in 
which they have received service of process are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by 
plaintiffs. The Directors have received legal advice that the defendants and their wholly-owned subsidiaries should be able to 
continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of 
the trial of any particular action. It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages which might ensue 
if liability were imposed on any of the defendants. The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charter’s operating 
proﬁts in 2010 were negligible. The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors 
believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’s ﬁnancial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of  
such actions.
(ii) Welding
The ESAB Group Inc. (‘EGI’), an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state 
and federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding 
consumables. Other current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as 
various other defendants such as distributors, trade associations and others. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some 
cases, punitive damages for unspeciﬁed amounts.  Charter International plc

27 Contingent liabilities (continued)
There are three manganese fume trials scheduled for the balance of 2011. Additional trials could also be scheduled. During 2010 
EGI was not a defendant in any trials that were tried to verdict. 
For more than 20 years, the Welding Industry Defense group, which was established to represent a number of the welding 
company defendants, including EGI, in this and other litigation, has succeeded in obtaining defence verdicts in the vast majority of 
cases in which one or more of its members have been named as a defendant. Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk 
of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGI’s counsel in the United States, the Directors 
believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance. EGI, 
in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously. 
EGI’s defence costs, in relation to the manganese fume cases, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of 
US$8.6 million, which is reﬂected in EGI’s balance sheet at 31 December 2010. In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the 
legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on 
Charter’s ﬁnancial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants 
allege asbestos-induced personal injuries. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for 
unspeciﬁed amounts from EGI, other welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of 
asbestos products. EGI has two asbestos cases listed for trial in 2011 although it is not anticipated that they will proceed to trial 
as scheduled. EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant.
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to 
defend these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance. In addition, the majority of defence costs are 
being borne by EGI’s insurers.
(iii) Air and gas handling
Howden North America Inc. (formerly Howden Buffalo Inc.), an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a 
number of asbestos-related actions in the United States. On the advice of counsel, Howden North America is vigorously 
defending all the cases that have been ﬁled against it. Over the past few years, Howden North America has sought and received 
dismissals in 11,493 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 455 cases. These cases were typically settled for nuisance 
value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial. Howden North America has received legal advice 
indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought. At this time, it is not practical to 
estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the 
majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost of the settlements have been covered, in substantial 
part, by applicable insurance. The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos-related lawsuits against 
Howden North America, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden North America 
known as Buffalo Forge Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance. The situation is 
reviewed regularly and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden North America, the Directors 
believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’s ﬁnancial position.
(iv) Other
In addition there are contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business from which no liability is expected to crystallise. 
Various of the Company’s subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary 
course of business. The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually 
or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s ﬁnancial position.

29 Acquisitions and disposals
Current year 
In March 2010, Charter acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of AustCold Refrigeration Pty Ltd (‘AustCold’), a 
compressor company based in Sydney, Australia with net assets of £2.2 million for a cash consideration of £3.3 million 
(A$5.6 million) resulting in goodwill of £1.1 million. Acquisition costs of £0.2 million have been expensed. The cash outﬂow of 
£0.8 million, included in the cash ﬂow statement, comprises the net cash consideration of £3.3 million less amounts to be paid in 
future periods of £0.3 million and cash acquired of £2.2 million.
The value attributed to the assets acquired as shown in the table below represents the Directors’ current estimate of the fair value 
of the net assets acquired. In accordance with IFRS 3, the values attributable to the acquisition of AustCold are provisional and 
may be revised as further information becomes available. During the year ended 31 December 2010, no adjustments have been 
made to the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in prior years.

Intangible assets acquired principally represent customer relationships and brands.The goodwill arising principally reﬂects the 
anticipated proﬁtability of the new markets to which the Group has gained access and to additional proﬁtability and operating 
efﬁciencies in respect of existing markets. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The revenue and loss after tax of AustCold for the year ended 31 December 2010 were £2.8 million and £0.6 million respectively 
of which £1.5 million and £0.1 million respectively were for the period prior to acquisition.
Prior year 
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group made no acquisitions of subsidiaries. Costs of £0.3 million in relation to a 
potential acquisition have been charged to the income statement. During the year ended 31 December 2009, no adjustments 
have been made to the estimated fair value of the net assets of the other businesses acquired in 2008.
On 13 May 2009, ESAB completed the disposal of HD Engineering Limited, a manufacturer of drilling equipment, consumables 
and accessories with net assets of £3.1 million for a cash consideration of £1.7 million, net of disposal costs, resulting in a loss of 
£1.4 million. Cumulative exchange translation gains previously taken directly to equity of £0.9 million have been recycled through 
the income statement following this disposal. The cash inﬂow of £1.3 million in 2009, included in the cash ﬂow statement, 
comprises the net cash consideration of £1.7 million less cash disposed of £0.4 million. Charter International plc

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give  
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with

person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent  
in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies  
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial 
statements. 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements:
   give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of its proﬁt and cash 
ﬂows for the year then ended; 
   have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards; and
   have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Opinion on other matter

the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
   proper accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company; or
   the parent Company ﬁnancial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records; or
   we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements 
of Charter International plc for the year ended 31 December 
2010.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements of the Company
For the year ended 31 December 2010
1 Basis of preparation
The registered ofﬁce of the Company is situated at 22 Grenville Street, St Helier, Jersey JE4 8PX, Channel Islands.
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose 
shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. They were approved by the Board on 17 February 2011. The Company’s 
ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling, as that is the functional currency of the Company.
The ﬁnancial statements for the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost 
convention, with the exception of share-based payments awards measured at fair value, and in accordance with the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’) on the basis of the accounting 
policies set out in note 2 below.
These ﬁnancial statements comprise the proﬁt and loss account, balance sheet and related notes. The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash ﬂow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised 1996) ‘Cash ﬂow 
statements’. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with 
other members of the Charter Group.
2 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are set out below. 
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
liabilities are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred income taxation
Deferred income taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or 
liability. Deferred income taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred income taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments
The Company operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans. These include awards made in respect of shares in the 
then Charter plc exchanged for awards in respect of shares in the Company, following the Scheme of Arrangement establishing 
the Company as the holding company of the then Charter plc in 2008.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the proﬁt 
and loss account.
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This expense is spread over 
the vesting period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. The Company’s liability for social security costs 
arising in relation to the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the 
elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is 
accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense 
for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share-based payment’, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a 
contribution from the parent. Consequently, in the ﬁnancial statements of the parent (Charter International plc), the Company has 
recognised an addition to ﬁxed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions of £1.1 million (2009: £1.0 million) 
with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders’ funds.
Dividends

The Charter International plc shares issued pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement which established the Company as the 
holding company of the then Charter plc were recorded at fair value based on the closing mid-market price of the then Charter 
plc shares on 21 October 2008, the day prior to their delisting and the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective. This resulted 
in the creation of a share premium account of £646.6 million. On 6 November 2008, following conﬁrmation by the Jersey court, a 
reduction of capital became effective with all amounts then standing to the credit of the share premium account being 
recharacterised as a distributable reserve.

On 22 October 2008, pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement, awards of contingent rights to the allotment of 609,507 ordinary 
shares of the then Charter plc granted under the MF Plan, the CI LTIP and the Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) were converted to 
awards of contingent rights to the allotment of ordinary shares in the Company. There were no other changes to the terms of 
these awards.

Expected volatility is calculated based on historical volatility for the Company and the then Charter plc. The total shareholder 
return performance condition of the awards has been incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent at the end of the vesting period and therefore a dividend yield is not included in 
the valuation.

The Company has annual commitments of £0.1 million (2009: £0.1 million) in respect of the lease of land and buildings up to 
2012 (2009: up to 2012).
15 Dividends
Following the Scheme of Arrangement establishing the Company as the holding company of the Charter Group in 2008, Income 
Access Share arrangements have been put in place to enable shareholders in the Company to elect to receive their dividends 
from a UK source (the ‘IAS election’). All elections remain in force indeﬁnitely unless revoked. Unless shareholders make an IAS 
election, dividends will be received from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.
During the year, as disclosed in note 31 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, dividends were paid to the Company’s 
shareholders as follows:
2010  
£m
2009  
£m
Interim dividend for 2010 of 7.5p paid on 10 September 2010 12.5 –

Dividend for 2008 of 14.0p paid on 5 May 2009 – 23.4
36.7 35.0
Of these amounts £5.3 million (2009: £5.5 million) was paid by the Company to those shareholders who did not elect to receive 
dividends under the IAS election and £31.4 million (2009: £29.5 million) was paid by Charter Limited under the IAS election.
On 17 February 2011 the Directors declared a second interim dividend of 15.5 pence per share in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2010. It is anticipated that the dividend will be paid on 6 May 2011 to holders of ordinary shares registered on  
15 April 2011. This dividend, totalling £25.9 million, has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2010.
The Charter Employee Trust has waived its entitlement to receive dividends on its holding of 88,790 (2009: 74,120) ordinary 
shares in the Company. Charter International plc

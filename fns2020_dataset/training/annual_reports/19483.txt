Our customers
Rightmove’s customers are primarily estate agents, lettings 
agents and new homes developers.
Our business model
Rightmove is the UK’s number one 
property portal and operates a two-sided 
network. On one side we have the UK’s 
largest and most engaged property 
audience and on the other side we have 
the largest inventory of properties.
The Rightmove network effect
We beneﬁ t from strong network effects as 
our property audience and the properties 
our customers advertise creates a 
‘virtuous circle’ enhancing the Rightmove 
value proposition. 4  rightmove.co.uk
demand. Last year we attracted 200 million more consumer 
visits than the previous year and generated a record 50 million 
leads for our customers. Rightmove’s popularity is showing 
no signs of letting up and we have already set new site trafﬁ c 
records this January. 
Our customers have also beneﬁ tted from a continuous 
roll-out of additional advertising products to reach their 
audience of home sellers, landlords and home hunters. 
There is a wide range of choice and discretion to shape 
and reinforce brand identity on Rightmove to compete for 
business and market homes. There is also an increasing range 
of valuable tools, support and data available to our customers 
to assist them to operate their businesses more effectively 
and efﬁ ciently. 
Since Rightmove’s strategy does not depend on capital 
expenditure or M&A, the Board has a policy of distributing all 
of its free cash ﬂ ow each year. In fact, Rightmove has returned 
all of its free cash ﬂ ow since inception, totalling nearly £600m, 
through a combination of increased dividends and share 
buybacks. Our shareholders beneﬁ t from a predictable 
business model that is buoyed by our growing market 
leadership, together with clear and refreshingly candid 
communication from our executives.
Once again, the Board and I are grateful for the conﬁ dence 
and support of all our customers and for the talent and 
dedication of our employees. Together their efforts have 
positioned Rightmove as the essential marketplace for home 
hunters to ﬁ nd their next home and for property advertisers 
to reach by far the widest possible audience.
I am pleased to present Rightmove plc’s results for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
As we report on our 15th consecutive year of growth, 
I’d like to pick up on a theme raised in the Strategic Report: 
‘Doing the right thing’. This uncompromising principle 
supports the ethos of the Group. The philosophy drives our 
high achieving network business and what we do for our trade 
customers on one side of the network and our web and 
mobile visiting consumers on the other side. It also extends to 
our focus and behaviours towards all stakeholders including 
our investors, analysts, employees and our Board.
The team’s relentless focus and sensitive examination of 
our consumer experience has been the catalyst for continual 
improvements to site navigation and design. We aim for 
simplicity of use and an engaging experience. Of course 
our site trafﬁ c is in part a natural consequence of the best 
consumer proposition in the market, with almost 50% more 
listings than any other UK property portal, but it is in the main 
driven by the huge trust built up in our brand over the past 15 
years. The team works diligently to maintain a site that delivers 
the desired information when it is wanted and in the form it is 
wanted and we achieved an enviable 99.997% level of site 
availability last year. 
Our nearly 20,000 customers have beneﬁ ted from our 
ever-growing popularity with the British home moving public. 
We have delivered 15 consecutive years of site trafﬁ c growth 
for our customers and have been consistently ranked in the 
top ten sites in the UK irrespective of cyclical housing

Corporate governance
One of the Board’s responsibilities is ensuring that the Group 
applies good governance to facilitate effective management of 
a high growth business. As the Company’s Chairman I am 
pleased to note that the Group is continuing to foster an 
environment of entrepreneurial leadership and innovation in a 
framework of responsible governance and risk management 
as set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 26 
to 37.
Board changes
Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar both retired from the 
Board at the Group’s Annual General Meeting in May 2015 
after nine years of service. On behalf of the entire Board, 
I would like to thank them both for their substantial 
contributions to the Group, and wish them every success. 
Peter Williams has ably replaced Jonathan Agnew as 
Senior Independent Director and Remuneration Committee 
Chairman.
Outlook 
Our results for 2015 show us continuing to outperform 
expectations. Based upon strong customer numbers and 
trafﬁ c, and healthy growth in average spend per advertiser at 
the start of the year, the Board remains conﬁ dent of continued 
success in 2016.

Chairman
Financial results
The strength of our business model and core value 
proposition underpin record ﬁ nancial results in 2015. 
Underlying operating proﬁ t
(1)
 was up 16% to £144.3m 
(2014: £124.6m) driven by strong organic revenue growth of 
15% to £192.1m (2014: £167.0m) and continued focus on 
cost control. Underlying basic earnings per share (EPS)
(2)
 
was up 21% to 121.4p (2014: 100.3p), even greater than 
the percentage increase in proﬁ ts and in part attributable to 
£76.1m of share buybacks as part of our policy of returning 
cash to shareholders.
Returns to shareholders
Our commitment to return excess cash promptly to investors 
continues to be as strong as ever. Cash conversion remains in 
excess of 100% of operating proﬁ t. In 2015, we returned a 
further £112.5m (2014: £103.4m) to shareholders through 
dividends and share buybacks. 
Dividend
The Board previously announced that it would increase the 
interim dividend to 16.0p (H1 2014: 13.0p) per ordinary share, 
which was paid on 6 November 2015. Consistent with our 
policy of increasing the total dividend for the year broadly in 
line with earnings, the Board proposes to pay a ﬁ nal dividend 
of 27.0p (2014: 22.0p) per ordinary share for a total dividend 
for the year of 43.0p (2014: 35.0p), an increase of 23%. 
The ﬁ nal dividend, subject to shareholder approval, will be 
paid on 3 June 2016 to all shareholders on the register on 
6 May 2016.
Rightmove’s popularity is showing 
no signs of letting up and we have

customers to promote their properties, brands and proposition 
more strongly and gain a competitive edge.
As the property industry becomes more digital, Rightmove’s 
market leading audience and best in class software is 
becoming more valuable to customers. Our customers’ spend 
on digital advertising is growing as the property advertising 
market continues to shift structurally from ofﬂ ine to online and 
also as customers choose to reinvest the savings from the 
business efﬁ ciencies that our platform and the internet brings. 
We expect that our growth will continue to come through 
product innovation and pricing. 
We also continue to develop a number of smaller adjacent 
businesses focused on advertising overseas and commercial 
properties and property related data and valuation services.
15 successive years of growth
Rightmove celebrated its 15th birthday in 2015 delivering both 
another record year of results and our 15th successive year of 
growth. Our customer base grew by 2% to reach an all-time 
high of nearly 20,000, our property stock advantage increased 
to nearly 50% more than any other UK portal, we attracted an 
additional 200 million visits to Rightmove, we generated 16% 
more leads for our customers and our underlying operating 
proﬁ t grew 16% to a record £144.3m.
It is remarkable how far Rightmove has come. Our progress 
is testament to our disciplined focus on the UK property 
advertising market and the huge effort Rightmovers have put in 
to build this business together with our industry customers. 
Rightmove has changed the way Britain searches and 
researches property and we look forward to delivering 
continued growth and further empowering the UK’s decisions 
around property. 
Our strategy
The place that consumers turn to ﬁ rst and engage 
with most when searching and researching property.
For 15 years we have invested in our brand. However, it is not 
just the 15 years of investment that makes Rightmove so 
strong, it is the depth of connection that the British public has 
with our brand. With our focus on doing the right thing for both 
consumers and customers Rightmove has become a trusted 
and valuable source of property information.
Rightmove celebrated its 15th birthday in 2015 and together 
with the support of nearly 20,000 customers, it has changed 
the way Britain searches and researches property.
Our property stock advantage coupled with our brand 
strength and innovation have substantially increased our 
audience size and engagement this year. We attracted 200 
million more visits in 2015 as more people came to search 
and research the only place with a million properties for sale 
and to rent in the UK. 
We help our customers succeed by delivering great 
value marketing and by helping drive business efﬁ ciencies. 
We have grown our customer base by 2% during 2015 to a 
record high and continue to build broader relationships to 
support customers’ ambitions. We continue to break records 
at the start of 2016 having already generated over 9 million 
leads for our customers.
Business model
Rightmove is the UK’s number one property portal and 
operates a two-sided network. On one side we have the UK’s 
largest and most engaged property audience and on the other 
side we have the largest inventory of properties. We beneﬁ t 
from strong network effects as our property audience and the 
properties our customers advertise create a ‘virtuous circle’ 
enhancing the Rightmove value proposition. 
Rightmove is free to the consumer and is where home 
buyers and renters turn to ﬁ rst as they can see virtually the 
whole property market in one place. It is equally compelling to 
home sellers and landlords as it is where nearly all home 
buyers and renters are searching and researching the market. 
Our customers are primarily estate agents, lettings agents 
and new homes developers advertising properties for sale and 
to rent in the UK. We offer the most signiﬁ cant and effective 
exposure for their brand and properties, the largest source of 
high quality leads together with best in class software 
providing market insight and tools that empower their 
decisions and help drive business efﬁ ciencies.
Our principal sources of revenue are the monthly 
subscription fee paid by customers to advertise all of their 
properties and the fee paid for additional advertising products 
and packages. Our additional advertising products enable

platforms each month, our new launches in the year included 
our Valuation Range App, the Rightmove School Checker, 
mortgage content to further support home movers in their 
journey and we began to roll-out our new look search results 
pages and products based on a brand new site architecture. 
Looking forward, we will be pressing home our advantage with 
further innovation including a new ‘Where can I live?’ search.
We continued to invest in our brand in 2015 with our ‘ﬁ nd 
your happy’ advertising campaign. This campaign connects 
with the strong positive emotions that moving home often 
generates and reﬂ ects our position at the heart of it. Our brand 
building focused on national TV , through our ‘always on’ 
partnership with Channel 4 across their property content. 
We added further weight to our presence in London with 
more heavyweight TV advertising and through additional 
outdoor media across the capital. We also became the 
exclusive property partner with the Evening Standard in 
addition to our existing exclusive partnership with Time Out. 
The popularity of our Overseas property site increased 
signiﬁ cantly as we launched a new mobile site, added over 
500 new customers and increased the number of properties 
advertised by a third. We now advertise over 230,000 properties 
across the world with a focus on the most popular British 
destinations such as Spain, France, USA, Italy and Portugal. Our 
audience for overseas property set new records in 2015 with 
searches up over 20% to 98 million and leads up by nearly 50%.
Our Commercial advertising business continues to 
grow with 55,000 properties now advertised. It has quickly 
established itself as the UK’s largest commercial property 
portal with engagement up strongly in the period as the 
number of commercial enquiries grew over 30% year on year.
Provide the most signiﬁ cant and effective exposure 
for customers’ brands and properties, be the largest 
source of high quality leads and offer high value-
adding products and packages.
We generated nearly 50 million leads for our customers, up 16% 
on last year, twice as many as our nearest competitor. The better 
quality of our leads continues to stand out as they convert to 
over four times
(4)
 as many sales and lets for our agency 
customers. This is the 15th successive year we have delivered 
increased exposure for our customers’ brands and properties. 
We provide indispensable support for home movers enabling 
them to feel conﬁ dent, inspired and more in control. This not 
only results in more consumers turning to Rightmove ﬁ rst and 
spending more time on Rightmove, but most importantly, 
generates more and better quality leads for our customers 
leading to better outcomes and value. 
We remain relentless in our focus to deliver the fastest, 
easiest to use and most engaging experience for home 
movers. At the core of our strategy is to have the largest, most 
up to date and richest property content together with the best 
search and research tools, and the most relevant content to 
support home movers in their journey. We are the digital 
advertising market leader in the UK for every major property 
category: sales; rentals; new homes; overseas and most 
recently commercial property.
This year Rightmove has become even more compelling to 
consumers and customers as we strengthened our position 
on both sides of the network. We are the only place to search 
and research virtually the whole property market in the UK and 
consumers can view nearly 50%
(1)
 more UK residential 
properties on Rightmove than on any other portal. Our 
property stock advantage coupled with our brand strength, 
innovation and expertise has substantially increased our 
audience size and engagement.
There were a record 1.3 billion visits to Rightmove in 2015, 
a year on year increase of 18%, and 17.5 billion pages of 
property content were viewed. With this substantial increase 
our share of trafﬁ c of the top four property portals has grown 
across the board
(2)
. Our audience is also compelling to people 
selling their homes with 85%
(3)
 now ranking us as the most 
important site for marketing their properties in a recent 
independent survey.
Trafﬁ c to our research tools grew signiﬁ cantly in 2015 as 
sellers and landlords turned to Rightmove ﬁ rst to help inform 
their decisions. Our research tools, such as sold prices, are 
by far the most widely used in the UK and provide the unique 
beneﬁ t of access to our unrivalled catalogue of current and 
archived properties. Consumers viewed over 350 million 
pages of research content on Rightmove in 2015 which is 
up by a third on the previous year.
Our culture of restlessness continues to drive improvement 
and innovation. In addition to the hundreds of updates to our

Winning the right to sell a property is the lifeblood of agents. Over 
a million home movers highlighted they had a property to sell when 
emailing an agent about another property , creating business 
opportunities for our customers. We also delivered nearly 200,000 
leads from people asking for a valuation on their home, for those 
customers who bought our Local Valuation Alert product. 
From our beginnings as a simple listings business we have 
developed additional advertising products and now provide our 
customers with a range of products to promote their brands 
and properties more strongly to gain a competitive edge.
We launched our ﬁ rst product in 2007 and we now have a 
suite of products across three categories: display advertising, 
property promotion and direct response. Product revenue 
now accounts for 42% of Agency and New Homes revenue 
with the remainder coming from listing fees. 
Revenue from products grew by 20% in 2015 to £73.9m. 
There is signiﬁ cant headroom to grow product revenue as we 
have the opportunity to increase the penetration of existing 
products, evolve their value and pricing, and continue to 
innovate and introduce new products as customers look to 
invest more to drive their brand exposure. 
This year average monthly revenue per advertiser (ARPA) 
increased by 10% with around two thirds of the ARPA growth 
driven by customers spending more on products and 
packages. ARPA has grown to over £750 as customers 
choose to spend more online and transition away from the 
historic use of newspapers where ARPA peaked at circa 
£2,500
(5)
 per month back in 2007.
Help drive operational efﬁ ciencies and empower 
customer decisions through software, data and insight.
Over the last 15 years Rightmove has helped drive signiﬁ cant 
efﬁ ciencies within the property industry by providing our 
customers with training, support and a suite of software as 
part of their membership to help them in the day to day 
running of their businesses.
For example, whereas previously our customers would 
have manually gathered valuation and comparable data, 
paid for printing and postage of property or development 
details and paid a third party to count ‘For Sale’ and ‘Sold’ 
advertising boards for market share information, they can 
now do this electronically. 
Using our software customers can:
�  Easily ﬁ nd a range of comparable properties from over one 
million properties currently advertised on Rightmove and 
from our archive of over 35 million properties advertised 
on Rightmove; 
�  Upload a new vendor’ s property onto Rightmove almost 
immediately and in the same instant alert relevant home movers 
from Rightmove’ s database of millions of registered users;
�  Easily see the level of interest in a property and provide 
independent market feedback to their vendors and landlords;
�  Monitor their market share and ranking versus their local 
competition;
�  Identify potential valuation opportunities faster and more 
efﬁ ciently;
�  See a map of lead activity by street in their local area to 
help target potential sellers and landlords; and
�  Ensure leads are dealt with effectively by using our lead 
reporting and call recording functionality. 
The digitalisation of the property industry and the efﬁ ciencies 
these tools bring helps to reduce cost per ofﬁ ce and has also 
enabled the growth in the number of agents. Over the last 
12 months our membership base has grown by over 2%. 
Our software products have become an integral part of the 
industry over many years of use and in a recent independent 
survey
(6)
 49% of agents said our software was ‘crucial’ to their 
business and would be hard to switch from with a further 39% 
saying it was ‘helpful’. Over 50% of agents also cited that our 
software makes them more efﬁ cient not just in marketing but in 
other areas of their business too. 
In 2015 we introduced the next wave of market share analysis 
tools to help our customers drive further business efﬁ ciencies and 
make better informed decisions. The new functionality and data, 
greater ﬂ exibility and unique ‘whole of market’ view has doubled 
agent use year on year. We are also delighted that the survey 
found that nearly 60% of agents place their trust in us and only use 
Rightmove portal software for their insights. 
We care about our customers’ business success and building 
strong relationships is vital to support their ambitions, especially 
in light of the signiﬁ cant digital changes taking place. T o that end 
we are spending more time with customers than ever before by 
expanding our account management team and increasing the

team’ s efﬁ ciency through better tools. We also continued our 
popular agent seminar programme which covers concepts 
such as brand building, targeting sellers and customer service 
in a digital world. Over 2,000 agents attended one of the 35 
seminars we ran across the UK in 2015 from Norwich to 
Swansea and from Truro to Inverness. 
To help all agents and developers realise the full beneﬁ t 
from Rightmove we also set up a telephone training team and 
expanded our webinar offering. Our webinars provide 
customers with an efﬁ cient way to learn about Rightmove 
and our software without leaving their ofﬁ ces. We ran over 
80 webinars in the year with 2,500 agents and developers 
attending with popular topics including Winning Landlords 
and The Ultimate Property Listing.
Build great teams and continue to make Rightmove a 
great place to work.
From the ﬁ rst Rightmove team of a dozen people to the current 
organisation of 435 we are always striving to create one team of 
Rightmovers with as few barriers as possible to rapid growth 
and innovation. We believe that this comes from a process-light, 
highly connected organisation with little constraining hierarchy 
and bureaucracy. T o enable this we need every Rightmover to 
be both individually empowered and accountable.
T o ensure we foster a highly connected organisation, we have 
taken care to create a physical environment that encourages 
open and honest discussion, including social spaces for the 
teams to enjoy each other’ s company. Our workplace is free 
from ofﬁ ces and the usual trappings of hierarchy.
We believe in sharing often and early and reinforce this 
through events such as ‘townhalls’ which share progress, 
successes and challenges. In June 2015 the whole Group spent 
a day and a night under canvas together building and reinforcing 
cross team connections. The culture is not solely built on these 
events, but also from the everyday small gestures and the 
authentic care Rightmovers have for one another. Everything 
together creates a unique, driven and quirky environment that we 
believe results in people feeling there’ s no place they’d rather be. 
By striving to make Rightmove a great place to work we can 
attract and retain the best talent and provide the best service 
for consumers and customers. 
Great talent and passion to perform is not enough to make a great 
Rightmover; the way in which we behave towards each other, our 
customers and partners is vital. How we go about our work is 
central to our recruitment, feedback and personal development 
processes. We also have a scheme to allow the team to recognise 
their peers who embody the behaviours we aspire to.
The biggest inﬂ uence in our restless and inquisitive culture, 
of course, comes from our people. Their actions and 
behaviours create the sense of belonging and connection 
and allows the business to continue to thrive and attract 
great people. In our 2015 ‘Have Your Say’ people survey, 
again over 90% of Rightmovers think it is a great place to work. 
To recognise employees who have been part of the journey 
with Rightmove for ten years we create a gnome in their image. 
I’m pleased that for such a young company, over 40 gnomes 
have pride of place in our ofﬁ ce. 
I am proud of the vibrant culture and business we have built 
together, I would like to thank everyone for everything they have 
done to achieve this and look forward to enjoying continued 
success in the future.
Current trading and outlook
The outlook for the UK online property advertising market remains 
positive as consumers and customers become ever more digital 
and the market continues to shift from traditional advertising 
channels. We are well positioned to beneﬁ t from this transition and 
with our market leading position strengthening, average spend per 
advertiser continuing to grow and record January trafﬁ c numbers, 
the Board remains conﬁ dent of making further progress in growing 
the business organically in 2016 and beyond.

Revenue 
Revenue grew strongly in 2015 up 15% to £192.1m

contributor to the absolute revenue growth with a year on 
year increase of £17.5m to £147.1m (2014: £129.6m). 
We experienced 3% growth in Agency customer numbers,

Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying basic EPS
(2)
 increased by 21% to 121.4p 
(2014: 100.3p). Basic EPS increased by 17% to 114.0p 
(2014: 97.7p). The growth in EPS was driven by the increase 
in proﬁ tability in the year together with the beneﬁ t from our 
continued share buyback programme which reduced the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to 
96.0m (2014: 98.4m).
Balance sheet
Rightmove’s balance sheet at 31 December 2015 showed 
total equity of £6.6m (2014: £2.4m) reﬂ ecting growth in proﬁ ts 
and retained earnings less the continued return of capital to 
shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends 
during the year.
In line with stronger revenue, trade receivables increased 
by 13% to £24.6m (2014: £21.8m). Trade and other payables 
increased by £4.0m to £31.6m (2014: £27.6m) primarily due 
to an increase in deferred revenue in line with trading and an 
increase in the accrual for NI charge on share-based 
incentives outstanding. Our deferred tax asset, representing 
future tax beneﬁ ts from share-based incentives, is higher at 
£6.8m (2014: £4.5m) due to a larger potential tax beneﬁ t 
being recognised in relation to outstanding share-based 
incentives as a result of the growth in the share price during 
the year.
Cash ﬂ ow 
Rightmove continues to see strong cash generation and 
to return all the free cash generated to shareholders. 
Predictable cash ﬂ ows reﬂ ect the subscription nature of the 
business coupled with low working capital requirements. 
Cash generated from operating activities was £143.2m 
(2014: £125.4m) representing an operating cash conversion 
in excess of 100%.
This was driven by continued strong revenue growth coupled 
with a slightly lower percentage increase in underlying operating 
costs
(1)
. Underlying operating costs
(1)
 increased by £5.5m to 
£47.9m (2014: £42.4m). £2.4m of the increase related to salary 
and associated costs attributable to general wage inﬂ ation and 
an increased average headcount of 412 (2014: 388), reﬂ ecting 
investment in sales, customer support and technical heads 
during the year and the full year impact of staff recruited during 
2014. Marketing spend increased by £2.0m in the year as we 
continued to invest in promoting the Rightmove brand and 
driving home our competitive advantage. 
Share-based payments and National Insurance (NI)
In accordance with IFRS 2, a non-cash charge of £3.8m 
(2014: £2.7m) is charged to income representing the 
amortisation of the fair value of share-based incentives granted.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8% 
on the potential employee gain on share-based incentives 
granted. Based on a year on year increase in the closing 
share price from £22.48  at 31 December 2014 to £41.25 
at 31 December 2015 in respect of the outstanding 
share-based incentives granted, together with the actual 
NI cost on share-based incentives exercised in the year, 
there was a charge of £3.3m (2014: credit of £0.2m).
Taxation
The consolidated tax rate for the year ended 31 December 
2015 was 20.2% (2014: 21.2%). The effective tax rate was 
slightly lower than the UK enacted rate of 20.25% due to 
research and development relief claimed in relation to 
previous years. 
We are committed to being a responsible tax payer acting 
in a straightforward and open manner in all tax matters. 
The total tax payable in respect of 2015 was £75.3m 
(2014: £66.2m). £29.8m (2014: £28.6m) related to 
corporation tax and Employer’s NI borne by the Group 
while the remaining £45.5m (2014: £37.6m) was collected 
in respect of payroll taxes and VAT.

and facility fees resulting in net cash from operating activities 
of £116.1m (2014: £108.2m).
Capital expenditure of £1.8m (2014: £1.1m) reﬂ ects

Proceeds of £0.4m (2014: £0.2m) were received on the 
exercise of share-based incentives and £0.5m (2014: £0.9m) 
was applied to purchase shares to fund the Rightmove Share 
Incentive Plan which was introduced in January 2015.
During 2015, £76.1m was invested in the repurchase of 
our own shares (2014: £73.9m) whilst a further £36.5m 
(2014: £29.5m) was paid in dividends reﬂ ecting the increased 
ﬁ nal dividend for 2014 and the 3p increase in the interim 
dividend this year. This brings the total cash returned to 
shareholders in the year to £112.5m.
The closing Group cash and money market deposit 
balance at the end of the year was £12.4m (2014: £11.2m).
Use of cash
The Board’s priorities for the use of cash continue to be: 
investment in the business; payment of progressive dividends; 
and the return of cash to shareholders via share buybacks. 
The Board believes that the future working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements of the business will continue to be 
low and that the business will again be in a position to return 
surplus cash to shareholders during 2016 through a 
combination of dividends and share buybacks.

Key areas of focus
We continue to drive improvements to our risk management 
process and the quality of risk information generated, whilst at 
the same time maintaining a simple and practical approach. 
This year the risk management framework has been reviewed 
by Rightmove Assurance, our outsourced internal audit 
function, with a presentation to the Audit Committee on key 
ﬁ ndings including recommendations to enhance the risk 
management approach beyond the speciﬁ c requirements 
of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and 
to implement principal risk dashboards. 
Approach to risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that risk is 
effectively managed across the Group. The primary method 
by which risks are monitored and managed is through the 
monthly Executive Committee meetings. The subject of risk 
is included on each monthly agenda and any signiﬁ cant new 
risks or change in status to existing signiﬁ cant risks is 
discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
On a bi-annual basis, risk is reviewed across each 
business area. This review includes a detailed assessment 
of identiﬁ ed risks, the likelihood of each risk occurring and 
the potential impact, together with controls and mitigating 
procedures in place. This information is combined to form a 
consolidated risk register which is reported to the Executive 
Committee for review and challenge, ahead of ﬁ nal review 
and approval by the Board. A nominated Director has 
responsibility for each risk. The Board reviewed the risk 
register at the February 2015 and September 2015 
Board meetings. 
Strategic report | Risk management
numbers, ARPA growth and other ancillary revenue streams 
and considers the Group’s proﬁ tability, cash ﬂ ows and 
dividend cover over the period. 
The plan is subject to robust downside sensitivity analysis 
which involves ﬂ exing a number of the main assumptions 
underlying the plan. Where appropriate, analysis is carried out 
to evaluate the potential ﬁ nancial impact over the period of the 
Group’s principal risks actually occurring. Furthermore our 
business model is structured so that the Group is not overly 
reliant on a small customer base with no single customer 
constituting more than 3% of Group sales. 
Also given our signiﬁ cant free cash ﬂ ow, our ability to adjust 
our discretionary share buyback programme further provides 
long-term comfort around viability in the face of adverse 
economic or competitive conditions. 
Whilst this review does not consider all the risks that the 
Group may face, the directors consider that this stress-testing 
based assessment of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in 
the circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved.
Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2. of the Code, the directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a three year 
period, taking into account the Group’s current position and 
the potential impact of the principal risks and uncertainties set 
out on pages 17 to 18. Based upon the robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group and the Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year 
period to 31 December 2018.
The directors have determined that a three year period to 
31 December 2018 constitutes an appropriate period over 
which to provide its viability statement, being the period 
considered under the Group’s current three-year strategic 
plan. The three-year plan is reviewed by the directors at least 
annually and is developed on a segment by segment basis 
using a bottom up model. The three-year plan makes certain 
assumptions about Agency and New Homes customer  18  rightmove.co.uk

Employee beneﬁ ts 
Whilst we believe that that being a great place to work helps 
us attract the best talent we also reward our employees with 
a range of additional beneﬁ ts.
Rightmove contributes towards a group stakeholder 
pension plan. Opt out rates continue to be low and currently 
91% of employees are members of the pension plan. We also 
offer private healthcare complimented by a cash plan scheme 
to all employees. 
We want our people to directly beneﬁ t from the success 
their talent and hard work brings to Rightmove. All employees 
can join the Group’s Save As You Earn Scheme (Sharesave), 
which allows employees to save money from their salary with 
the option to purchase shares at a discount after three years. 
In November 2015, the Group’s seventh Sharesave contract 
matured allowing employees to beneﬁ t from the continued 
success of the Group over the last three years. 65% of our 
employees currently participate in the Sharesave.
In January 2015 we made a free share award of 100 
shares to all qualifying employees through the Rightmove 
Share Incentive Plan. In December 2015 we communicated to 
all employees that we were making a further free share award 
of 50 shares to all qualifying employees in January 2016. 
We also offer ﬂ exible working arrangements, supporting 
part time working and reduced hours to allow our employees 
to balance their work and family commitments. 
Engagement
We encourage employees involvement and place emphasis 
on keeping employees informed of the Group’s activities via 
‘townhalls’ and business performance updates with senior 
management and quarterly sales conferences. In 2015 to 
celebrate our 15th birthday, Rightmove brought the whole 
Group together for camping, team building and our annual 
summer party.
During 2015, our employee recognition scheme, which is 
based around the ‘Rightmove behaviours’ which reﬂ ect our 
unique blend of values and ways of working and which is an 
opportunity to nominate colleagues who have demonstrated 
these behaviours in action, continued to prove popular with 
up to eight awards presented every two months at our 
‘townhalls’. 
Our people
Our people are our most highly valued asset, they are critical 
to our success and growth and we are proud of the mixture 
of talent and experience they bring. Our open and honest 
cultural style comes from our people and the environment 
we have created together. 
We strive to make Rightmove a great place to work and 
this enables us to attract and retain the best talent and provide 
the best service for both our customers and consumers. 
Recruitment 
Recruiting the ‘right’ talent continues to be an important part 
of our ability to drive growth. The tightening job market, 
particularly in technology skills makes our working environment 
and beneﬁ ts ever more important in attracting the right people. 
Referrals from existing employees are a valuable source of 
new recruits, typically ensuring a higher quality candidate with 
a better cultural ﬁ t. 20% of new employees in 2015 were 
introduced to Rightmove by an existing employee. 
This year we partnered with MK College and the University 
of Bedford to offer paid internships to design graduates for 
up to six months to provide graduates with valuable work 
experience when looking for their ﬁ rst job. This has proved to 
be a most successful partnership and Rightmove are looking 
to extend this into other areas of the business in 2016. 
High quality recruiting is supported by long-term 
commitment from Rightmove employees. We are proud to 
now have 40 people who have celebrated ten or more years’ 
service, which represents 10% of our employees and which 
we believe backs our impressive  people survey results. 
People development and training 
To foster our culture of highly connected and empowered 
employees every new employee attends two ofﬁ ce based 
‘How Rightmove ﬁ ts together’ days to introduce them to the 
business and our customers. They also attend ‘Nexton’, an 
off-site residential experience to introduce them to our culture 
and values.
Beyond induction, Rightmove is committed to investing in 
our employees through extensive training and leadership 
programmes that are designed to equip them with the necessary 
skills to perform to the best of their ability and provide the best 
possible service to our customers and consumers. 
We have also developed a suite of internal development 
courses for our employees covering both technical and 
non-technical skills to further invest in our people and in 
recognition of the beneﬁ t in providing continual professional 
and personal development for Rightmovers.  building great teams

The Board continues to focus on the next level of senior 
management in order to develop potential within this team to 
step up to Board level at the appropriate time and to identify 
and develop potential within the wider organisation with a view 
to strengthening the female representation within the senior 
management team. In 2015, 24% (2014: 28%) of our senior 
management team were female. 
A breakdown by gender of the number of persons who 
were directors of Rightmove, senior managers and other 
employees as at 31 December 2015, is set out below:
Human rights
Whilst Rightmove does not have a speciﬁ c human rights 
policy, it does have policies such as Equal Opportunities and 
an Anti-bribery policy that adhere to internationally proclaimed 
human rights principles. There is also a gifts and hospitality 
policy and an online register to record all gifts and hospitality 
that are accepted by employees. 
Charitable activity
We continue to encourage all our employees to devote time 
and fundraising efforts to charitable causes that are of 
particular importance to them as individuals. During 2015, 
many of our staff have been active in raising money or 
supporting fundraising activities across a wide range of 
charities for which Rightmove matches the donations raised. 
In 2015 we contributed £56,000 to UK charities through 
matched funding. Our employees are also able to donate 
directly from their monthly salary to any charity or recognised 
good cause registered within the UK through the Charities 
Trust. This provides a tax efﬁ cient means of giving. 
As it is important to us to know what our employees think 
and having received such valuable feedback in the past, 
we conduct an annual ‘Have your Say’ people survey.
Again in 2015 we are proud of our outstanding results 
from the survey with highlights including:
�  91% of respondents saying Rightmove is a great 
place to work;
�  96% of respondents committed to making a real 
contribution to the success of Rightmove; and
� 92% of respondents enjoy working in their team.
Despite the outstanding results from the survey, the 
management team is working hard to improve the results 
in 2016. To recognise the importance of employees in the 
continuing success of Rightmove an employee engagement 
score will form part of the senior management bonus criteria 
in 2016.
Equality and diversity 
Rightmove has a ﬁ rm commitment to equality of opportunity in 
all our employment policies, practices and procedures. Our 
recruitment and selection processes are geared to selecting 
the best candidate regardless of their age, gender, sexuality, 
full or part time status, disability and marital status.
We recognise that a diverse workforce will provide a wide 
array of perspectives that promotes innovation and business 
success. Drawing on what is unique about individuals adds 
value to the way we do business and helps us anticipate and 
provide what our customers want from us. 
For the year ended 31 December 2015, one out of three 
executive directors were female. Our female representation 
on the Board is 25%, with two out of eight Board directors 
being female.

Forest Carbon to capture the CO
2
 emissions from our ﬂ eet of 
company cars and turn it into new UK woodlands, under the 
Allstar Ecopoint scheme. We pay an amount per month per 
car to capture all of the CO
2
 from each vehicle and with that 
Forest Carbon plant woodlands that are quality assured by 
the Governments’ Woodland Carbon Code to offset the 
emissions from each vehicle. We are provided an e-certiﬁ cate 
annually which shows us how many trees have been planted 
for us, as well as their location and how much CO
2
 they are 
expected to capture. 
As an online business, our culture emphasises a paperless 
environment. We also recognise that our responsibilities do 
not stop with how we operate internally; we encourage all 
our customers, business partners and suppliers not to 
unnecessarily print out emails sent by us in the signature of 
all our emails. We also continue to focus on streamlining 
processes and replacing paper-based services with online 
services and communications, wherever possible. Steps 
introduced in recent years include e-communications to 
shareholders and online customer membership forms and 
product documentation. 
Greenhouse gas reporting
Since 1 October 2013, the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 has required 
all UK quoted companies to report on their greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, which are classiﬁ ed as either direct or indirect 
and which are divided further into Scope 1, Scope 2 and 
Scope 3 emissions.
Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are 
owned or controlled by Rightmove. Indirect GHG emissions 
are emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the 
Group but that occur at sources owned or controlled by 
other entities. 
Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions controlled by the 
Group arising from company cars. Whilst the cars are leased, 
we are responsible for the emissions and therefore we report 
these under Scope 1.
Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions attributable to the 
Group due to its consumption of purchased electricity.
Scope 3 emissions: Other indirect emissions associated 
with activities that support or supply the Group’s operations. 
We include emissions arising from our third-party-run 
data centres.
In 2015, we contributed £41,000 to support customer 
initiatives via Agents Giving, where we will contribute to the 
costs of the setting up of a charitable activity carried out by 
our customers, for example, paying for the kit to be used at 
a charity football match. This allows for more of the money 
raised by our customers to go directly to the charity through a 
charitable sponsorship fund we set up in 2014 in conjunction 
with Agents Giving. In 2015, the fundraising activities by our 
customers that we have supported will raise nearly £500,000 
for UK charities. 
Environment
Rightmove actively considers its environmental impact and we 
are conscious of playing our part in tackling climate change. 
Rightmove reduces the need for print media and the 
environmental damage that goes with it. Rightmove takes 
care to design the layout of property particulars to reduce the 
total number of pages that need to be printed out in those 
cases where a home hunter does want a physical copy.
Enhanced information on properties also reduces the 
amount of time home hunters waste in visiting properties that 
rapidly turn out to be inappropriate. As a high proportion of 
viewings involve a car journey, any reduction in wasted 
viewings has an environmental beneﬁ t. Rightmove has worked 
hard to increase the number and size of photographs of each 
property, improved the size and added functionality to 
property ﬂ oor plans and has introduced more comprehensive 
map searches and aerial photographs which help home 
hunters to identify the speciﬁ c location of a property. 
Rightmove has added information on which schools are 
closest to the properties listed and the broadband speed 
for the area, all of which combined, provides high quality 
information about properties to reduce the carbon footprint 
generated by prospective buyers making wasted journeys. 
The rightmove.co.uk website includes functionality for our 
customers to display Energy Performance Certiﬁ cates which 
allow prospective buyers to evaluate the energy efﬁ ciency of 
a property they are considering buying, and to identify 
opportunities to improve the energy efﬁ ciency once they 
have purchased the property.
As an internet-based Group with most staff employed in 
two ofﬁ ce locations, we believe our own environmental 
footprint is small. We encourage our staff to take steps to 
address our environmental responsibilities. For instance, 
we continue to operate recycling schemes which were 
established in consultation with local authorities and recycling 
partners. All waste bins were removed from the desks in our 
London and Milton Keynes ofﬁ ces, which encourages and 
increases the amount of recycling we do. 
As an operator of an online property portal, the main 
environmental impact is the power usage of our data centres. 
Our procurement policy is to purchase hardware with the 
best computational performance which uses the least 
electrical power.  Rightmove plc annual report 2015      23
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Methodology 
We have reported on all of the emission sources required under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. We have used the GHG’ s Protocol’ s 
Operational Control consolidation method. We do not have 
responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in 
the above information. 
Health and safety
The Group considers the effective management of health and 
safety to be an integral part of managing its business. During 
2015, we continued our ﬁ re safety, ﬁ rst aid and work-place 
safety training. The Group’ s ongoing policy on health and safety 
is to provide adequate control of the health and safety risks 
arising from work activities, through further consultation with, 
and training of, employees, the provision and maintenance of 
plant and equipment, safe handling and use of all substances 
and the prevention of accidents and causes of ill health.
The Group is required to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 
its reporting year to 31 December 2015. Scope 3 is not yet 
mandatory, however, the Group has again chosen to report 
Scope 3 emissions as it relates to electricity used in data 
centres, in which the Group rents space to house and operate 
various servers, which host our website platforms.

been selected from the emissions conversion factors published annually by 
Defra. https://www.gov.uk/measuring-and-reporting-environmental-impacts-
guidance-for-businesses.
Emissions have also been calculated using an ‘intensity metric’, 
which will enable the Group to monitor how well we are 
controlling emissions on an annual basis, independent of 
ﬂ uctuations in the levels of their activity. As Rightmove is a 
‘people’ business, the most suitable metric is ‘Emissions per 
Employee’, based on the average number of employees during 
the year. The Group’ s emissions per employee are shown in the 
table below.

We will continue to monitor and look for ways to improve 
energy efﬁ ciency.
In January 2016, we submitted our ﬁ rst Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) report, a mandatory energy 
assessment introduced by the Government in 2015. 
The report has highlighted only one area for improvement 
and minor potential savings in relation to sub-metering of 
our ofﬁ ce air conditioning units.  24  rightmove.co.uk

Introduction 
The following sections explain how the Company applies the 
main provisions set out in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code, (the Code) issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC), as required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and meets the relevant information provisions 
of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FCA.
The statement of corporate governance covers the 
following areas:
� The structure and role of the Board and its committees;
�  Relations with the Company’s shareholders and the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM); and
�  The reports of the Audit Committee and Nomination 
Committee including Board effectiveness and evaluation.
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out 
separately in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
42 and 43 and 53 to 66.
The Group’s risk management and internal control 
framework and the principal risks and uncertainties are 
described on pages 17 to 18 and 35. The Directors’ Report 
on pages 38 to 40 also contains information required to be 
included in this statement of corporate governance.
Statement of compliance
The Code sets out the principles and provisions relating to 
good governance of UK listed companies. We are pleased to 
conﬁ rm, that for the year under review, the Group has 
complied fully with the principles and provisions of the Code.
Further information on the Code can be found on the FRC’s 
website at https://frc.org.uk.
The Board’s role
The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the 
overall direction and control of the Group and has the powers 
and duties set out in the relevant laws of England and Wales 
and the Company’s Articles of Association. The Board 
delegates certain matters to the Board committees and 
delegates the detailed implementation of matters approved 
by the Board and the day to day operational aspects of the 
business to the executive directors. The Board’s main 
responsibilities and the key actions carried out during the 
year are set out below: Rightmove plc annual report 2015      27

and depth of talent 
supporting business growth
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters requiring 
speciﬁ c approval. These include:
� The approval of the annual business plan; 
� Review of Group strategy;
� Changes to the Group’s capital structure; 
� Approval of the dividend policy;
� Acquisitions and disposals;
� Appointment and removal of ofﬁ cers of the Company; 
�  Approval of annual and half-year results and shareholder 
communications; and
� System of internal control and risk management.
The Board normally schedules seven or eight meetings each 
year although meetings can be scheduled at short notice at 
the request of any director, if required. In addition to formal 
Board meetings, there is regular informal dialogue between 
all directors.
The Board receives meeting papers sufﬁ ciently in advance 
of the meetings to allow time for review and consideration of 
the documents beforehand. If any director has a concern 
about any aspect of the business conducted at any Board 
meeting, the Company Secretary shall discuss this with the 
director concerned and record their concern or comments in 
the Board minutes. The Board receives monthly management 
and ﬁ nancial reports on the operational and ﬁ nancial 
performance of the business setting out actual and forecast 
ﬁ nancial performance against approved budgets in addition 
to other key performance indicators. The Board also receives 
copies of broker reports and press releases relating to 
the Group. 
Board committees
The Board has established three principal committees, 
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and 
the Nomination Committee, to assist it in the execution of its 
duties. The Chairman of each Committee provides a report 
or update of each meeting of the respective Committee to 
the Board at the subsequent Board meeting.
The Committees’ terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s corporate website, plc.rightmove.co.uk or by 
request from the Company Secretary.
Each of the Committees is authorised, at the Company’s 
expense, to obtain legal or other professional advice to assist 
in carrying out its duties. No person other than a Committee 
member is entitled to attend the meetings of these 
Committees, except by invitation of the Chairman of that 
Committee. 
Current membership of the Committees is shown on 
page 30. The composition of these Committees is reviewed 
regularly, taking into consideration the recommendations of 
the Nomination Committee.  28  rightmove.co.uk

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Division of responsibilities
The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer are separate and there are clear written guidelines to support their division 
of responsibilities. The key responsibilities of the Board members are summarised below:
Chairman � The leadership and governance of the Board;
�  Ensuring its effectiveness by creating and managing constructive relationships between the 
executive and non-executive directors;
�  Ensures there is ongoing and effective communication between the Board and its key 
shareholders; and
�  With the assistance of the Company Secretary, setting the Board’s agenda and ensuring that 
adequate time is available for discussions and that the Board receives sufﬁ cient, pertinent, 
timely and clear information.
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer � Responsible for the day to day management of the Group;
� Responsible for the operations and results of the Group;
�  Developing the Group’s objectives and strategy and following Board approval, the successful 
execution of strategy;
� Responsible for the effective and ongoing communication with shareholders; and
� Chairing the Executive Committee.
Non-executive directors � Constructively challenge the executive directors; and
� Monitor the delivery of the strategy within the risk and control framework set by the Board.
The non-executive directors bring wide and varied commercial experience and independent 
judgement to the Board and the Committees’ deliberations. 
The breadth of management, ﬁ nancial and listed company experience of the non-executive 
directors is described in the biographical details on pages 24 to 25 and demonstrates a range 
of business expertise that provides the right mix of skills and experience given the size of 
the Group.
Senior Independent Director � Acting in an advisory capacity to the Chairman;
� Deputising for the Chairman if required;
� Serving as an intermediary for other directors when necessary;
�  Being available to shareholders if they have concerns which they have not been able to 
resolve through the normal channels of the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer or other 
executive directors for which such contact is inappropriate; and
�  Conducting an annual review of the performance of the Chairman and, in the event it should 
be necessary, convening a meeting of the non-executive directors.
Company Secretary � Monitoring compliance with appropriate Board procedures; 
� Advising the Board on corporate governance matters;
�  Assisting the Chairman in ensuring that all the directors have full and timely access 
to relevant information; and
� Assisting the Chairman by organising induction and training programmes.
In addition to her duties as Company Secretary to the Board, the Company Secretary also 
acts as Secretary to the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is one of the matters reserved 
for the Board. 30  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Corporate governance report continued
Board diversity 
We are committed to a Board comprised of directors from 
different backgrounds, diverse and relevant experience, 
perspectives, skills and knowledge. We believe that diversity, 
including gender diversity, amongst directors contributes 
towards a high performing and effective Board. We strive 
to maintain the optimal balance.
As at 31 December 2015, 25% (2014: 25%) of Board 
members were female. Consequently, the Board has met its 
minimum target representation level to be achieved by 2015, 
as recommended by the Davies Review.
Board independence 
The Code provides that the Board should identify in the 
Annual Report each non-executive director that it considers 
to be independent. That is, to determine whether the director 
is independent in character and judgment and whether there 
are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, 
or could appear to affect, the director’s judgment.
The Board reviews non-executive director independence 
on an annual basis taking into account such factors as their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate during 
meetings. The Board considers that there is an appropriate 
balance between the executive (37.5%) and non-executive 
directors (62.5%) and that all non-executive directors are fully 
independent of management and independent in character 
and judgment. 
To safeguard their independence, a director is not entitled 
to vote on any matter in which they may be conﬂ icted or have 
a personal interest. Where necessary, directors are required to 
absent themselves from a meeting of the Board while such 
matters are being discussed. In cases of doubt, the Chairman 
of the Board is responsible for determining whether a conﬂ ict 
of interest exists. 
The Chairman is also the Chairman of another publicly 
listed company. The executive directors do not hold any 
other non-executive directorships or commitments requiring 
disclosure under the Code.

Re-election to the Board
Directors are appointed and may be removed in accordance 
with the Articles of Association of the Company and the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. All directors are 
subject to election at the ﬁ rst AGM following their appointment 
and to re-election at intervals of no more than three years in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
However, following changes to the Code, all directors will seek 
re-election at the 2016 AGM, in accordance with the Code 
provision B.7.1.

In addition to the above meetings, the Chairman conducts 
meetings with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors being present when required. Peter 
Williams, the Senior Independent Director, chaired a meeting 
of the Board at which the performance of the Chairman was 
also reviewed, without the presence of the Chairman.
Indemniﬁ cation of directors
The Articles of Association of the Company allow for a 
qualifying third-party indemnity provision between the 
Company and its directors and ofﬁ cers, which remains in 
force at the date of this report. The Group has also arranged 
directors’ and ofﬁ cers’ insurance cover in respect of legal 
action against the directors. Neither our indemnity nor the 
insurance provides cover in the event that a director is proven 
to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
The Group has written policies in compliance with an 
internal code of securities dealings in relation to the process 
and timing for dealing in shares, which is equivalent to the 
Model Code published in the Listing Rules. The Code applies 
to all directors, other persons discharging managerial 
responsibility and other relevant employees.
Shareholder relations
The Board is accountable to shareholders for the performance 
and activities of the Company and welcomes the opportunities 
to engage with shareholders.
Within the terms of the regulatory framework, the 
Company has conducted regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders through ongoing meetings with institutional 
investors and research ﬁ rms to discuss strategy, operating 
performance and ﬁ nancial performance. Contact in the UK is 
principally with the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and the Finance 
Director. The Chairman attends certain investor meetings in 
the UK and typically participates in the USA investor meetings. 
The Senior Independent Director is also available to 
shareholders if they wish to supplement their communication, 
or if contact through the normal channels is inappropriate.
The Board is kept informed of the views and opinions of 
those with an interest in the Company through reports from 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and the Finance Director, as well as 
reports from the Company’s joint brokers, UBS and Numis.
Shareholders are also kept up to date with the Group’s 
activities through the half year results statement and Annual 
Report and the investor relations section of its website, at 
plc.rightmove.co.uk, which provides details of all the directors, 
latest news including ﬁ nancial results, investor presentations 
and Stock Exchange announcements. 
Annual General Meeting
The AGM is an opportunity for shareholders to vote on certain 
aspects of the Company’s business, and to ask questions of 
the directors, who will also be available for discussions with 
shareholders prior to and after the meeting. The AGM will 
be held on 5 May 2016 at the ofﬁ ces of UBS Limited at 
1 Finsbury Avenue, London EC2M 2PP .
The Company will arrange for the Annual Report and 
related papers to be available on the Company’s corporate 
website at plc.rightmove.co.uk or posted to shareholders 
(where requested) so as to allow at least 20 working days 
for consideration before the AGM. 
The Company also complies with the Code with the 
separation of all resolutions put to the vote of shareholders. 
The Company proactively encourages shareholders to vote 
at general meetings by providing electronic voting for 
shareholders who hold their shares through the Crest system 
and provides personalised proxy cards to ensure that all votes 
are clearly identiﬁ able. The Company presently takes votes at 
general meetings on a show of hands on the grounds of 
practicality due to the limited number of shareholders in 
attendance. Votes are taken by a poll at any shareholder 
meeting where legally required. All proxy votes are counted 
and the level of proxy votes including abstentions lodged for 
each resolution are reported after each resolution and 
published on the Company’s website. 32  rightmove.co.uk

Audit Committee report
Ashley Martin
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the 2015 report of the Audit 
Committee (the Committee).
The Committee is an essential part of Rightmove’s 
governance framework to which the Board has delegated 
oversight of the Group’s ﬁ nancial reporting, internal controls, 
outsourced internal audit function and the relationship with 
the external auditors.
The terms of reference for the Committee were reviewed 
during the year with the key responsibilities as follows:
Financial 
reporting
�  Reviewing the ﬁ nancial statements and results 
announcements and ensuring compliance with 
relevant regulations; and 
�  Ensuring the Group’s accounting policies are 
appropriate, consistently applied and supported 
by relevant judgments and estimates.
Internal control 
and internal
�  Reviewing the processes and systems to identify 
and mitigate both ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial risks; 
�  Approving the internal audit plan, reviewing the 
results and considering the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function; and
�  Reviewing the procedures for detecting and 
managing the risk of fraud.
External audit �  Make recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment of the external auditor, overseeing 
the relationship and assessing the effectiveness 
of the external audit process. 
A signiﬁ cant change in the Group’s internal control framework 
last year was the appointment in December 2014 of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to provide an 
outsourced internal audit function known as ‘Rightmove 
Assurance’. During the year we have established a Rightmove 
Assurance Terms of Reference and approved a plan for a two 
year cycle of work focusing on both core ﬁ nancial processes 
and specialist reviews of certain key risk areas. We will 
continue to monitor and review the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control and risk management systems with 
the support of this new function.
The Committee welcomes the changes to the revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting, published 
in September 2014.  These changes apply to the Group 
for the ﬁ rst time this year and have been areas of focus for 
the Committee.
This report also outlines the signiﬁ cant accounting matters 
which received our particular focus during the year. It seeks to 
explain why the issues are considered signiﬁ cant and together 
with the external auditors’ report provides additional context 
for understanding the Group’s accounting policies and 
ﬁ nancial statements for the year.
In May 2015 Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar retired 
from the Board and Committee. On behalf of the Committee, 
I would like to thank them for the wisdom and experience they 
have brought to the Committee’s deliberations over many 
years. We were pleased to welcome Peter Williams and 
Rakhi Parekh as members of the Committee from May 2015.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions 
about the work of the Committee.

Committee with effect from 7 May 2015. 
The Committee is comprised entirely of independent 
non-executive directors, the biographical details of whom 
can be found on pages 24 to 25. The Board is satisﬁ ed that 
both Ashley Martin and Peter Williams have recent and 
relevant ﬁ nancial skills and experience. Both have professional 
qualiﬁ cations with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
England and Wales. Rightmove plc annual report 2015      33
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The Finance Director and the Head of Finance are normally 
invited to attend the meetings as well as the external auditor, 
KPMG and the internal auditor, PwC. Other relevant people 
from the business are also invited to attend certain meetings 
in order to provide a deeper level of insight into certain key 
issues and developments. The Committee regularly meets 
separately with the external and internal auditors without 
others being present.
The quorum for meetings of the Committee is two members. 
Appointments to the Committee are for a period of up to three 
years, extendable by no more than two additional three-year 
periods, so long as members continue to be independent.
The Committee Chairman briefs the Board on the matters 
discussed at each Committee meeting and the effectiveness of 
the operation of the Committee was reviewed as part of the 
effectiveness review of the Board and its committees in 
December 2015. 
Principal activities of the Committee during the year
The principal activities of the Committee through the year, 
and the manner in which it discharged its responsibilities are 
described below:
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to ﬁ nancial 
reporting is to review with both management and the external 
auditor the appropriateness of the half-year results statement 
and the Annual Report and ﬁ nancial statements including, 
amongst other matters:
�  The quality and appropriateness of accounting policies and 
practices;
�  The clarity of the disclosures and compliance with relevant 
ﬁ nancial reporting standards and governance reporting 
requirements; and
�  Key accounting issues or matters in which signiﬁ cant 
judgements have been applied.
At the request of the Board, the Committee was asked to 
consider whether the 2015 Annual Report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, and 
has concluded that this is the case.
The signiﬁ cant areas of judgment considered by the 
Committee in relation to the 2015 Annual Report and how 
these were addressed were:
Revenue recognition
The timing of revenue recognition in relation to the billing of 
subscription fees and additional products and services and 
the accounting for any membership offers to customers with 
discounted or free periods. This was a prime area of audit 
focus with KPMG performing detailed analytical procedures 
using computer-assisted audit techniques throughout the 
year on amounts billed to the two largest customer groups 
(Agency and New Homes), together with the billing of 
Overseas customers, investigating any anomalies and outliers 
identiﬁ ed and providing detailed reporting to the Committee 
in this regard. The Committee discussed any reported 
anomalies highlighted by KPMG ensuring that adequate 
explanations were received from management in line with 
their business understanding.
In addition the Committee received regular updates from 
management discussing current customer offers and their 
impact on revenue recognition. 
As this area is of higher audit risk the Committee also 
received detailed verbal and written reporting from KPMG on 
this matter. The Committee was satisﬁ ed with the explanations 
provided and conclusions reached.
Share-based incentives and the related deferred 
tax balance
The external auditors and Committee discussed the 
audit plan and assessed the risks associated with share-
based incentives and the related deferred tax balances and 
concluded that it was no longer a signiﬁ cant audit risk area. 
It remains an area of judgement for management given the 
technical complexity of the calculations and the assumptions 
around the rate at which the related deferred tax asset is likely 
to reverse.
Internal audit
The Group established an outsourced internal audit function 
provided by PwC during 2015 known as Rightmove 
Assurance. The aim of Rightmove Assurance is to provide 
independent and objective assurance on the effectiveness of 
internal control, risk management and governance processes. 34  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Corporate governance report continued
During the year and in accordance with the approved internal 
audit plan, Rightmove Assurance has carried out reviews 
in respect of certain core ﬁ nancial processes, the robustness 
of the risk management framework in the context of the new 
Corporate Governance Code, options in relation to the 
provision of mortgage content on the www.rightmove.co.uk 
website, the identiﬁ cation and prevention of certain fraudulent 
online activities by third parties against Rightmove and the 
systems and controls in place to prevent the loss or malicious 
publication of Rightmove data. Reports setting out their 
principal ﬁ ndings and agreed management actions were 
discussed by the Committee.
External audit
KPMG has been the Group’s auditors since 2000. Following 
the 2012 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code by 
the Financial Reporting Council, a decision was made by the 
Committee to formally tender the provision of audit and 
taxation services to the Group. A comprehensive tender and 
review process was concluded in March 2013. The Committee 
was satisﬁ ed that the skills and depth of industry knowledge in 
the team remained very strong and combined with the fresh 
perspective of the new audit partner decided that KPMG 
should be re-appointed as the Group’s auditor, with Karen 
Wightman taking over responsibility as lead audit partner
The EU Audit Regulations have not yet been formally 
enacted in the UK, however, in October 2015 the Department 
for Business Innovation & Skills consultation on the legislative 
implementation of the EU Audit Directive and Regulation, 
commented that a tender of an audit engagement resulting in 
the reappointment of the incumbent auditor for an accounting 
period beginning up to 10 years before the application of the 
new EU Audit Directive and Regulation, effective 17 June 
2016 (‘The EU Regulation’), should be treated as a tender for 
the purposes of the transitional provisions. As KPMG were 
reappointed in 2013 following a competitive tender process, 
we therefore anticipate Rightmove’s next requirement to 
tender its audit will be for the 2023 calendar accounting year. 
These timeframes will also ensure compliance with the 
provisions of the CMA Statutory Audit Services Order 2014.
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every ﬁ ve years. The current lead 
partner, Karen Wightman, has been in place for three years. 
The Committee also approved the fees of KPMG during 
the year.
Effectiveness of the external audit process
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent 
on a number of matters. These include the quality, continuity, 
experience and training of audit personnel, business 
understanding, technical knowledge and the degree of rigour 
applied in the review processes of the work undertaken, 
together with appropriate audit risk identiﬁ cation at the start 
of the audit cycle. 
The Committee evaluated the effectiveness of the audit 
process in addressing these matters together with input 
from management. Areas the Committee considered in this 
review included the quality of audit planning and execution, 
engagement with the Committee and management, quality 
of reporting and capability and experience of the audit team. 
For the 2015 ﬁ nancial year, the Committee were satisﬁ ed 
that there had been appropriate focus and challenge on 
the primary areas of audit risk and concluded that the 
performance of KPMG remained efﬁ cient and effective.
Non-audit services
The Committee also discussed its responsibilities to safeguard 
audit objectivity and independence as well as the needs of the 
business and agreed that it was practical in certain limited 
cases for the auditor to be assigned to other non-audit project 
work due to their knowledge and expertise of the business. 
In November 2015 the Committee agreed a policy that 
management be given authority to incur permitted non-audit 
fees up to 50% of the annual agreed audit fee in any ﬁ nancial 
year without the prior approval of the Committee. Thereafter 
all additional fees will be referred to the Committee in 
advance, subject to a cap on permitted non-audit fees at 70% 
of the average audit fees over the three preceding ﬁ nancial 
years, in line with the forthcoming new EU Regulations. 
Permitted non-audit fees exclude those services prohibited by 
the EU requirements, in particular all tax services. Non-audit 
services required by legislation are not subject to the cap.
 In 2015 the non-audit fees were £5,000 in relation to 
other advisory services and were £10,000 in relation to tax 
compliance and advice and are fully disclosed in Note 6 of 
the ﬁ nancial statements. As a result of the forthcoming 
EU regulations on permitted non-audit services, KPMG will 
no longer be able to provide tax compliance and advisory 
services and we have therefore appointed PwC to provide 
these services in 2016. Rightmove plc annual report 2015      35
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Internal controls 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and has established a framework of ﬁ nancial 
and other controls which is periodically reviewed in accordance 
with the FRC Internal Control: Guidance to Directors 
publication for its effectiveness.
The Board has taken, and will continue to take, appropriate 
measures to ensure that the chances of ﬁ nancial irregularities 
occurring are reduced as far as reasonably possible by 
improving the quality of information at all levels in the Group, 
fostering an open environment and ensuring that the ﬁ nancial 
analysis is rigorously applied. Any system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The Group’s management have established the 
procedures necessary to ensure that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
signiﬁ cant risks to the Group. These procedures have 
been in place for the whole of the ﬁ nancial year ended 
31 December 2015 and up to the date of the approval of 
these ﬁ nancial statements and they are reviewed regularly.
The key elements of the system of internal control are:
�  Major commercial, strategic, competitive and ﬁ nancial risks 
are formally identiﬁ ed, quantiﬁ ed and assessed, discussed 
with the executive directors, after which they are considered 
by the Board; 
�  A comprehensive system of planning, budgeting and 
monitoring Group results. This includes monthly 
management reporting and monitoring of performance 
against both budgets and forecasts with explanations for 
all signiﬁ cant variances;
�  An organisational structure with clearly deﬁ ned lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority;
�  Clearly deﬁ ned policies for capital expenditure and 
investment exist, including appropriate authorisation levels, 
with larger capital projects, acquisitions and disposals 
requiring Board approval;
�  A comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity 
plan based upon:
 –  co-hosting of the rightmove.co.uk website across three 
separate locations which is regularly tested and reviewed;
 –  the capability for employees to remote work from home or 
a third party location in the event of a loss of one our 
premises which has been tested for both our London and 
Milton Keynes ofﬁ ces during the year.
�  Regular testing of the security of the IT systems and 
platforms, regular backups of key data and ongoing threat 
monitoring to protect against the risk of cyber attack;
�  A treasury function which manages cash ﬂ ow forecasts and 
cash on deposit and counterparty risk and is responsible for 
monitoring compliance with banking agreements, where 
appropriate; and
�  Whistleblowing and bribery policies of which all employees 
are made aware, to enable concerns to be raised either with 
line management or, if appropriate, conﬁ dentially outside the 
line management.
Through the procedures outlined above, the Board, with 
advice from the Committee, has considered all signiﬁ cant 
aspects of internal control for the year and up to the date of 
this Annual Report. No signiﬁ cant failings or weaknesses were 
identiﬁ ed during this review. However, had there been any 
such failings or weaknesses, the Board conﬁ rms that 
necessary actions would have been taken to remedy them. 36  rightmove.co.uk

Nomination Committee report
Scott Forbes
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the 2015 report of the Nomination 
Committee (the Committee).
The Committee’s role is to regularly review the structure, 
size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and 
experience) of the Board, with a view to ensuring the 
continued ability of the Group to compete effectively in the 
marketplace, and make recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes.
The terms of reference for the Committee were reviewed 
during the year with the key responsibilities as follows:
Board evaluation �  Evaluate the performance of the Board both 
collectively and individually against performance 
criteria. Determine the level of Board 
effectiveness based on the assessment.
Organisation and 
succession 
planning
�  Give full consideration to the organisation and 
succession plan in order to identify the executive 
and non-executive resources required for the 
Company to meet its strategic objectives.
In 2015 the Committee reviewed the organisation and 
succession plans and conducted its tri-annual, externally 
facilitated Board evaluation and Board skills and 
composition review.
The external Board evaluation was conducted by Echelon 
Compensation Partners (Echelon) and the Board skills and 
composition review by Korn Ferry International (Korn Ferry). 
Echelon have no other connection with the Company. Korn 
Ferry, an executive search ﬁ rm, conducted a Board review 
in 2012 and successfully placed Peter Williams and Rakhi 
(Parekh) Goss-Custard. Further details on the Board skills 
and composition review can be found in the section on Board 
effectiveness and evaluation on page 37 of my report below.
Following completion of their third term of service to the 
Board, both Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar retired from 
the Board and Committees after the 2015 AGM. The Board 
now consists of eight directors, including ﬁ ve non-executive 
directors, four of which are considered to be independent. 
Peter Williams was appointed Senior Independent Director 
and Remuneration Committee Chairman in May 2015.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions 
about the work of the Committee.

Membership 
The Committee is comprised entirely of non-executive 
directors, the biographical details which can be found on 
pages 24 to 25. As at 31 December 2015 three out of the four 
members of the Committee were considered by the Board to 
be independent. The quorum for meetings of the Committee 
is two members. At the request of the Committee Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer is normally invited to attend the 
meeting to discuss the annual organisation and succession 
plan.
The Chairman of the Company may not chair the 
Committee in connection with any discussion about the 
appointment of his successor to the chairmanship of the 
Company. In these circumstances, the Senior Independent 
Director will take the chair. 
Appointments are for a period of up to three years, 
extendable by no more than two additional three year 
periods, so long as members continue to be independent.
Principal activities of the Committee during 2015
During the year the Committee has:
� Reviewed the Board composition;
� Reviewed the Board committees composition;
�  Approved the plans for the organisation and succession 
of the executive directors and senior management;  Rightmove plc annual report 2015      37
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
�  Agreed the process for and considered the outcome of 
the Board’s external evaluation;
�  Considered the diversity of the Board and agreed the 
policy regarding gender composition on the Board; and
� Conducted an annual review of its terms of reference.  
Board induction and training
All new non-executive directors joining the Board undertake 
a tailored induction programme to meet their individual needs. 
This covers for example: the operation and activities of the 
Group (including meeting with members of the senior 
management team, spending a day on the road with a sales 
director meeting our customers and attendance at an Agency 
seminar), the role of the Board and the decision making 
matters reserved to it, the responsibilities of the Board 
Committees; and the strategic challenges and opportunities 
facing the Group.
There are procedures in place for individual Board 
members to receive training and to seek the advice and 
services of independent professional advisers, at the Group’s 
expense, where speciﬁ c expertise or training is required in 
furtherance of their duties. 
Board effectiveness and evaluation 
The Board is committed to undertaking annual reviews of its 
own performance and also the performance of its Committees 
and individual directors. For the past two years, the Board has 
undertaken an internal self-assessment. This year , Echelon, 
an external ﬁ rm of consultants, was appointed to undertake 
an independent review of the performance of the Board and its 
Committees together with a Board skills and composition review 
which was undertaken by Korn Ferry . 
The external Board evaluation was conducted by Echelon 
in the fourth quarter of 2015. The evaluation results including 
anonymous ratings and comments were summarised in a report 
and discussed by the Committee and Board in December 2015. 
The evaluation concluded that the Board and Committees 
operate at a high degree of effectiveness with all individuals 
contributing with plenty of open debate and challenge from all 
directors. Recommendations for continued development included 
remaining proactive in the search for the right talent, both at the 
Board and executive level; further enhancing Board diversity by 
recruiting more female non-executives or non-executives from 
different ethnic backgrounds; and ensuring that the Group 
strategy continues to be both communicated and understood 
at levels beyond the executive management team. 
An internally facilitated review of the performance of the Board 
and its Committees will again be conducted during 2016.
The Board skills and composition review involved a series 
of Korn Ferry independent interviews with each executive and 
non-executive director. Questions were intended to identify 
the Group’s strategy and the ideal capabilities and experience 
required on the Board that will best support the Group’s effort 
to achieve its strategic objectives. The Board skills and 
composition review also explored corporate governance 
requirements including compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, best practice and diversity policies. Priority 
capabilities and experience were cross-referenced against the 
proﬁ le of the current Board both at the present time and as 
of the anticipated dates that directors will retire in order to 
identify gaps against which the Board’s recruitment policy 
is based.
The work of Korn Ferry was substantially complete in 
December 2015, with the results of the review to be 
distributed in a report to the Committee in early 2016. 
The Committee will review the report and discuss its 
recommendations with the Board as part of an ongoing 
process to ensure that the Board operates at a high level of 
effectiveness fortiﬁ ed by the most appropriate resources in 
support of the Group’s business strategy. 38  rightmove.co.uk

2,322,314 are held in treasury with the remainder having been 
cancelled. A resolution seeking to renew this authority will be 
put to shareholders at the AGM on 5 May 2016. 
Shares held in trust

Dividend
An interim dividend of 16.0p (2014: 13.0p) per ordinary 
share was paid in respect of the half year period on 
6 November 2015 to shareholders on the register of 
members at the close of business on 9 October 2015. 
The directors are recommending a ﬁ nal dividend for the 
year of 27.0p (2014: 22.0p) per ordinary share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 16.0p, makes a total for the 
year of 43.0p (2014: 35.0p), amounting to £40,854,000 
(2014: £33,991,000). Subject to shareholders’ approval at

dividend will be paid on 3 June 2016 to shareholders on the 
register of members at the close of business on 6 May 2016.
Share capital
The shares in issue including 2,322,314 shares held in 
treasury (2014: 2,505,430) at the year end amounted to 
97,741,977 (2014: 99,993,317) ordinary shares of £0.01, 
with a nominal value of  £977,419 (2014: £999,933). The

One of the items of special business to be addressed 
at this AGM relates to the requirement in the Companies 
(Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009, which came 
into force on 3 August 2009 that all general meetings must 
be held on not less than 21 clear days’ notice unless 
shareholders approve a shorter notice period. At the 2015 
AGM, a resolution was passed allowing the Company to call 
general meetings (other than AGMs) on not less than 14 clear 
days’ notice. As this authority will expire at the 2016 AGM, 
a resolution will be proposed to renew this authority. 
The Company is also seeking approval for the 
disapplication of pre-emption rights up to a maximum ten 
percent of issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
(excuding shares held in treasury), in line with the revised 
Statement of Principles of the Pre-Emption Group.
Auditor
KPMG LLP has conﬁ rmed its willingness to continue in ofﬁ ce 
as auditor of the Group. In accordance with section 489 of 
the Companies Act 2006, separate resolutions for the 
re-appointment of KPMG LLP as auditor of the Group and 
for the Audit Committee to determine their remuneration will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM of the Company. 
Audit information
So far as the directors in ofﬁ ce at the date of signing of the 
report are aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the auditor is unaware and each such director has 
taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
auditor is aware of that information.
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Our report of greenhouse gas emissions in line with 
UK mandatory reporting regulation is provided in the 
Corporate Responsibility section of the Strategic Report 
on pages 22 to 23. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board has concluded that the 2015 Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the necessary 
information for shareholders and other readers of the 
accounts to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. Rightmove plc annual report 2015      41

Governance | Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain 
the parent Company’s  transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the 
parent Company and enable them to ensure that its ﬁ nancial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. 
Under that law, they are required to prepare the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent Company ﬁ nancial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law, the directors must not approve the 
ﬁ nancial statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their proﬁ t or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
�  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
�  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
�  state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
�  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business.  42  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report
Performance and reward
In light of the combination of strong Group and executive 
directors’ performance during the year, the Remuneration 
Committee considers the remuneration paid to the executive 
directors to reﬂ ect fairly their performance during the year. 
As a result of the ﬁ nancial and operational results of the 
Group, including growth in underlying operating proﬁ t before 
tax
(1)
 of 16%, the annual bonus entitlement for executive 
directors was 100% of the maximum for 2015. The Company 
consolidated its market leading position during the year 
despite increased and new competition and also achieved 
substantial growth in other revenue streams resulting in a 
maximum bonus becoming payable. In aggregate, the 
performance over the year signiﬁ cantly outperformed the 
business plan and exceeded the maximum incentive plan 
targets set at the start of the year and therefore the 
Committee were satisﬁ ed that it was appropriate to pay 
maximum bonuses.  
With regard to the Group’s longer-term performance, 
reﬂ ecting the successful implementation of its growth strategy 
over the last three ﬁ nancial years, the 2013 Performance Share 
Plan awards (measuring performance from 1 January 2013 to 
31 December 2015) will vest in full in March 2016 as a result 
of delivering normalised EPS
(2)
 growth of over 79% and 
TSR growth of 198% over the performance period, which 
signiﬁ cantly exceeded the respective growth targets set 
of 40% and Index +25% over the three year period. The 
Committee having tested the condition, determined that this 
result signiﬁ cantly outperformed the maximum incentive plan 
targets set at the start of the performance period placing 
Rightmove well into the top quartile of performance across the 
FTSE 250 Index, and so was satisﬁ ed that the awards should 
vest in full.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for Rightmove plc (the Company) together with its subsidiary 
companies (the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
The report is divided into two distinct sections, the 
Remuneration Policy Report and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. 
In accordance with the new regulations you were asked 
to vote separately on these two reports at our AGM held on 
7 May 2014. The three year remuneration policy received 
overwhelming support. We do not propose to make any 
changes to this policy. For ease of reference, we present the 
policy on pages 43 to 52. 
Our remuneration framework is designed to ensure we 
reward and incentivise our people to deliver our strategy with 
a clear emphasis on performance-related pay to reﬂ ect the 
culture of the Group. The overall policy provides below market 
levels of ﬁ xed pay but with above market levels of variable pay 
opportunity, subject to the achievement of challenging 
performance measures linked to the Group KPIs. Variable pay 
is biased toward long-term sustainable performance, through 
a high level of annual bonus deferral into shares, long-term 
incentive awards and share ownership guidelines. We believe 
that the remuneration policy which you approved in 2014 
continues to remain appropriate. 
As described in the Strategic Report, our 2015 results 
show strong organic revenue and proﬁ t growth. The increase 
in proﬁ t achieved this year once again demonstrates the 
strength of the Rightmove business model and brand and 
the effectiveness of our management team.

Further details in relation to the remuneration policy, which is 
expected to operate for at least another year are set out on 
pages 43 to 52. We are committed to maintaining an open 
and transparent dialogue with shareholders. We have valued 
the engagement with, and support of shareholders and we 
remain focused on disclosing clearly how much our executive 
directors earn and how this is linked closely to performance.
In 2016 the Committee will turn its attention to the new 
three year remuneration policy framework to be put to a vote 
at the AGM in 2017.
Peter Williams
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration policy for 2016
The Committee continues to believe that the current 
remuneration policy of providing below market ﬁ xed pay 
(base salary, pension and minimal beneﬁ ts) and above market 
variable pay opportunity (short and long-term incentives) for 
delivery of challenging performance targets remains 
appropriate for a growth orientated Group. 
In summary, the key elements to the remuneration policy 
are as follows:
�  We remain committed to a pay model of below comparative 
median benchmarks on ﬁ xed pay and an above median 
incentive opportunity.
�  Executive directors are to receive inﬂ ationary adjustments 
to base salary levels in line with all employees. Up to 6% of 
base salary is contributed to the Group pension scheme. 
�  The annual bonus opportunity provides that 60% of any 
bonus earned is deferred into the Company’s shares for 
a period of two years.
�  Annual award levels under the Company’s Performance 
Share Plan are granted at 200% of salary with challenging 
underlying earnings per share growth targets. 
�  Clawback will continue to operate in relation to both 
deferred annual bonus awards and Performance Share Plan 
awards. The mechanism through which the clawback can 
be implemented enables the Committee to (i) reduce the 
cash bonus earned in a subsequent year and/or reduce 
outstanding DSP/PSP share awards (i.e. withholding 
provisions may be used to effect a recovery) or (ii) for the 
Committee to require that a net of tax balancing cash 
payment be made to the Company.
�  The existing share ownership guidelines will be 200% 
of base salary for the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and 100% 
of base salary for other executive directors. 44  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued
�  Executive directors should have below market levels of base 
salary, minimal beneﬁ ts (and only beneﬁ ts which are made 
available on the same basis to all Rightmove employees), 
but with above market levels of variable pay potential. 
This arrangement is designed to best align the interests of 
the executive directors with the interests of shareholders 
and to reﬂ ect the performance driven culture of the 
Company. The Company will generally review market levels 
of remuneration for executive directors with the assistance 
of external, independent remuneration consultants and with 
shareholder consultation every three years.
�  Having reviewed executive director remuneration against the 
market every three years, further changes to remuneration 
should be made infrequently and those changes made each 
year should, in most instances, be directly linked to the 
policies applied to all employees (speciﬁ cally with regard to 
cost of living rises in base salary and changes in beneﬁ ts).
�  Executive directors should be principally rewarded for the 
overall success of the business for which they have 
collective responsibility. The Group has key short-term and 
medium/long-term goals and executive directors should be 
incentivised against these goals. 
�  Executive directors should not be able to gain signiﬁ cantly 
from short-term successes which subsequently prove not to 
be consistent with growing the overall value of the business. 
Hence a majority of any bonus payable in relation to short-
term strategic goals is required to be taken in the form of 
shares in the Company which are deferred for a further two 
years after the bonus target has been achieved.
The following table provides an overview of the Committee’s 
remuneration policy, which has been designed 
to reﬂ ect the principles described above: 
Introduction
This report sets out the Company’s policy on directors’ 
remuneration for the forthcoming year, and so far as 
practicable, for subsequent years, as well as information on 
remuneration paid to directors for the ﬁ nancial year ended 
31 December 2015. This report has been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (together the Act) 
and the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
In accordance with the Act this report has been divided 
into two sections: a Policy Report and an Annual Report 
on Remuneration. The Policy Report was put to a binding 
shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and received more than 
98% votes in favour with an ‘Effective Date’ of 7 May 2014 for 
the purposes of complying with the Act. In practice, however, 
the Remuneration Committee (herein referred to as the 
Committee throughout this report) applied the policy detailed 
below from the start of 2014 and expects to apply it 
throughout the three year policy period that commenced from 
the Effective Date. For ease of reference, the Policy Report 
has been represented, albeit with some changes to references 
and with the removal of the performance scenario charts. 
A copy of the original report can be found on the Company 
website at plc.rightmove.co.uk. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2016 
AGM. The parts of the report which have been audited have 
been highlighted as required by the Act.
Remuneration Policy Report (the Policy Report) 
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company and has been prepared 
in accordance with the Act. The policy has been developed 
after taking into account Rightmove’s pay philosophy that our 
executives should be rewarded with demonstrably lower than 
market base salaries and beneﬁ ts and higher than market 
equity rewards contingent upon the achievement of 
challenging performance targets in accordance with the ‘best 
practice’ principles set out in the Code and the views of our 
major shareholders.
The key principles of the Committee’s policy are as follows:
�  Remuneration arrangements should be simple to explain, 
understand and administer. 
�  Remuneration arrangements should be designed to provide 
executive directors with the opportunity to receive a share in 
the future growth and development of the Group which is 
regarded as fair by both other employees and shareholders.  
This approach should allow the Company to attract and 
retain the dynamic, self-motivated individuals who are critical 
to the success of the business.

Performance 
criteria
Salary To provide a base 
salary which will 
attract and retain high 
calibre executives to 
execute the Group’s 
business strategy.
Base salaries are normally 
reviewed annually, with changes 
effective from 1 January.
When considering the executive’s 
eligibility for a salary increase, 
the Committee considers the 
following points:
�  size and responsibilities 
of the role;
�  individual and Group 
performance;
�  increases awarded to the 
wider workforce; and
�  broader economic and 
inﬂ ationary conditions.
Executive directors are 
benchmarked against external 
market data periodically (generally 
every three years). Relevant market 
comparators are selected for 
comparison, which include other 
companies of a similar size and 
complexity. The Committee 
considers benchmark data, 
alongside a broad review of the 
individual’ s skills and experience, 
performance and internal relativities. 
The current salaries are set out 
on page 54.
These salary levels will be eligible 
for increases during the period 
that the remuneration policy 
operates from the Effective Date. 
During this time, salaries 
may be increased each year 
(in percentage of salary terms) 
in line with those of the wider 
workforce (after taking into account 
the annual salary budget and 
performance related increases 
within the overall salary budget). 
Increases beyond those linked 
to the workforce (in percentage 
of salary terms) may be awarded 
in certain circumstances such as 
where there is a change in 
responsibility, experience or a 
signiﬁ cant increase in the scale of 
the role and/or size, value and/or 
complexity of the Group.
The Committee considers both 
individual and Group performance 
in a broad context when 
determining base salary increases. 
Beneﬁ ts To provide simple, 
cost-effective, 
employee beneﬁ ts 
which are the same 
as those offered to 
the wider workforce.
The executive directors are 
enrolled in the Group’s private 
medical insurance scheme and 
receive life assurance cover equal 
to four times base salary. 
Additionally, all executive 
directors are members of the 
Group’s medical cash plan.
The value of beneﬁ ts may vary 
from year to year depending on 
the cost to the Company from 
third party providers.
Not applicable
Pension To provide a
basic, cost-effective,
long-term retirement 
beneﬁ t.
The Group operates a stakeholder 
pension plan for employees under 
which the employer contributes 
6% of base salary subject to the 
employee contributing a minimum 
of 3% of base salary. 
The Company does not 
contribute to any personal pension 
arrangements.
Whilst executives are not 
obliged to join, the Company 
operates a pension salary 
exchange arrangement whereby 
executives can exchange part of 
their salary for Company paid 
pension contributions. Where 
executives exchange salary and 
this reduces the Company’s 
National Insurance Contributions 
the Company credits the entire 
saving to the executive’s pension.
Company contributions of up to 
6% of base salary subject to the

Plan (DSP)
To incentivise and

Rewards the 
achievement of 
annual ﬁ nancial and 
operational goals.
The annual bonus comprises a 
cash award (40% of any bonus 
earned) and a DSP award (60% 
of any bonus earned).  
Deferred shares will vest after 
two years and be potentially 
forfeitable during that period. 
Payments under the annual 
bonus plan may be subject to 
clawback in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial results or misconduct.
Maximum (% salary):
125% of base salary. 
The bonus is determined based 
on performance against a range 
of key performance indicators. 
The primary bonus metric will 
be proﬁ t-based (e.g. underlying 
operating proﬁ t before tax) 
with targets set in relation to a 
carefully considered business 
plan and requiring signiﬁ cant 
out-performance of that plan to 
trigger maximum payments. 
A minority of bonus will also be 
earned based on pre-set targets 
drawn from the Group’s other key 
performance indicators relating to 
underlying drivers of long-term 
revenue growth.
Details of the performance 
measures used for the current 
year and the targets set for 
the year under review and 
performance against them is 
provided on pages 54 to 55 
and 60 to 61.
25% of the awards vest for 
hitting the threshold performance 
target. Bonus is earned on a 
graduated basis from threshold to 
maximum performance levels.
Performance 
Share 
Plan (PSP)
To incentivise and 
reward executives for 
the achievement of 
superior returns to 
shareholders over a 
three year period, 
and to retain key 
individuals and align 
interests with 
shareholders.
Following shareholder approval at 
the 2011 AGM, the PSP was 
established. The PSP permits 
annual awards of nil cost options, 
contingent shares and forfeitable 
shares which vest after three 
years subject to continued service 
and the achievement of 
challenging performance 
conditions. 
A dividend equivalent provision 
operates enabling dividends to be 
paid (in cash or shares) on shares 
at the time of vesting.
PSP awards may be subject 
to clawback in the event of a 
material misstatement of the 
Group’s ﬁ nancial results or 
misconduct.
Maximum (% salary): 
200% of base salary.
Awards vest based on three year 
performance against challenging 
ﬁ nancial targets for EPS and 
relative TSR performance. 
Financial targets will determine 
vesting in relation to at least half 
of an award.
25% of the awards vest for 
hitting the threshold performance 
target. 
The performance period for 
ﬁ nancial targets and relative TSR 
targets is three ﬁ nancial years, 
starting with the year in which 
the award is granted.  Rightmove plc annual report 2015      47

Executive directors are required 
to retain at least half of any share 
awards vesting or exercised (after 
selling sufﬁ cient shares to meet 
the exercise price and to pay any 
tax liabilities due) until they have 
met the shareholding guideline. 
The Committee will regularly

To provide a 
competitive fee which 
will attract and retain 
high calibre 
individuals and 
reﬂ ects their relevant 
skills and experience.
The fees for non-executive 
directors (including the Company 
Chairman) are reviewed 
periodically (generally every three 
to four years). 
The Remuneration Committee 
will consider the Chairman’s fee, 
whilst the non-executive directors’ 
fee is considered by the wider 
Board excluding the non-
executives.  
Fee levels for each role are 
determined after considering the 
responsibility of the role, the skills 
and knowledge required and the 
expected time commitments. 
Periodic benchmarking against 
relevant market comparators, 
reﬂ ecting the size and complexity 
of the role, is used to provide 
context when setting fee levels. 
Fees for the Chairman and 
non-executive directors’ are set 
out on page 56.
The Chairman and non-
executive directors’ fee increases 
in future years are expected to 
increase (in percentage terms) in 
line with the basic level of pay rise 
received by employees within the 
business.
Fee increases beyond the level 
detailed above may take place if 
fee levels are considered to have 
become out of line with the 
responsibilities and time 
commitments of individual roles.
Flexibility is retained to go 
above the above fee levels in the 
event that it is necessary to recruit 
a new Chairman or non-executive 
director of an appropriate calibre 
in future years.

Selection of performance measures and how 
targets are set
The performance metrics that are used for annual bonus and 
long-term incentive plans are a subset of the Group’s key 
performance indicators.
For the annual bonus, underlying operating proﬁ t before 
tax
(1)
 is the primary performance metric used as it is aligned to 
the Group’s strategy of delivering proﬁ table growth and is a 
key ﬁ nancial performance indicator used within the business. 
Consistent with previous years, operating proﬁ t is measured 
on an underlying basis, to exclude any volatility in relation to 
the Company’s share price in connection with the IFRS 2 
valuation and National Insurance charge on share-based 
incentives granted. The underlying operating proﬁ t
(1)
 before tax 
target is set on a sliding scale based around the business plan 
for the year, with 25% payable for threshold performance. 
The annual bonus also considers performance against 
other operational metrics, including a trafﬁ c market share 
target, Other revenue and a new employee engagement 
target, for a minority of the bonus, with a sliding scale used to 
determine performance against each measure. Market share 
is a measure of the size and engagement of our audience and 
the value which Rightmove, as a media group, brings to our 
customers. Therefore a challenging target to increase this 
audience is considered appropriate by the Committee. The 
Other revenue target will measure growth in revenue from 
businesses other than Agency and New Homes. Since some 
of these will be at an early stage, we consider growth in 
revenue rather than in operating proﬁ t to be the appropriate 
measure and note that this element of the bonus is only a 
small proportion of the total bonus opportunity. 
For the PSP , awards are subject to a combination of EPS 
and relative TSR performance conditions. EPS is considered 
the most appropriate ﬁ nancial metric for this particular 
business at this stage in its development (since it is the 
measure of proﬁ tability that is most closely aligned with 
shareholders’ interests and monitored on an ongoing basis 
within the business). The policy also recognises that relative 
TSR should also be a performance measure in order for there 
to be a clear alignment of executive and shareholder interests. 
EPS targets are set based on sliding scales that take account 
of internal ﬁ nancial planning and external analyst forecasts. 
Only 25% of the EPS element will pay out for threshold 
performance levels, with the maximum award requiring 
substantial out-performance. For TSR, the range of targets 
measure how successful the Company is in out-performing 
the FTSE 250 index (the Index within which the Company 
currently resides) with 25% of this part of the award vesting 
at the threshold performance level, through to full vesting for 
25% out-performance of the Index over the three year 
performance period. 
Discretions maintained by the Committee in 
operating its incentive plans
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan, PSP 
and Sharesave Plan according to their respective rules 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC 
rules where relevant. 
The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market 
practice, in a number of regards to the operation and 
administration of these plans. These discretions include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
�  The selection of participants in the respective plan;
�  The timing of grant of an award (if any) and payments;
�  The size of an award and/or a payment (with limits as 
described in the table above);
�  The extent of vesting based on the achievement of 
performance targets and applicable exercise periods 
where relevant; 
�  How to deal with a change of control (e.g. the timing of 
testing performance targets) or restructuring of the Group;
�  Determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes based on the rules of each plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen including the timing of 
the delivery of shares;
�  Adjustments (if any) required in certain circumstances 
(e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and 
special dividends); and
�  The annual review of performance measures, targets and 
weightings for the annual bonus plan and PSP from year 
to year.
The Committee also retains the ability to adjust the targets 
and/or set different measures for the annual bonus plan and 
PSP if events occur (e.g. a material divestment or acquisition) 
which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer 
appropriate and the amendment is required so that the 
conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially 
less difﬁ cult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, 
be detailed in the Annual Report on Remuneration and 
if appropriate, the subject of prior communication with the 
Company’s major shareholders.
All previous share options, PSP , DSP and Sharesave 
awards that were granted but remain outstanding at 
31 December 2015 (detailed on pages 62 to 64), remain 
eligible to vest based on their original award terms.

Shareholders’ views
The Committee considers it vitally important to maintain 
open and transparent communication with the Company’s 
shareholders. The Committee will consult with major 
shareholders before any material change in remuneration 
policy is approved. The views of shareholders received 
at the AGM, during meetings with investors and through 
other contact during the year, are considered by the 
Committee and contribute to the development of the overall 
remuneration policy. 
Recruitment and promotion policy
The Committee proposes  an executive director’s remuneration 
package for new appointments in line with the principles 
outlined in the table overleaf: 
Performance targets do not apply to Sharesave awards since 
these awards are structured to encourage employees to 
become share owners, and to maintain tax-favoured status the 
awards must operate on a consistent basis for all employees.
How the views of employees are taken into account
The Company has not to date felt it necessary to consult 
directly with employees on executive remuneration matters.  
However, the Committee is kept aware of pay and 
employment conditions within the wider workforce when 
setting executive directors’ remuneration policy. 
Remuneration policy for executive directors 
compared to other employees
The Committee will consider the proposed salary increase 
budget for the whole Group when it is deciding on salary 
increases for executive directors speciﬁ cally. 
In line with the Company’s strategy to keep remuneration 
simple and consistent, beneﬁ ts and pension arrangements 
provided to executive directors are the same as those offered 
to all Group employees.
The extent to which annual bonuses are offered varies by 
level of employee within the Group, with the quantum and 
performance metrics used determined by the nature of the 
role and responsibilities and market rates at that level.
Long-term incentive awards, other than the all-employee 
Sharesave Plan, are only offered to senior management as 
those awards are more heavily weighted towards 
performance-related pay and have a stronger visibility on the 
value created for shareholders and the reward for participants.  50  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued
Element of remuneration Policy
Base salary Base salary levels will be set based on the roles and responsibilities of the individual together with their 
relevant skills and experience, taking into account the market rates for companies of comparable size and 
complexity and internal Company relativities. In some circumstances (e.g. to reﬂ ect an individual’s limited 
experience at a Plc board level) it may be considered appropriate to set initial salary levels below the 
perceived market competitive rate. Phased increases, potentially above inﬂ ation, may then be offered to 
achieve the desired market positioning over time, subject to individual’s continued performance and 
development in the role. 
Beneﬁ ts Beneﬁ ts as provided to current executive directors. Where necessary the Committee may approve the 
payment of relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment, and ﬂ exibility is retained for the Company to pay 
legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation to their appointment.
Pension A deﬁ ned contribution at the level provided to current executive directors.
Annual bonus An annual bonus would operate in the same manner as outlined for the current executives (as described 
above and in the Annual Report on Remuneration), although it would be pro-rated to reﬂ ect the 
employment period during the bonus year. 
The bonus maximum potential would not exceed 125% of base salary.  
It would be expected that the bonus for a new appointment would be assessed on the same 
performance metrics as that for the current executives on an ongoing basis. However, depending on 
the timing and nature of appointment it may be necessary to set tailored performance criteria for their 
ﬁ rst bonus plan.
Long-term incentives A new appointment will be eligible to receive an award under the PSP policy outlined in the policy table. 
Share awards may be granted shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in a close 
period) and would be measured against the same performance criteria as the current executives. 
The ongoing award maximum would not exceed 200% of base salary. 
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject 
to their terms as at the date of grant.   
The new appointment would be eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan under the same terms as all 
other employees. 
Buy-out awards To facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy-out remuneration which would be 
forfeited on leaving their previous employer. When determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out 
awards the Committee will, as a minimum, take into account the following factors:
� the form of remuneration (cash or shares); 
� timing of expected payment/vesting; and 
� expected value (i.e. taking into account the likelihood of achieving the existing performance criteria).  
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing share plans to the extent possible, 
although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the 
Listing Rules.  Rightmove plc annual report 2015      51

employing company, or other circumstances at the discretion 
of the Committee. If deﬁ ned as a good leaver, awards will 
remain subject to performance conditions, which will be 
measured over the performance period from grant to the 
original vesting date, unless the Committee determine to 
assess performance from grant to the date of cessation, and 
which will be reduced pro-rata to reﬂ ect the proportion of the 
performance period actually served. The Committee retains 
the discretion to disapply time pro-rating in exceptional 
circumstances. 
For awards granted under the DSP , ‘good leaver’ status 
may be determined for reasons of death, injury, disability, 
redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee. If 
deﬁ ned as a good leaver, awards will be retained and vest 
on the original vesting date. 
Scott Forbes’ appointment may be terminated by either 
party giving to the other not less than three months’ notice 
in writing. The Company may also terminate by making a 
payment in lieu of notice. Scott Forbes is not contractually 
entitled to any other beneﬁ ts on termination of his contract.
The Letters of Appointment for the non-executive directors 
provide for a term of up to two three year periods and a 
possible further three year term (subject to re-election by 
shareholders and subject to the director remaining 
independent). The appointments may be terminated with a 
notice period of three months on either side and the Letters of 
Appointment set out the time commitments required to meet 
the expectations of their roles. 
Copies are available for inspection on request to the 
Company Secretary. 
Further details of all directors’ contracts and Letters of 
Appointment are summarised overleaf:
Directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ terms of appointment
The Committee’s policy on service agreements for executive 
directors is that they should provide for 12 months’ notice of 
termination by the Company and by the executive. Any 
proposals for the early termination by the Company of the 
service agreements of directors or senior executives are 
considered by the Committee.
The service agreements for the executive directors allow 
for lawful termination of employment by making a payment 
in lieu of notice or by making phased payments over any 
remaining unexpired period of notice. The phased payments 
may be reduced if, and to the extent that, the executive ﬁ nds 
an alternative remunerated position. 
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or 
compromise claims in connection with the termination would 
be paid as necessary. 
For Nick McKittrick a payment in lieu of notice will be 
related to base salary, beneﬁ ts and projected annual bonus 
pursuant to the Group’s targets being achieved for the 
year (pro-rated for any unexpired period of notice where 
appropriate). The Committee is aware that the provision of 
annual bonus with a payment in lieu of notice is no longer 
considered in line with best practice. The provision within 
Nick McKittrick’s contract is considered a legacy issue which 
would not be repeated in any future director’s service contract. 
For Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss a payment 
in lieu of notice will be restricted to base salary and beneﬁ ts.
The treatment for share-based incentives previously 
granted to an executive director will be determined based 
on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment will be for 
outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment. 
For awards granted under the PSP (approved by 
shareholders in 2011) ‘good leaver’ status may be 
determined, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as 
death, ill health, disability, redundancy, transfer or sale of the  52  rightmove.co.uk

Pension and other beneﬁ ts
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for 
employees under which the employer contributes 6% of base 
salary, subject to the employee contributing a minimum of 3% 
of base salary. Nick McKittrick has chosen not to participate in 
this arrangement. The Company does not contribute to any 
personal pension arrangements. 
The executive directors are enrolled in the Group’s private 
medical insurance scheme and receive life assurance cover 
equal to four times base salary. Additionally, the executive 
directors are members of the Group’s medical cash plan.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus for the 2016 ﬁ nancial year will be consistent 
with the policy detailed on page 46 of the remuneration policy 
section of this report in terms of maximum bonus opportunity, 
deferral and clawback provisions. The mechanism through 
which the clawback can be implemented (enabling both the 
recovery and withholding of incentive pay) enables the 
Committee to (i) reduce the cash bonus earned in a 
subsequent year and/or reduce outstanding DSP/PSP 
share awards (i.e. withholding provisions may be used to 
effect a recovery) or (ii) for the Committee to require that a 
net of tax balancing cash payment be made to the Company. 
The measures have been selected to reﬂ ect a range of

these targets will be measured is 121.4p.
As in prior years, the targets that are intended to operate 
for the 2016 PSP awards were set to be appropriately 
demanding in light of the Group’s internal planning, external 
market expectations for future growth and the record high 
base point from which growth would be measured. In the 
current trading environment, the targets are considered to 
provide a realistic incentive at the lower end of the performance 
range but require exceptional performance to achieve full 
vesting. On this basis, the Committee is satisﬁ ed that the 
range of targets are appropriately demanding, and no less 
challenging to the range of targets set for 2015 awards.  
Relative TSR condition
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of executive 
directors’ 2016 PSP awards is set out below. For previous 
awards, relative TSR has been assessed against the FTSE 
250 Index, reﬂ ecting that the Company was, and continues to 
be, a constituent of this Index and towards the middle or top 
half of the Index in terms of market capitalisation when the 
awards were granted. The Company is now positioned well 
into the top quartile of the FTSE 250 Index in terms of market 
capitalisation and therefore to ensure that the comparator 
group remains reﬂ ective of companies of a comparable size 
for the 2016 grant, it was felt that it was more appropriate 
to compare the Company’s performance relative to the 
FTSE 350 Index. Performance will continue to be measured 
over three ﬁ nancial years.
 TSR performance of the Company  % of award vesting

 (maximum 25%)
 Less than the Index 0%
 Equal to the Index 6.25%
 25% higher than the Index 25%
 Intermediate performance Straight-line vesting
(1)  If the FTSE 350 Index’s TSR was 50% over the three year performance 
period, then the Company’s TSR would have to be at least 75% for all 25% 
of the PSP shares to vest.
In relation to the ﬁ nancial target a challenging sliding scale will 
operate with 25% of the maximum bonus opportunity payable 
at the threshold underlying operating proﬁ t target relative to 
2016 business plan through to 100% becoming payable for 
signiﬁ cant outperformance relative to the plan. A greater 
proportion of the award will be paid for exceeding on-target 
performance. The weighting of this performance measure has 
been reduced to 65% (2014: 70%) to allow for a new 5% 
employee engagement performance measure, introduced this 
year, which has been introduced as Rightmove recognises 
that the engagement and commitment of our employees is 
considered a key contributor to the Group’s ﬁ nancial success. 
The other target weightings are unchanged from 2014 at 15% 
trafﬁ c market share and 15% Other revenue.
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2016 ﬁ nancial 
year, are deemed to be commercially sensitive. However, 
retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance 
against them will be provided in next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration to the extent that they do not remain 
commercially sensitive at the time.
Long-term incentives
To ensure that the Company’s total remuneration is 
competitive overall, following a wide reaching shareholder 
pre-consultation exercise, subject to achieving demanding 
performance targets, the award levels under the PSP were 
increased to 200% of base salary for all executive directors 
from 2014.
Consistent with current market practice and previous 
years, awards to the executive directors under the PSP in 
2016 will be subject to a mixture of EPS (75% of awards) 
and relative TSR (25% of the awards) performance conditions. 
The 2016 targets are as follows:
EPS condition
The Group’s EPS growth will be measured over the period of 
three ﬁ nancial years (2016 to 2018). The EPS ﬁ gure used will 
be equivalent to the Group’s basic underlying EPS (before 
share-based payments, National Insurance on share-based 
incentives and no related adjustment for tax). With a view to 
ensuring appropriately stretching but achievable targets are 
set in light of market expectations for the Group, the following 
range of targets will apply to the 2016 awards: 56  rightmove.co.uk

Review of past performance
Share price performance
In 2015, the Company’s share price ended the year at 
£41.25 up 83% year on year (the FTSE 250 Index was up 
8.36%). On a three year basis the share price has increased 
by 198% and has continued to outperform the FTSE 250 
Index over that period as shown in the graphs on page 57.
Total shareholder return (TSR)
The ﬁ rst graph on the next page compares the TSR of 
Rightmove’s shares against the FTSE 250 Index and the 
FTSE 350 Index for the period from 1 January 2013 to 
31 December 2015. TSR is the product of movements in the 
share price plus dividends reinvested on the ex-dividend date. 
TSR provides a useful, widely used benchmark to illustrate the 
Company’s performance over the last three years. Speciﬁ cally, 
it illustrates the value of £100 invested in Rightmove’s shares 
and in the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE 350 Index over 
that period. 
As required by the Act, the Company’s TSR performance 
is required to be shown against a recognised broad-based 
share index. The FTSE 250 Index was previously chosen as 
the comparator because Rightmove was, and continues to 
be, a constituent of this Index and it was therefore also the 
Index used for the purposes of measuring relative 
performance for PSP awards. As Rightmove is currently 
ranked towards the top of that Index in terms of market 
capitalisation, it is now felt to be more appropriate to use 
the FTSE 350 Index for the purpose of comparing TSR 
performance against the 2016 PSP awards and therefore 
this will be used as the criteria applied to 25% of the PSP 
awards to be granted in March 2016.
The graphs on the next page illustrate, for statutory 
purposes, the TSR of Rightmove’s shares against the 
FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE 350 Index for the three 
and seven years to 31 December 2015.
Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees
The Chairman and non-executive fees were last reviewed in a 
market context in 2009 with no increases beyond the default 
policy level of a cost of living increase in line with the basic 
level of pay rise received by employees within the business. 
Therefore it was considered appropriate to ask NBS to carry 
out a benchmarking exercise in 2015 to ensure that the 
Chairman and non-executive director remuneration at 
Rightmove took due account of the continued growth of the 
Group, current market rates and reﬂ ected the current time 
commitment of the Chairman and non-executives in light of 
increased responsibilities due to regulatory changes. It was 
also considered necessary to revise fees so that the Company 
would be able to recruit a Chairman or non-executive 
directors of the appropriate calibre in the future allowing for 
the current size of the Group. Having assessed these factors, 
revised fees were approved.
The basic non-executive fee has been set at £50,000 
(2015: £46,817) with an additional £10,000 (2015: £5,852) 
fee per annum paid for the chairing of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees and a further £5,000 
(2015: £5,852) fee paid to the Senior Independent Director 
as detailed in the table below. 
No further increases are anticipated for a minimum of three years.

Statement of shareholder voting at AGM
At the AGM on 7 May 2015, 94.62% of shareholders voted in 
favour of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Committee 
believes this illustrates the strong level of shareholder support 
for the remuneration framework. The table below shows

Certain pre-ﬂ oat share option awards prior to 2006, which had only service conditions and no performance conditions would have been included in the single 
ﬁ gure remuneration table in the year of grant in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Act. The table above therefore excludes £2,026,674 and £4,151,532 of awards 
with no performance conditions, which vested in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

Deﬁ ned contribution pension
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for employees under which the employer contributes 6% of base salary, 
subject to the employee contributing a minimum of 3% of base salary. Nick McKittrick chose not to participate in this 
arrangement. Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss are members of the stakeholder pension plan and during 2015 
the Company contributed £22,860 and £21,816 per annum respectively. The Company does not contribute to any personal 
pension arrangements. 60  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued
How was pay linked to performance in 2015?
Annual bonus plan
The incentive for the ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 2015 was in the form of a cash bonus of up to 50% of salary and a DSP 
bonus of up to 75% of salary (i.e. 125% in total). The bonus (both cash and DSP elements) was determined by a mixture of 
underlying operating proﬁ t performance (70%) and key performance indicators (30%) relating to underlying drivers of long-term 
revenue growth.
When comparing performance against the 2015 bonus targets set, the Committee determined that 100% of the maximum 
achievable cash and DSP bonus should be paid to the executive directors. Accordingly, a cash bonus of 50% of base salary will 
be paid to the executives and 75% of base salary will be granted to the executives under the DSP , which will be deferred until 
March 2018. More details are provided in the table below:

Long-term incentives
The PSP awards granted in March 2013 were subject to EPS (75% of the awards) and relative TSR (25% of the awards) 
performance conditions which related to the three year period ended 31 December 2015. 
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of executive directors’ 2013 PSP awards is set out below:
 % of award vesting
Relative TSR condition  (maximum 25%)
Less than the Index 0%
Equal to the Index 6.25%
25% higher than the Index 25%
Intermediate performance Straight-line vesting
At the end of the performance period, Rightmove’s TSR was 198.0% compared to 52% for the FTSE 250 Index. 
As this level of outperformance is more than 25%, these options will vest in full from 8 March 2016. 
Rightmove’s EPS growth is measured over a period of three ﬁ nancial years (2013 to 2015). The EPS ﬁ gure used 
is equivalent to Rightmove’s reported diluted underlying EPS but with a standard UK tax rate applied (Normalised EPS) 
and the vesting schedule is set out opposite: Rightmove plc annual report 2015      61

22.5% 18.75%
40% 75%
Between 22.5% and 40% Straight-line vesting
At the end of the performance period, Normalised EPS was 112.9p which from a Normalised EPS base of 63.1p results in 
growth of 79%, exceeding the maximum 40% EPS growth target and will result in full vesting of this part of the award 
(maximum of 75%) from 8 March 2016.
In aggregate, the performance over the year was considered exceptional by the Committee who were satisﬁ ed that paying 
maximum bonuses was appropriate. 
Share awards granted during the year
On 2 March 2015 Nick McKittrick, Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss were awarded shares under the PSP , which vest 
in March 2018, and are subject to a mixture of EPS (75% of the awards) and relative TSR (25% of the awards) performance 
with the greater weighting on EPS to reﬂ ect its particular relevance to the performance of the business.
Executive Basis of grant Number of shares Face value of award
(1)
 
Nick McKittrick 200% of base salary 29,321 £816,003
Peter Brooks-Johnson 200% of base salary 24,556 £683,393
Robyn Perriss 200% of base salary 19,425 £540,598
(1) Based on the average mid market share price for the three consecutive days prior to grant, taken from the Daily Ofﬁ cial List, of £27.83.
Rightmove’s EPS growth will be measured over a period of 
three ﬁ nancial years (2015-2017). The EPS ﬁ gure used will 
be equivalent to the Group’s underlying basic EPS (before 
share-based payments, NI on share-based incentives and 
no related adjustments for tax).
The following vesting schedule will apply for executive 
directors’ awards granted in 2015:
Underlying basic EPS growth  % of award vesting
from 2015 to 2017  (maximum 75%)
Less than 30% 0%
Equal to 30% 18.75%
Equal to or greater than 60% 75%
Between 30% and 60% Straight-line vesting
The benchmark underlying basic EPS for the ﬁ nancial year 
2014 from which these targets will be measured is 100.3p.
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of executive 
directors’ 2015 PSP awards is set out below. It is consistent 
with the TSR condition used for previous grants under the 
share option scheme. Performance will be measured over 
three ﬁ nancial years.

Percentage increase in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
The table below shows the movement in the salary, beneﬁ ts and annual bonus for the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer between the 
current and previous ﬁ nancial year compared to that of the total amounts for all employees of the Group for each of these 
elements of pay.
The CEO’s salary increased by 2%, being the same inﬂ ationary increase as awarded to all eligible Rightmove employees. 
The annual bonus of the CEO increased as a result of the maximum bonus being achieved in relation to the 2015 bonus 
targets, compared with a payout of 70% in 2014.
The average salary and annual bonus for all employees shows a small year on year decline due to a mix effect with the 
investment in new heads in 2015 primarily being in customer facing roles at lower average salary levels than other Rightmove 
employees.
Beneﬁ t costs have fallen for the CEO and all employees following the renegotiation of our health insurance supply contract 
on improved terms.

and conditions. Given the variety of individual contract terms 
and that revenue is the most material ﬁ gure in the ﬁ nancial 
statements, we consider a signiﬁ cant risk exists in relation to 
revenue recognition; speciﬁ cally that the billing of customers 
is not in line with the contract terms, with resulting revenue 
not being recognised appropriately.
�  Our response: Our audit procedures included testing the 
design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the 
Group’s controls over the billing of customers in line with 
contract terms and product usage. For Agency, New Homes 
and Overseas, which cover 95% of revenue recognised in 
the year, we performed detailed procedures using computer 
assisted audit techniques to analyse the amounts billed to 
customers by product in order to identify and investigate any 
anomalies and outliers. We considered whether amounts 
billed had been recognised as revenue in the correct 
accounting period by comparing the period of subscription 
or usage of additional advertising products to the timing of 
revenue recognition. We inspected signiﬁ cant contracts 
signed in the year on a sample basis, to assess whether 
revenue has been recognised in accordance with the 
speciﬁ c contract terms and conditions and relevant 
accounting standards. We assessed the appropriateness 
of deferred revenue at the period end with reference to 
subscription fee billings in December and speciﬁ c product 
deferrals, where amounts are billed in advance but revenue 
recognition deferred until use or expiry. We also considered 
the adequacy of the Group’s accounting policy and 
disclosures (see Notes 1, 2 and 5) in respect of revenue 
recognition, and whether disclosures properly reﬂ ect the 
risks inherent in recognising revenue.
�  Our ﬁ ndings: Our testing did not identify weaknesses in the 
design and operation of controls that would have required 
us to expand the extent of our planned detailed testing. 
Our computer assisted audit techniques did not reveal 
any differences for which we were unable to appropriate 
explanation and we found that revenue was recognised in 
line with the period of subscription or usage of additional 
products. We found that revenue was recognised in respect 
of the signiﬁ cant contracts selected for testing in line with 
the underlying contractual terms and we found no errors in 
the Group’s calculation of deferred revenue at the year end. 
We found the group’s disclosures to be proportionate in 
their description of the assumptions and estimates made 
by the group.
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements 
is unmodiﬁ ed 
We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements of Rightmove plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 70 to 
107. In our opinion: 
�  the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s proﬁ t for the year 
then ended; 
�  the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU); 
�  the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and 
�  the ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We summarise below the risks of material misstatement that 
had the greatest effect on our audit, our key audit procedures 
to address those risks and our ﬁ ndings from those procedures 
in order that the Company’s members as a body may better 
understand the process by which we arrived at our audit 
opinion. Our ﬁ ndings are the result of procedures undertaken 
in the context of and solely for the purpose of our statutory 
audit opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole and 
consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not 
express discrete opinions on separate elements of the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Revenue recognition (£192,129,000)
Refer to page 33 (Corporate governance report), page 81 
(accounting policy) and pages 84 to 85 (ﬁ nancial disclosures)
�  The risk: Revenue primarily consists of subscription fees 
and customer spend on additional advertising products 
in respect of properties listed on rightmove.co.uk and is 
recognised over the period of subscription or as additional 
advertising products are used. Individual contracts exist with 
each customer, which include a variety of differing terms  68  rightmove.co.uk
Governance | Independent auditor’s report to the members of Rightmove plc only continued
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures 
of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
�  the directors’ viability statement on page 17, concerning 
the principal risks, their management, and, based on 
that, the directors’ assessment and expectations of the 
Group continuing in operation over the three years to 
31 December 2018; or 
�  the disclosures in note 1 of the ﬁ nancial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis 
of accounting. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect of 
the matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identiﬁ ed other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the ﬁ nancial statements, a material misstatement of fact, 
or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
�  we have identiﬁ ed material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
ﬁ nancial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy; or
�  the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
�  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
�  the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
We continue to perform audit procedures over risk of 
misstatement of share-based incentives charge and related 
deferred tax charge and asset. However, as there are no 
complex new schemes and the underlying assumptions used, 
and the Group’s model for quantifying the expense, are now 
better established, we have not assessed this as one of the 
risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and, therefore, 
it is not separately identiﬁ ed in our report this year.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group ﬁ nancial statements as a whole 
was set at £6.7m, determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group proﬁ t before tax of which it represents 4.9%.
We report to the Audit Committee any uncorrected 
identiﬁ ed misstatements exceeding £0.34m, in addition to 
other identiﬁ ed misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We report misstatements corrected by 
management where we believe these will assist the audit 
committee in fulﬁ lling its governance responsibilities.
The Group audit team also audits the single wholly owned 
subsidiary, Rightmove Group Limited with a component 
materiality of £5.0m. The Group procedures covered all of the 
operations of the Group, and accordingly 100% of total Group 
revenue; 100% of Group proﬁ t before taxation and 100% of 
total Group assets were audited.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodiﬁ ed 
In our opinion: 
�  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; 
�  the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the ﬁ nancial year for which the ﬁ nancial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the ﬁ nancial 
statements; and 
�  information given in the Corporate Governance Statement 
set out on page 35 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to ﬁ nancial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the ﬁ nancial statements.  Rightmove plc annual report 2015      69
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
�  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by 
law are not made; or 
�  we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
�  a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared 
by the company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
�  the directors’ statements, set out on pages 17 and 77 in 
relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and  
�  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
26 to 31 relating to the company’s compliance with the 
eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code speciﬁ ed for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 41, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements and for being 
satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view. A description 
of the scope of an audit of ﬁ nancial statements is 
provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made 
solely to the company’s members as a body and is subject 
to important explanations and disclaimers regarding 
our responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014b, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should 
be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of 
this report, the work we have undertaken and the basis of 
our opinions.

Notes forming part of the ﬁ nancial statements
1 General information
Rightmove plc (the Company) is a company registered in England (Company no. 6426485) domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK). 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015 comprise the Company and its 
interest in its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). Its principal business is the operation of the rightmove.co.uk website, which 
has the largest audience of any UK property website (as measured by page impressions).
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015 are available upon request to the 
Company Secretary from the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce at Turnberry House, 30 Caldecotte Lake Drive, Caldecotte, Milton Keynes 
MK7 8LE or are available on the corporate website at plc.rightmove.co.uk
Statement of compliance
The Group and Company ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared and approved by the Board of directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (Adopted IFRSs).
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 26 February 2016.
Basis of preparation
On publishing the Company ﬁ nancial statements here together with the Group ﬁ nancial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the 
exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form 
a part of these approved ﬁ nancial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies applied by the Group in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are in accordance with Adopted IFRSs and are 
the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated ﬁ nancial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Going concern
Throughout 2015, the Group was debt free and has continued to generate signiﬁ cant cash. The Group had net cash balances of £8,418,000 
at 31 December 2015 (2014: £11,205,000). The Group also had £4,000,000 (2014: £nil) of money market deposits (2014: nil). 
The Group agreed to extend a 12 month agreement with HSBC for a £10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility. This agreement will 
expire on 9 February 2017. To date, no amount has been drawn under this facility.
During the year, £112,540,000 (2014: £103,357,000) of cash was returned to shareholders via dividends and discretionary share buy backs.
The Board of directors is conﬁ dent that with the existing cash resources and banking facilities in place, coupled with the strength of the 
underlying business model, that the Group and the Company will remain cash positive and will have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for a period of 12 months from the date of signing these accounts.
Further information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 23. The ﬁ nancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂ ows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described on pages 13 to 16. In addition Note 4 to the ﬁ nancial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its ﬁ nancial risk management objectives; details of its ﬁ nancial instruments; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
Capital structure
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 November 2007 under the Companies Act 1985 as a private 
company limited by shares with the name Rightmove Group Limited, registered no. 6426485. The Company was re-registered as a public 
limited company under the name Rightmove Group plc on 29 November 2007. On 28 January 2008, the Company became the holding 
company of Rightmove Group Limited (formerly Rightmove plc, Company no. 3997679) and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of 
Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985. The shares in the Company were admitted to trading on the Ofﬁ cial List of the London 
Stock Exchange on 28 January 2008 and the Company immediately changed its name to Rightmove plc. Details of the share capital of the 
Company are disclosed in Note 22. 78  rightmove.co.uk
Notes continued
1 General information continued
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant 
activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with the entity. In assessing 
control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated and Company ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
In particular, information about signiﬁ cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the 
most signiﬁ cant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated and Company ﬁ nancial statements is included in the following notes:
Note 2 (j)  Revenue recognition, speciﬁ cally regarding the period to which services relate and the recognition of revenue from 
membership offers including discounted or free periods.
Notes 16 and 24  The choice of valuation methodology and the inputs and assumptions used to calculate the initial fair value for new share-
based incentives granted and the rate at which the related deferred tax asset is measured. The key estimates used in 
calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Company’s shares at the grant date, expected share price 
volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and weighted average expected life of the instrument. In respect of 
share-based incentives granted to employees, the number of share-based incentives that are expected to vest is based 
upon estimates of the number of employees that will forfeit their awards through leaving the Group and the likelihood of 
any non-market performance conditions being satisﬁ ed. Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the 
number of shares that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies
(a) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements. 
(b) Intangible assets
 (i) Research and development
  The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing platforms. 
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised 
in proﬁ t or loss as incurred.
  Expenditure on development activities, whereby research ﬁ ndings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product 
or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible, 
the Group has sufﬁ cient resources to complete development, future economic beneﬁ ts are probable and the Group can measure reliably 
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
  The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised 
only when it increases the economic beneﬁ ts embodied in the speciﬁ c asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed 
when incurred.
  Rightmove plc annual report 2015      79
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 (ii) Computer software and licences
  Computer software and externally acquired software licences are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost 
less the estimated residual value of the computer software or licence by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic 
life as follows:
 Computer software 20.0% – 33.3% per annum
 Software licences 20.0% – 33.3% per annum
(c) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is provided to write off 
the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic 
lives as follows:
Ofﬁ ce equipment, ﬁ xtures and ﬁ ttings 20.0% per annum
Computer equipment 20.0% – 33.3% per annum
Leasehold improvements remaining life of the lease
(d) Impairment
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of non-ﬁ nancial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash ﬂ ows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indeﬁ nite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value 
of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the 
Company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written 
down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in proﬁ t or loss. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other 
than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s ﬁ nancial performance and 
the Company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufﬁ cient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the 
investment’s market value.
(e) Financial instruments
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any 
impairment loss. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the receivables’ original terms.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade 
payables are classiﬁ ed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the reporting date.
Money market deposits are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. They represent deposits with 
a maturity of over three months.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 80  rightmove.co.uk
Notes continued
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies continued
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 
(g) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably 
and it is probable that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current market assessment of the time 
value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a ﬁ nance cost.
A provision is maintained in respect of lease dilapidations based on an estimated cost to make good per square foot multiplied by the ﬂ oor 
area of each premise.
(h) Employee beneﬁ ts
 (i) Pensions
  The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme (a deﬁ ned contribution pension plan) into which employees may elect to 
contribute via salary exchange. Obligations for contributions to deﬁ ned contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee beneﬁ t 
expense in proﬁ t or loss when they are incurred.
 (ii) Employee share schemes
  The Group provides share-based incentive plans allowing executive directors and other employees to acquire shares in the Company. 
An expense is recognised in proﬁ t or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to acquire equity settled share-based incentives.
  Fair value at the grant date is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each 
scheme. Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on 
weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life 
of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option behaviour), expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates (based 
on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in 
determining the fair value.
  For share-based incentive awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based incentives is measured to 
reﬂ ect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. When either the employee or the 
Company chooses not to meet the non-vesting condition, the failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation and 
the cost that would have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in proﬁ t or loss.
  (iii) Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees’ Share Trust (EBT)
  The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and, as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of 
Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reﬂ ected in the Group’s consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. In particular, at a consolidated 
level, the EBT’s purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
 (iv) Own shares held by The Rightmove Share Incentive Plan Trust (SIP)
  The SIP is treated as an agent of Rightmove plc and, as such SIP transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove plc and are 
therefore reﬂ ected in the Group’s consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. In particular, at a consolidated level, the SIP’s purchases of shares 
in the Company are charged directly to equity.
  (v) National Insurance (NI) on share-based incentives
  Employer’s NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when share-based 
incentives are exercised. In the case of share options, it is provided on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and 
the average exercise price of share options. In the case of nil cost performance shares and deferred shares, it is provided based on the 
share price at the reporting date.
(i) Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, 
is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled. Rightmove plc annual report 2015      81
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
(j) Revenue
Revenue principally represents the amounts receivable from customers in respect of membership to the rightmove.co.uk website. 
Agency, New Homes, Overseas and Commercial revenue comprises subscriptions for core listing fees and amounts paid for additional 
advertising products. Contracts for these services are per branch or branch equivalent for Agency and per development for New Homes. 
They vary in length from one month to ﬁ ve years, but are typically for periods of six to 12 months. Revenue is recognised over the period 
of the contract or as advertising products are used. Membership offers take place from time to time and may include discounted products 
and free periods. These are recognised on a monthly basis over the contract term.
Agency, Overseas and Commercial services are typically billed in advance with revenue deferred until the service commencement date. 
New Homes developers are billed monthly in arrears. Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised 
as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the proﬁ t or loss on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the 
contract terms.
Data Services revenue relates to fees generated for data and valuation services under a variety of contractual arrangements. Revenue 
is recognised when the service has been provided. Third party advertising revenue represents amounts paid in respect of non-property 
advertising on the rightmove.co.uk website and is recognised in the month in which the service is provided. Consumer Services revenue 
principally relates to payment for leads and is recognised when the lead is generated. Data Services, third party advertising and Consumer 
Services revenue is typically billed in arrears.
(k) Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. An operating segment’s operating 
results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and 
assess its performance and for which discrete ﬁ nancial information is available.
(l) Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to proﬁ t or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Where cash is received in exchange for 
entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(m) Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances, deposits and dividend income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, 
using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised on the date that the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
Financial expenses comprise banking facility fees and bank charges and the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
(n) Taxation
Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in proﬁ t or loss except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case, it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period net of any charge or credit posted directly to equity, using tax 
rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁ nancial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of 
goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t other than in a business combination; 
and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based incentives is to include the income 
tax effect of the tax deduction in proﬁ t or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge. The remainder of the 
income tax effect of the tax deduction is recognised in equity. 82  rightmove.co.uk
Notes continued
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies continued
(o) Dividends
Dividends unpaid at the reporting date are only recognised as a liability (and deduction to equity) at that date to the extent that they are 
appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed 
in the notes to the ﬁ nancial statements.
(p) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing 
the proﬁ t or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
year, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the proﬁ t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all potential dilutive instruments, 
which comprise share-based incentives granted to employees. The calculation of underlying EPS is disclosed in Note 11.
3 IFRSs not yet applied
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for the year ended 
31 December 2015 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued in 2014, although not yet endorsed in the EU, and an exercise is underway 
to assess the impact that this will have on revenue recognition.
IFRS 16 Operating Leases has been issued in January 2016, although not yet endorsed in the EU, and an exercise is underway to assess 
the impact that this will have on the Group’s assets and liabilities.
4 Risk and capital management
Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of ﬁ nancial instruments:
� credit risk
� liquidity risk
� market risk
This note presents information about the Group and Company’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout 
these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The primary 
method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board, where any signiﬁ cant 
new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂ ect changes in 
market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop 
a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s internal controls and reviews the adequacy of the 
risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a customer or banking institution fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group provides credit to 
customers in the normal course of business. The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and 
therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 90.0% (2014: 90.0%) of the Group’s Agency and New Homes customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of 
non-payment. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables based on individually identiﬁ ed loss exposures. Rightmove plc annual report 2015      83
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The Group’s treasury policy is to monitor cash and deposit balances on a daily basis to ensure that no more than £30,000,000 is held with any 
single institution.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difﬁ culties in meeting the obligations associated with its ﬁ nancial liabilities that are settled 
by delivering cash. The Group and Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufﬁ cient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage 
to the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s revenue model is largely subscription-based, which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working 
capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensure that they have sufﬁ cient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential 
impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. Throughout the year, the Group typically 
had sufﬁ cient cash on demand to meet operational expenses, before ﬁ nancing activities, for a period of 137 days (2014: 105 days).
The Group agreed to extend a 12 month agreement with HSBC for a £10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility. This agreement will 
expire on 9 February 2017. To date, no amount has been drawn under this facility.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective 
of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
 (i) Currency risk
  All of the Group’s sales and more than 95.0% (2014: 95.0%) of the Group’s purchases are Sterling denominated, accordingly, it has no 
signiﬁ cant currency risk.
 (ii) Interest rate risk
  The Group and Company have no interest bearing ﬁ nancial liabilities. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash and deposit balances.
Capital management
The Board of directors’ policy is to maintain an efﬁ cient statement of ﬁ nancial position so as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁ dence 
and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of directors considers that the future working capital and capital expenditure 
requirements of the Group will continue to be low and accordingly, return on capital measures are not key performance targets. The Board of 
directors monitors the spread of the Company’s shareholders as well as underlying basic earnings per share. The Board of directors has a 
progressive dividend policy in line with underlying earnings growth and also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to 
growth in proﬁ t before tax. The Board’s policy is to return surplus capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.
The Company purchases its own shares in the market; the timing of these purchases depends on market conditions. In 2015, 2,251,340
(2014: 3,122,418) shares were bought back and were cancelled at an average price of £33.79 (2014: £23.66).
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are 
subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group’s processes, personnel, 
technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and 
regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour. Operational risks arise from all of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of ﬁ nancial losses and damage to the Group’s reputation 
with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management 
within each business unit. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational 
risk in the following areas: 
�  requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions;
�  requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions; 
�  compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements; 84  rightmove.co.uk
Notes continued
4 Risk and capital management continued
�  documentation of controls and procedures;
�  requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address 
the risks identiﬁ ed;
�  requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action;
�  development and regular testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans; 
�  training and professional development; and
�  risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
5 Operating segments
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on internal information that is provided to the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, who 
is the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group’s reportable segments are as follows:
�  The Agency segment which provides resale and lettings property advertising services on www.rightmove.co.uk; and
�  The New Homes segment which provides property advertising services to new home developers and housing associations on 
www.rightmove.co.uk
The Other segment which represents activities under the reportable segments threshold, comprises overseas and commercial property 
advertising services and non-property advertising services which include our third party and consumer services as well as data and valuation 
services. Management monitors the business segments at a revenue and trade receivables level separately for the purpose of making 
decisions about resources to be allocated and of assessing performance. All revenues in both years are derived from third parties and there 
are no inter-segment revenues.
Operating costs, ﬁ nancial income, ﬁ nancial expenses and income taxes in relation to the Agency, New Homes and the Other segment are 
managed on a centralised basis at a Rightmove Group Limited level and as there are no internal measures of individual segment proﬁ tability, 
relevant disclosures have been shown under the heading of Central in the table below.
The Company has no reportable segments.

10 Income tax expense continued
The difference between the standard rate and effective rate at 31 December 2015 is primarily attributable to a prior year adjustment of 
0.2% (2014: 0.4%), offset by disallowable expenditure and a reduction in the rate at which the deferred tax asset is recognised of 0.1% 
(2014: 0.1%).

Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operations which represent the lowest level within the Group at 
which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments as reported in Note 5.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each unit are as follows:
      31 December 2015 31 December 2014
      £000 £000
Agency     732 732
The carrying value of the £732,000 purchased goodwill in Agency, arising pre-transition to IFRS, is reviewed annually for impairment. Due to 
its low level of signiﬁ cance, the disclosures as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets have not been made.

In 2008, the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited (formerly Rightmove plc, Company no. 3997679) and its 
subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985 by way of a share-for-share exchange. Following the 
Scheme of Arrangement, the Company underwent a court-approved capital reduction. The consolidated assets and liabilities of the Group 
immediately after the Scheme were substantially the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of the Group immediately prior to the Scheme.
Following the capital reconstruction in 2008, all employees’ share-based incentives were transferred to the new holding company, Rightmove 
plc. In addition, certain directors’ contracts of employment were transferred from Rightmove Group Limited to Rightmove plc, whilst all other 
employees remained employed by Rightmove Group Limited. Accordingly, the share-based payments charge has been split between the 
Company and Rightmove Group Limited, with £1,660,000 (2014: £1,084,000) being recognised in the Company accounts as a capital 
contribution to its subsidiary.

share price from £22.48 to £41.25, and the impact of new share awards in the year, partly offset by the exercise of share-based incentives.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively

26 October 2015. This will reduce the Group’s future tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2015 has been calculated at 
the rate of 19% which represents the average expected rate at which this asset will reverse in the future.

share-based incentives charge for employees of Rightmove Group Limited.

24 Share-based payments
The Group and Company operate share-based incentive schemes for executive directors and employees. Since ﬂ otation, the Company has 
awarded share options under the Rightmove Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan (Unapproved Plan) and the Rightmove Approved 
Executive Share Option Plan (Approved Plan). The Group also operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave Plan), a Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan (DSP) and Performance Share Plan (PSP) and, in January 2015, the Rightmove Share Incentive Plan (SIP) was introduced. 
All share-based incentives are subject to a service condition. Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service 
received. The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based 
incentives granted. The estimate of the fair value of the share-based incentives is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes 
pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
During 2013, the Group amended the rules of the Unapproved Plan to enable such awards to be net settled whereby the number of shares 
released and sold to satisfy the award is equivalent to the gain due to the option holder. Consequently no proceeds are received on exercise 
of unapproved share options.
The total share-based payments charge for the year relating to all share-based incentive plans was £3,765,000 (2014: £2,728,000).  
A 2% reduction or increase in the employee leaver assumption (excluding executive directors) for the DSP and the PSP would have 
increased/decreased the share-based payments charge in the year by £49,000 (2014: £23,000).
The Company charge for the year was £2,105,000 (2014: £1,644,000).
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the awards are 
exercised, based on the share price at the reporting date. NI for the year ended 31 December 2015 relating to all awards was a charge of 
£3,331,000 compared to a credit of £194,000 in the prior year, due to an increase in the share price from £22.48 at 31 December 2014 to 
£41.25 at 31 December 2015.
The Company NI charge for the year was £2,605,000 (2014: credit £301,000).
Approved and Unapproved Plans
There has been no award of share options since 5 March 2010 and there has been no share-based incentive charge in either year.
The Group has 546,527 (2014: 663,131) Approved and Unapproved share options outstanding which have vested and are exercisable.

Sharesave Plan
The Group operates an HMRC Approved Sharesave Plan under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years’ time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make 
monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. These funds are used to fund the option exercise. No performance 
criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the 
Sharesave Plan are as follows:
          Employee turnover 
          before vesting/

Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.
The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave Plan is a non-vesting condition. This feature 
has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model. 
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the 
share price and past employee behaviour.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP permits awards of nil cost options or contingent shares, which will only vest in the event of prior satisfaction of a performance condition.
129,645 PSP awards were made on 2 March 2015 (the Grant Date) subject to EPS and TSR performance. Performance will be measured 
over three ﬁ nancial years (1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017). The vesting in March 2018 (Vesting Date) of 25% of the 2015 PSP award 
will be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three year performance period and the vesting of the 75% of the 
2015 PSP award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target measured over a three year performance period. PSP award 
holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date and this value will be delivered in shares.
The PSP awards have been valued using the Monte Carlo model for the TSR element and the Black Scholes model for the EPS element and 
the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSP)
In March 2009 a DSP was established which allows executive directors and other selected senior management the opportunity to earn a 
bonus determined as a percentage of base salary settled in nil cost deferred shares. The award of shares under the plan is contingent on the 
satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to underlying drivers of long-term revenue growth (the Performance Period). The right to the 
shares is deferred for two years from the date of the award (the Vesting Period) and potentially forfeitable during that period should the 
employee leave employment. The deferred share awards have been valued using the Black Scholes model and the resulting share-based 
payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value of the deferred share awards are calculated at the date on which the potential 
DSP bonus is communicated to directors and senior management (the Grant Date) as follows:

Share Incentive Plan
In November 2014, the Group established the Rightmove Share Incentive Plan Trust (SIP). Employees were offered 50 shares (2014: 100) as a 
gift, subject to a three year service period (the Vesting Period), with effect from 4 January 2016 (2014: 1 January 2015). The SIP awards have 
been valued using the Black Scholes model and the resulting share-based payments charge spread evenly over the Vesting Period of three 
years. The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends paid in cash over the Vesting Period. No performance criteria are applied to the exercise 
of SIP options. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at Grant Date of the SIP awards are as follows:

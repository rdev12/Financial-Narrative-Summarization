Shopping centres Bill Bailie, an executive director of
Alumasc since May 1989 with
responsibility for a number of the Group’s
operations including its brewery related
activities, retired on 31 August 2003 and 
I thank him on your behalf for his
contribution to the company over the 
past 14 years.
Prospects
The consensus forecast for manufacturing
in the UK remains at best flat for the
remainder of 2003. The stronger euro -
some 10 per cent higher against sterling
at the end of the last financial year
compared with the start - could help to
boost demand, but probably not before
2004.
In the construction market, the outlook 
for house-building is uncertain with
underlying demand somewhat tempered
by the surge in house prices. Public
spending, in contrast, is growing strongly.
On balance, we anticipate another year of
tight market conditions in which further
advances will depend largely on our own
actions and continued attention to detail.
J S McCall
Chairman
Summary
2003 was a year of solid achievement 
for Alumasc, against the background of
major events internal and external to 
the company.
Our continuing activities grew turnover 
by 6.2%, following similar advances in 
the previous year. Profit before tax and
earnings per share were ahead on a
similar basis, by 21% and 23%
respectively, and exceeded those for the
Group as a whole in the previous year.
These results were achieved despite
absorbing sharply higher pension and
insurance costs and the closure of the
beer barrel activity which was for so many
years a major contributor to Group profits.
Both our engineering and building product
divisions contributed to this advance.
There was further strengthening of the
Group’s balance sheet, underwriting our
ability to pursue opportunities for
development, with positive cash balances
reported at the year end.
Dividend
This performance has led your directors
to recommend an increase in the final
dividend per share of 0.25p to 6.3p
(2002: 6.05p), an increase of 4%, making
a total of 8.75p for the year (2002: 8.5p)
an increase of 3%. In the Board’s view,
this will result in an excessive weighting 
in favour of the final dividend payment.
Accordingly, it is the Board’s intention to
rebalance the dividend payments less
heavily towards the final payment,
commencing with the next interim
payment. Further details will be announced
at the time of the next interim results.
Strategy
The present business environment of low
inflation and lower economic growth
presents challenges to well-established
businesses such as ours. Our strategy for
continuing the advances of recent years is
to take advantage of our strong market
positions through increased sales activity
and product development. The Group 
has the resources with which to pursue
product innovation and acquisitions in
pursuit of this strategy.
Board
As announced in our interim report, Paul
Hooper, who joined Alumasc in April 2001
as Group Managing Director, was
appointed Chief Executive on 1 March
2003.
Chairman’s Statement
2 The Alumasc Group plc
The Group has the resources 
with which to pursue product
innovation and acquisitions The Group finished the year with net cash
of £1.5 million versus £1.9 million net
borrowings in the prior year.
The strong final quarter of the year has
helped several companies, particularly in
the Building Products Division, to enter
the new financial year with healthy order
books.
During the year, the Group closed
Alumasc Grundy, the beer barrel
manufacturing and repair operation,
following a downturn in business which
resulted from permanent changes in the
UK brewing industry. The costs of £0.9
million for this closure, excluding goodwill,
accounted for under discontinued
activities, are in line with the estimate
given in the December 2002
announcement. The operation’s 10 acre
site in Burton-upon-Trent is being
marketed. Leonardo Internet, the 70%
owned web design company, also formed
part of discontinued activities. Its sale was
in keeping with the Group’s focus on
premium engineering and building
products.
I am very pleased to report a further
improvement in the Group’s operations
during the year. Both Engineering
Products and Building Products improved
upon the performance of continuing
activities against the prior year. This
resulted in an operating profit of £7.7
million, an increase of £0.9 million (14%),
from continuing activities on turnover of
£117.4 million (2002 : £110.5 million).
The 6.2% sales increase for the Group’s
continuing activities contributed to the
improved result. Both divisions’ sales
went ahead. At the same time costs in
several areas were reduced. For example,
year end headcount was on continuing
activities 7% lower than at the prior year
end and, when combined with other cost
reduction measures, helped to offset
some of the £1.0 million increased costs
in insurance, National Insurance and
pensions. The total gross margin
improved by 0.3%.
An improvement in the utilisation of assets
coupled with tight control on capital
investment led to reduced expenditure 
in the year. A focus on working capital
helped to reduce stocks, although the
overall working capital moved ahead of
the prior year due to the strong final
quarter sales which lifted the debtor
figures. The cash performance was
helped by a £1.0 million land sale. 
3 The Alumasc Group plc
Chief Executive’s Review
Both divisions improved upon 
the performance of continuing
activities against the prior year The Engineering Products Division
(continuing activities) increased its profit
by £1.0 million (36%) to £4.0 million on
sales of £81.3 million, £5.6 million (7%)
ahead of the prior year.
Alumasc Precision Components
Despite a £0.5 million sales reduction to
£37.4 million, associated primarily with a
softening in demand from the more
established automotive customer
accounts, operating profit of £1.7 million
grew slightly against the prior year. 
Within the automotive area, BMW has
been a highlight with strong sales of the
Mini Cooper S resulting in increased
component demand.
Several new projects commenced outside
the automotive area including the supply
of cast and machined components to
Caterpillar in North America and Europe.
As with many project start-ups, there
were initial cost overruns. However, costs
fell into line by the year end. Additional
business with Philips and Orangebox, the
manufacturer of office chairs, added to
development outside the automotive area.
Filtronic raised its demand for the high
specification components supplied by the
Precision Component businesses. These
businesses slimmed down their employee
numbers as a result of improved layouts,
efficiency initiatives and changed sales
profiles.
Although affected by some softening 
of demand, Copal went through a
restructuring which substantially improved
its performance versus the prior year. This
helped to offset some of the costs
associated with new project start-ups
across the division. Dyson did well to
increase its sales whilst simultaneously
reducing its overhead costs.
It is pleasing to report that both Alumasc
Precision Components and Dyson
achieved the ISO 14001 environmental
accreditation during the year. Copal is in
the process of applying for this
accreditation.
The Precision Component businesses will
continue to develop into non-automotive
markets and, as an example of this, the
German diesel engine manufacturer,
Deutz, promises to become quite a
significant new customer in the next
financial year.
Industrial Products
The ongoing Industrial Products
companies increased their profit by £1.0
million (87%) to £2.3 million on sales
which increased by £6.1 million (16%) to
£43.9 million.
Alumasc Dispense had an outstanding
year with significant sales being made of
Carlsberg, Kronenbourg and Heineken
branded dispense products, in particular.
The Tap business also grew and
decorated glass had a record year.
Brock Metal maintained a good
performance. Sales tonnages of both
aluminium and zinc grew. However,
margins were tighter than the prior year.
There was some benefit from the sale of a
better mix of high grade aluminum alloys
and the reduction in alloy capacity
following the closure of competitors.
Export sales were also developed.
Bissell continued to restructure its
business and improved its performance,
despite a difficult economic background,
particularly in Continental Europe.

Building Products
6 The Alumasc Group plc
The Building Products Division increased
its profit by £0.4 million (10%) to £4.0
million on sales which were £1.3 million
(4%) ahead of the prior year at £36.1
million.
Alumasc Exterior Building Products
Alumasc Exterior Building Products grew
its sales whilst simultaneously achieving
productivity improvements, in part due to
investment in new production equipment.
In particular, the company was successful
in growing its Alumasc and Harmer
Rainwater and Drainage sales along with
its MR social housing walling range. Sales
in the final quarter were particularly good
and a highlight during that period was the
strength of the Roofing Product orders
and sales.
The company will continue to build on its
customer service improvements. It enters
the next financial year with a healthy order
book and there are some signs that the
Government funded improvements in
social housing will accelerate, to the likely
benefit of MR walling sales.
Alumasc Interior Building Products
Alumasc Interior Building Products fell
short of its record results of the prior year.
Nevertheless, its performance was still
satisfactory. Sales were affected
principally by the non-repetition of major
radiator guard projects in the previous
year. Elsewhere, an expanded range of
Pendock-brand column casings, launched
during the year, became established. A
‘state of the art’ website to assist
designers continued to support this
company.
Next year will encompass some quite
ambitious new product launch plans
backed by creative marketing campaigns
which will further develop the established
Pendock range.
Alumasc Construction Products
Elkington Gatic had an outstanding year.
Its strategic plans became a reality in
which, for instance, the Gatic Slotdrain
product successfully widened its market
outside of airports. Assisted by good
productivity and a re-engineered product,
the future looks promising for this range.
Several national supermarkets and a
major oil company are either specifying or
evaluating Gatic Slotdrain for supermarket
car parks and petrol station forecourts.
Export sales of Gatic airport products more
than offset some UK weakness. Significant
contracts were won in the Bahamas,
Bangkok and Singapore. Overall the
business moved ahead strongly, driven by
improved sales and good manufacturing
efficiency improvements.
Elkington China, despite a depressed
Hong Kong economy and the impact of
SARS, grew its sales and reduced costs.
Sales continued for Hong Kong’s Terminal
9 Container Project. In the circumstances,
this company’s result was commendable.
Scaffold and Construction Products 
had a very busy year which included a
relocation of its operation and its
reinvention as a sourcing and marketing
company. During such a potentially
disruptive period, it significantly grew its
sales and reduced its cost base resulting
in an excellent performance. 
Prospects
Across both divisions there continue to be
opportunities to build on the significant
performance improvements that have
taken place in the last two years.
Initiatives will include the targeting of
further productivity improvements in all
businesses. The Group will continue to
invest in sales and marketing resources 
to drive the businesses forward. Whilst
actions taken in the last year have helped
to limit insurance cost increases for the
current year, such increases are still way
ahead of inflation. When combined with
the full year effect of National Insurance
and further pension cost increases, as
with many other companies, the Group
will need to work hard to offset such
costs to continue the forward momentum. 
The Group has increased its profit and
controlled its cash well resulting in a
positive net cash position at the year end.
There is a serious intent to use such
funds to speed up the expansion of the
Building Products Division through bolt-
on acquisitions. To date the Group has
looked at several opportunities. However,
these have been owned by vendors with
unrealistic price aspirations. The search
will continue into the next year to make
acquisitions to benefit from the
operational gearing that should accrue
from the Group’s established brand,
marketing and technical support
strengths, along with its well established
distribution channels.
The future is challenging and exciting. 
The Group remains in a strong position 
to move further forward.

Shareholders’ funds increased to £36.2

note 25 to the accounts.
Cash
The Group remains firmly cash generative;
net cash at the year end was £1.5 million
compared with net borrowings of £1.9
million last year. Cash flow benefited from
the sale of a property for £1.0 million and
a prudent scale back in capital investment
to £2.2 million (2002: £6.3 million), £1.7
million below depreciation. Interest costs
fell to £0.3 million (2002: £0.5 million) on
the positive cash flow and reducing
interest rates.
Pensions
Following an increase in the actuarial
deficit on one of the Group’s final salary
schemes to £4.9 million which was
reported last year, the 2002 actuarial
Results
Profits before tax on continuing activities
rose by £1.4 million to £7.8 million (2002:
£6.4 million) on turnover up by £6.9
million to £117.4 million (2002: £110.5
million). The profit increase includes a
£0.3 million profit on a property sale. The
total result of £4.5 million (2002: £7.5
million) is net of a £3.3 million loss on
discontinued activities which includes 
the write-off through the profit and loss
account under FRS 2 of £2.4 million of
goodwill already written-off to reserves
when the related business was acquired
in the 1980’s. Details of discontinued
activities are set out in note 28 to the
accounts. The satisfactory increase in
profits from continuing activities reflects 
a further 0.3% improvement in gross
margin, and has been achieved despite
significant increases in insurance, pension
and National Insurance charges
amounting to £1.0 million.
Earnings, tax and dividend
Earnings per share on continuing activities
were 15.7p (2002: 12.8p), although
overall earnings per share fell 8.0p to 6.9p
because of the impact of discontinued
activities, including the goodwill write off.
The effective tax rate on continuing
activities was 29.6% (2002: 30.1%). 
This has benefited from a tax refund and
the release of provisions relating to 
earlier years.
In light of the result, the directors propose
an increase in the final dividend to 6.3p
per share (2002: 6.05p), payable on 31
October 2003 to shareholders on the
register as at 10 October 2003. This will
make a total dividend for the year of
8.75p per share (2002: 8.5p) covered 1.8
times by profits from continuing activities.

D R Sowerby
Group Finance Director
report on the Group’s other final salary
scheme showed that it also had moved 
to a £4.4 million deficit at 1 April 2002.
These deficits required an increase of
£0.5 million to be made in the SSAP24
pension charge for the year. Movements
in equity and bond prices since the
actuarial valuations have resulted in a
further decrease in the scheme’s assets
and decreases in bond yields have
resulted in further increases in the
actuarial computation of the schemes’
liabilities. The result is an increase in the
overall deficits as at 30 June 2003
compared with the earlier actuarial
valuations. Note 26 to the accounts
shows the schemes’ deficits based on 
the FRS17 conventions. In the analysis of
segmental results in note 2, the cost of
funding the deficits is reported separately
to avoid distorting the results of
commercial operations, since the bulk of
the deficits relate to the 86% of scheme
members who are not current employees.

D R Sowerby
Company Secretary
9 September 2003 14 The Alumasc Group plc
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance throughout the Group. This statement describes to the
shareholders how the principles of the Combined Code are applied.
Compliance with the Combined Code of Best Practice
The Company complied with the Combined Code throughout the year ended 30 June 2003 except for those areas which are
reported upon below.
Directors’ service contracts
Certain of the directors have service contracts in excess of the recommended 12 months as disclosed in the Remuneration Report
on pages 16 to 18.
Shareholder communication
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director maintain regular contact with institutional investors throughout the year to
discuss the strategy and progress of the Group. Private investors are encouraged to attend the AGM and the Notice of Meeting is
sent out 20 working days prior to this meeting. If they are unable to attend, shareholders can vote by proxy. At the AGM the
numbers and voting intentions of the shareholders voting by proxy will be declared to the meeting. The Chairman aims to ensure
that the chairmen of the nomination, remuneration and audit committees are available at the AGM to answer any questions.
The Group web site, www.alumasc.co.uk, makes available copies or summaries of all company announcements, electronic
versions of the Annual Report and Accounts plus full subsidiary information with hot links to the subsidiary companies’ own
websites.
The Board
At 9 September 2003, the date of signing the accounts, the Board comprises 4 executive directors and 3 non-executive directors.
John McCall held the joint role of Chairman and Chief Executive following the flotation of the Company in 1986. On 1 March 2003
he relinquished the role of Chief Executive to Paul Hooper who had been Group Managing Director since April 2001.
The Board meets regularly and retains responsibility for a schedule of matters covering strategic, operational, financial and
compliance issues and receives regular reports on these areas.
The Board of Alumasc is satisfied that a good balance of authority and decision taking power exists among the Group’s executive
directors. The Board considers that the non-executive directors are independent and free from any business or other relationship
that could materially interfere with the exercise of independent judgement. 
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee are John McCall (Chairman), Jon Pither (Deputy Chairman) Philip Gwyn and Richard
Saville. The Committee meets when appropriate and is responsible for considering and recommending changes in the Board’s
composition and membership. Appointments are fully discussed against the requirements of the Group’s business plan and the
need to have a balanced Board.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non executive directors chaired by Philip Gwyn since September 2002. The
Committee operates within its agreed terms of reference in advising the Board on the remuneration policy for executive directors
and senior executives. The Committee is also responsible for the allocation of options under the executive share option scheme
and awards under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan. When making its decisions, the views of the Chief Executive are
considered and professional advice is available if needed. The Board, excluding the non executives, reviews non executive
directors’ fees annually.
The Director’s Report on Remuneration, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
Schedule 7A and approved by the Board, is set out on pages 16 to 18.
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are all non executive directors chaired by Jon Pither. The Committee meets no less than
twice a year and reports to the Board on all matters relating to regulatory and accounting issues affecting the Group together with
financial reporting and internal control procedures. In addition, the Committee ensures that an objective and professional
relationship is maintained with external auditors who may attend all meetings and have direct access to the Committee and its
Chairman at all times. The executive directors are not members of the Committee but may attend meetings of the Committee as
necessary. The Group does not currently have a dedicated internal audit function; the requirement for this function is kept under
review.
Statement of Corporate Governance 15 The Alumasc Group plc
Going concern
After making proper enquiries, the directors fully expect the Group to have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Internal Control
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control. The effectiveness of the system has been reviewed during
the financial year. It is acknowledged that any system of internal control can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance
against any material misstatement or loss. An ongoing process, in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee, has
been established for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.
(i) Risk review
Risk assessment is a continuing process throughout the year, dealt with through monthly board meetings of operating
companies which formally identify the risks most important to each Company, consider their financial implications and assess
the adequacy and effectiveness of control. Each operating company has implemented procedures for controlling the relevant
risks of their businesses. 
The Chairmen of each operating subsidiary, who are executive directors, report to the Board on the risk management
procedures that have been in place during the year and the effectiveness of the level of control in managing the identified risks.
The Board reviews these reports and adds additional items where appropriate. The Board is able to confirm that these
procedures are ongoing. 
(ii) Financial reporting and monitoring
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and has adopted a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it
for decisions. This procedure is intended to ensure that directors maintain full and effective control over all financial issues. The
Executive Committee, which oversees the Group’s business activities comprises the Group’s executive directors and the
managing directors of principal operating companies.
Group companies operate under a system of controls which include:
•a defined organisational structure with an appropriate delegation of authority to operational management;
•the identification and appraisal of financial risks both formally, within the annual process of preparing business plans and
budgets, and informally through close monitoring of operations;
•a comprehensive financial reporting system within which actual results are compared with approved budgets and previous
years figures on a monthly basis and reviewed at both local and group level;
• an investment evaluation procedure to ensure an appropriate level of approval for all capital expenditure.
Statement of Directors Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the accounts;
•prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities. 16 The Alumasc Group plc
Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration policy 
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies 
of a similar size in comparable industries. The Remuneration Committee takes into account company pay awards and personal
performance in reviewing directors’ salaries and information from external salary survey sources, including Monks Partnership,
(part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
Annual bonuses are determined by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set each year above
which bonuses increase in line with earnings, to a maximum of 40% of salaries, (in relation to Paul Hooper the maximum bonus is
50% of his salary). The bonus targets are set at levels which the Remuneration Committee believes to provide a major challenge
for management in the bonus year.
The Remuneration Committee annually reviews long term incentive awards and awards under the Group’s executive share option
plan which are designed to reward the achievement of long term performance targets.
The Company’s policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar
responsibility and scope in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme
membership and do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
All executive directors, except Paul Hooper, are members of The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme which is a final salary scheme
and provides directors with individual accrual rates ranging from 1/35th to 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum
pension of two-thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary excludes bonus payments to the directors.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new
appointments.
In the case of directors appointed prior to 1994, notice periods are increased by one month for each completed year of service, to
a maximum of 24 months. Accordingly Messrs McCall and Sowerby have rolling service contracts and notice periods of 24
months. Messrs Hooper and Rhodes are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts with 12 months notice.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts. In accordance with current best practice, since 1999 letters of
appointment have been issued which provide for an initial period of three years, subject to review. Richard Saville’s current terms
of appointment expire on 1 January 2005. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gwyn and Pither who
were appointed prior to this date.
The Committee considers the above arrangements are reasonable and necessary to the employment of high calibre executive
directors. Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the corporate governance statement on pages 14 to 15.

year.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Alumasc Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by the shareholders in October 1997. The purpose of
the Plan is to motivate key individuals to take the Company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for
exceptional performance. Under the Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is
subject to the achievement of the Performance Criteria. To date no shares have been vested in the participants.
Awards under the Plan vest pro rata between nil and 100 per cent conditional upon achieving targeted growth in EPS over a fixed
three year period following the making of the award.
In respect of awards made prior to October 2002 there is nil vesting until the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5 per cent
growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the RPI. 100 per cent of awards will vest on achieving 15 per cent growth
per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
In respect of awards made after October 2002 there will be 10 per cent vesting when the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5
per cent growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the RPI. 100 per cent of awards will vest on achieving 10 per
cent growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
The maximum contingent interest in shares under the Plan is:

On behalf of the Board
P H R Gwyn
Chairman 
Remuneration Committee 19 The Alumasc Group plc
We have audited the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2003 which comprise the consolidated profit and loss
account, consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses, consolidated balance sheet, balance sheet, consolidated
cash flow statement, and the related notes 1 to 28. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements which are required to be prepared
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards as set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities in relation to the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Statement of Corporate Governance reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether
the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises the Directors’ Report, unaudited part of the Remuneration Report, Chairman’s
Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Financial Review and Statement of Corporate Governance. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of
the Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Remuneration
Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at 30 June
2003 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended and the financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1 Accounting policies
(a) Accounting convention
The accounts are prepared:
(i) under the historical cost convention modified in the consolidated balance sheet by the revaluation of freehold and long
leasehold property and in the Company balance sheet by the revaluation of the investment in certain subsidiaries; and
(ii) in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the Company and each of its subsidiaries for the year ended 30 June
2003. The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group profit and loss account from
or up to the effective date of acquisition or disposal.
(c) Goodwill
The excess or deficiency of the purchase consideration for companies compared to the value ascribed to their net assets at
the date of acquisition prior to 1 July 1998 was set off directly to reserves and not reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
For acquisitions made on or after 1 July 1998, positive goodwill is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and
amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life of 10 or 20 years.
If a subsidiary, associate or business activity is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written
off directly to reserves is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Where appropriate, advantage is taken of statutory share premium relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
(d) Depreciation of tangible fixed assets
Freehold land is not depreciated. The cost or valuation of other tangible fixed assets is written off by equal monthly instalments
over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold and leasehold buildings – 25 to 50 years
Long leasehold land – over the period of the lease
Short leasehold property – over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles – 4 to 5 years
(e) Fixed asset accounting - FRS 15
The Group elected to adopt the transitional provisions of FRS 15 under which previous valuations of freehold and long
leasehold land and buildings are retained and treated as “cost” for future accounting purposes. The majority of the Group’s
properties have been acquired as a result of the acquisition of related businesses; in these cases, the fair value of the freehold
and long leasehold land and buildings at acquisition is already treated as “cost” for all purposes.
(f) Leased assets
Assets held under leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are
capitalised. The capital element of the related rental obligation is included in creditors. The interest element of the rental
obligation is charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. Rentals in
respect of all other leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
(g) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving
items. In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate
proportion of manufacturing fixed and variable overheads, based on a normal level of activity.
(h) Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Notes on the Accounts
For the year ended 30 June 2003 25 The Alumasc Group plc
1 Accounting policies (continued)
(i) Pension costs
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes as follows:
(i) Defined benefit pensions
The Group operates two principal defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made to separately
administered funds. Contributions to the funds are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of
pensions over the employees’ working lives within the Group. The regular cost is attributed to individual years using the
“projected unit” method. Variations in pension cost, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised
over the average expected remaining working lives of employees in proportion to their expected payroll costs. Differences
between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or
prepayments in the balance sheet.
(ii) Defined contribution pensions
The pension cost charge of the Group’s defined contribution schemes represents the contributions payable by the Group to
the funds. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24. Phased transitional disclosures in accordance
with FRS 17, full implementation of which has been deferred, are given in note 26 to the accounts.
(j) Deferred taxation
Provision is made for deferred taxation in accordance with FRS 19. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to
receive more, tax, with the following exceptions:
–provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains
on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet
date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis
of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into
replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
– deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will
be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
(k) Foreign currencies
Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the
dates of the transactions; monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates are translated at year end rates of
exchange.
The accounts of the overseas subsidiary and associate are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves. All other translation
differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the
extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are
taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises. 26 The Alumasc Group plc

c. Factors that may affect future tax charges
Group
Based on current capital investment plans, the Group expects to continue to be able to claim capital allowances in excess 
of depreciation in future years. 
The Group has agreed capital losses in the UK in excess of £20 million that relate to prior years, and under current legislation
these losses are available for offset against future chargeable gains. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of
these losses, as there are no disposals on which a binding agreement exists for sale at the balance sheet date. 
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value. Such tax would
become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief or the offset of capital losses
referred to above. The total amount unprovided for is £120,000 (2002: £120,000).
Parent Company
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing shares held in a subsidiary to its market value.
Such tax would become payable only if the shares in the subsidiary were sold and such disposal did not qualify for the
substantial shareholdings exemption enacted in Finance Act 2002 or where any gain could not be set off against the capital
losses within the Group. The total amount unprovided for, should the exemption not apply, is £86,000 (2002: £86,000).

10 Tangible fixed assets (continued)
All of the Group’s tangible fixed assets are held at cost, except that £7,173,000 of the cost of freehold land and buildings is
held at valuations carried out in June 1989. Had these revaluations not taken place the assets would have been carried in the
balance sheet at a cost of £2,396,000 and a net book value of £671,000.
Included within freehold land and buildings is land of £6,856,000 (2002: £7,196,000) which is not depreciated.
Included within freehold land and buildings is an amount of cost £1,281,000, accumulated depreciation £582,000, relating to
assets held for resale, being the Alumasc Grundy site property.

materials manufacturer which is incorporated and operates in Belgium, and 20% of the share capital of Amorim Isolamentos
SA, a specialist cork insulation product manufacturer and distributor, which is incorporated and operates in Portugal. In the
directors’ opinion, the degree of influence exercised over Amorim Isolamentos SA is insufficient to justify its treatment as an
associated undertaking.  32 The Alumasc Group plc

Notes on the Accounts
For the year ended 30 June 2003
17 Derivatives and other financial instruments
Policy
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments
is undertaken. It is exposed, to an extent, to risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Policies for managing each of
these risks are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by operating companies in
currencies other than the companies’ operating (or “functional”) currency. Operating companies use forward currency contracts
to hedge at the time of committing to significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Finance and interest rate risk
Although the Group has limited borrowings, and therefore its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited, it decided during
the prior year to convert part of its floating rate overdraft facilities to fixed rate asset backed borrowings repayable over five
years, in order to lock into historically low interest rates.
Other borrowings remain short term with floating interest rates.
Liquidity risk
For short term working capital purposes the Group utilises bank overdrafts. Because of the nature of their use, such facilities
are typically “on demand”. Reliance on overdraft facilities has been reduced as a result of the medium term secured borrowing
arrangements set up in the previous year. Borrowing facilities are reviewed annually. 
The disclosures below comprise sterling denominated financial instruments and exclude short term debtors and creditors.

The floating rate financial asset represents cash at bank. To the extent that significant cash balances exist, it is Group policy to
move funds into money market deposits which would earn interest currently at a rate of approximately 3.7%.
At 30 June 2003, the Group’s currency exposure, for all of which Sterling was the functional currency, was £543,000 (2002:
£214,000) denominated in US Dollars, £275,000 (2002: £362,000) in Euros, and £nil (2002: £36,000) in Hong Kong Dollars. 
Borrowing facilities
The Group had total borrowing facilities of £18.0 million at 30 June 2003 (2002: £18.0 million), of which a total of £3.9 million
was utilised at 30 June 2003 (2002: £4.2 million). The facilities comprise unsecured overdraft facilities of £11.5 million (2002:
£11.5 million) and fixed asset backed facilities of £6.5 million (2002: £6.5 million). 
The undrawn amounts at 30 June 2003 were overdraft facilities of £11.5 million (2002: £11.2 million) and fixed asset backed
facilities of £2.6 million (2002: £2.6 million).
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different to the carrying value.
Hedges
As explained above, the Group’s policy is to hedge significant transactional currency exposures by the use of forward foreign
currency contracts. At 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2002, a number of these contracts existed, the fair values of which were not
materially different from the book value.
The profits on fixed price forward sales undertaken by the Group’s zinc and aluminium alloy operations are locked in by
hedging the sales commitments against forward purchases of metal on the London Metal Exchange (LME). The gross value of
forward purchase commitments with LME brokers at 30 June 2003, which mature within 12 months, was £2.48 million (2002:
£3.08 million) on which a loss of £110,000 (2002: £213,000) would have been incurred at prices at that date; forward sales
commitments at the same date would have made profits in excess of this figure using the hedged purchase price. 36 The Alumasc Group plc

26 Commitments to pension schemes
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in (a) below are
those required by that Standard. Phased transitional disclosures under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, to the extent not given in
(a) are set out in (b).
(a) The Group’s pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, funded by the payment of contributions
into separately administered trust funds. The defined benefit schemes, which were closed to new members in October 1999,
provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay. External professional actuaries value the schemes triennially using the
“projected unit” method in order to determine the necessary funding contributions to be paid. 
Pension costs for the defined benefit schemes were £1,102,000 (2002: £721,000), and for the defined contribution schemes
were £453,000 (2002: £358,000).
The two principal defined benefit schemes are The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme and The Benjamin Priest Group Pension
Scheme. The most recent valuation dates for these schemes are 1 April 2002 and 6 April 2001 when the market values of the
scheme assets were £26,008,000 and £33,108,000 respectively and the actuarial values of the assets represented 85% and
87% respectively of the value of the accrued benefits after allowing for expected future earnings increases. The main actuarial
assumptions employed for this purpose in respect of the Alumasc Scheme are that the rate of investment returns will exceed
increases in earnings by 1.5% and exceed the increase in pension by 3.5%. The comparable assumptions for increases in
earnings and pensions in respect of the Benjamin Priest Scheme are 2% and 3%; in respect of the valuation of assets, market
values have been used. 39 The Alumasc Group plc
26 Commitments to pension schemes (continued)
A provision of £1,800,000 (2002: £2,125,000) is included in creditors, this being the excess of the accumulated pension cost
over the funded amount and the deficit on the Benjamin Priest Scheme recognised under FRS 7. The rate of contributions will
be reassessed regularly in accordance with actuarial advice. Company contributions to the schemes include £650,000 to
eliminate the past service shortfall over ten years. This amount will increase to £1 million from 1 July 2003.
Under the “projected unit” method, for closed schemes the amounts allocated to service cost in future periods will tend to be
higher as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
(b) FRS 17 Retirement Benefits
The actuarial valuations performed on 1 April 2002 and 6 April 2001 were updated to 30 June 2003 by a qualified independent
actuary. The major assumptions used by the actuary were (in normal terms):
2003 2002 2001
Rate of increase in salaries 3.63% 3.66% 4.15%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 2.63% 2.66% 2.65%

Explanatory notes to certain Resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
(1) Resolution 7 - Renewal of directors’ authority to allot shares
By virtue of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 the directors require the authority of shareholders of the Company to allot
shares or other relevant securities of the Company. Resolution 7 authorises the directors to make allotments of up to an
additional 12,584,927 shares (representing approximately 36% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 9 September
2003 (including existing commitments under the Company’s share schemes)). This authority will lapse at the conclusion of the
next Annual General Meeting, unless renewed earlier. The directors have no present intention to exercise the authority
proposed to be conferred by Resolution 7.
(2) Resolution 8 - Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
By virtue of Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 any issue by the Company of equity capital for cash made otherwise than
to existing shareholders on a proportional basis requires the consent of the shareholders of the Company unless the Company
has obtained the authority of the shareholders under Section 95 of the Companies Act. The purpose of Resolution 8 is to
authorise the directors to allot shares by way of rights or pursuant to an open offer or otherwise than strictly pro rata when they
consider it expedient to do so and allows them to issue for cash up to 1,740,840 shares other than on a pre-emptive basis
(representing 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 9 September 2003).
(3) Resolution 9 - Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
The directors consider it desirable that the Company should have the authority to make market purchases of its own shares.
The purpose of Resolution 9 is to authorise the directors generally to purchase up to 14.9% of the issued share capital of the
Company as at 16 October 2003. The directors will only exercise the authority granted by Resolution 9 (if passed) if to do so
would result in an increase in earnings per share and is in the best interests of shareholders generally. The Alumasc Group plc

•	 Our Pub Partners business offers people the 
opportunity to run their own pubs across the UK 
on a tenanted, leased or franchised basis.

value, exceptional service and unbeatable quality across 
all of our businesses.
Our strategy to drive growth and returns 
to our shareholders has three main elements:
•	 Expand our biggest and fastest growing business, 
Retail, to 1,100 sites and at the same time increase 
the overall quality of the estate by increasing our 
exposure to long-term growth categories such as 
food, wine and coffee.

taking more control over the licensee offer and 
introducing innovative agreements into the estate.

Chairman’s statement
ANOTHER 
SUCCESSFUL YEAR
“ On the back of our strong growth, 
we are recommending a final dividend 
of 19.45p per share, up 7.5%.”
Results
We have achieved another set of record 
results, despite the difficult weather 
conditions in the second half of the year. 
Revenue was £1,194.7m, up 4.8%, and 
operating profit before exceptionals was 
£248.2m, up 5.1%. Profit before tax and 
exceptional items was £162.0m, up 6.6%, 
while adjusted earnings per share was 
57.0p, up 7.5%.
Dividend
On the back of these record results and 
strong growth, the board has recommended 
a final dividend of 19.45p per share, up 7.5% 
on last year. This takes the total dividend 
for the year to 26.6p per share, up 7.3%. 
The final dividend is expected to be paid 
on 9 September 2013 to those shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 9 August 2013.
Acquisitions
In the year, we have made further progress 
with the expansion of our Retail business. 
We spent £35.3m on 24 new pubs and have 
exchanged or completed on a further 30 sites 
for development.
Disposals
We also remain focused on disposing of sites 
that we consider no longer have a long-term 
sustainable future within our estate. 
These mainly come from Pub Partners, 
from which we disposed of 103 sites in the 
year. In total, the disposed properties 
raised proceeds of £28.0m.
Board
At the end of December, we bade farewell 
to Norman Murray, who served on our board 
as a non-executive director for nine years, 
and acted as chairman of both the audit and 
the remuneration committees during that 
time. I would like to express my sincere 
thanks to him for the substantial contribution 
he made to the board and wish him well for 
the future. 
In October, we welcomed Lynne Weedall 
to our board as a non-executive director 
and member of the remuneration committee. 
She has subsequently become chairman of 
that committee. She is the HR and strategy 
director at Carphone Warehouse and we 
expect her business background to be a 
great asset to us.
Governance
The board continues to set itself high 
standards of corporate governance, 
supported by its nomination, remuneration 
and audit committees. The corporate 
governance section in this report shows 
details of our compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and our 
directors’ remuneration report incorporates 
a number of additional disclosures 
consistent with the government’s proposed 
new regulations on remuneration reporting. 
These regulations will apply to the company 
next year.
People
Our consistent growth and success could 
not have been achieved without the hard 
work and efforts of our 22,000 employees 
across the business. They combine to make 
Greene King the company that it is and 
deliver the greatest source of competitive 
advantage for our shareholders, particularly 
in such a demanding trading environment. 
I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks 
to every one of our team for their personal 
and collective contribution. Looking ahead, 
we do not expect short-term conditions to 
improve but I am confident that the team 
at Greene King will continue to drive the 
business forward and deliver further success.

REVIEW o F THE YEAR
Our business 
We have 2,250 pubs, restaurants and hotels and we brew the country’s 
leading cask ale brands. We operate through three main business units.
Retail
Our Retail business is split into two divisions: Destination 
Pubs and Restaurants, with 500 sites, comprising our 
industry-leading retail brands such as Hungry Horse, 
Old English Inns, Eating Inns, Loch Fyne Restaurants 
and Farmhouse Inns; and Local Pubs, with 480 sites, 
comprising mainly branded and unbranded in local 
communities across the UK. At the year end we had:
Pub Partners
Our Pub Partners business offers entrepreneurs the

Our leased model offers longer, assignable

These agreements attract the more

more freedom to run their business

Our tenanted model is based on a more 
hands-on approach to working with our 
licensees and works particularly well for 
first-time licensees or those who do not 
wish to take on the extra responsibility 
of a lease. Our new agreements provide 
incentives for tenants who build their 
business and improve customer loyalty.

We have two agreements: ‘Meet & Eat’ 
is a food, drink, service and entertainment 
package for the value community segment, 
while ‘Local Hero’ is designed for wet-let

local provenance. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

Our Brewing & Brands division operates two breweries, 
in Bury St Edmunds and in Dunbar. We brew, distribute,

REVIEW o F THE YEAR
Our markets 
We aim to grow our market share utilising our industry-leading 
brands, our high quality asset base and our talented teams.
Market overview
Introduction
The key markets in which we compete 
are the UK drinking out, eating out and 
staying out markets. In each market, we 
aim to grow our market share utilising our 
industry-leading brands, our high quality 
asset base and our talented teams. Over the 
last 12 months we have met those aims within 
Greene King Retail, our largest and fastest 
growing business. Beer volumes per pub 
in Pub Partners, our tenanted, leased and 
franchised division, have also outperformed 
the UK on-trade beer market, while 
own-brewed volumes of our core ale brands 
have outperformed the total UK ale market.
Environmental analysis
Political
The UK Government has been giving out 
mixed messages regarding its approach 
to the UK pubs and beer industries. At the 
budget during the year, we saw the first cut 
in beer duty since the 1950s, alongside the 
scrapping of the beer duty escalator, which 
had been responsible for increasing duty by 
almost 40% since 2007. It is pleasing that 
the Government recognised that beer, 
primarily drunk in pubs, was not the cause 
of the rising incidence of alcohol-related 
illness in the UK, and that it needed more 
support. However, tax on beer, including 
duty and VAT, is still high, at around one 
third of the price of a pint, and therefore 
we are hopeful that the Government will 
continue to reduce beer duty going forward. 
At the same time, reform of Progressive Beer 
Duty is needed to rebalance the significant 
tax advantage that micro-breweries have 
over those that invest and grow and pay 
the full rate. 
Government has changed its approach to the 
much investigated relationship between pub 
companies and licensees. Having previously 
recognised the strength of the tied model 
and the improvements, via self-regulation, 
that the industry was making, there was a 
complete about turn in opinion during the 
year. Government announced a consultation 
including a series of proposed measures 
aimed at transferring over £100m of value from 
pub companies to licensees. We have made 
a detailed submission to the consultation, 
advocating the continuation of self-regulation, 
which has worked well for Greene King for 
over 200 years, instead of the introduction 
of a Statutory Code with an independent 
Adjudicator and all of the costs and red-tape 
associated with it. 
Our support for a minimum unit price 
(MUP) for alcohol remains, despite the 
continued delay in Government’s response 
to the consultation on its Alcohol Strategy. 
We believe MUP, alongside other measures 
such as improved alcohol education, can 
be a highly effective measure in reducing 
irresponsible retailing and consuming of 
alcohol, therefore helping to reduce the costs 
to society of rising alcohol-related illness and 
crime. We do not see the UK Government 
making a decision on MUP until the legal 
process in Scotland is resolved. 
Economic
It has been another year of minimal growth 
within the UK economy. Real GDP has still 
not recovered to the peak levels experienced 
in 2007, before the credit crunch, and it is 
easily the longest and deepest economic 
slump since detailed records began. Most 
importantly to our business, real household 
income remains under pressure as cost 
inflation continues to run ahead of wage 
inflation, meaning our customers are not 
confident enough to return to the spending 
patterns of pre-2007. This suggests that our 
focus on delivering industry-leading value, 
service and quality continues to be the best 
approach, as we offer ‘everyday treats’ to 
our customers in our pubs across the UK. 
Social
UK alcohol consumption is in decline 
although it is difficult to differentiate between 
the economic and social reasons for this 
decline. Beer consumption is in steeper 
decline, averaging 2.4% per annum since 
2002. Factors driving this decline include 
a more health conscious UK consumer and 
increased leisure alternatives to the pub. 
In addition, partly due to the price differential 
between the on- and off-trades and partly 
due to the continuous improvement of home 
entertainment, there is an increasing 
propensity to consume alcohol at home. 
Beer consumption in the on-trade has declined 
at an average of 4.6% per annum since 2002, 
including a 4.7% decline in 2012, while the 
off-trade has increased by 0.2% per annum 
over the same period, although there was 
also a 4.6% decline in 2012. 
The UK consumer is also continuing to 
eat out more due to time pressures and the 
increasing value offered by competitors 
in this market. The value of the informal 
eating out market has grown by 2.9% since 
2007 to stand at £54bn by the end of 2012. 
Within this, pubs have been taking a greater 
share of the growth as they have improved 
the relative quality and value of their offer 
against other ‘casual dining’ competitors. 
Against an overall growth in informal eating 
out of 1.6% in 2012, pub and bar food grew 
1.9%*. We expect these trends to continue. 
Finally, the UK staying out market has also 
benefited from the improved provision of 
budget and mid-market accommodation, 
satisfying the increased demand for business 
related overnight accommodation and, 
particularly in the recession, an increase 
in domestic holidays and short breaks. 
Revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the 
UK has risen 14.1%* since 2009 and grew 1.0%** 
in 2012. Although growth may be moderate 
in the near-term, we still expect long-term 
value growth in this market.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Chief executive’s review 
ANOTHER 
STRONG YEAR
“ The robustness of our business and our proven 
strategy ensured we delivered further strong 
growth and record results for our shareholders.”
Performance summary
It has been another strong year for Greene 
King, delivering record results for our 
shareholders. This was led by a successful 
trading performance from our largest and 
fastest growing business, Greene King Retail, 
achieving 12.1% operating profit growth:
 • Group revenue was £1,194.7m, up 4.8%.
 • Operating profit before exceptional items 
was up 5.1% at £248.2m.
 • The operating margin was up ten basis 
points to 20.8%, despite the business 
mix change.
 • Profit before tax and exceptional items 
was £162.0m, up 6.6%. 
 • Adjusted earnings per share grew 7.5% 
to 57.0p.
 • The board has recommended a final 
dividend of 19.45p per share, up 7.5%.
 • ROCE improved a further 40 basis points 
to 8.9%. 
Even though we experienced a long, cold 
and wet winter, the robustness of our business 
and our proven strategy ensured we delivered 
further strong growth in revenue, up 4.8%, with 
Retail leading the way with growth of 7.4%. 
We continue to focus on providing our 
customers with the best value, service and 
quality across our three main markets of 
eating out, drinking out and staying out. 
This helped us deliver like-for-like (LFL) 
sales growth of 2.3% in Retail, split 4.3% 
growth in the first half and 0.6% growth in 
the second half (reflecting the more difficult 
trading conditions experienced after the 
New Year). This underlying growth was 
supported by another positive contribution 
from new sites. Retail now generates over 
72% of group revenue.
Further productivity improvements in labour, 
tight cost control and acquisition synergy 
benefits drove strong margin growth in 
Retail, which more than offset the negative 
impact of our changing business mix on the 
group operating margin. Operating profit 
before exceptional items grew 5.1%.
Our strong performance delivered adjusted 
earnings per share growth of 7.5% and 
dividend growth of 7.3% for our shareholders 
in the third year of our retail expansion plan. 
The impact of estate changes, growing the size 
and quality of our retail estate and reducing 
the size, while improving the quality, of our 
tenanted and leased estate, has driven further 
improvements in our ROCE. In the year, 
ROCE rose 40 basis points (bps) to 8.9%, 
ahead of our cost of capital. 
We made substantial financial progress in 
the year helping to further strengthen our 
balance sheet and financial resilience. After 
the year end, we refinanced our revolving 
credit facility, using an additional £60m to 
buy back our AB1 bonds ahead of their step-up, 
and we completed the latest triennial pension 
review, leading to a lower annual cash 
funding requirement.
This was the first year of our three year 
partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support 
to raise £1m. It has been successful so far, 
raising £300,000 in the first year, including 
raising £100,000 for the ‘World’s Biggest 
Coffee Morning’.
Overview
Our strong performance and record results 
were delivered in another year of tough 
economic conditions, a generally difficult 
regulatory environment, highly competitive 
markets and constantly shifting consumer 
trends. We also had to deal with a year of 
unprecedented weather, particularly in some 
of our most important trading months. Both 
June and July were abnormally wet, while 
October and March were abnormally cold. 
While we hope for better weather in the 
new financial year, we do not expect 
to see material change in the economic 
or political environment.  Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

Economic conditions through the year 
remained subdued. After five years, we have 
still not returned to the real GDP levels of 
2007, before the economic slump began. 
Numerous key measures, such as house prices, 
consumer confidence and household earnings 
are sluggish, although there is a degree of 
resilience to the employment market.
From a regulatory perspective, there are 
three key issues facing the industry:
1.  Beer Duty. The scrapping of the beer 
duty escalator was a welcome move and 
we are hopeful of additional duty reform 
going forward. 
2.  Statutory Code. We believe the proposal 
for a statutory code to govern the 
relationship between pub companies and 
licensees is unnecessary. We have fully 
participated in the consultation process 
and have argued for more time to be 
given to the current, legally-binding, 
self-regulatory code to prove its worth, 
particularly for brewery-tied tenanted 
operators like Greene King.
3.  Minimum Unit Pricing. We remain 
supporters of a minimum unit price 
(MUP) for alcohol. We believe it would 
help to reduce the costs to society of 
irresponsible retailing and consumption 
of alcohol, although we do not expect 
legislation on MUP in this parliament. 
We primarily operate in three UK markets: 
informal eating out, worth £54bn*, drinking 
out, worth £22bn** and staying out, worth 
£27bn***. These are large, profitable and 
fragmented markets with long-term growth 
potential and opportunities for us to grow 
market share. Our focus on delivering industry 
leading value, service and quality, providing 
‘affordable treats’ to customers, combined 
with accelerating offer innovation, gives us 
a significant competitive advantage. It ensures 
we optimise the opportunities within each 
market, particularly in accessible growth 
segments and occasions such as breakfasts 
and takeaways in eating out, the trend towards 
premiumisation in drinking out and pub 
accommodation within staying out. 
We can also deliver competitive advantage 
through improved understanding of 
consumers and their evolving preferences. 
We anticipate trends such as health, 
convenience and customisation to grow 
in importance over the next few years and 
we are positioning our offers accordingly. 
Improving customer information and insight 
is therefore crucial to delivering sustainable 
sector-leading growth and margins. As a 
result, we made further investment in our 
digital platform and customer insight, 
covering areas such as targeted voucher 
offers, maintaining a regular dialogue 
with customers through social media 
and facilitating online table reservations.

Strategic progress
We are three years into our five-year strategy 
to improve growth and returns to shareholders 
through increasing our exposure to more 
attractive categories in our markets. We made 
further progress in all areas as we continue to 
invest in a successful future for Greene King:
1.  Expanding Retail to 1,100 sites and 
improving estate quality. We acquired 
or transferred in 38 sites to take the estate 
to 987 pubs, restaurants and hotels. 
Of the 38 sites, 15 were new Hungry Horse 
openings and 11 were Meet & Eat transfers. 
We opened our 200th Hungry Horse just 
after the year end. Since we began our 
strategy, the acquired sites have delivered 
an average site EBITDA ROI of 15.0%. 
2.  Reducing the Pub Partners estate, 
improving estate quality and increasing 
our offer influence. In Pub Partners, 
we disposed of 103 non-core sites and 
transferred 14 sites to Retail. Average 
EBITDA per pub grew 4.2% and there 
were 38 franchise and franchise-style 
sites at the year end. There are 331 sites, 
or 26% of the Pub Partners estate, under 
central offer influence. 
3.  Maintain industry-leading brand 
investment to strengthen leadership 
position. We again invested in our 
core ale brands to drive core own brewed 
volume (OBV) growth and UK ale market 
outperformance in Brewing & Brands. 
We relaunched TV advertising for Greene 
King IPA, Old Speckled Hen and Belhaven 
Best and our investment took a 45%* share 
of all ale media spend in the year. 
* Nielsen MAT to 31 March 2013.
Current trading and outlook
In the first eight weeks of the new financial 
year, we have delivered another strong trading 
performance, against tough comparatives 
with last year, which benefited from the 
Jubilee and Euro 2012. LFL sales in Retail 
were up 3.3%, helped by improved weather 
on both Bank Holiday weekends. Both food 
LFL sales and room LFL sales have been 
particularly strong. Average EBITDA in 
Pub Partners was up 5.1% and core OBV 
in Brewing & Brands was up 1.5%, taking 
further market share and continuing the 
momentum from the second half of the 
previous financial year. 
Although we have made a strong start, the 
overall outlook remains subdued and we are 
not assuming a pick-up in the economy this 
year. However, our strategy is designed, and 
proven to be appropriate, for these conditions 
as we shift our business towards higher 
growth areas of our markets and constantly 
improve our customer offer. We are confident 
of maintaining this momentum and delivering 
further value to our shareholders.

growth across all our key sales categories leading 
to an improvement in EBITDA per site. We believe 
Retail can get to 45% food sales share over the 
next few years.
PLANS FoR 2013/14 MoRE
We will continue to target disposals during the 
year to continue the estate reduction plan and 
reach around 1,200 sites in 2014. As well as 
achieving further average EBITDA growth per 
site, we also aim to increase the number of sites 
operating under a franchise or innovation 
agreement, where we have greater influence 
over the customer offer.
PLANS FoR 2013/14 MoRE
We are aiming for another year of volume growth 
in our core brands and increased market share

INCREASING ExPOSURE 
TO GROWTH CATEGORIES
Much of our food-led growth comes 
from increasing our exposure to growth 
categories. This includes our increased 
focus on food, wine and coffee. During 
the year we launched our own coffee 
brand, Big Bean, which has been rolled 
out across our Hungry Horse estate, 
helping sales of hot drinks to grow 6.2%,

Retail
Greene King Retail delivered another 
successful year, combining strong growth 
with further strategic progress. LFL sales 
growth was 2.3%, outperforming the sector 
average growth of 0.5%*, as the industry 
was hit by challenging weather in the second 
half of our financial year. Over the last five 
years, Retail has delivered average annual 
LFL sales growth of 3.3%. Of the 2.3% LFL 
sales growth in the year, 0.4% was driven 
by volume improvements and 1.9% by price, 
mix and spend per head improvements. 
All major sales categories achieved growth 
with food LFL sales up 2.9%, drink LFL sales 
up 1.8% and room LFL sales up 3.1%. London 
performed well with Realpubs achieving 
9.1% LFL sales growth. 
Total revenue was £863.6m, up 7.4% on 3.5% 
more sites. As a result, the average weekly 
take grew 3.8% to £17.1k. Retail also achieved 
strong profit growth, with operating profit 
of £167.7m, up 12.1%. The operating margin 
was 19.4%, an improvement of 80bps, driven 
by strong operational gearing, improved 
labour productivity, the delivery of acquisition 
synergies, and despite the weaker second 
half sales environment. 
* Coffer Peach Tracker.
There are a number of key factors driving 
the continued success in Retail:
1.  Exceeding customer value, 
service & quality expectations
 • Value. The flight to value by UK consumers, 
as they seek out ‘everyday treats’, continued 
in the year. We maintained a healthy balance 
between offering further value to our 
customers and continuing to improve our 
retail margins. In Hungry Horse, we increased 
the share of all covers sold through offers, 
while we simplified and improved our 
centrepiece two for £8.49 offer to all day, 
every day. In Loch Fyne Restaurants (LFR), 
we introduced ‘Loch Fyne Favourites’ via 
a meal and drink offer at £9.95, while in 
Old English Inns (OEI), we launched a lunch 
deal highlighting a sandwich, crisps and 
a drink for £4.95. In our Scottish sites, we 
lowered the average coffee price and increased 
the average serve size, while in Local Pubs 
we introduced additional known value item 
pricing on lager and for early week occasions. 
 • Service. We continued to roll out our 
tailored service enhancement programmes 
across the retail estate. Our ‘Hungry for 
Feedback’ guest satisfaction programme 
in Hungry Horse had over 70,000 customer 
responses in the year delivering a net 
promoter score (NPS) of 59.6% and 40,000 
positive individual employee comments. Our 
LFR ‘Keeping it Reel’ programme delivered 
a record NPS, halved customer complaints 
and doubled customer compliments, while 
guest satisfaction programmes were launched 
in Farmhouse Inns and Eating Inn.
 • Quality. In Local Pubs, we launched our 
Flame Grill family dining concept in the 
mainstream community segment, where 
we improved the quality of our unique grill 
offer through increased kitchen investment 
and more fresh meat items. In Eating Inn 
and Belhaven, we increased the number of 
fresh, homemade dishes, while we introduced 
improved menu specifications and additional 
carvery training into Farmhouse Inns. 
Across the whole of the Destination Pubs 
estate, our guest satisfaction score for food 
quality improved 16%pts through the year.
No issues were found in our supply chain 
during the horsemeat scandal that affected 
the food industry in February and March. 
We have a robust supply chain with thorough 
quality control procedures, although we took 
this opportunity to further strengthen 
procedures to ensure we provide the highest 
quality ingredients and we remain clear of 
any future industry mislabelling issues.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Operational review continued
Retail
2.  Broadening customer appeal 
through growth categories 
such as food, wine & coffee
We continue to pursue our strategy of 
increasing our share of the £54bn eating out 
market and increasing our share of sales driven 
by food and food occasions. On an organic 
basis, we primarily achieve this by broadening 
the appeal of our food offers to drive cover 
growth, alongside selected price and mix 
improvements to help offset annual 
cost inflation.
Against a market with value growth of 1.6%*, 
Retail food sales were up 9.7% to £336.9m. 
This took food’s share of our total sales to 40%, 
up 80bps on the previous year. Food LFL sales 
were up 2.9% with cover growth of 0.4%.
Much of our food growth comes from 
innovating to meet eating out consumer 
trends. We have identified three key trends: 
 • Customisation. We developed ‘fish your 
way’ in LFR, ‘burger your way’ in Eating 
Inn, and ‘build your own burger’ in Flame 
Grill and Meet & Eat. In Eating Inn, there 
are 560 different combinations of burger 
for a customer to choose from. 
 • Convenience. Our Cakeaway offer in 
Hungry Horse generated sales of £750k 
in the first full year and in our Local high 
street sites, we improved the breakfast 
offer, launched a lunchtime deli deal, 
and introduced a wider range of sharing 
platters for ‘after work’ customers. 
 • Health. We introduced a ‘live well’ section 
on our Eating Inn menu for dishes under 
700 calories and we stepped up the number 
of gluten free dishes in our menus. 
Wine and coffee are also important long-term 
growth categories for Retail.
Wine sales grew 15.8% and are now up 
62% in the last five years. On a per site basis, 
wine sales grew 11.8%. Our wines won 25 
International Wine Challenge awards this 
year, including 19 sourced directly by our 
expert wine team. In Metropolitan, our 
premium Local Pubs estate, we introduced 
a dedicated wine specialist and developed 
our own premium, directly sourced, 
own-label brand, Piazzi.
Hot beverage sales, of which coffee is 75%, 
grew 6.2% and we expect further growth as 
we grow our breakfast trade. We launched our 
own coffee brand, Big Bean, which has been 
successfully rolled out across the Hungry 
Horse estate. Across the rest of the estate, 
86% of our sites use illy as their coffee offer. 
* Allegra Eating Out Report 2013.
3.  Further aligning our estate 
to our customers through 
targeted acquisitions
We have targeted 1,100 sites by 2015 and we 
remain on track to achieve this. In the year, 
we increased our trading estate by a net 
33 sites, having acquired or transferred in 
38 sites and disposed of five non-core sites. 
This took the estate to 987 pubs, restaurants 
and hotels. Of those new sites, 12 were 
single-site acquisitions, 12 were new build 
openings, including our first Hungry Horse 
leasehold site, and 14 were transfers from 
Pub Partners, including 11 Meet & Eat sites. 
These transfers are supporting the expansion 
of the Meet & Eat brand within Retail. In 
addition, our pipeline for further expansion 
is healthy and we exchanged or completed 
on a further 30 sites. 
4.  Employing the best trained & 
motivated people in the sector
We have over 22,000 employees across the 
business. 94% work within Retail, taking part 
in 440m customer interactions each year. 
We therefore constantly look to improve the 
calibre of our teams to deliver the best value, 
service and quality in the sector. There are 
a number of ways this is achieved, including 
improving the working environment and 
building employee loyalty to Greene King as 
an employer brand through initiatives such 
as enhanced employee benefits, more effective 
communication and improved recruitment 
and training processes. 
At the heart of our approach is our 
Discovery Apprentice scheme, which we 
began in January 2011. The introduction of 
apprenticeships has improved the culture 
within Retail, as team members can more 
easily see a career path in hospitality ahead 
of them. We continue to grow the scheme 
and deliver excellent results: at the year end, 
we had almost 2,500 apprentices in Retail, 
of which 1,300 were ‘in learning’ and 1,200 
were fully trained. This equates to 12.3% of 
our Retail team, compared to 8.2% 12 months 
ago. Most importantly, 71% of our apprentices 
have successfully completed the programme, 
ahead of the national average of 62%. 
This focus on, and success of, our 
apprenticeship scheme has positively 
influenced team turnover, down 8%pts, 
employee engagement, up 4%pts, and labour 
productivity, which was 2.3% better than 
last year.
Finally, we believe that our positive reputation 
as an employer is attracting more and more 
people to work for Greene King. For example, 
we average 12 applications for every job 
vacancy in our new build sites, equivalent 
to almost 800 applications per site.
5.  Continued investment in our 
branded & segmented estate 
In our retail estate, we operate branded sites 
or sites segmented by customer occasion and 
demographics. We re-segmented our Local 
Pubs estate into five segments: Metropolitan, 
Mainstream High Street, Flame Grill, Meet 
& Eat and Value Sport. The new segmentation 
further simplifies the operating structure in 
Local Pubs and brings our Flame Grill and 
Meet & Eat concepts to the fore. Excluding 
these concepts, our fully branded pubs, 
restaurants and hotels represent 40% of our 
retail estate, with our leading brand, Hungry 
Horse, at 199 trading sites at the year end. 
Just after the year end, we opened our 
200th Hungry Horse, the Royal Horse in 
Leamington Spa, and we anticipate opening 
a further 25 in the new financial year. Also 
at the year end, there were 108 Old English 
Inns, 42 Loch Fyne Restaurants, 28 Eating 
Inns and 16 Farmhouse Inns, the former 
Cloverleaf estate.
We converted seven sites to the Realpubs 
or Capital Pub Company formats. On average, 
all the converted sites are delivering an 
EBITDA ROI of 33%, although we expect 
investment returns to moderate going forward.
In total, we spent £70.1m on repairing, 
maintaining and improving the quality of 
our existing retail estate, of which £31.7m 
was expansionary capital. This was invested 
in 140 sites, or 14.2% of the estate, and 
achieved an EBITDA ROI of 26%.
6.  Increasing investment in our 
expanding digital platform 
Investment in our digital platform has 
continued as we improve our customer 
understanding, directly target our tailored 
offers to the right demographics and occasions, 
and use direct feedback to improve the retail 
offer. Traffic on our websites grew 50% to 7.2m 
over the year with mobile traffic trebling to 
31% of the total, up from 17% last year. We 
averaged 138,000 ‘hits’ per week in total. 
Online table reservations grew 26% and 
generated £3.2m in sales. At the year end, 
we had 224,000 Facebook followers, up from 
23,000 last year. Our combined databases grew 
by 76%, we sent out over 20m marketing emails, 
our loyalty card holders increased ten-fold 
and our guest satisfaction feedback forms 
totalled 167,000.  Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

SUPPORTING 
OUR LICENSEES
Our Business Development Managers 
are highly trained to support our 
licensee partners in a range of areas, 
including pre contract-signing advice, 
to ensure they have the right information 
to choose the right agreement for their 
circumstances. This BDM support is 
essential to help us attract the best 
licensees into our pubs. We also provide 
online marketing support and on-going 
training and advice in a number of areas. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk
21
The tenanted and leased model has become 
challenged over the last five years and our 
response has been to reduce the size of our 
estate and to enhance our influence over the 
customer offer to improve licensee and pub 
sustainability. Pub Partners plays an important 
role in Greene King, through generating 
significant cash for the group, adding material 
purchasing scale and providing attractive 
yields on smaller pub sites.
On 8.8% fewer pubs, Pub Partners achieved 
revenue of £153.7m, down 5.5%. Revenue 
per pub was up 3.6%, with beer volume per 
pub in line and rent per pub ahead. EBITDA 
was £76.3m, down 4.9%, although average 
EBITDA per pub was up 4.2%. LFL EBITDA 
in the core estate was up 0.1% and total LFL 
EBITDA was level with the previous year, 
highlighting the profit and cash stability of 
Pub Partners. Operating profit was £68.1m, 
down 5.7%, with the operating margin 
holding up at 44.3%, down just 10bps.
Pub Partners is focused on operating the 
right pubs, with the right people, on the 
right agreement with the right offer:
 • Right pubs. We progressed our plan to 
reduce the size of the estate. We sold 103 
non-core sites and transferred 14 to Retail. 
This left 1,269 trading sites and 44 sites 
closed for disposal at the year end. 
We expect to dispose of around 125 sites 
during the new financial year. 
 • Right people. The recruitment of high 
quality licensees to run our pubs remains 
the most important element of the Pub 
Partners model. We made a number of 
improvements to our recruitment process, 
including the regionalisation of our 
recruitment teams and the introduction of 
licensee profiling. As a result, the number 
of new licensees in their pub, after one 
year, reached 83%. We also stepped up our 
licensee training, including a new service 
programme. Licensees that attended the 
course saw an average 12.5%pts increase 
in their mystery guest service scores.  
 
Having the best Business Development 
Managers (BDMs) is an important 
differentiator. During the year, 12 BDMs 
completed their diplomas in Multi-Unit 
Leadership at Birmingham City University 
and three have gone onto the Masters 
programme. We also began supporting 
our licensees to recruit apprentices into 
their businesses, saving them £1,500 per 
employee in labour costs. At the year end, 
there were 82 apprentices in the Pub 
Partners estate. 
 • Right agreements. Our new suite of 
agreements, including Touchstone and 
Touchstone Plus tenancies, started to gain 
traction, with 108 new agreements in place 
at the year end. We also had 38 franchise 
or franchise-style agreements, with our 
innovative concept, Local Hero, growing 
strongly. There were 17 Local Hero sites 
at the year end delivering an average £3k 
sales uplift and an EBITDA ROI of 31%. 
We anticipate the Local Hero estate 
rising to around 30 sites over the new 
financial year. 
 • Right offer. We do all we can to help our 
licensees deliver the right customer offer 
to maximise profits and align their interests 
with ours. At the year end, we had 830 sites, 
or 65% of the trading estate, on some form 
of free-of-tie (FOT) agreement, including 
21 sites completely FOT. We had 331 sites, 
or 26% of the estate, under an element of 
central offer influence and we provided 
800 sites with free advertising boards to 
improve their external offer communication. 
We launched a digital support tool called 
Footfall 123, which led to 85 sites initiating 
a loyalty card scheme, and our Sports Club 
and Head Brewers Cask Club each had 
over 300 members by the year end. 
As a result of these initiatives, two additional 
key metrics improved during the year. 
Average licensee tenure increased by one 
month to four years and eight months, while 
our licensee NPS increased 11%pts to 34.3%, 
better than a number of Pub Partners’ 
retail competitors.

Brewing & Brands
Brewing & Brands is a strong business with 
market-leading ales, supported by industry-
leading brand investment and a highly efficient 
brewing model, combining to deliver the 
highest ROCE within Greene King. While 
there are significant opportunities for 
long-term growth in parts of our business, 
there are structural headwinds negatively 
impacting elsewhere. These include supplier 
cost increases adversely affecting our free 
trade wholesaling business, particularly in 
Scotland, declining volume in the tenanted 
industry and a reduction in the number 
of Pub Partners’ sites.
The year was split into two. The first half 
saw core own brewed volumes (OBV) down 
0.9% and operating profit down 13.5%, 
while the second half recovery, led by our 
continued sector-leading brand investment 
and innovation, delivered 2.7% core OBV 
growth and operating profit down 4.8%.
Core OBV in Brewing & Brands was up 
1.0%, outperforming a UK ale market down 
3.9%*. Within this strong performance, 
Old Speckled Hen, the UK’s no.1 premium 
ale brand, achieved volume growth of 6.9%, 
against a premium ale market up just 0.2%*. 
In addition, Greene King IPA achieved 
volume growth of 3.3%, against a standard 
ale market down 5.6%*. Our volume share 
of the UK ale market rose to 10.5%**.
Brewing & Brands further repositioned 
towards the long-term growth channels of 
take home and export. After a year of strong 
growth, the share of OBV through these 
channels was up 3.5%pts to 38.3%, driven by 
the success of our golden ales in take home, 
including Greene King IPA Gold and Old 
Golden Hen, and the introduction of our 
new smoothflow can for Greene King IPA. 
Revenue was £177.4m, up 2.1%, helped by 
strong growth in bottled ale, as, since the 
year end, we became the UK’s leading 
bottled ale brewer with a 16.7%*** value 
share. EBITDA fell 7.8% to £35.4m and 
operating profit fell 9.1% to £30.0m.
Our out-performance is driven by industry-
leading investment and innovation in our 
core ale brand portfolio. During the year, 
Old Speckled Hen, Greene King IPA and 
Belhaven Best returned to television 
advertising as part of a combined £4.5m 
campaign, as we invested 45% of the total 
ale market media investment in the year. 
Our innovative brand extensions, such as 
Old Golden Hen and Belhaven Black, grew 
to around 7% of total OBV.
Our focus on delivering an attractive value 
proposition to our customers has again led 
to new account wins in free trade, including 
Saracens, Worcestershire Cricket Club, 
Sheffield United and Imperial College, 
and across leading national pub retailers.
We maintained our consistently high 
service and quality levels. Our internal 
service measure, covering the whole of our 
supply chain, rose to 97.6%, comfortably 
ahead of target. On quality, Greene King IPA 
Reserve and Greene King IPA Gold won Grand 
Gold and Gold awards respectively at the 
2013 Monde Awards. We put 1,300 delegates 
through the BII cellar management course, 
we retained our Red Tractor status and 
achieved ISO9001 for the 20
th
 year in 
succession. Finally, our visitor centre achieved 
a 2013 Certificate of Excellence from Trip 
Advisor, putting it in the top 10% of global 
visitor attractions for quality.

Financial review
BUSINESS REVIEW
STRONG 
PERFORMANCE
“ Revenue grew by 4.8% driven by growth 
in our Retail business. Profit before tax and 
exceptionals was up 6.6%. Operating cash 
flows were strong and we increased our 
return on capital employed to 8.9%.”
Once again, the benefits of a consistent and 
clear strategy to deliver earnings and dividend 
growth continue to be seen in the performance 
of the group. The highlights are:
 • Revenue up 4.8% to £1,194.7m.
 • Profit before tax and exceptionals up 6.6%.
 • Dividend per share up 7.3%.
 • Reduction in net debt to EBITDA to 4.7x.
 • ROCE up 40bps to 8.9%.
 • New financing in place. 
Results 
Revenue grew by 4.8% to £1,194.7m. The 
biggest driver of this growth came from our 
retail estate, where revenue grew by 7.4% 
and average revenue per pub rose 3.8%. Our 
retail estate now accounts for over 72% of 
group revenue and will continue to grow its 
share as we progress towards our target of 
1,100 retail sites. Total revenue in Pub Partners 
was down 5.5%, while average revenue per 
pub increased by 3.6%. Brewing & Brands 
grew revenue by 2.1%. 
Operating profit before exceptionals was 
£248.2m, up 5.1%, with the group operating 
margin up 10bps to 20.8%, despite the 
changing business mix of the group. Control 
over costs and cash remains strong with the 
retail operating margin growing 80bps to 
19.4%, despite significant cost inflation.
Net interest costs before exceptional items of 
£86.2m were only 2.4% higher than last year, 
as a result of strong cash flow management 
and despite a reduction in the IFRS pension 
interest credit of £1.2m.
Profit before tax and exceptionals was £162.0m, 
an increase of 6.6%. Adjusted earnings per 
share of 57.0p was up 7.5%, benefiting from 
the reduction in the effective tax rate. Statutory 
profit before tax was £114.8m, down 8.2%.
Tax
The effective rate of corporation tax (before 
exceptional items) was 24% compared to 25% 
in the previous year, resulting in a charge to 
operating profits (before exceptional items) 
of £38.9m. This is in line with the standard 
UK corporation tax rate and is expected 
to remain in line. 
However, our full year contribution to 
HM Treasury was much higher with a total 
of £375m in total taxes paid or generated 
(including beer duty, VAT, PAYE etc.). 
This is equivalent to 31% of our turnover 
and is seven times the dividends we paid 
out to our shareholders.
The group’s tax policy, which has been 
approved by the board, is aligned with 
the business strategy. It seeks to protect 
shareholder value by structuring operations 
in a tax efficient manner, while complying 
with all relevant tax laws and legislation, 
and fulfilling our obligations as a 
responsible UK tax payer.
Exceptional items
As set out in note five, we recorded a net 
exceptional charge of £24.8m, consisting 
of a £19.0m charge to operating profit before 
tax, a £28.2m charge to finance costs and 
an exceptional tax credit of £22.4m.
The key items in operating profit were a 
£8.4m credit as a consequence of closure 
of the defined benefit pension schemes to 
future accrual, offset by an impairment 
charge of £17.7m against the carrying value 
of a small number of our pubs, where specific 
market conditions have impacted trading, 
and £6.7m relating to disposals, which 
includes £4.5m of related goodwill.
An exceptional finance cost of £28.2m has 
been recognised in respect of the fair value 
of the interest rate swap no longer qualifying 
for hedge accounting, in anticipation of the 
post year-end repurchase of the AB1 floating 
rate bond.
In addition to a tax credit of £9.0m in respect 
of the above items, the exceptional tax credit 
of £22.4m includes a deferred tax credit of 
£6.1m, arising from the reduction in the rate 
of corporation tax from 24% to 23%, effective 
from 1 April 2013, and a deferred tax credit 
of £7.5m, in respect of the licensed estate. 
Cash flow
Operating cash flows were strong. We 
generated record free cash flow (FCF) of 
£63.1m, up from £38.5m in the previous year, 
and comfortably ahead of our scheduled 
debt repayments of £27.8m. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

BUSINESS REVIEW
Financial review continued
BUSINESS REVIEW
Cash flow continued
EBITDA, before exceptional items, was 
£306.5m, up 5.0%, from 4% fewer pubs. 
We disposed of 108 sites as part of our 
strategy to improve the quality of our estate 
with the cash proceeds totalling £28.0m.
As outlined below, we made good progress 
towards our target of growing our retail 
estate to 1,100 sites with a cash outflow on 
acquisitions and acquired sites totalling 
£46.3m, bringing the net cash inflow 
to £42.8m.
Capital expenditure
We again kept constant our level of 
investment in maintaining and developing 
our core estate, as well as investing to grow 
the size of our retail estate. The result is a 
well invested estate with total expenditure 
of £39.7m in the year.
Capital expenditure on the core estate, 
including maintenance capital, was £79.4m, 
compared to £81.3m in the previous year. 
A further £22.6m was invested in acquiring 
single sites, with £23.7m invested on these 
and previously acquired sites.
Looking forward, we have a strong pipeline 
of new retail sites and we are on track to open 
30 new builds and single site acquisitions each 
year, as well as identifying further transfer 
opportunities from the tenanted estate.
Net debt and financing
Net debt at the year end was £1,450.4m, 
a reduction of £42.8m from the previous 
year end, with the key movements being 
positive FCF of £63.1m, disposal proceeds 
of £28.0m and the continued investment in 
growing our retail estate, through new sites, 
of £46.3m.
Our financing strategy is designed to 
ensure we can access sufficiently diversified 
funding sources, maintain sufficient stand-by 
liquidity and mitigate re-financing risk, 
while maintaining an effective total cost 
of borrowing.
The principal element of our funding 
structure is a portfolio of securitised bonds, 
totalling £1,292.7m, with final maturity dates 
ranging from 2021 to 2036. The weighted 
average maturity of these bonds is 14 years. 
During the year, the group made scheduled 
debt repayments of £27.8m.
The group also maintains a revolving credit 
facility, which was £180m drawn at the 
year end.
Since the financial year end, the group has 
renegotiated its revolving credit facility, 
increasing its size from £400m to £460m 
and extending its maturity from April 2016 
to June 2018. At the same time, a group entity 
has purchased the £60m AB1 bond issued by 
the securitisation vehicle. The impact of this 
transaction will help to mitigate the scheduled 
increase in interest costs on the securitised 
debt due to start in June 2013, as well as 
providing further liquidity. 
Our blended cost of debt was 5.9% with 
interest rate hedges in place for 99% of the 
year-end debt at a fixed rate. Going forward 
from June 2013, we expect a blended cost of 
debt of 6.1% after all of the securitised bond 
step-ups and the impact of the re-financing 
outlined above. 
Our overall credit metrics remain strong. 
Fixed charge cover has improved to 2.7x from 
2.6x and interest cover has also improved 
to 2.9x from 2.7x. Annualised net debt to 
EBITDA has reduced to 4.7x and will continue 
to improve as we maximise the annual 
EBITDA returns from the underlying 
business and our investments in new sites. 
Our securitised vehicle had a FCF debt 
service cover ratio of 1.5x at the year end, 
giving 29% headroom.
Return on capital employed
At the year end, our ROCE, on an annualised 
basis, was 8.9%, up from 8.5%. This growth 
is due to strong capital disciplines and 
improvements in the underlying profitability 
of the business, coupled with our stated 
strategy of investing trading cash flows and 
disposal proceeds into expanding our retail 
estate, where we are able to achieve returns 
significantly ahead of our cost of capital.
As we continue to invest and increase the 
number of new retail sites, particularly new 
builds opened each year, the full impact on 
ROCE will not be seen immediately as we 
invest capital ahead of the income stream. 
That said, the returns we are achieving on 
sites opened since 2009 remain very strong 
with a combined EBITDA ROI of 15.0%.
Dividend
The board has recommended a final dividend 
of 19.45 pence per share, up 7.5%. This will 
be paid on 9 September 2013 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
9 August 2013.
The proposed final dividend brings the 
total dividend for the year to 26.6 pence 
per share, up 7.3%.
This is in line with the board’s policy of 
maintaining a minimum dividend cover 
of two times underlying earnings, while 
continuing to invest for future growth, 
and maintains our long-term track record 
of annual dividend growth.
Pensions
The group maintains a defined contribution 
scheme, which is open to all new employees. 
The group’s three defined benefit schemes are 
all closed to new entrants. During the year, 
the group completed a consultation with the 
remaining active members of the defined 
benefit schemes, resulting in the schemes 
being closed to future accrual and members 
being invited to join the defined contribution 
scheme instead. A net gain of £8.4m has 
been recognised within exceptional items, 
comprising a £10.1m gain, in respect of past 
service accrual, no longer being linked to 
future salary growth, less £1.7m of 
implementation costs.
At the year end, there was an IAS 19 pension 
deficit of £63.8m, which compares to £67.3m 
at the previous year end. The movement is 
primarily driven by the exceptional gain 
following the closure of the scheme to 
future accrual.
Total cash contributions in the period were 
£10.1m for both past and current service.
The triennial valuation for our main pension 
scheme was completed in the year and the 
future annual deficit funding payments will 
reduce to £6.9m from a previous payment 
level of £10.5m. 
Summary
The group has continued to make good 
progress across all of the key financial 
metrics during the year, with both earnings 
and dividend growth, underpinned by 
strong margins and credit metrics, reduced 
leverage and an improving ROCE.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Risks and uncertainties 
Greene King has a formal risk management process which is designed to identify, 
assess and prioritise risks within the business, so that their impact on sustainable 
profitability is minimised and the group is able to deliver our business plans 
and strategic objectives, as well as to maximise shareholder returns. 
The board retains ultimate responsibility for 
the company’s risk management framework 
and reviews the group’s principal risks on 
an annual basis. The board has delegated 
responsibility for assurance for the risk 
management process to the audit committee, 
which regularly reviews the risk management 
processes for each division and functional area. 
The implementation of risk management and 
internal control systems is the responsibility 
of the executive directors and other 
senior management.
Each division and functional area is 
responsible for maintaining, reviewing 
and regularly updating a risk register. 
Classification of risks takes into account the 
likelihood of their occurrence and the scale 
of potential impact (both financial and 
reputational) on the business. Each division 
and functional area is then responsible for 
drawing up plans to manage new risks or 
gaps in mitigation plans. Progress of these 
risk implementation plans is monitored by 
senior management on a regular basis. In 
addition, a company-wide risk committee 
reviews the individual risk registers in detail, 
monitors the risk mitigation plans and assists 
in the production of the group risk register. 
Given that some risks are external and not 
fully within our control, the risk management 
processes are designed to manage risks which 
may have a material impact on our business, 
rather than to fully mitigate all risks.
This section highlights some of the key risks 
and uncertainties which affect Greene King, 
but it is not intended to be an exhaustive 
analysis of all risks facing the business.

To achieve our Retail 
expansion plans we need to be 
able to acquire existing pubs, 
smaller pub businesses and 
brown or greenfield sites on 
which to build new pubs.
A failure to find and secure the 
acquisition (and development where 
appropriate) of top quality sites could 
reduce our rate of growth in the future.
We maintain a pipeline of sites available 
for purchase and a team of acquisition 
managers responsible for securing new 
sites on an on-going basis. Our in-house 
property development team is employed 
to help deliver new-build projects on 
time and on budget.
Regular updates are provided to 
management as to the status of potential 
acquisitions and of development progress 
for new build sites or major conversions 
of acquired pubs. Monthly estate plan 
meetings are held to discuss progress.
The current economic 
situation and fluctuations 
in the UK property market 
may make it more difficult 
to reduce the size of our 
tenanted estate. 
It may be more difficult to dispose of 
properties at an appropriate valuation, 
impacting our ability to reinvest those 
funds elsewhere or service debt. 
This may also lead us to continuing 
operating pubs that are in long-term 
profit decline.
We have an on-going programme 
of investment in our sites, in the form 
of both expansionary and maintenance 
capital. Under-performing sites receive 
additional operational focus through our 
Independence Pub division. Our team of 
estate managers is tasked with achieving 
the sale of proposed disposal sites at the 
best possible prices.
There is regular assessment of the 
long-term value of all of our sites 
by the property department.
We are investing significantly 
in our core ale brands to drive 
core own-brand volume 
growth and UK ale market 
out-performance.
A failure to execute this strategy 
correctly could result in lower or 
stagnant sales growth in those brands, 
affecting profitability.
This year we have invested £7 .3m in 
marketing relating to our beers, with 
national TV advertising campaigns for 
Greene King IPA, Old Speckled Hen 
and Belhaven Best.
The Brewing & Brands executive team 
reviews and approves brand investment 
proposals, monitors customer opinions 
and is tasked with turning increased 
investment into increased sales.

An event or series of events 
(including poor service standards 
and food provenance issues) may 
occur which damages our brand 
in the eyes of our customers, 
particularly in the age of 
increasing use of social media.
Customers may stop visiting our sites 
or visit less frequently, leading to a loss 
of revenue and reputational damage.
W e maintain tight controls (including with 
regard to food provenance) to protect 
and enhance our reputation and brand 
values, alongside staff training, targeted 
investment programmes and mystery 
guest visits. Incident escalation and 
management systems are also in place. 
Mystery guest scores are regularly 
measured and reviewed by the relevant 
executive teams in our Retail divisions. 
We have introduced a new supplier 
assurance programme to enable us 
to give appropriate assurances to 
our customers as to the provenance 
of the food in our pubs.
W e are reliant on information 
systems and technology for many 
aspects of our business.
W e are reliant on the quality of 
our employees and our licensees.
A lengthy failure of any such systems, 
howsoever caused, could impact our 
ability to do business and cause 
reputational damage.
A failure to attract, develop, retain and 
motivate the best employees at all levels 
of the organisation and the best tenants 
may mean that we are not able to execute 
our business plans and strategy.
Our networks are protected by firewalls 
and anti-virus protection systems and 
back-up procedures are also in place. 
A business continuity plan is in place 
for critical business processes. We have 
access to an off-site disaster recovery 
facility in the event of a major issue 
with our head office or our systems.
W e aim to recruit the best people and offer 
training and development programmes to 
ensure that we retain them. Remuneration 
packages are benchmarked to ensure that 
they remain competitive. The range of 
tenancy agreements, training programmes 
and support available is designed to attract 
and retain the best quality licensees.
The IT department constantly monitor 
threats to data protection by viruses, 
hacking and breach of access controls. 
The business continuity plan is also 
regularly reviewed and tested.
Our annual employee engagement 
survey is used to obtain direct feedback 
from employees on a range of issues. 
Both staff and licensee turnover is 
measured and reviewed by relevant 
management teams.
W e are reliant on a number of 
key suppliers and third party 
distributors to supply our pubs 
and restaurants and are also at 
risk of an event occurring which 
may prevent us from producing, 
packaging and distributing our 
own beers.
Supply disruption (whether of our own 
beers or any third party products) could 
impact customer satisfaction. Additionally 
a key supplier or distributor failure 
could over the longer term reduce our 
revenue or lead to increased costs if 
alternative arrangements are required.
Detailed risk management and mitigation 
plans exist in our internal production 
and distribution activities. Our key 
suppliers are expected to maintain 
disaster recovery plans. We also maintain 
back-up plans in the event of the failure 
by or loss of a key supplier.
Risk mitigation and product recall plans 
are reviewed and tested regularly across 
the business and disaster recovery plans 
of suppliers are reviewed regularly. The 
financial stability of key suppliers that 
we regard as most at risk is monitored 
with the help of external advisers.

The wider economic situation 
within the UK affects consumer 
confidence, with a consequential 
impact on levels of consumer 
spending in our pubs and those 
of our tenants and lessees. 
W e also face increasing 
competitor activity .
A prolonged recession or delay in 
economic recovery, or significant 
competitor activity, could reduce our 
revenue and lead to lower growth rates. 
More tenant defaults and business 
failures could also reduce revenue and 
increase costs in the form of tenant 
support or recruiting new licensees.
By focusing on value, service and quality 
we aim to continue to appeal to a broad 
range of consumers. We have a wide 
geographic spread of pubs including the 
more affluent areas of London and the 
South East, and a good range of customer 
offers. For our tenants and lessees we 
provide on-going training, operational 
and financial support alongside continued 
agreement innovation to ensure that 
more of our tenants are able to run 
profitable businesses.
The executive teams and the board receive 
regular updates on performance. 
Competitor activity is monitored at both 
a strategic and tactical level to enable 
suitable actions to be developed in 
response. All business units keep and 
update profit protection plans in case 
of any downturn in trading conditions. 
Our Pub Partners division constantly 
monitors the vital signs of our licensee 
health, including debt levels and the 
numbers of tenancies at will.
Inflationary trends increase 
the costs of our key products, 
including food, drink and site 
services including utilities. 
Higher costs could impact margins 
and lead to reduced profitability.
We have contracts in place with major 
suppliers designed to protect us against 
significant increases in major cost items 
and against price volatility . W e continually 
evolve the composition of menus and 
retail prices to optimise value to the 
customer and profits for the company.
All costs, including labour, are closely 
monitored by the executive teams 
to ensure that they remain in line 
with budget.

Risks and uncertainties continued
SPECIFIC RISK AREAS PoTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATIoN MoNIToRING/ASSURANCE
The government is currently 
consulting on a statutory code 
to manage the relationship 
between pub companies and 
their tenants which could have 
significant implications for 
our Pub Partners division. 
There is also a risk of further 
legislative changes in relation 
to alcohol and licensing.
A new stautory code could increase 
costs for Pub Partners and reduce 
revenue. Additional taxation or further 
changes to laws on the sale of alcohol 
could lead to both reduced revenue and 
increased costs across the group.
We have responded to the recent 
government consultation in relation to the 
proposed statutory code and will continue 
to engage actively with government to 
argue for more time to be given for the 
self-regulatory code to prove its worth. 
We also aim to ensure that government 
appreciates that the safest and most 
responsible place to consume alcohol 
is in a well-managed licensed 
on-trade premises. 
The regulatory landscape is monitored 
on an on-going basis by our public 
affairs team, so we remain aware of any 
potential changes which may adversely 
impact our business.
We are required to comply 
with a wide range of health 
and safety legislation, including 
in the areas of food safety and 
fire safety, across all parts 
of our business.
A major food safety or health and safety 
incident which causes serious illness, 
injury or even loss of life to one of our 
customers, employees or tenants 
could have a significant impact 
on our reputation.
We have a comprehensive range of 
formally documented policies and 
procedures in place to ensure compliance 
with current legislation and approved 
guidance in this area, as well as our own 
high standards. Our health and safety 
policies have been reviewed by our 
primary authority partner, Reading 
Borough Council, which has rated our 
safety management systems as very 
good. Safety levels for new tenants have 
been improved, and safety measures are 
in place to ensure that product integrity 
is maintained and that all food and 
drink products are fully traceable.
We have a centrally managed system 
of compliance tracking (KPIs), which 
is validated by both internal and 
independent external audits carried out 
at all Retail sites to measure performance 
against certain strict health and safety 
standards including food safety and fire 
safety . Operational managers are regularly 
briefed on performance and remedial 
actions are tracked from the centre.

Our financing structure requires 
us to be able to repay capital 
borrowed and interest on 
time and to ensure that we 
operate within certain 
financial covenants.
Breaching our financial covenants would 
have a significant impact on our ability to 
pay dividends or reinvest cash back into 
the business. It could also impact our 
reputation and on-going creditworthiness.
Our long-term strategy and yearly 
business plans are formulated to ensure 
that financial covenants can be met. Our 
securitised vehicle had a free cash flow 
debt service cover ratio at the year end 
of 1.5x, giving 29% headroom. Under our 
bank facility we had 135% headroom on 
the key net debt/EBITDA covenant.
We regularly monitor our performance 
against our financial covenants, including 
stress-testing. Working capital is carefully 
forecast, regularly reviewed by the 
finance teams and closely managed.
We are reliant on maintaining 
robust systems of internal 
control to deal accurately 
with the large numbers of 
transactions undertaken by 
the business and to ensure 
compliance with statutory 
obligations particularly 
with regard to taxation.
Inadequate internal control systems 
increase the risk of fraud being perpetrated 
against us. Non-compliance with statutory 
obligations or a material mis-statement 
in the reported results of the company 
could damage our reputation.
Our systems of internal control, more 
details of which appear on page 45, 
include robust controls, appropriately 
qualified staff, segregation of duties and 
authority levels for expenditure and 
payments. Appropriate advice is taken 
to ensure relevant statutory compliance. 
Regular management accounts are 
produced for each area and reviewed 
in detail, to enable irregularities to be 
exposed. There is a detailed external 
audit of our statutory accounts. 
There is regular monitoring of the 
schemes’ investments and dialogue 
with the trustees on an on-going basis 
regarding funding requirements.
We maintain three defined 
benefit pension schemes 
which must be funded to meet 
the required benefit payments. 
The value and funding of the 
schemes are subject to the risk 
of changes in life expectancy, 
actual and expected price 
inflation and changes in 
investment yields.
The difference in value between the 
schemes’ assets and liabilities may vary, 
resulting in an increased deficit being 
recognised on our balance sheet. 
The volatility of this deficit makes 
longer-term planning more difficult.
All the schemes are now closed to 
future accrual to reduce volatility.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Corporate social responsibility
As the leading UK pub retailer and 
brewer, it is vital that we operate a 
sustainable and responsible business. 
We take the maintenance and delivery 
of an effective social responsibility 
programme very seriously. 
Our focus
This year, our focus is on our impact 
on four key stakeholder areas: our 
customers, our communities, people 
and our environment. We continue to 
make good progress in our corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) goals and 
for next year we have set even more 
challenging targets. Details of our CSR 
policies and practices can be found in 
the social responsibility section of our 
website www.greeneking.co.uk. 
Pubs continue to play a vital role for 
customers, families and communities 
across the UK and provide safe, affordable 
hospitality, especially in this difficult 
financial environment.
Our commitment to delivering industry-
leading value, service and quality to our 
customers is supported by our strong retail 
brands and innovation, which drives us to 
deliver the best experience possible for 
our customers.
Food authenticity – 
horsemeat scandal 
We know how important it is that our 
customers can trust the food that they 
eat in our pubs, hotels and restaurants. 
As soon as we heard the news of mislabelling 
of meat products, in addition to the strict 
tests already carried out on our supply 
chain, we immediately began a series 
of additional DNA tests. 
The horsemeat scandal highlighted the 
need for changes within the global food 
supply chain to enable customers to eat with 
confidence. All of our meat is from fully 
traceable sources and our customers can be 
assured that we take the quality of the food 
we serve very seriously. Greene King has 
always had robust measures in place to 
ensure that our suppliers and products meet 
our exacting standards and we were pleased 
to be in a position to reassure our customers 
that no horse meat was found in any of our 
dishes following a full programme of tests. 
We will not become complacent and we are 
introducing additional measures to ensure 
the on-going integrity and quality of our 
products. We have engaged an international 
risk assessment specialist company to carry 
out a full risk assessment of our suppliers to 
determine integrity and traceability, including 
oUR CUSToMERS
checks all the way back to the raw ingredients 
of every dish. We are also implementing a 
new system for the management of our 
menu specifications.
Healthy eating 
This year we have increased our range 
of healthier dishes in our Premium Local 
pubs. These include broad bean risotto, 
bulgar wheat salad, skinny burger, oven 
baked fishcakes, haricot bean dip, vitality 
salad and frozen yoghurt. In conjunction 
with this, we have also expanded our range 
of super food salads across our menus, 
incorporating ingredients such as pomegranate 
and avocado, which are key indicators 
for healthier food choices. 
Our lower calorie menu sections have now 
been extended to our Old English Inns (OEI) 
and Eating Inn menus, offering an increased 
range of healthier dishes. With lunchtime 
being an important dining occasion, we have 
also introduced a gluten-free bread option 
into OEI, Eating Inn and our mainstream 
high street menus. This has been received 
well, with 2% of our mainstream high street 
customers choosing this as an option. 
As part of our on-going commitment to 
reduce the levels of salt within our supply 
chain, we have made further progress in 
meeting the government’s 2012 salt targets 
and are continuing to review our products 
in line with the current recommendations. 
This year we have already seen a 7% reduction 
in the levels of salt in back bacon across 
our estate. 
Stay safe with Safe Start 
Last year saw the introduction of a new Safe 
Start initiative in our leased and tenanted 
division. The Safe Start pack comprises a 
complete set of statutory tests including gas, 
electricity and fire safety, which are carried 
out before the new licensee takes over the 
pub. Licensees are now also required to 
pass an online Safe Start exam before 
taking on a pub. 
This is now an embedded behaviour across 
our leased and tenanted estate and continues 
to be an essential part of our letting procedure 
with 409 new tenants undertaking the online 
training and benefiting from the complete 
set of statutory checks during the year. The 
Belhaven estate was successfully integrated 
into the same process during the year.
Quality standards for our beers
Our Bury St Edmunds brewery site has been 
awarded the highest quality grade for the 
third consecutive year of unannounced 
audits with the British Retail Consortium. 
Our Belhaven brewery also has a similar 
level of award with pre planned visits. This 
award confirms that our beer is produced to 
the highest quality and food safety standards.
We have introduced new quality measures 
to track quality in glass with cellar inspections, 
beer tasting for customers, as well as 
customer feedback surveys. 
Responsible retailing
We strive to ensure that alcohol produced 
or sold by Greene King is consumed 
responsibly. Greene King has invested in, 
launched and maintains the website  
http://enjoyresponsibly.co.uk/. This was 
created to offer free and practical advice on 
all aspects of alcohol use, with guidance on 
health safety levels and even has practical 
advice on where to go for support for people 
who feel they have a problem with alcohol.

bottles and cans. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

Local communities are fundamental to 
the UK’s unique identity and, within such 
communities local pubs play a vital and 
central role. They are, quite literally, the 
hub of the community and the place where 
everyone comes together to relax and to 
discuss issues that affect that community. 
Greene King recognises the value of that 
role within the social fabric of our society 
and how, for everyone, maintaining the 
presence of a pub in a community is essential. 
Beyond that core social role, but linked to it, 
Greene King has developed a programme to 
support key organisations that address the 
inequalities in our society.
Pub is the Hub
This year, we extended our community 
support by providing £15,000 of central 
funding to ‘Pub is the Hub’. This is a 
not-for-profit organisation offering 
independent, specialist advice on rural 
services diversification or community 
ownership of pubs, so they can continue 
to provide viable local services at the 
heart of the community.
Our funding supports Pub is the Hub’s 
‘Community Services Fund’, established 
in April 2013 to help UK pubs to diversify 
into new services provision for their 
own communities. 
With its track record of rural project 
development and delivery over the last 
ten years, Pub is The Hub has worked with 
licensees to open 100 post offices, 125 shops, 
30 computer training centres, provision for 
allotments, play areas, libraries, school meals, 
local cinemas, and in the region of 30 pubs 
being run by their own local community.
Responsible retailing continued
Our promotional materials carry clear 
and concise messages encouraging sensible 
drinking and all our bottles, cans and outer 
packaging specify the number of units of 
alcohol in them, the NHS guidelines and the 
drinking whilst pregnant advisory logo. 
Greene King also supports the principles 
laid out in the Portman Code of Practice 
on responsible retailing of alcohol. All retail 
managers and our bar staff are trained upon 
recruitment and on-going to ensure they 
understand their role in promoting the 
responsible consumption of alcohol by 
our customers. 
Tackling under-age sales
All of our directly managed premises operate 
‘challenge 21’ or ‘challenge 25’ programmes 
and free of charge notices are available to all 
of our premises. Our premises are regularly 
audited both in-house and externally to ensure 
that notices are displayed in prominent 
positions advising customers that a ‘challenge 
21’ or ‘challenge 25’ policy is in force.
Best Bar None and Pub Watch schemes
172 of our managed pubs belong to recognised 
Pub Watch schemes and a further 42 have 
or are currently signed up to Best Bar None 
award schemes, with an additional 32 awaiting 
schemes currently on hold to commence. 
Last year, 18 of our pubs were accredited 
with Best Bar None status, some of whom 
were awarded best in specific categories. 
Teams at the Blue Anchor, Aintree and 
Rudds Arms, Middlesborough were Best 
Pub Runners-up within their individual 
schemes. The Frog & Parrot and Museum, 
Sheffield both received a Distinction for 
their efforts. Baldwins, Great Barr won 
Best Suburban Bar and The Turf Tavern 
in Carlisle won the overall Best Pub award 
in their scheme.
Limit awareness
We support the government’s anti-drink 
drive Christmas campaigns. In 2011 and 
2012, we also supported the Designated 
Driver Christmas Campaign in conjunction 
with Coca-Cola Enterprises Limited, 
throughout our managed pubs estate, where 
we offered free soft drinks at Christmas 
for designated drivers. 
Minimum unit pricing for alcohol
In order to tackle the misuse of alcohol, which 
causes ill health and can lead to anti-social 
behaviour within communities, Greene King 
has long advocated the need for a minimum 
unit price (MUP) for alcohol, throughout the 
UK, as a targeted approach to tackle the easy 
availability of cheap alcohol in the off-trade. 
This, plus a range of associated measures, such 
as better alcohol-education for adults and 
children, and a ban on multi-buy deals, are 
essential for the future health and wellbeing 
of our society.
This year, Greene King established and 
led a coalition of similarly minded industry 
stakeholders who have called on the UK 
government to remain committed to its 
stated aim to introduce MUP. 
Not only could such a step significantly 
improve public health, it would also 
reinforce the family experience, which our 
pubs and restaurants aim to create, quite 
apart from the broader societal benefits.
Public Health Responsibility 
Deal – progress on our pledges
Over the last year, our focus has centred 
on a number of priorities including pledges 
made in connection with the government’s 
Public Health Responsibility Deal (PHRD). 
The PHRD taps into our potential to 
make a significant contribution by taking 
a collaborative approach to tackling the 
challenges caused by lifestyle choices. Details 
of our signed pledges and our progress is set

Focus 12
Greene King continues to support the work 
of the charity, Focus 12, based close to our 
head office and brewery in Bury St Edmunds, 
Suffolk. Focus 12 provides treatment for 
clients with drugs and alcohol dependency, 
as well as guidance and counselling for 
affected family members. 
In May, the Greene King Charity ball raised 
over £20,000 for Focus 12, thereby enabling 
them to continue to support the local 
community and tackle the effects of alcohol 
and drug abuse. 
Focus 12’s chief executive, Chip Somers, said: 
‘We are always grateful for any fundraising 
but feel especially that Greene King has taken 
a brave stance in supporting a charity such 
as ours. The money raised will enable at least 
five people to go through the three-month 
programme which will hopefully change the 
lives of them and all their family members.’
Case study – raising funds for Macmillan
To mark the opening of our 200th Hungry 
Horse pub, The Royal Horse, Leamington 
Spa, in May, we challenged our Hungry 
Horse pubs to each raise a minimum of £200 
for Macmillan Cancer Support, through a 
number of fundraising activities.
oUR CoMMUNITIES continued
Macmillan Cancer Support
In May 2012, Greene King launched its first 
national charity partnership, committing 
to raise £1m, over three years, for Macmillan 
Cancer Support. Thanks to the enthusiasm 
and support of our employees and our 
customers across the business, we have 
already raised £300,000 in our first year. 
This great cause has united our customers 
and employees and we have been overwhelmed 
by the enthusiasm for the partnership, the 
goodwill, and the contribution we are 
demonstrating within our local communities 
and we are confident we will attain our 
long-term objective.
By supporting Macmillan’s World’s Biggest 
Coffee Morning on Friday 28 September, 
not only did we raise over £100,000, we 
also saw a growth in sales and footfall over 
that period. This is a clear example of the 
mutual benefit both parties enjoy from 
our partnership... apart from the fun such 
initiatives bring to our communities.
Our colleagues have, unsurprisingly, proven 
themselves to be enthusiastic and creative. 
Examples of ideas from our teams include the 
offer to ale fans of a new and limited edition ale 
Caritas (Latin for charity), with 5p from every 
pint sold donated to Macmillan. We have been 
selling ‘Not alone’ wristbands; six of our gutsy 
employees ran in the London Marathon and 
there has been a plethora of other activities 
across the group as employees and customers 
have embraced the programme.
Lynda Thomas, director of fundraising, 
Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘A huge 
thank you to all Greene King staff and 
customers for the wonderful support they 
have given Macmillan during the first year 
of our partnership. Raising £300,000 is a 
fantastic achievement, and will go a long 
way towards helping Macmillan support 
Macmillan’s World’s Biggest Coffee Morning.
people affected by cancer, ensuring that 
no one has to face cancer alone. As the £1m 
target gets closer, I am looking forward 
to the next exciting and successful year 
working together.’ 
In our first year, we have laid the foundations 
for a truly successful partnership. With the 
money our teams have raised, we are helping 
Macmillan to provide practical, emotional, 
financial and medical support to people 
diagnosed with cancer, and their families.

community outreach initiative to build 
closer links with local communities, 
Loch Fyne in Guildford and in Loughton 
have been hosting class visits from local

Our people are our lifeblood and our 
greatest asset. With over 22,000 employees, 
it is vital that we attract and retain the best 
people and developing and nurturing talent 
is essential to our continued success and the 
future growth of our business. 
Employee engagement
We take very seriously the engagement 
and wellbeing of our employees. Last year 
we set ourselves a challenge to improve on 
our employee engagement, demonstrated by 
our annual attitude survey. We were pleased 
that not only did we see an improvement, 
from 71% to 75%, but we also achieved that 
score with a response rate of 85%, representing 
some 18,000 people and a 20% increase in 
responses on our last full survey.
We will use the data collected to improve 
the business and our working lives. The 
survey results identified specific areas 
for improvement and we will be taking 
these forward.

As part of our programme to support 
and educate our employees, we are working 
on a programme to develop and implement 
alcohol education for our 22,000 employees, 
to ensure a full understanding of how to enjoy 
alcohol responsibly and to offer advice on the 
dangers of over-consumption/binge drinking 
and the impact it has on our health and our 
lives. This education training will be rolled out 
in personal meetings with management and via 
on-line training tools. As part of the training, 
we will also reinforce Greene King’s policy 
towards alcohol and responsible consumption.
Health and safety awards
Once again, we continued our good record 
of receiving awards for our health and safety 
practices in our Brewing & Brands division:
 • Greene King awarded Gold Medal for 
Occupational Health and Safety from RoSPA 
(Royal Society for the Prevention of 
Accidents) – ninth consecutive gold award.
 • Achieved Silver award for MORR 
(Management of Road Risk).
Developing our talent
Greene King recognises the wider benefits 
of developing internal talent and career 
paths that support increased employee 
retention, employee engagement and 
provide long-term career opportunities.
Apprenticeships
As a leader in hospitality, employing over 
22,000 people across the UK, it is important 
to us that we attract, train and retain the 
very best people. 
Greene King signed up to the government’s 
apprenticeship scheme in February 2011, 
leading with Level 2 NVQ qualifications that 
are available to all employees as part of a wider 
employee development framework. The aim is 
to support genuine career opportunities and 
learning from entry-level part-time members 
of staff to area management, and culminating 
in degree level learning with Birmingham 
City University. 
To date, over 3,000 Greene King employees 
from across our business have joined the 
apprenticeship programme, with 1,587 
completing their training. Our apprenticeships 
programme is providing job opportunities 
in local communities, and, where Greene King 
is acquiring, refurbishing or building new 
businesses, new jobs are also being created, 
as we work closely with Job Centre Plus to 
provide opportunities through pre-employment 
training for the long-term unemployed 
and youth unemployment.
Support for our tenants
Greene King has been helping people to run 
their own pubs for over 200 years. The level 
of support we provide for our tenants and 
lessees is central to attracting the best 
licensees for our pubs. 
Our support is tailored to meet the individual 
needs of our licensees from industry-leading 
training for them and their staff, to online 
business support providing easy access from 
a wide range of marketing support, all of 
which is underpinned by our professionally 
qualified BDMs, who work to ensure every 
licensee is making the most of their business.
Licensee profiling
This year Pub Partners introduced a licensee 
profiling tool to assist us with our licensee 
recruitment, helping to ensure we recruit 
the right person for the right pub.
Case study – Apprenticeships
Greene King apprentices Alister Halbert, 17, 
(pictured right) and Kevin Davis, 38, from 
Loch Fyne, Shrewsbury helped the Deputy 
Prime Minister launch a new campaign to 
celebrate the productivity of apprentices 
during National Apprenticeship Week, at 
an evening event in London in March 2013.
Alister and Kevin were undergoing kitchen 
skills training and were chosen as two of four 
Greene King apprentices to make canapés 
for the event at Admiralty House in London, 
as the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg 
officially launched the ‘made by apprentices’ 
campaign to showcase the talents of 
apprentices across the UK.
Talking about his experience, Alister, 
who has since transferred to a professional 
cookery apprenticeship, said: ‘When I 
started my training with Greene King 
I never imagined it would take me so far. 
Bringing the skills I have learnt through 
my apprenticeship to such a high profile 
event has shown me just how far the right 
training really can take you.’
Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said: 
‘Apprentices not only make an invaluable 
contribution to their employer, but to the 
economy as a whole.’
Case study – Developing management talent
As part of our commitment to develop 
from within, 12 of our Business 
Development Managers (BDM), who 
studied for a post-graduate degree in 
Multi-Unit Leadership and Strategy 
at Birmingham City University, have 
graduated. With a focus on multi-site 
leadership and retail management, the 
programme takes a year to complete and 
was developed exclusively for Greene King. 
Twenty-six managers have now completed 
this qualification, with four completing 
a Masters degree.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Corporate social responsibility continued 
We are committed to reducing the 
environmental impact of our business 
wherever we can, and focus, in particular, 
on energy and water consumption and on the 
amount of waste produced by the business.
Overall use of both gas and electricity 
increased during the year, driven primarily 
by the cold winter and especially cold spring, 
which meant that the heating was kept on in 
our pubs, restaurants and hotels for much 
longer than anticipated. Carbon emissions 
from vehicles also increased, although we 
have improved our record keeping in this 
area during the year and have more accurate 
data than we did last year. As a result, the 
ratio of CO
2
 emissions to £100k of revenue 
in our Retail and Brewing & Brands divisions 
increased to 14.9 tonnes. 
Work continued throughout the year to 
improve our energy efficiency. 34 sites had 
voltage optimisers installed, while 16 sites 
were fully fitted with LED lighting. We 
installed new cellar cooling systems in 
30 sites, using outside air to cool ground 
level cellars, in a system designed by our 
own cellar service team. We also installed 
new boilers in 45 sites during the year and 
reduced the emissions from our boilers in 
the Bury St Edmunds brewery by over 10%. 
Although water usage was up during the 
year, we now have water monitors installed 
in 15% of sites, doubling the number we had 
last year and giving data on the daily usage of 
water so we can detect higher than average 
usage and leakages much more quickly. 
We continue to work closely with water 
companies to encourage them to help us in 
this area as more accurate records are vital 
to us. 
We also worked hard to reduce waste across 
the business, and the amount of waste that was 
recycled increased by 25% during the year. 
We now have 220 pubs, restaurants and hotels 
that divert all of their waste away from landfill, 
while 74% of our sites are diverting at least 
80% of their waste away from landfill. An 
additional 42% more cooking oil was recycled 
during the year, and in our brewing business, 
over 2,800 tonnes of spent yeast was sent to 
Marmite. As signatories to the voluntary 
Food Service and Hospitality Agreement, we 
have worked closely with WRAP on a number 
of initiatives to reduce food waste, optimise 
packaging and increase recycling rates.

This year we will continue our focus on healthy eating and will work on developing more 
lower calorie and healthier options for our customers. We will also ensure all of our menus 
indicate lower calorie dishes. We are also planning to trial full calorie labelling on our 
Eating Inn core menus.
Healthy eating
This year we will be looking at reducing salt on gammon, which will impact positively on 
our top ten dishes. With technical solutions currently being a focus point for manufacturers, 
we anticipate that salt levels will continue to improve. 
Salt targets
We will extend our support in local communities for schemes to address issues around 
social and health harms, and will act together to improve joined up working between 
schemes operating in local areas. We are investigating the possibility of participating 
in a Suffolk-wide Best Bar None scheme next year.
Responsible retailing
We will continue to organise activities across the business to raise £1m for Macmillan 
Cancer Support by May 2015. We will also support our businesses in their local charitable 
fundraising activities for causes close to their hearts.
Charitable support
We will continue to help UK pubs to diversify into new services provision for their 
own communities.
Community pubs 
support
When we next conduct our employee engagement survey we aim to achieve an improvement 
in employee engagement to achieve even more engagement across our teams.
Improve employee 
engagement
We will link apprenticeships to the career ladder, drive catering-led apprenticeships, 
introduce pre-employment training (particularly in our new-build sites), further develop 
apprenticeships across the rest of our business, introduce innovative learning methods, 
and maintain a base of 10% of employees completing apprenticeships.
Apprenticeships
We will continue to strive to identify and reduce health and safety risks and to improve 
the safety of our premises.
Health and safety
A natural progression of our partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support is to embed 
their cancer awareness services among our employees and roll out a programme 
of cancer awareness throughout Greene King.
Macmillan – a two-way 
partnership
In July 2013, we will appoint a technical and quality manager within our food buying 
team, to review our current reporting and measurement of quality and to make 
recommendations on areas for improvement and to monitor implementation. 
Food assurance
Our priorities for 2013/14
While we have had an alcohol policy for some time, and we support treatment 
for employees who have dependency issues, in the coming year we will focus on 
implementing alcohol education and awareness, to help prevent issues occurring 
and to highlight the impact of over-indulgence in alcohol.
Alcohol education 
We will aim to reduce CO
2
 emissions in our existing estate and specifically aim to improve the 
ratio of CO
2
 emissions to revenue in our Retail and Brewing & Brands divisions to around 
14.4 tonnes. We will continue to install energy saving systems in our Retail estate and propose 
to move the main boilers in the Bury St Edmunds brewery from light fuel oil to gas.
Reduce CO
2
We will continue to aim for improvements in our waste recycling programme during the 
year, with a view to increasing the amount of waste not being sent to landfill, and for even 
more of our pubs, restaurants and hotels to divert all of their waste away from landfill.
Reduce waste
Our focus this year will be on continuing to introduce more water monitors across the estate, 
with a view to having around 30% of the estate fitted with them by the end of this financial year.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance statement
Statement of compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code
The company is subject to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code which is 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
and which is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
The code sets out guidance in the form 
of principles and provisions on how 
companies should be directed and 
controlled to follow good governance 
practice. Companies listed in the UK 
are required to disclose how they have 
applied the main principles and whether 
they have complied with its provisions 
throughout the financial year. Where the 
provisions have not been complied with 
companies must provide an explanation. 
The board considers that the company 
has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code dated June 2010 
throughout the year, except in the 
following area.
B.7.1
B.7.1 requires that all directors of 
FTSE 350 companies should be subject 
to annual election by shareholders. 
At the last AGM three directors submitted 
themselves for re‑ election as the other 
directors had submitted themselves 
for re‑ election the previous year. 
This year the company will ask all 
of its directors to submit themselves 
for re‑ election. 
The board
Board composition
As at the year end the board comprised the 
chairman, two executive directors and four 
non‑ executive directors. The non‑ executive 
chairman is Tim Bridge, the chief executive 
Rooney Anand, and the senior independent 
director Ian Durant.
The directors’ biographies are on page 38. 
The board believes that the structure and 
size of the board is appropriate and that no 
single individual or group dominates the 
decision making process. 
Independence of 
non‑executive directors
In compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, more than half of the board, 
excluding the chairman, are non‑ executive 
directors and the board is satisfied that all 
of these were independent throughout the 
year, in that they satisfied the independence 
criteria of the code on their appointment 
and continue to satisfy those criteria. 
Tim Bridge, the chairman, was not independent 
on appointment, having previously served 
as chief executive. However, the board is 
satisfied that he shows independent judgment, 
that his performance as chairman is effective 
and that he demonstrates continued 
commitment to the role. 
Prior to his retirement at the end of 
December 2012 Norman Murray was the 
senior independent non‑ executive director 
and thereafter Ian Durant took over that role. 
Ian Durant has never been employed by the 
company and has diverse business interests. 
The board considers that he remained 
independent in both character and judgment, 
that his performance has been effective and 
that he has demonstrated commitment to 
the role. The same was also applicable to 
Norman Murray whilst he was the senior 
independent director. As well as supporting 
the chairman, a key responsibility for the 
senior independent director is to be available 
for direct contact from shareholders should 
they require. 
Diversity
The board approves of the principle of 
trying to recruit more women into senior 
management and director roles. When making 
new appointments, the policy of the company 
is to recruit on merit for each role on offer, 
whether executive or non‑ executive. We set 
out a job specification and a profile of the likely 
characteristics, qualifications, experience 
and merits required before starting a search, 
and aim to find the individual who is best 
suited to the role, without prejudice between 
male and female candidates. 
During the year Lynne Weedall was appointed 
to the board as a new non‑ executive director 
and became chairman of the remuneration 
committee at the beginning of January 2013. 
We thus currently have one female director 
on the board. Notwithstanding Lord Davies’ 
desire for targets to be set, and looking 
forward to where we may be by 2015, we do 
not think a percentage target is the right 
way to address the issue of female directors 
for a board of seven people, where the key 
will be to ensure a suitable range of skills, 
experience and knowledge across the board 
members and where the issue of gender and 
diversity will be just one consideration taken 
into account when filling board vacancies. 
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
“ As chairman, with responsibility for ensuring that high standards 
of corporate governance are maintained, I am pleased to introduce 
the corporate governance report for 2012/13.
  We recognise that good governance is important in helping the business to 
deliver its strategy, generate shareholder value and safeguard our shareholders’ 
long‑ term interests. We also note the emphasis within the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the code) on well balanced, effective boards, strong 
oversight of risk management, alignment of remuneration policies with 
shareholder interests and sound shareholder relations.
  This year’s corporate governance report, and the sections therein from each 
of the board committees, describes the operation of the board and explains 
how we applied the principles of good governance set out in the code during 
the year. This was a year when we saw the retirement of Norman Murray as 
senior independent director and chairman of the remuneration committee. 
Ian Durant, who has been on the board since 2007, has taken over as senior 
independent director, whilst Lynne Weedall was appointed to the board 
in October 2012 and took over as chairman of the remuneration 
committee at the beginning of this calendar year.
  The directors’ remuneration report sets out details of the 
remuneration review we have been conducting during 
the course of the last year, which incorporates a number 
of additional disclosures consistent with the government’s 
proposed new regulations on remuneration reporting 
which will apply to the company next year.”

Leadership
Role of the board
The board is collectively responsible for 
the long‑ term success of the company. The 
chairman is responsible for the leadership 
and effectiveness of the board and for ensuring 
that each non‑ executive director is able to 
make an effective contribution to the board 
through debate and discussion with the 
executive directors. He is also responsible for 
setting the style and tone of board discussions.
The chief executive’s role is to develop the 
company’s strategic direction and to lead 
senior management in executing the 
company’s strategy and dealing with the 
operational requirements of the business. 
The non‑ executive directors have a particular 
responsibility to ensure that the strategies 
proposed by the executive directors are 
carefully examined and fully discussed, that 
the performance of the company is monitored 
and challenged and that the financial 
information provided is comprehensive 
and accurate. They are also responsible for 
ensuring, through the relevant committees, 
that appropriate remuneration arrangements 
are in place for the executive directors.
The offices of chairman and chief executive 
are separate and distinct. The division of 
responsibilities between them has been 
clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the board. The job descriptions 
are available on request.
Operation of the board
The board has a formal schedule of matters 
which is reserved for its decision, including 
approval of the long‑ term objectives and 
strategy, approval of budgets and financial 
statements including the report and accounts, 
acquisitions and disposals, changes to the 
structure of the group and overall corporate 
governance issues. It reviews trading 
performance and considers major capital 
expenditure and acquisition opportunities. 
The board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to standing committees, details 
of which are set out below. By delegating key 
responsibilities to these committees, the 
board is able to ensure that adequate time is 
devoted by board members to the oversight 
of key areas within their responsibility.
Day‑ to‑ day management and control of the 
business is delegated to the executive directors 
and the business unit managing directors, 
who meet formally on a monthly basis together 
with other senior managers as appropriate. 
Board meetings are scheduled to be held eight 
times a year, with main meetings linked to key 
events in the company’s financial calendar, 
with the annual results and dividend being 
approved in June or July and the interim 
results and dividend in November or December. 
Regular agenda items include an overview 
of the market and current trading as well as 
a detailed review of financial performance 
against agreed targets. 
There is a two‑ day off‑ site meeting for the 
board in February each year focusing on 
strategy, with the business unit managing 
directors attending for part thereof. The 
strategy sessions include an in‑ depth review 
of relevant economic factors, management’s 
projections for the medium term and provide 
the board with an opportunity to agree the 
strategic plans for the short and medium 
term. Following approval of the company’s 
strategy, budgets are prepared for the next 
financial year to be approved by the board 
in April. The board reviews each business 
unit and main functional area (including 
property and commercial) in detail at least 
once each year, with particular focus on the 
achievement of strategic objectives, with the 
relevant managing director and functional 
head attending to present and answer questions.
Between meetings, as required, the board 
can be in frequent contact to progress the 
company’s business and if necessary, board 
meetings can be held at short notice. Where 
possible, however, ad hoc committees of the 
board are appointed to deal with matters 
which it is known will need to be dealt with 
between scheduled board meetings. It is 
expected that all directors attend board and 
relevant committee meetings, unless they are 
prevented from doing so by prior commitments. 
If directors are unable to attend meetings in 
person or by telephone they are given the 
opportunity to be consulted and comment 
in advance of the meeting.

***  Membership of the nomination committee was extended to all non‑ executive directors with effect from 1 January 2013.
Board papers are circulated seven days prior 
to each board or committee meeting to ensure 
that directors have sufficient time to review 
them before the meeting. Documentation 
includes detailed management accounts, 
reports on current trading, reports from 
each business unit and main functional area 
and full papers on matters where the board 
is required to give its approval. 
The chairman holds regular, informal 
meetings with the non‑ executive directors 
without the executive directors being present 
and the non‑ executives also meet with the 
chairman and the chief executive on an 
informal basis twice each year.
Board effectiveness
Board performance and evaluation
There is an on‑ going dialogue within the 
board to ensure that it operates effectively. 
As a result of points raised during the year 
an additional session on strategy planning 
was held prior to the two‑ day off‑ site strategy 
meeting. Non‑ executive directors also 
requested and have been given more access 
to senior management other than the business 
unit managing directors.
Given that an external evaluation exercise 
was undertaken during the 2011/12 financial 
year, it was agreed that the evaluation this 
year would be undertaken internally. It took 
the form of a detailed questionnaire that all 
directors were asked to complete and return 
to the chairman. The questionnaires covered 
a range of areas including questions on board 
structure and composition, strategy and 
financials, board processes, risks, the board’s 
committees and on corporate governance 
generally. The responses by the directors 
were discussed at the nomination committee 
and the board.
An externally facilitated evaluation will 
need to be performed again in two years’ 
time, in accordance with the requirements 
of the code.
An appraisal of the chairman’s performance 
was initiated prior to the year end and 
completed recently. The performance of the 
executive directors is reviewed annually by 
the remuneration committee in conjunction 
with their annual pay review and the payment 
of bonuses. 
Training and support
Each director is responsible for ensuring that 
they remain up to date in their skills and 
knowledge of the company and the training 
needs of the board and its committees are 
regularly reviewed. Particular emphasis is 
placed on ensuring that directors are aware 
of proposed legislative changes in areas 
such as remuneration, corporate governance 
and financial reporting and sector specific 
issues. All directors are also encouraged to 
visit the company’s pubs and restaurants 
and do so throughout the year. 
Newly‑ appointed directors receive a tailored 
induction on joining the board to acquaint 
them with the company. This generally 
takes the form of meetings with other board 
members and senior management and the 
provision of an induction pack containing 
general information on the company, its 
policies and procedures, financial and 
operational information and a briefing on 
directors’ responsibilities. Lynne Weedall 
was provided with specific training on the 
obligations of directors of listed companies 
shortly after her appointment and also 
met with remuneration advisers prior 
to taking over as chairman of the 
remuneration committee.
There is an agreed procedure, set out in writing, 
for directors, in furtherance of their duties, 
to take independent professional advice 
at the company’s expense. Directors also 
have access to the services of the company 
secretary. The company has in place directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance.
Conflicts of interest
The board has the right, under the articles of 
association, to approve potential situational 
conflicts of interest. A small number of such 
potential conflicts has been approved by the 
board following disclosure by certain directors, 
in each case with the relevant director not 
taking part in any decision relating to their 
own position. Directors are also aware that the 
disclosure and authorisation of any potential 
conflict situation does not detract from their 
requirement to notify the board separately 
of an actual or potential conflict in relation 
to a proposed transaction by the company. 
Communication with shareholders 
The board is keen to ensure that our 
shareholders have a good understanding 
of the business and its performance, and 
that the directors are aware of any issues 
or concerns which shareholders may have. 
Communication with shareholders takes 
a variety of forms.
Institutional shareholders and analysts
There is a regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders, including meetings after the 
announcement of the year‑ end and interim 
results. Analysts are also invited to  Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

Communication with shareholders 
continued
Institutional shareholders and analysts 
continued
presentations at those times and separately 
to analyst trips to visit our premises and 
hear presentations on specific divisions of 
the business. The board receives regular 
reports from the chief executive on the 
meetings he and the finance director have 
with principal shareholders, and copies 
of analyst’s reports on the company. 
Recently a consultation exercise has been 
held with a number of the company’s major 
shareholders in relation to the company’s 
executive remuneration and the proposed 
introduction of a new LTIP. The senior 
independent non‑ executive director, 
Ian Durant, is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns about governance issues 
which the normal channels of contact fail 
to resolve. 
Annual general meeting
The AGM is fully utilised as a means of 
communicating directly with private 
shareholders, who receive a brief presentation 
on the business before the substantive part 
of the meeting begins. They also have the 
full opportunity to ask questions during the 
meeting and to meet directors and senior 
management informally after the meeting. 
The board aims to ensure that all members 
of the board, including in particular the 
chairmen of the board committees, are 
available to answer questions at the AGM. 
All substantive items of business at 
shareholders’ meetings are dealt with under 
separate resolutions, including a resolution 
to adopt the report and accounts. The chairman 
announces the results of the proxy voting 
on each resolution after it has been dealt 
with on a show of hands. 
Website
The company maintains a website  
(www.greeneking.co.uk) to provide up‑ to‑ date, 
detailed information on the company’s 
operations and brands, which includes 
a dedicated investor relations section. 
All company announcements are available 
on this site, as are copies of slides used for 
presentations to investment analysts. We 
are happy to answer questions by telephone 
or email (investorrelations@greeneking.co.uk 
or companysecretary@greeneking.co.uk).
Board committees
The board has established a nomination 
committee, a remuneration committee 
and an audit committee, each of which has 
formal terms of reference governing its method 
of operation. Each of the terms of reference, 
which have been approved by the board, are 
available on request or to download from 
the company’s website and will be available 
for inspection at the AGM.
Set out below are reports from each of the 
nomination committee, remuneration 
committee and audit committee.
Nomination committee report
During the year the nomination committee 
was chaired by Tim Bridge. The other members 
of the committee were Norman Murray 
and John Brady until 31 December 2012. 
With effect from 1 January 2013 and after 
discussion with the non‑ executive directors, 
it was determined that all the non‑ executive 
directors should be appointed as members 
of the committee. Apart from the chairman, 
all members were considered by the board 
to be independent.
The role of the 
nomination committee
The role of the nomination committee 
is to identify, evaluate and nominate 
candidates for appointment to the board, 
to review regularly the structure, size 
and composition (including skills, 
knowledge and experience) of the 
board and make recommendations to 
the board with regard to any adjustments 
that are deemed necessary. 
The committee is also responsible for 
considering the company’s succession 
plans for board members and senior 
management, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the 
company, and what skills and expertise 
are therefore needed on the board in 
the future, and for reviewing membership 
of the board’s committees to ensure 
that undue reliance is not placed upon 
any individuals.
The committee met twice during the year. 
Attendance at these meetings by the 
committee members is shown in the table 
on page 42.
Matters considered by the committee during 
the year included the proposed appointment 
of Lynne Weedall, board succession planning, 
committee composition, the board evaluation 
exercise and the re‑ election of directors. 
With regard to the appointment of Lynne 
Weedall, the focus was on finding someone 
who could take over the role of chairman 
of the remuneration committee. The Zygos 
Partnership, which provides no other services 
to the group, was appointed to assist and was 
asked to produce a short list of about six 
candidates, which included both men and 
women. At the end of the process Lynne 
Weedall was selected as the best candidate. 
Arrangements were made for her to meet 
all of the other non‑ executive directors 
prior to her appointment being 
recommended to the board.
That appointment was also part of the 
succession planning activities of the 
committee. It was made in a timely manner 
prior to Norman Murray’s retirement, to 
enable a few months’ smooth handover 
between them. Succession planning will 
continue to be a focus for the committee’s 
activities during next year.
Having considered what has now become 
standard market practice in this area, and 
on the recommendation of the nomination 
committee, the board has decided this year 
to ask all directors to stand for re‑ election 
at the forthcoming AGM. 
Remuneration committee report
The remuneration committee was chaired 
during the year by Norman Murray until his 
retirement from the board on 31 December 2012. 
Lynne Weedall joined the committee on her 
appointment to the board in October 2012, and 
then took over as chairman from 1 January 2013. 
The other members of the committee were 
Ian Durant and John Brady. All the members 
are considered by the board to be independent. 
The role of the 
remuneration committee
The role of the committee includes 
determining the remuneration policy for 
the executive directors, the chairman 
and those members of senior management 
whose details appear on page 38 and 39. 
It agrees the total individual remuneration 
package of each of the executive directors 
and those senior managers, considers the 
granting of awards under the long‑ term 
incentive plan and determines bonuses 
payable to the executive directors and 
senior managers.
The remuneration committee held four 
scheduled meetings during the year. 
The chairman and the chief executive, 
at the request of the committee, attend its 
meetings. The chairman does not participate 
in any discussions relating to his own 
remuneration. The chief executive is 
consulted by the committee on its proposals, 
but does not participate in any discussions 
relating to his own remuneration.  GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

Remuneration committee report 
continued
The committee’s external adviser, 
NewBridgeStreet Consultants, attended 
three of the meetings in connection with 
the review of the company’s remuneration 
structure.
Details of the company’s policies on 
remuneration, service contracts and 
compensation payments are set out in 
the remuneration report on pages 46 to 50.
Audit committee report
The audit committee was chaired during 
the year by Ian Durant. The other members 
of the committee were John Brady and 
Mike Coupe. All members are considered by 
the board to be independent. The board is 
satisfied that Ian Durant has recent and 
relevant financial experience, as the former 
finance director of Liberty International plc, 
since renamed as Intu Properties PLC. 
The role of the audit committee
The role of the audit committee is to 
review the financial reporting process, and 
the related external audit conclusions, 
of the full year and interim results, in 
each case prior to their submission to 
the board. It is also responsible for 
reviewing the company’s internal 
financial control systems, advising the 
board on the appointment of the external 
auditor, overseeing the relationship 
with the external auditor, reviewing the 
company’s whistle blowing procedures 
and considering the need for a full 
internal audit function. It also reviews 
the group’s risk management policies 
and procedures prior to submission to 
the board and receives detailed reports 
on the risk management processes within 
the business units. Regular updates are 
provided to the committee on regulatory, 
accounting and reporting developments 
under relevant financial standards 
and codes.
There is a planned programme of meetings 
during the year to deal with all matters within 
the committee’s sphere of responsibility. 
The committee had three meetings and on 
each occasion the finance director and senior 
members of the finance function attended. 
The external auditor attended all of the 
meetings. There is an opportunity at each 
meeting for the committee to discuss 
matters privately with the auditor without 
management present. In addition, the 
chairman of the committee is in regular 
contact with the external audit partner to 
discuss matters relevant to the company.
Financial statements and audit
Before the start of the audit cycle, the 
committee reviewed the audit plan presented 
by the auditor and agreed the scope of the 
audit work. The committee then discussed 
a range of issues arising from the audit and 
reviewed the consistency of accounting 
policies on a year to year basis and across 
the group, and the methods used to account 
for significant or unusual transactions, 
including in particular the assessment of 
impairment losses and tax. During the year 
particular attention was paid to the accounting 
changes necessitated by the closure of the 
group’s final salary pension schemes to future 
accrual. The committee reviewed management’s 
attestation paper setting out the information 
that had been provided to the auditor to enable 
them to form their opinion on the group’s 
financial statements and demonstrating that 
it was appropriate for the directors to make 
the representations set out in the letter of 
representation. The financial statements 
and interim results themselves were also 
reviewed in detail prior to their submission 
to the board. 
After the audit was completed a review 
of the effectiveness of the auditor and of 
the audit service was undertaken by means 
of a questionnaire completed by the audit 
committee chairman, the group finance 
director, and a number of key members of 
the finance team involved in the preparation 
of the statutory accounts. The review covered 
the overall quality of the service, the audit 
partner and the audit team, and considered 
matters such as the management of the 
audit team, the quality of their insight and 
communications and the cost‑ effectiveness 
of the audit. The committee reviewed the 
feedback provided and satisfied itself as to 
the quality of the audit service. The feedback 
was also provided to Ernst & Young.
External auditor
Ernst & Young have been the company’s 
auditor since 1997. They are required to 
rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
group and subsidiary audits every five years 
and the current audit partner was appointed 
in the autumn of 2011. The board is aware of 
the new requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code with regard to audit 
tendering and is currently proposing to put 
the audit of the group and subsidiary accounts 
out to tender no later than 2016, with a view 
to any change, if agreed, taking effect for 
the 2016/17 statutory accounts, at the end of 
the current audit partner’s term. In addition 
to the assessment of the effectiveness of the 
audit outlined above, the committee also 
assessed and found itself satisfied with the 
objectivity and independence of Ernst & Young, 
on the basis set out below, and, accordingly, 
agreed to recommend Ernst & Young’s 
re‑ appointment as auditor to the board. 
This resolution will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM.
The audit committee has established a policy 
in relation to the use of Ernst & Young LLP 
for non‑ audit work. The company will award 
non‑ audit work to the firm which provides 
the best commercial solution for the work in 
question, taking into account the skills and 
experience of the firm, the nature of the 
services involved, the level of fees relative to 
the audit fee and whether there are safeguards 
in place to mitigate to an acceptable level 
any threat to objectivity and independence 
in the conduct of the audit resulting from 
such services. 
Work estimated to cost in excess of £25,000 
is put out to tender unless agreed otherwise 
by the chairman of the audit committee. 
The finance director may approve specific 
engagements up to £50,000 (in aggregate up 
to £100,000 pa), and the chairman of the audit 
committee may approve engagements up to 
£100,000 (in aggregate up to £200,000 pa), 
with fees in excess of those limits being subject 
to approval of the full committee. During 
the year the company made limited use of 
specialist teams within Ernst & Young LLP 
for non‑ audit work such as taxation advice, 
primarily in relation to certain tax matters 
on which Ernst & Young LLP specialists 
had originally advised. The committee was 
satisfied that the use of separate teams, and 
in particular the use of a separate team to 
audit the tax disclosures in the report and 
accounts, ensured that auditor independence 
and objectivity was safeguarded. The total 
fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP amounted 
to £382,000, of which £56,000 related to 
non‑audit work.
The committee also reviewed and debated a 
report from Ernst & Young LLP in which it 
confirmed compliance with its own policies, 
procedures and ethical standards, including 
those of the Auditing Practices Board, in 
relation to auditor objectivity and independence, 
and, after due consideration, satisfied itself 
that the safeguards put in place to protect 
the independence and objectivity of the 
service provided by the external auditor 
were appropriate. 
The committee also approved a policy 
in relation to the appointment of former 
employees of the auditor by the group. The 
policy provides that audit partners will not 
be offered employment by Greene King or 
any of its subsidiary undertakings within 
two years of undertaking any role on the 
audit. Other key team members will not be 
offered employment by Greene King within 
six months of undertaking any role on the 
audit. Other audit team members who accept 
employment by Greene King must cease 
activity on the audit immediately when they 
tender their resignation to the audit firm. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

Audit committee report continued
Internal audit
The committee reviewed the company’s 
internal audit function, which currently 
focuses primarily on the group’s Retail 
division, although its remit is being expanded. 
Elsewhere within the group a combination 
of the external audit procedures and the 
types of financial risks involved are felt to 
be such that a wider internal audit function 
is not required. This will be reviewed on an 
annual basis.
Other matters
The committee reviewed, as it does on an 
annual basis, the group’s whistle blowing 
policy and its application across the business. 
A review of the group’s tax risk policy was 
undertaken during the year to ensure that 
clear guidance was available to management 
in relation to future tax arrangements.
The terms of reference of the committee 
were also reviewed and updated during the 
year and an exercise was undertaken to assess 
the effectiveness of the audit committee itself. 
Internal control and risk management
The board has overall responsibility for the 
group’s risk management framework and 
systems of internal control and for reviewing 
their effectiveness, whilst the audit committee 
monitors and reviews those internal controls 
and risks on a regular basis, and reports to 
the board on its findings. During the course 
of the year the committee reviewed in detail 
reports from each business unit and functional 
area on their respective risk management 
processes and key risks, so that each area was 
reviewed at least once. Representatives of 
the relevant business unit or functional area 
attended those meetings to present the reports 
and answer questions from the committee. 
A summary of the risk management 
framework is set out on page 28. The risk 
management framework and internal control 
systems are designed to manage, and not 
to eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. They can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that 
the group’s assets are safeguarded and that 
the financial information used within the 
business and for external reporting is reliable. 
The company has in place procedures to assess 
the key risks to which it is exposed and has 
formalised the control environment needed 
to address these and other issues. There are 
processes in place which accord with the 
guidance of the Turnbull Committee on 
internal control, and these remained in place 
up to the date of this report. The board 
is satisfied that there are no significant 
weaknesses in these systems.
The key elements of the internal 
control framework are:
 • the schedule of matters reserved 
for the board;
 • the group’s defined management 
structure with suitable authority 
limits and responsibilities, staffed 
by appropriate personnel;
 • regular updates for the board 
on strategy;
 • a comprehensive planning and 
financial reporting procedure including 
annual budgets and a three‑ year strategic 
plan, both of which are reviewed and 
approved by the board; 
 • on‑ going monitoring by both the 
board and senior management of 
performance against budgets, 
through the periodic reporting of 
detailed management accounts and 
key performance indicators;
 • on‑ going monitoring by the board of 
compliance with financial covenants;
 • a centralised financial reporting 
system and close process, with controls 
and reconciliation procedures designed 
to facilitate the production of the 
consolidated accounts; 
 • clearly defined evaluation and 
approval processes for acquisitions 
and disposals, capital expenditure 
and project control, with escalating 
levels of authority (including board 
approval for major acquisitions and 
disposals), detailed appraisal and 
review procedures and post‑ completion reviews;
 • review of retail operational 
compliance by the retail internal audit 
team responsible and other analytical 
and control procedures facilitated 
by the EPOS till system; and
 • documented policies to cover bribery 
and whistle blowing and regular 
updates on any incidents.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
LETTER f ROM THE CHAIRMAN 
Of THE COMMITTEE
“ As the new chairman of the committee, I am pleased to introduce our 
directors’ remuneration report for the 2012/13 financial year. I would like 
first to express my thanks to Norman Murray for his work as chairman 
in the first half of the year.”
Lynne Weedall
Chairman
As you may be aware, the government has 
reformed the way directors’ remuneration is 
reported and voted upon. The new legislation 
will apply for our next annual report but the 
committee has decided to adopt some of the 
changes early, including separate sections 
on our remuneration policy going forwards 
and on implementation of our policy during 
the last year.
During the past year we have made good 
progress on our strategic priorities, increasing 
the size of our retail estate and reducing that 
of our tenanted and leased estate. At the same 
time, profit before tax and exceptional items 
has increased by 6.6%, the dividend has 
increased by 7.3% and our share price by 39% 
year‑ on‑ year. Our strong performance has 
helped ensure that the awards made under 
the long‑ term incentive plan (LTIP) three years 
ago will vest in full on the third anniversary 
of their grant. The bonus outturn this year 
is 83% of salary for the CEO and 72% of salary 
for the group FD, which is lower than last 
year’s, reflecting the very stretching targets 
set at the beginning of the year. We continue 
to exercise restraint in executive pay levels 
and salary increases for executives will be 
a maximum of 2% for the forthcoming year, 
which is lower than the average of the 
workforce generally.
The company’s LTIP is due for renewal this 
year and we have taken the opportunity to 
undertake a full review of the company’s 
incentive arrangements. Following this 
review, the committee has made some 
amendments to the remuneration policy to 
ensure it both supports and motivates our 
senior team whilst at the same time continues 
to align them to the company’s strategic 
objectives and to achieving long‑ term growth 
for shareholders. We have consulted with a 
number of our major shareholders in relation 
to these proposals and have been pleased 
with the generally positive responses received.
The key changes are as follows:
 • it was determined that the balance between 
short term (annual bonus) and longer term 
(LTIP) should be re‑ weighted in favour 
of long‑ term performance and that the 
performance conditions in the annual 
bonus and new LTIP should have a 
slightly different emphasis;
 • the annual bonus potential for executive 
directors will be reduced from 150% of 
salary to 100% of salary through the removal 
of the deferred share bonus scheme;
 • the LTIP grant level will be increased 
from 133% to 200% of base salary; 
 • LTIP awards will be subject to stretching 
EPS and ROCE targets, measured over 
three financial years; and
 • executive share ownership guidelines and 
clawback provisions – applicable to both 
the annual bonus and LTIP – are being 
introduced, in line with best practice.
The committee is conscious of the current 
climate on executive pay and is comfortable 
that this modest increase in the executive 
directors’ incentive opportunity does not 
raise total remuneration above mid‑ market 
levels, particularly given the longer‑ term focus 
of the package and the challenging targets 
that will apply to the enhanced LTIP awards. 
For this year, shareholders will be asked to vote 
on this remuneration report, as an ordinary 
resolution, at the company’s AGM, where 
we hope once again to receive your support. 
In addition, the new LTIP will also be subject 
to the approval of shareholders at the AGM, 
in the form of an ordinary resolution, 
and we very much hope you will vote 
in favour thereof.

INTRODUCTION AND 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
POLICY – UNAUDITED 
INFORMATION
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is appointed by 
the board. During the year the members were 
Norman Murray (chairman of the committee 
until his retirement from the board on 
31 December 2012), John Brady, Ian Durant 
and Lynne Weedall (from October 2012, and 
chairman from 1 January 2013). All of the 
committee members were regarded by the 
board as independent non‑ executive directors. 
The role of the committee, as set out in its 
terms of reference (which are available on 
the company’s website), includes determining 
the remuneration policy for the executive 
directors, the chairman and those members 
of senior management whose details appear 
on pages 38 and 39. It agrees total individual 
remuneration packages, considers the granting 
of awards under the long‑ term incentive plan 
and determines bonuses payable to the 
executive directors and senior managers.
It approves the service contracts of the 
executive directors and those senior managers 
and any compensation arrangements arising 
from their termination. The committee is 
made aware of, and takes into account, the 
salary levels of the wider senior management 
team and of the incentive arrangements 
operating throughout the company.
During the year there were four scheduled 
meetings of the committee. A further 
telephone conference call was also held 
specifically to consider the results of the 
shareholder consultation. All members 
of the committee attended each meeting.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee seeks advice on general 
remuneration matters and comparator 
information from New Bridge Street, a 
subsidiary of Aon plc. Aon plc provides 
insurance broking and consultancy services 
to the group. The committee is satisfied 
that the provision of these services does 
not in any way prejudice the position of 
New Bridge Street as independent advisers 
to the committee. 
The committee has also sought legal advice 
from Eversheds on the terms of the new 
long‑ term incentive plan and related matters.
Rooney Anand, chief executive, attends 
meetings of the committee and provides 
advice to help the committee determine 
appropriate remuneration and incentive 
packages for the finance director and the 
other senior executives, but he leaves the 
meeting when his own remuneration 
is being discussed. 
Consultation
The company engages regularly with 
shareholders on matters relating to its 
strategy and business operations. Where 
necessary, we also engage with shareholders 
and their representative bodies on matters 
relating to executive remuneration. 
During the year we consulted with our 
major shareholders, the Association of 
British Insurers (ABI) and Institutional 
Shareholder Services (ISS), in relation to our 
proposals following our remuneration 
review. The committee received support 
from the majority of shareholders consulted 
and the full range of views were carefully 
considered before finalising the arrangements, 
with changes to the policy being made 
as a result thereof.
The committee does not consult with 
employees when deciding remuneration 
policy, although it does receive information 
on salary increases for and other benefits, 
including bonuses, available to employees 
across the group. These matters were taken 
into account when conducting the review 
of executive remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
Introduction 
As explained above, the committee conducted 
a review of the company’s policy and practices 
during the year to ensure that they continue 
to be appropriately aligned with company 
strategy and shareholder interests. The 
committee concluded that the remuneration 
policy, which is designed to ensure that the 
group offers a competitive, and not excessive, 
remuneration package so that it can attract, 
motivate and retain high quality directors 
able to deliver continued growth of the 
business and achieve the group’s strategic 
aims, remains broadly appropriate. 
General considerations
In designing this policy the committee has 
considered whether there are any aspects 
thereof which could inadvertently encourage 
executives to take inappropriate risk and is 
satisfied that this is not the case. The committee 
has also ensured that the incentive structure 
for executive directors and senior management 
does not raise environmental, social or 
governance risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

Base salary
Reviewed annually or when a 
change in responsibility occurs, 
to reflect the executive’s 
responsibilities, market value 
and sustained performance level. 
In setting pay levels, the 
committee considers current 
market practice and makes 
comparisons against a selection 
of other companies determined 
by reference to turnover, market 
capitalisation and operational 
details. Account is also taken of 
the level of pay awards across 
the rest of the business.
When reviewing base salaries, 
the committee is mindful of 
the gearing effect that increases 
in base salary will have on the 
potential total remuneration 
of the executive directors.

Group FD – £341,000
— Increases of 2% and 1.8% 
for the CEO and group FD 
respectively. These increases 
compare with average pay rises 
across the group of 2.5%. 
Bonuses are paid entirely in cash,

the strategy to maintain a 
sustainable but stretching 
level of earnings growth 
whilst maintaining 
dividend growth and 
reducing net debt.
The ROCE targets 
focus on generating 
the necessary returns 
as capital needs to be 
re‑ deployed in order 
to focus on Retail, 
growth of which forms 
a significant part of the 
company’s strategy.

Notes:
1.  Minimum relates to the value of the package 
assuming that salary, benefits and pension 
alone are paid. 
2.  The on‑ target annual bonus opportunity, based 
on stretching performance targets, is 75% of salary 
for the chief executive and 75% for the group 
finance director.
3.  The on‑ target vesting level under the core LTIP 
and the growth LTIP is assumed to be 50% 
and 50% respectively.
4.  The maximum scenario assumes full bonus payout 
and full vesting of LTIP awards. 
5.  No assumption as to share price growth is made 
in either the on‑ target or the maximum scenarios.
Service agreements
Newly appointed executive directors are 
offered a service agreement with a notice 
period of one year. In the event of the 
employment of an executive director being 
terminated, the committee would pay due 
regard to best practice and take account of 
the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss.
The payment of any annual bonus in respect 
of the year of termination is subject to the 
discretion of the committee. The vesting of 
any LTIP awards will be governed by the rules 
of the LTIP. Awards will normally lapse unless 
the individual is considered a ‘good leaver’. 
An individual would generally be considered 
a ‘good leaver’ if they left the group’s 
employment by reason of injury, ill‑ health, 
disability approved by the committee, 
redundancy or retirement, although the 
committee has the absolute discretion to 
treat any individual as a ‘good leaver’ for 
any other reason. In the case of a ‘good 
leaver’, payments would normally be scaled 
back to recognise the shorter period of 
service than the award was intended to 
cover and remain subject to outstanding 
performance conditions. 
Rooney Anand, whose employment with the 
company commenced on 6 August 2001, is 
subject to a one‑ year notice period from the 
company. His contract does not contain any 
additional terms relating to compensation 
for termination of employment. The terms 
of his appointment as chief executive were 
agreed and set out in a letter dated 
24 December 2004.
Matthew Fearn’s contract may be terminated 
by the company on giving one year’s notice, 
without any additional terms relating to 
compensation for termination of employment.
Non‑ executive directors are appointed 
pursuant to letters of appointment for 
three‑ year periods. The table below sets 
out the start and expiry date of their 
respective appointments:

Annual bonus payment
The tables below outline the key annual financial and individual performance measures that applied to the main part of the 2012/13 
annual bonus payment, where directors were entitled to receive a bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary: 
Below Threshold Target Stretch
Chief executive – Rooney Anand
Corporate financial targets (90%)

In addition, a further 10% of salary was awarded for the achievement of two personal targets, at the discretion of the committee. 
Finance director – Matthew Fearn

The resulting bonus payments were therefore £442k for Rooney Anand, equivalent to 83% of salary, and £240k for Matthew Fearn, 
equivalent to 72% of salary.
Deferred share bonus scheme
In addition to the annual bonus figures above, £130k (2012: £110k) of bonus will be payable to Rooney Anand and £82k (2012: £46k) to 
Matthew Fearn under the terms of the economic profit deferred share bonus scheme introduced in 2010. Additional economic profit of £3.7m 
in excess of the strategic plan was achieved against a maximum target of £7.5m. This resulted in a payout of 49% of the economic profit element 
of the bonus scheme, equating to 24.5% of each of Rooney Anand’s and Matthew Fearn’s salaries, compared with a maximum payout of 50% 
of salary. The bonus will be deferred in the form of restricted shares, which will be acquired shortly after the preliminary announcement 
of the results. They will be entitled to any dividends paid on those shares, which will be released to them if they remain in employment 
for a period of one year from the date that the shares are acquired.
The table below sets out the directors’ interests in the deferred share bonus scheme.

The deferred share bonus scheme will not be operated in future years, as explained in the chairman’s letter.
Directors’ pensions

are shown in the table below: 
2013 2012
£’000 £’000
Rooney Anand — 20
Matthew Fearn 31 33
During the course of 2012 Rooney Anand reached the lifetime allowance for contributions to his pension fund and accordingly no further 
contributions will be made to his pension. Contributions to Matthew Fearn’s pension are limited by the yearly allowance. Cash payments 
in lieu of pension contributions for both Rooney Anand and Matthew Fearn are set out in the emoluments table above.
Tim Bridge is a pensioner member of the group’s defined benefit scheme. His pension is equivalent to 1/45th of his final pensionable 
earnings for each year of service, with a pro rata payment for a part year, subject to HMRC limits. His final pensionable earnings were those 
received immediately prior to him ceasing to be chief executive.
During the year two former directors received additional pension income from the company. John Bridge, who retired as a director 
on 31 December 1989, received a pension of £35k pa in excess of his scheme entitlements and Bernard Tickner, who retired as a director 
on 27 August 1992, received a pension of £28k pa in excess of his scheme entitlements. As required by law, both of these figures are stated 
net of their company‑ funded pension in payment at 31 March 1997. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

The market price of the shares on 6 August 2012, when the last awards were made, was 596.0p, although the number of shares comprising 
the award was determined by reference to the closing market price on 3 August 2012, namely 598.5p. 
Outstanding LTIP awards
The 2010 LTIP awards will vest at a rate of 100% on the third anniversary of their grant in August 2013 provided that the recipients remain 
employed by the group. The performance targets and vesting levels are set out below:
Vesting condition 
EPS (represented 40% of the award)
Threshold vesting (0% vesting) 47.0p
Target for 100% vesting 51.0p
Figure achieved 57.0p
Free cash flow (represented 60% of the award)
Threshold vesting (0% vesting) £230.4m
Target for 100% vesting £270.4m
Figure achieved £305.0m
The 2011 and the 2012 LTIP awards will only vest to the extent that the relevant performance targets are met over the three financial years 
ending in April 2014 and April 2015 respectively. In each case, a maximum of 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow 
performance condition has been met and the remaining 40% of the award will vest if an earnings per share performance condition 
has been met. The target range for the aggregate adjusted free cash flow for the relevant three financial years, which is calculated 
on a straight‑ line basis from 0% to 100%, is set out below:
2011 award 2012 award
3 years 3 years
Target level to May 2014 to May 2015
Nil vesting £250.0m £262.0m
50% vesting £270.0m £282.0m
100% vesting £290.0m £302.0m
The earnings per share performance conditions set a range for the EPS for the financial year ending in May 2014 (for the 2011 LTIP) or May 2015 
(for the 2012 LTIP) which the remuneration committee considered to be sufficiently challenging in the market conditions, but which is not 
disclosed due to its commercial sensitivity. 
The remuneration committee is advised on a regular basis as to how actual performance is tracking against the relevant targets. In relation to 
the 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards, based on the recent performance of the business and assuming that the business units continue to meet 
their stretching strategic plan targets, it is anticipated that the payout will reflect achievement of the maximum free cash flow and 
earnings per share targets. 
Details as to the extent to which the targets have actually been met and the awards have vested will be provided at the end of each three‑ year 
performance period.
During the year the 2009 LTIP awards vested on the third anniversary of their grant as a result of the remuneration committee having 
determined that the performance conditions applicable to those awards had been met. Details of the awards that vested during the year, 
the notional gain before tax achieved by the directors and the number of shares retained on vesting, are set out below. Total gains made 
by directors under the LTIP in the period ended 28 April 2013 therefore amounted to £948,707 (2012: £nil).  Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

Remuneration from other company directorships
Until December 2012 Rooney Anand served as a non‑ executive director of DriveAssist Holdings Limited, a company unconnected with the 
group. He received and retained for his personal benefit £23,000 from that company by way of director’s fees during the year. In July 2012 
he became non‑ executive chairman of JB Drinks Holdings Limited, which is also unconnected with the group, and received and retained 
£22,500 from that company by way of fees.  GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

to exercise termination or other rights in

be no less than five nor more than 12. 
Directors may be appointed by the company

re‑ elected, at the AGM held in the third 
calendar year before the current year shall 
retire from office and may stand for re‑ election.

the company a written offer to resign and 
the directors decide to accept this offer, (iii) 
all of the other directors remove them from

no political donations.
Payments to suppliers 
The group understands the benefits to be 
derived from maintaining good relationships 
with its suppliers and where possible enters 
into agreements over payment terms. Where 
such terms have not been agreed it is the group 
policy to settle invoices 60 days following 
the end of month of invoicing. This policy is 
dependent on suppliers providing accurate, 
timely and sufficiently detailed invoices. 
Payment in respect of 59 days’ average 
purchases from trade creditors of the group 
was outstanding at the end of the period 
(2012: 62 days).
Directors’ and officers’ 
indemnity insurance
The group has taken out insurance to 
indemnify, against third party proceedings, 
the directors of the company whilst serving 
on the board of the company and of any 
subsidiary. This cover indemnifies all 
employees of the group who serve on the 
boards of all subsidiaries. These indemnity 
policies subsisted throughout the year and 
remain in place at the date of this report.

The group’s policy on the use of financial 
instruments is set out in note 24.
Post-balance sheet events
Details of events occurring after the year 
end are set out in note 32.
Directors’ statement as to 
disclosure of information 
to auditor
The directors who were members of the 
board at the time of approving the directors’ 
report are listed on page 38. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors and of the 
company’s auditor, each of these directors 
confirms that:
 • to the best of each director’s knowledge 
and belief, there is no information relevant 
to the preparation of their report of which 
the company’s auditor is unaware; and
 • each director has taken all the steps a 
director might reasonably be expected 
to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, 
are set out in the chief executive’s review. 
The financial position of the group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the financial 
review. In addition, note 24 to the financial 
statements includes the group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposure 
to credit and liquidity risk. 
The directors are of the opinion that the 
group’s forecast and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the group 
should be able to operate within its current 
borrowing facilities and comply with its 
financing covenants. 
After making enquiries, the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the company 
and the group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual report and financial statements.
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its 
willingness to continue in office and a 
resolution to re‑ appoint the firm as the 
company’s auditor will be proposed 
at the AGM.
Annual general meeting 
The AGM will be held at 12 noon on 
Tuesday 3 September 2013 at the Millennium 
Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse 
Conference Centre, Newmarket, Suffolk. 
The notice of the AGM is set out in the 
separate circular to shareholders. 
The directors consider that all of the 
resolutions set out in the notice of AGM are 
in the best interests of the company and its 
shareholders as a whole. The directors will 
be voting in favour of them and unanimously 
recommend that shareholders vote in favour 
of each of them.

Directors’ responsibilities statements
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the 
group financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union.
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the group financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they present fairly the 
financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of the group for that period. 
In preparing those group financial statements 
the directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies in 
accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
 • present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 • provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the group’s financial position and 
financial performance; 
 • state that the group has complied with 
IFRSs, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 • make judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the group and enable them to ensure that 
the group financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the 
parent company financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the directors’ report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. Company law requires 
the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company 
and of the profit or loss of the company for 
that period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
 • make judgments and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 • state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 • prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is appropriate 
to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the company financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors confirm, to the best 
of their knowledge:
 • that these financial statements prepared 
in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the company and 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 • that the directors’ report and the 
business review includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the company 
and undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

We have audited the group financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 which comprise the group income 
statement, group statement of comprehensive income, group balance sheet, group cash flow statement, group statement of changes in equity 
and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 57, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 • give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 28 April 2013 and of its profit for the 52 weeks then ended;
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and 
 • have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 • the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
 • the information given in the corporate governance statement set out on pages 40 to 45 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 • a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 • the directors’ statement, set out on page 56, in relation to going concern; and
 • the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
 • certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 
and on the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Notes:
1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Greene King plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration 
of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially 
presented on the website.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 were authorised for issue by the board of 
directors on 26 June 2013. Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s 
shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 (prior year 52 weeks ended 29 April 2012) 
and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except 
where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, 
Greene King Finance plc. Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated 
as a quasi-subsidiary. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments 
made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following amendments to standards are effective for this financial year but have not had a significant impact on the reported financial 
performance or position of the group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (Amendment) – Disclosures of transfer of financial assets
This amendment, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, requires additional quantitative and qualitative 
disclosures relating to transfers of financial assets.
IAS 12 Income Taxes – Recovery of underlying assets
The amendment, effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2012, clarified the determination of deferred tax on investment 
property measured at fair value.
Significant accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods 
up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term 
of the lease or useful life of the asset. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if 
residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range 
from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, 
if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Profit or loss on de-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, 
and is included in the income statement in the year of de-recognition.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement 
of non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, is determined on a 
transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation 
of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 
either in the income statement or in other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be 
re-measured until it is finally settled within equity.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
Business combinations and goodwill continued
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in exchange for the business combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, 
such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the 
business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRS. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal 
or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised 
if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest 
is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business 
acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent 
of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment. If an indication exists, the group makes 
an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group. An asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair 
value less costs to sell and value-in-use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets. If there is an indication that any 
previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment. Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating 
segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether 
other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents 
the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating 
segment before aggregation.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated with 
the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the 
cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date 
has been carried forward as the carrying value. Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves. Such goodwill has not been reinstated 
and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-recognised 
when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments or available-for-sale financial assets. The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, 
where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the group’s beer. Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market 
and have therefore been designated as ‘Loans and receivables’, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses 
are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired. If there is evidence that an impairment loss 
has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loan’s carrying amount and the expected future receipts, 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised 
in operating profit.  Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full 
amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials are valued at average cost. Finished goods and work 
in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less. For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale
Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management are committed to 
the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Property, plant and equipment 
classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method. Finance income is recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent measurement 
is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting 
the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the 
group’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. 
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine 
whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the 
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting
The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, 
unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the 
initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously 
recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds. 
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method 
on an annual basis. The current service cost is charged to operating profit. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the group 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have 
vested. When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are remeasured and the resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in the income statement in the same period. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued
Defined benefit pension schemes continued
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount in the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes’ obligations less the fair 
value of scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The cost of the group’s defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made. Contributions are charged 
to the income statement as they become payable.
Post‑employment healthcare benefits
The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded. The cost of providing 
these benefits is determined on an estimated accruals basis.
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. 
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. No account 
is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions (performance linked 
to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled 
to an award are considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in 
determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative 
amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares 
and options that are ultimately expected to vest. The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning 
to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the 
above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS. However, later modifications of such equity 
instruments are measured using IFRS 2.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The group has an employee benefit trust for the 
granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares 
is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares. 
Revenue 
Generally, revenue represents external sales (excluding taxes) of goods and services, net of discounts. Revenue is recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, 
rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products. Revenue principally consists of drink, food 
and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
Operating leases 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current 
(the portion relating to the next financial period) or non-current prepayments. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxes
Income tax
The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax. It is calculated 
using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or  of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

Significant accounting policies continued
Taxes continued
Deferred tax continued
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax 
losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate 
presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied
As at 28 April 2013 there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date 
of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group. These are expected to be applied as follows: 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised)
The revisions eliminate the corridor approach and requires immediate recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive 
income, immediate recognition of all past service costs and the replacement of interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net 
interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability/asset. The amendments are effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. If the revised standard had been adopted at 28 April 2013 the group would have 
reported net pension finance costs of £2.5m rather than net finance income of £1.1m.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (Amendment) and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (Amendment)
The amendment to IAS 32, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, clarifies some of the requirements 
for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the group balance sheet. The amendment to IFRS 7, effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013, will affect disclosure only and has no impact on the group’s financial position or performance.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement
The standard is the first phase in the IASB’s work to replace IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial instruments 
as defined in IAS 39. The Board’s work on other phases is on-going, and includes impairment of financial instruments and hedge accounting. 
This standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, establishes two primary measurement categories for 
financial assets: i) amortised cost; and ii) fair value. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual 
cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. In relation to liabilities the change in the fair value of a liability that relates to credit risk must 
be presented in other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in fair value is presented in profit or loss, unless such presentation 
would create or enlarge the accounting mismatch in profit or loss. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and 
derecognition. The group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
The new standard, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, sets out the required disclosures for 
entities reporting under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 that were previously included in IAS 27, IAS 28 and IAS 31. The standard includes disclosure 
requirements for all forms of interest in other legal entities, including subsidiaries joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles 
and other off-balance sheet vehicles. The impact on the group is on disclosure in the consolidated financial statements only, where 
summarised information may need to be provided.
The following standards and interpretations are relevant to the group though they have been assessed as having no financial impact 
or additional disclosure requirements at this time:
 • IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;
 •  IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements;
 •  IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;
 •  IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (Revised);
 •  IAS 28 Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendment);
 •  IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities; and 
 • Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (2009–2011 Cycle):
 • IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;
 • IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment; and
 • IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the accounts continued
For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting 
policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical 
experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below:
Taxation 
Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until 
a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances 
and the level of disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which 
can have an impact on both deferred and current tax. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained 
and tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise. The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material 
adjustments to the income statement and/or cash flow in future periods. The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit each 
period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments
Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the group’s share-based payment plans. Note 8 describes the 
key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values. In addition estimates are made of the number of 
awards that will ultimately vest, judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions 
and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities
The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are 
disclosed in note 9. Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities. Note 9 describes the key 
assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown 
in note 13. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Value-in-use 
calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments 
may be necessary.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment. This requires an 
estimation of the value-in-use at a site level. Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash 
flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity 
to changes in key assumptions.
Residual values 
Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends. If residual values were lower than estimated, 
an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required. Useful lives are reassessed annually which 
may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Business combinations
The group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value. The assessment of fair 
value, particularly for property, plant and equipment acquired, is undertaken with reference to current market conditions.
Note 17 describes the business combinations in the current year and provides details of the fair value adjustments made in arriving at the 
fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
Property provisions
The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where 
rental expense is in excess of income. The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal 
and external property experts. However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level 
of provision recorded. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

2 Segment information
The group has determined the following three reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according 
to the nature of products and services provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers: 
Retail: Managed pubs and restaurants 
Pub Partners: Tenanted and leased pubs
Brewing & Brands: Brewing beer, marketing and selling
These are also considered to be the group’s operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive 
who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis.

5 Exceptional items continued
Exceptional operating costs
Exceptional divisional restructuring and financial systems integration costs are items of one-off expenditure incurred in connection 
with the restructuring of certain trading divisions within the group and the review of group-wide financial systems.
Acquisition costs are items of one-off expenditure incurred in connection with acquisition of businesses in the year. These costs include legal 
and professional fees incurred by the group and stamp duty which in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised) can no longer be included within 
the consideration for the acquisition and amount to £nil (2012: £3.3m). In addition acquisition costs include a charge of £2.2m (2012: £2.5m) 
in respect of amounts payable, two years post-acquisition and subject to the future profitability of the businesses, to the former owners 
of Cloverleaf Restaurants and Realpubs, respectively, who remained employees of the group.
Following the closure of the group’s defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual an exceptional credit of £8.4m has been recognised. 
This comprises a gain of £10.1m in respect of past service accruals no longer being linked to future salary growth less £1.7m of implementation 
costs and fees. The credit of £4.4m in the prior year is as a result of the curtailment of discretionary benefits provided to retired members 
of the main defined benefit pension scheme.
The net loss on disposal of property plant and equipment of £5.4m (2012: £0.2m profit) comprises a total profit on disposal of £6.9m (2012: £7.6m) 
and a total loss on disposal of £12.3m (2011: £7.4m). The loss on disposal includes £4.5m in respect of goodwill allocated to parts of operating 
segments disposed of in the year. The other loss on disposal of £1.3m relates to the loss on disposal of an investment in the year.
Exceptional tax 
The tax credit in respect of the licensed estate arises from movements in their base cost, including the impact of indexation.
The Finance Act 2012 reduced the rate of corporate tax from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013. The effect of the change in tax rate is to reduce 
the deferred tax provision by a net £3.3m, comprising a credit to the group income statement of £6.1m and a debit to the group statement 
of comprehensive income of £2.8m.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods’ income tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods including tax relief 
for capital expenditure and repairs.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods’ deferred tax arises from finalising the tax returns and also deferred tax on revaluation and rolled 
over gains on the licensed estate.

8 Share-based payment plans
The group operates three types of share-based payment arrangements: a senior management long-term incentive plan (LTIP), a deferred 
share bonus scheme for senior executives and a general employee share option plan (SAYE). 
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 46 to 54. All are equity-settled. 
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions 
is £5.0m (2012: £4.4m). A corresponding credit of £3.9m (2012: £3.9m) has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value 
of the grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows:
2013 LTIP SAYE 
Weighted average share price 596p 708p
Exercise price — 505p
Expected dividend yield 4.5% 3.8%
Risk-free rate of return 0.2% 0.6%
Volatility 23.8% 22.0%
Expected life (years) 3.0 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 521p 168p
2012 LTIP SAYE 
Weighted average share price 455p 522p
Exercise price — 387p
Expected dividend yield 4.9% 4.9%
Risk-free rate of return 1.4% 0.6%
Volatility 42.9% 33.2%
Expected life (years) 3.0 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 393p 133p
Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life. Expected volatility 
is based on historical volatility of the company’s share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of 
future trends. Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period. This is not necessarily indicative 
of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

The options and shares granted under the LTIP are at nil cost therefore the weighted average exercise price for rights outstanding 
at the beginning and end of the period, granted, forfeited and exercised during the period is £nil (2012: £nil).
ESOS, SAYE and LTIP
Options were exercised on a range of dates. The weighted average share price through the period was 607p in 2013 and 483p in 2012.
The rights outstanding at 28 April 2013 under the LTIP had an exercise price of £nil (2012: £nil) and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 1.3 years (2012: 1.4 years). 
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 332p and 528p (2012: 296p – 528p) and for the SAYE scheme 
between 274p and 505p (2012: 274p and 694p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 1.8 years for the ESOS (2012: 2.6 years) and 2.8 years for the SAYE scheme (2012: 3.0 years).
Deferred share bonus scheme
Selected senior executives participate in a deferred share bonus scheme. Awards made under this scheme are based on a percentage of 
salary and are paid in shares. Awards are made to eligible employees on the achievement of corporate targets and vest once required sevice 
periods are completed. During the year 0.05m (2012: 0.12m) shares were purchased to fulfil awards made in 2011/12 under this scheme. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

9 Pensions
The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and three defined benefit schemes.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs 
after employment. The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme
Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company. The total cost 
recognised in operating profit for the period was £2.2m (2012: £1.9m).
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits
The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and were closed to future accrual during 
the year. All schemes have had full actuarial valuations in the last three years: Greene King Pension Scheme (last valued as at 5 April 2012), 
Belhaven Pension Scheme (last valued as at 4 May 2011), and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme (last valued as at 30 April 2012).
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group’s finances and are administered 
by pension trustees. Pension benefits are related to members’ final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of comprehensive income.
The total cost recognised in the income statement was:

During the year the group defined benefit schemes were closed to future accrual with a credit of £10.1m being recognised as a consequence 
of past service accruals no longer being linked to future salary growth. The credit in the prior year relates to a curtailment of discretionary 
post-employment benefits provided to retired members of the main defined benefit pension scheme.

The total contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes in the following period are expected to be £7.3m (2012: £12.9m) for the group.
The values of the schemes’ liabilities have been determined by a qualified actuary based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, 
updated to 28 April 2013 using the following principal actuarial assumptions: 
2013 2012
Discount rate 3.9% 4.7%
Expected rates of salary increases — 4.0%
Expected pension payment increases 3.1% 2.9%
Rate of inflation (RPI) 3.2% 3.0%
Rate of inflation (CPI) 2.5% 2.3%
Healthcare cost increase 9.0% 9.0%
The mortality assumptions imply the following expectations of years of life from age 65:
Man currently aged 40 24.0  23.6 
Woman currently aged 40 26.4  26.2 
Man currently aged 65 22.3  21.2 
Woman currently aged 65 24.5  24.0 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life 
expectancy. Overall expected rate of return on assets is established by applying brokers’ forecasts to each category of scheme asset. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by Greene King plc to its shareholders. 
Factors that may affect future tax charges 
In addition to the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% during the period it is proposed to reduce the rate to 21% 
from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015. These further reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
and consequently are not included in these financial statements. The effect of these proposals would be to reduce the deferred tax liability 
by a further £9.1m. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of £98.3m (2012: £102.4m) by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period (excluding own shares held) of 216.1m (2012: 215.0m).  
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 1.3m (2012: 0.6m) dilutive potential shares under option, giving 
a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 217 .4m (2012: 215.6m). Share options granted over 0.0m shares 
(2012: 0.5m) have not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because they are anti-dilutive at the year end. The performance 
conditions for share options granted over 2.8m (2012: 2.9m) shares have not been met in the current financial period and therefore the dilutive effect 
of the number of shares which would have been issued at the period end has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group 
on both a basic and dilutive basis.

All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations. As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer 
amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored 
internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
Goodwill disposed of in the year is the amount of goodwill allocated to parts of operating segments disposed of during the year. The amount 
disposed is calculated based on the relative value of the operation disposed and the portion of the operating segment retained. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated £353.8m (2012: £354.0m) to Retail, £156.5m (2012: £160.8m) to Pub Partners, and £214.5m 
(2012: £214.5m) to Brewing & Brands.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on one-year budgets 
approved by the board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount. 
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are budgeted EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used 
to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period.
Budgeted EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to each cash-generating unit’s 
pub estate or operations, sales prices and volumes, capital expenditure, business mix and margin. 
Cash flows are discounted at 9.0% (2012: 9.0%) which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant 
operating segment. A growth rate of 2.0% (2012: 2.0%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows. The growth rate is considered a conservative 
rate and is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.  Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

13 Goodwill continued
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate. 
Management consider that reasonable possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1% point, a reduction in growth 
rate of 1% point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow. As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation none 
of these changes would have  resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the period.

Valuation
The licensed estate properties were valued by the group’s own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, 
on the basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Appraisal and Valuation Standards. 
A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, 
who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal. Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition 
to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value. These valuations 
have been retained but they have not been updated. Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets
Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of £1,437.7m (2012: £1,433.9m) over which there is a first charge 
in favour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
During the year £19.3m of impairment losses (2012: £22.1m) were recognised in the income statement as exceptional costs. 
These are analysed between the group’s principal reporting segments as shown below.
£1.6m of the impairment recognised in the year for within the Retail estate is in respect of licensed properties damaged by fire. 
In the period the group has received £0.8m of insurance compensation to meet the costs incurred to date of restoring these properties; 
further compensation is expected to be received as the restoration projects progress.

The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators 
of impairment. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGU’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
The group estimates value-in-use using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow 
projections of 9% (2012: 9%) and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% (2012: 2%) which is below the 
long-term average growth rate for the industry. Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on 
historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
Estimates of fair value less costs to sell are based on valuations undertaken by in-house property experts.
The impairment recognised in the Retail and Pub Partners estates are primarily the result of the reduced trading performance of a relatively 
small number of pubs due to a combination of site specific trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK consumer environment 
seen in the year. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount 
rate applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth 
rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows:

At the start of the year the group had a 40% interest in Ensco 600 Limited, a company operating a single pub. During the year the group 
acquired the remaining 60% of the business for consideration of £0.9m and also repaid the company’s bank borrowings totalling £1.2m. 
The fair value of the tangible fixed assets acquired was £3.0m. 
On 19 July 2011 an agreement was reached on the terms of a recommended offer for the entire issued share capital of Capital Pub Company. 
The offer was declared unconditional on 22 August 2011 with the group assuming control of Capital Pub Company from 3 September 2011. 
On 5 September 2011 the group announced its intention to compulsorily acquire all outstanding shares in Capital Pub Company, 
with all purchases completed by 24 October 2011.

Goodwill has arisen primarily due to expected operating synergies and the difference between property portfolio value and value-in-use. 
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review of properties that was carried out by qualified surveyors employed 
by the group. Properties have been revalued at their existing use value. The values of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted

Bank overdrafts 
Overdrafts are utilised for the day-to-day management of cash. The group has facilities of £25.0m (2012: £25.0m) available with interest 
linked to base rate. 
Bank loans – unsecured 
On 1 April 2011 the group agreed a five-year revolving credit facility, of £400m, of which £177.9m (2012: £206.6m) was drawn down 
at the year end. Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions. 
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity. Although any individual draw-downs are repayable within 12 months of 
the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding. Immediate renewal is available under the £400m facility until April 2016. 
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Securitised debt 
The group has issued various tranches of bonds in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the group’s pubs held in Greene King 
Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap. The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were 
issued by Greene King Finance plc.
The group’s securitised debt consists of the following tranches:

Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, over the period shown above. 
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond. All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential 
interest payment and repayment rights over the Class AB1 and Class B bonds. The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, 
principal repayment and interest payment.
The Class AB1 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest 
payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds. 
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, 
a group company. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability 
to move cash to other group companies. Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

24 Financial instruments
The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business 
needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group. If appropriate, the group uses financial 
instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, 
cash and short-term deposits. Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, 
payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group’s operations 
and financing sources. No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group’s financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The policy for managing 
each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group’s borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the 
underlying debt. The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily 
arising from the floating rate instruments. The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged. 
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract 
included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in 
interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest 
rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 28 April 2013 and 29 April 2012. The analysis relates only to balances at these 
dates and is not representative of the year as a whole. The following assumptions were made:
 • balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits 
does not change as interest rates move;
 • gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group; and
 • cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end. An explanation for the split 
between those hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the group’s net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the group’s profit before tax 
by approximately £0.2m (2012: £0.1m) and the group’s equity by £106.1m (2012: £101.9m).
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt. 
The group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank 
loans. The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end (2012: 60 days following month end).
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month. Short-term 
flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities at 28 April 2013 and 29 April 2012 based on contractual 
undiscounted payments including interest.

Credit risk
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verification procedures. 
Receivable balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad 
debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash. Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation 
and the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging
At 28 April 2013 the group held 4 (2012: 4) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £140m (2012: £140m), designated as a hedge 
of the cash flow interest rate risk of the £177.9m (2012: £206.6m) draw-down from the variable credit facility in the year. The interest rate 
swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of £4.0m (2012: £2.4m). The cash flows occurred semi-annually based on 
a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 28 April 2013 the group held 5 (2012: 5) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £667.9m (2012: £695.7m), entered into as part 
of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps. A fair value liability of £235.2m (2012: £198.4m) has been recognised on the balance 
sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against £667.9m (2012: £695.7m) of variable rate bonds, receiving 
a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 5.1% (2012: 5.1%). The contract maturity dates are 
December 2034 and March 2036. The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms. 
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective. In anticipation 
of the repurchase of the £60.0m AB1 bond post-year end the cash flow hedge in respect of this bond has ceased to be effective and hedge 
accounting has been discontinued. Accordingly an exceptional cost of £28.2m has been recognised in respect of the fair value of the interest 
rate swap no longer qualifying for hedge accounting which has been recycled from equity to the income statement. The remaining interest 
rate swaps have been assessed as highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over their remaining 
contract lives.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 98.6% (2012: 97.4%) in line with the group’s policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.

The interest on variable rate financial instruments is repriced at intervals of less than one year. The interest on fixed rate financial instruments 
is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included above 
as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values
Set out in the table below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
the fair values:
Cash and cash equivalents (comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits) – approximates to the carrying amount stated 
in the accounts.
Financial assets – these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying amount in the case 
of the floating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps – fair values and effective interest rates of derivatives and other borrowings have been based on quotations from 
counterparties and represent estimates of the amount the group would expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used 
to derive fair value. 
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 –  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly.
Level 3 – techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

During the periods ending 28 April 2013 and 29 April 2012 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements.
Capital risk management 
The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) and shareholder value. 
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels (together referred to as capital), as appropriate in the light of economic 
and trading conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including fixed charge cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
and free cash flow debt service coverage. Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance 
costs before exceptional items (note 7). For the period to 28 April 2013 interest cover was 2.9x (2012: 2.7x). The board’s dividend policy 
is to maintain a minimum dividend cover of two times adjusted basic earnings per share.

Own shares 
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury, held by the employee benefit trust or purchased to fulfil awards made under the deferred share 
bonus scheme. At 28 April 2013 0.69m shares (2012: 0.97m) were held in treasury, 1.06m shares (2012: 1.09m) were held by the employee 
benefit trust and 0.05m (2012: 0.12m) were held to fulfil awards under the deferred share bonus scheme. The market value at 28 April 2013 
of the treasury shares was £4.9m (2012: £5.0m), of the shares held by the employee benefit trust was £7.5m (2012: £5.6m) and of the shares 
held for the deferred share bonus scheme was £0.3m (2012: £0.6m). 
The employee benefit trust is independently managed and has purchased shares in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options 
and potential awards under the long-term incentive plan.
At the year end 0.55m (2012: 0.84m) treasury shares and 0.44m (2012: 0.23m) shares in the employee benefit trust were allocated to meet 
awards under the long-term incentive plan.
A transfer of £4.0m (2012: £nil) from own shares to retained earnings has been made to reflect transfers to satisfy awards under the long 
term incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option plan and reflects the weighted average cost of own shares.
During the period 0.05m (2012: 0.12m) shares were repurchased at a cost of £0.3m (2012: £0.6m) to fulfil awards made under the deferred 
share bonus scheme with 0.11m shares transferred to individuals to satisfy awards. The employee benefit trust purchased 0.45m shares 
(2012: nil) at a cost of £3.2m and 0.79m (2012: nil) shares were transferred to satisfy awards under the long-term incentive plan.

30 Financial commitments
The group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties and items of plant and machinery. The terms of the leases vary but typically 
on inception a property lease will be for a period of up to 30 years and plant and machinery will be for less than 5 years. Most property 
leases have an upwards only rent review based on open market rents at the time of the review.

Final dividend
A final dividend of 19.45p per share (2012: 18.1p) amounting to a dividend of £42.4m (2012: £39.0m) was proposed by the directors 
at their meeting on 26 June 2013. These financial statements do not reflect the dividend payable.
Financing
Since the year end, the group has re-purchased the £60m AB1 floating rate bond at par. This has been financed from bank loan facilities, 
which have been increased to £460m and extended to June 2018.
The interest rate swap which was designated as a hedge against the AB1 bond will be retained though the existing hedge arrangement 
has ceased to be effective and as a result the group has recognised an exceptional cost of £28.2m (note 24).
33 Contingent liabilities
The group has provided guarantees totalling £1.9m at 28 April 2013 (2012: £4.0m) in respect of free trade customers’ bank borrowings.
In a previous period the group received a refund of £7.0m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines following a ruling that the 
application of VAT to certain gaming machines contravened the European Union’s principle of fiscal neutrality. HMRC have appealed 
against the ruling and last year the case was referred from the European Court of Justice back to UK courts. We are awaiting their final 
decision. If HMRC’s appeal is upheld the refund of £7.0m and associated interest of £1.0m would become repayable. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.greeneking.co.uk

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent auditor’s report (company)
To the members of Greene King plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 which comprise the 
parent company balance sheet and the related notes 34 to 44. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 57, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 • give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 28 April 2013;
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 • have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 • the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 • the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 • the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013.

Notes:
1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Greene King plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration 
of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially 
presented on the website.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
34 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and presentation
The accounts are prepared on a going-concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting and financial 
reporting standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of 
derivatives, where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value of 
investments is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, 
with the following exceptions: 
 • provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal 
of fixed assets that have rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement 
to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, 
it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement 
assets are sold; and 
 • deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-recognised 
when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The company is exempt, in accordance with FRS 29.2D, from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain 
disclosure that complies with FRS 29 (IFRS 7).
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent 
measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge 
accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the 
company’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. 
The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine 
whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the 
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when 
the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the profit and 
loss account as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit and loss.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The company has an employee benefit trust 
for the granting of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such 
shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Notes to the company accounts
For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk
99
34 Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors of subsidiary companies receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange 
for shares or rights over shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at 
which they were granted. No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than 
market conditions (performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order 
for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance, non-vesting conditions 
are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an increase 
in the company’s investments in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an investment reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. 
In accordance with the exemption within FRS 20 no amount is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior 
to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of implementation of FRS 20.
Related party transactions
In accordance with FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures the company is not required to disclose transactions with its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
35 Profit for the period
No profit or loss account is presented for the company as permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for the period 
is £10.0m (2012: £9.1m profit).
36 Auditor’s remuneration
Auditor’s remuneration in respect of the company audit was £16,300 (2012: £15,760).
37 Directors’ remuneration and employee costs
Details of directors’ remuneration is contained in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 46 to 54. The company has no employees 
other than directors and the directors are not remunerated through this company. Details of share options issued by the company are given 
in note 8 to the group accounts.
The directors do not believe that it is practicable to apportion these amounts between their services as directors of the company and their 
services as directors of other group companies.

(2012: £90.6m) arising from transfer of revalued assets to other group companies and will only be realised when the related assets are 
disposed of by the group.
Hedging reserve
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the company’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, 
in line with the accounting policy disclosed in note 34.
Own shares
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury and by the employee benefit trust. Movement in own shares is described in note 27

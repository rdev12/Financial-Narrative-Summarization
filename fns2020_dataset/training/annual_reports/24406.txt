Our purpose
The UK Private Rented Sector (‘PRS’) presents 
a major opportunity as more people are choosing 
to rent. 
We plan to capture this opportunity. We are 
the UK’s largest residential landlord listed on 
the London Stock Exchange and have a clear, 
focused strategy to significantly grow our portfolio 
of homes for rent and deliver sustainable returns 
to our Shareholders while providing our customers 
with great homes to live in.
Building on our growing national portfolio of 
8,609 rental homes, we plan to invest over £1bn 
into the UK’s private rented sector by 2020. We 
will execute this plan with our unrelenting focus 
on growing net rental income, driving operational 
efficiency and improving customer service – to 
the benefit of our Shareholders and customers.

Driving net rental 
income through design 
and management
 
Our new PRS assets are designed to deliver 
a great experience for our customers and 
are efficient to run.
Well-designed buildings are more 
cost-effective to run and last longer, 
mitigating against depreciation and 
obsolescence and reducing maintenance 
costs. They also make for happy, loyal 
customers which, in turn, provide 
robust, sustainable income.
Providing 
homes for 
better renting
We provide homes for rent and we are 
professionalising the sector and improving 
the customer experience by creating new 
purpose built rental homes that offer an 
attractive alternative to owning. 
We are designing, building and managing  
great homes in desirable areas.

Growing net rental 
income
 
Our strategy is transforming Grainger 
from a business reliant on capital growth 
to one with more balanced total returns 
and greater rental income. 
We are investing over £1bn into rental 
homes by 2020, a pipeline which is fully 
funded through the measures we have 
taken to simplify the business. This 
strategy is enabled by our portfolio 
of regulated tenancies which generate 
stable long-term cash flows.
By driving ever greater operational 
efficiencies and creating economies  
of scale, we are enhancing net rental  
income, which will in turn allow us to 
grow our dividend. 
  For further details on our 
strategy and focus, please 
see the Chief Executive’s 
review on pages 9 to 11.
Our investment focus
 
We target cities with attractive market 
fundamentals and positive economic 
prospects, including wage and job 
growth. We look for top universities, 
teaching hospitals, infrastructure 
investment and high-quality employers. 
We use our extensive, local knowledge 
and our strong network to identify 
investment opportunities.
Among our target cities are London, 
Manchester, Bristol, Birmingham and Leeds.

The UK needs more homes
 
Last year, the UK built about 152,520 
new homes (DCLG). This is less than half 
the projected demand. According to a 
recent report by the House of Lords 
Economic Affairs Committee, it is 
estimated the UK needs at least 
300,000 new homes each year. 
By building homes specifically for the 
rental market (‘build to rent’), we are able 
to significantly contribute to new housing 
supply, and we are able to deliver homes 
much more quickly than other traditional 
forms of housebuilding.
Renting on  
the rise
Renting is the fastest growing housing  
tenure in the UK. It has doubled in size  
in the last decade and it is predicted  
to grow by 25% by 2020.
For more about our market 
opportunities see 
pages 12 and 13.
4 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Renting is the fastest 
growing housing tenure
 
In the last decade, the PRS has  
increased in size by 82% to over 4 million 
households. This equals growth of 17,500 
households per month on average 
(English Housing Survey).
Forecasts predict the PRS will continue 
to grow. PwC indicates that an additional 
1.8 million UK households will rent by 
2025 (PwC, UK Economic Outlook report, 
July 2015), a 45% increase, while Savills 
suggests an additional 1 million PRS 
households in the next five years (Savills, 
Rental Britain report, February 2016).
The drivers behind this growth in 
demand for renting are both economic 
and cultural: the cost of owning is 
increasing and the flexibility of renting 
is becoming more desirable.
Opportunity for large 
scale professional 
landlords
 
Ninety-eight per cent of landlords in 
the UK own less than 10 properties. 
This gives Grainger a clear opportunity 
to provide a differentiated product with 
high-quality service and gain significant 
market share in the new, emerging PRS 
of large scale professional, purpose built 
rental housing (DCLG Landlord Survey).
A decade ago 1 in 10 
households in England 
rented. Today
1 in 5 
rent privately
(English Housing Survey)
“ One of things that has impressed 
me most about Grainger is how 
responsive they are to our needs. 
We always receive a reply to our 
emails within 24 hours and they 
actually care about making us feel 
comfortable in our home! We’re 
treated like valued clients, rather 
than simply tenants.”

generative portfolio 
delivering balanced  
total returns
 
We manage our portfolio to protect 
value and capture growth opportunities. 
Our regulated tenancy portfolio is 
expected to generate more than £100m 
of gross cash per year from sales and 
rental income for the next ten years. 
This provides us with a solid foundation 
for growth in the PRS. These cash flows 
have proved resilient throughout 
economic cycles.
This stable trading income from our 
regulated tenancy portfolio is balanced by 
a robust rental income coupled with the 
higher yielding PRS assets. This year , our PRS 
homes generated rental growth of 3.6%.

Strategic report Baroness Margaret Ford
Chairman
I am pleased to report significant 
progress following our changes 
in the executive leadership at the 
beginning of the year.
Shortly after taking office as Chief 
Executive, Helen Gordon, supported 
by an energetic leadership team, 
reviewed and refined the strategy 
the Board had initiated at the end of 
2015. She immediately set out the key 
milestones to achieving a step change in 
the strategic direction of the Company 
with the ultimate objective of improving 
value for all stakeholders. The benefits 
are already beginning to materialise and 
the future attractions of the business as 
an income generating, residential rental 
company are becoming increasingly clear.
In simple terms, we are shifting the nature 
of the business from a traditional trading 
model, heavily reliant on house price 
inflation as a driver of capital value, to 
an investment model with a sustainable 
and visible income stream from well-run 
private rented residential homes. 
The Grainger model continues to 
capture over time the full reversionary 
value of our regulated portfolio. 
The predictable cash flow from these 
properties is then reinvested directly  
into developing or acquiring modern, 
purpose-built residential rental 
properties. This is a significant growth 
market in the UK as the demand 
for homes outstrips supply and the 
option to rent becomes an increasingly 
attractive and affordable alternative  
to buying a home.
I am pleased to say that the new 
management team has lost no time 
in delivering on the milestones set out 
in January 2016 and in reshaping the 
organisation to support the strategy. 
Disposals have been made, costs 
have been cut, and resources have 
been concentrated on identifying and 
creating a strong pipeline of private 
rented sector (‘PRS’) assets, that build 
on our heritage and will deliver strong, 
sustainable shareholder returns over 
the coming years. 
The transition from strategy to 
implementation has been short and 
decisive and I would like to thank all of 
my colleagues on the Board for their 
tremendous effort in achieving this. 
The effective management and proper 
governance of the Group is critical to our 
continued success and I have set out on 
pages 43 to 53 a number of key actions 
that we have taken to ensure that it 
remains of the highest standard.
We have also enjoyed strong support 
from the majority of our Shareholders 
for our move to a UK residential rental 
model with a greater focus on reliable 
income. Their support of this and our 
new management team during this  
first year of transition has been  
much appreciated. 
A period of significant progress
Strategic report – Chairman’s letter
Sadly we have to report that this year 
we lost Stephen Dickinson, who died 
after a short illness. Stephen joined 
Grainger in 1974 and was an extremely 
effective Chief Executive of the 
Company until 2002, eventually retiring 
from the Board in 2009, and was 
instrumental in leading the Company 
from private to public ownership. He 
was a wonderful person who left a very 
strong legacy and will be much missed 
by all at Grainger.
Finally, we never forget that over 18,000 
people choose to make their home with 
Grainger. We take that responsibility 
very seriously and our staff will continue 
to go the extra mile for our customers, 
day in and day out providing the best 
service and best support possible.

Helen Gordon
Chief Executive
This is my first full year statement 
to you as Chief Executive of your 
Company and I am pleased to report 
a solid performance and the swift 
execution of the planned strategic 
changes in the business, which will 
ultimately drive all stakeholder value. 
I set out in this report how we have 
simplified and put focus into the 
business to capture the opportunity 
created by the growing demand for 
private rental housing in the UK. 
Strategic review
In January I presented my review of 
the Company’s strategy. The strategy 
positions Grainger for sustainable 
growth in an emerging sector. It is 
designed to grow rents, simplify and 
focus the business and build on the 
operational strength and foundations 
of over 100 years of renting homes.
I was supported in this review by an 
enthusiastic and engaged leadership 
team. The whole of the Grainger team 
provided insights and contributions. The 
review examined every division and all 
assets and portfolios were appraised 
and avenues for growth explored.
The key findings supported our 
view that there is a significant market 
opportunity in an area where Grainger 
has unparalleled expertise and 
committed employees ready for change.
We identified the need for Grainger to 
focus on growing rental income, to exit 
non-UK assets and dispose of assets 
which consume shareholder capital and 
were focused on capital growth.
We concluded that our regulated 
tenancy business remains a compelling 
investment with robust cash flows. The 
retention of these assets supports and 
provides financing for Grainger’s 
evolution to our new PRS model. Most 
importantly, this PRS model will establish 
Grainger as an income generating quoted 
vehicle, which provides Shareholders 
easy and liquid access to the UK’s 
high-growth PRS market, which is 
otherwise only achievable through direct 
real estate investment. 
Delivering on our strategy 
of simplifying the business
During the year we sold our  
non-core assets and reorganised 
our operational platform. 
In January 2016 we agreed to sell our 
Equity Release business as it was no 
longer complementary to Grainger’s 
core focus. This was completed in 
May 2016.
Having decided to sell our German 
business, we disposed of a series of 
portfolios. We sold our German joint 
venture in January. In February we 
agreed to sell our German business 
platform with one of the portfolios, 
thereby securing the majority of the 
Grainger employees’ jobs with the new 
owners and reducing exit costs. The 
majority of remaining assets were also 
Maximising the opportunity  
in the private rented sector
Strategic report – Chief Executive’s strategic review 
sold by May 2016. We disposed of surplus 
land at Kennel Farm, Basingstoke, and in 
August we were able to secure the 
unwinding of our joint venture in Prague 
by securing planning consent and 
disposing of the land. I am pleased to 
report that these disposals have been 
achieved profitably, while successfully 
securing the future for Grainger 
colleagues within those non- core 
businesses under their new owners. 
These disposals reduced the quantum 
and cost of debt and enabled us to 
embark on a restructuring of our more 
expensive debt resulting in further cost 
reductions. This is explained more fully  
in the Financial review. In June 2016 we 
embarked on the restructuring of our 
operations by removing divisions and 
restructuring the business into Property 
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 9
Strategic report Strategic report – Chief Executive’s strategic review 
continued
and Operations (a PropCo/OpCo model) 
backed by our central corporate teams. 
This is designed to focus on driving 
capital and income growth in the 
business as well as significantly reducing 
overheads. The benefit of this will be 
fully realised in 2017 when overheads 
are on track to be 24% lower than 
in 2015. We will continue to pursue 
ongoing improvements where possible, 
realising further cost efficiencies that 
our new model creates.
Delivering on our strategy of 
growing rents and dividends
The growth of our rental income is 
at the heart of the strategic objective 
of delivering shareholder returns 
which are a balanced mixture of both 
income and capital growth. During 
this transitional period to 2020 we have 
linked our dividend directly to net rental 
income and will distribute the equivalent 
of 50% of net rents to Shareholders. 
The majority of Grainger staff are also 
Shareholders and this approach will 
further incentivise the teams to drive 
rental growth alongside providing a 
high-quality service.
In January we announced a target that 
over 50% of our wholly-owned assets 
would be modern PRS stock by 2020 and 
that by that date net rental income 
would exceed profit from sales. This is a 
model which is more income focused and 
structured to give more sustainable and 
less volatile returns. 
We also announced we would invest 
£850m (c.£1. 1bn alongside our partners) 
in the PRS between now and 2020. I 
am pleased to announce that we have 
already achieved significant progress 
and have secured £389m with a further 
pipeline of £347m of potential sites in 
the planning or legal process. 
The growth in rents has been achieved 
by new acquisitions but also by the 
operations team delivering great 
customer service and encouraging 
our customers to stay for longer, and 
increasing demand for our homes.
Disciplined approach to acquisition
We have restructured our investment 
and acquisitions teams to enable them 
to identify and assess opportunities 
quickly in our target markets, and 
provided an investment framework 
which is supported by rigorous analysis 
and in-depth local knowledge. This has 
dramatically increased the number of 
opportunities we are evaluating and has 
enabled us to make good progress on  
our pipeline.
UK PRS market 
As you will read in the market review 
section of this report, the demand for 
renting is growing and this trend is set 
to continue. Ten years ago, one in ten 
households in England rented privately. 
T oday it is one in five. In London, it is one 
in four. PwC predicts that 1.8 million new 
rental homes will be required by 2025 to 
meet demand. This demand, coupled 
with positive support for the build-to-rent 
sector and large scale institutional 
investment in the PRS, presents Grainger 
with a very compelling opportunity.
As the UK market leader in the 
residential rental sector, we are targeting 
investment in the PRS in key target cities 
where demand for renting is highest and 
local economic prospects are greatest, 
including cities with top universities 
and good graduate retention, teaching 
hospitals and strong professional 
services. Our top five target cities are: 
London, Manchester, Bristol, Birmingham 
and Leeds. I am pleased to say that we 
have secured sizeable investments in four 
of five of these cities since we launched 
our strategy.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 10 Working in partnership
Our reputation of working in partnership 
and taking the long-term view of key 
relationships is well established. Whilst 
we are clear about our commitment to 
existing partners, we believe we should 
drive returns for our shareholders and 
not take on more third-party property 
management mandates at this time. 
Our relationship with APG is important 
to us and I am delighted that GRIP , our 
fund with APG, was converted to a Real 
Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in July 
of this year.
Our partners in local and central 
government are important to 
us. We are aligned in our objective 
of creating new high-quality homes. 
Grainger’s longevity and commitment 
to stewardship with communities has 
been evidenced across a number of 
development projects. In particular, our 
work at Aldershot in partnership with the 
Defence Infrastructure Organisation 
(part of the Ministry of Defence) and our 
developments with the Royal Borough of 
Kensington and Chelsea are both worthy 
of highlighting.
We continue to work with some 
housebuilders and to look for ways in 
which to increase the availability of private 
rental housing stock in the UK which is 
complementary to housebuilders’ needs 
to build new homes. 
Political and legislative changes
There is an undersupply of quality 
housing in the UK and this has been 
recognised by central and local 
government. Whilst the political 
environment has been largely 
supportive, the sector was adversely 
affected by an additional 3% stamp 
duty land tax surcharge on second 
homes in the Spring. In June the vote to 
leave the European Union was seen to 
have a negative impact on the housing 
market but was not evidenced in our 
sales pipeline, and the PRS sector is 
widely regarded as one of the most 
resilient real estate classes post the 
EU referendum.
Outlook 
2016 has been a landmark year for 
Grainger. The team has worked hard to 
support the delivery of the key milestones 
of the strategy. The UK PRS market is on 
the cusp of high growth as it provides a 
practical and compelling solution to the 
housing shortage in the UK. Grainger’s 
established leading market position and 
operational expertise provide us with 
confidence that we can capture this 
market opportunity to its fullest. 
2017 will be an important year for 
Grainger as we forge ahead with the 
transition into a more balanced rental 
model and as we realise the benefits 
of the restructuring and continue to 
manage our all-important portfolio 
of regulated tenancies. 
Our long-term aspirations for 
Grainger are for the business to be the 
acknowledged leader in the PRS market in 
the UK, delivering quality services whilst 
generating strong shareholder returns.
Grainger has seen substantial change 
and I would like to take the opportunity 
of thanking each and every one of our 
staff with whom so much has been 
and will be achieved. Together with our 
Shareholders, we look forward to an 
exciting and profitable future ahead.

Strategic report – Market review
Grainger’s business model is based 
on maximising the total returns 
generated from residential property 
investments. We do this through a 
combination of capital growth and 
rental income. 
Capital values (house prices)
UK house prices rose in the year ending 
30 September 2016 by 3.7% according 
to the LSL Acadata House Price Index, 
5.5% for the combined average of the 
Nationwide and Halifax house price 
indices, and 7.7% according to the Office 
of National Statistics.
This growth was significantly weighted 
towards the first half of the year. In the 
second half, activity and price growth in 
predominantly Central London slowed 
in the wake of increases to stamp duty 
land tax and the EU referendum result. 
Looking ahead, the consensus among 
the main UK estate agencies (including 
JLL, CBRE and Savills) is that house 
price inflation in the forthcoming year is 
anticipated to be between 0% and 5%.
Renting on the rise
Renting privately is the second most 
common housing tenure in the UK 
and it is rapidly growing. 
One in five households rent privately 
in England. In London, it is one in four. 
Owner occupation levels peaked in 
2003 at 71%, before the financial crisis, 
and are now at 64%, while in the last 
decade, the PRS has increased in size 
by 82% to over 4 million households. 
Private renting has been growing by 
17 ,500 households per month on 
average over the past decade (English 
Housing Survey 2014-15, February 2016).
Strong market conditions
Forecasts predict the PRS will continue 
to grow. PwC predicts an additional 
1.8 million UK households will rent 
by 2025, a 45% increase (PwC, UK 
Economic Outlook report, July 2015). 
Savills predicts an additional 1 million 
households in the PRS in the next five 
years (Savills, Rental Britain report, 
February 2016).
70% of individuals in the PRS are 
under age 45, compared with 25% 
in owner occupation. The proportion 
of individuals between ages 25 and 54 
who are privately renting has increased 
steadily over the last two decades, 
reflected in the term ‘Generation Rent’ 
(English Housing Survey).
The drivers behind the rental rise
There are two sets of drivers behind the 
rise in renting: 
1. Financial 
 Affordability challenges, lower levels 
of savings and high mortgage deposit 
requirements are some of the key 
drivers behind more people choosing 
to rent over owning, at least for a 
longer period of time. In particular 
the rising cost of buying and selling 
a home is making ownership less 
attractive, particularly for those 
who want the flexibility in their 
living arrangements.
2. Cultural and behavioural
 Lifestyle changes mean that an 
increasing number of people prefer 
the flexibility of renting for longer. 
Later family formation, greater job 
mobility, changing spending patterns

and preferences are all driving an 
increased demand for renting, due 
to its flexibility and reduced levels 
of commitment and liability. 
Research suggests that these two sets 
of drivers will continue to underpin 
increasing demand for rental housing. 
Britain needs to build more homes
Latest estimates suggest Britain requires 
an additional 300,000 new homes per 
year (House of Lords Economic Affairs 
Committee, ‘Building more homes’ 
report, July 2016). Last year only 
152,520 homes were built (DCLG).
It is widely accepted that more homes 
must be delivered in the UK. The 
Government recognises the need for 
increasing housing supply, while business 
surveys regularly cite housing amongst 
the top issues for the future success of 
the UK economy and its competitiveness.
This undersupply of housing has 
underpinned, and will continue 
to underpin, capital values and 
rental income.
Opportunity for large scale 
investors to gain market share
The UK rental housing market is 
dominated by small scale landlords. 
With less than ten properties each, 
they make up 98% of the entire PRS 
(DCLG, Landlord Survey).
Increasing demands for greater 
professionalism, improved standards, 
better service and better quality 
housing provide an opportunity for 
large scale investors such as ourselves.
There is a growing recognition among 
both consumers and politicians of the 
differentiation between large scale, 
institutional landlords and smaller 
scale, buy-to-let landlords.

Capital returns
The Directors have reviewed the use of KPIs to ensure that they are aligned to the business strategy. These measures are used 
by the Board and senior management to actively monitor business performance. The following KPIs capture Grainger’s strategy 
to maximise total returns and capital growth from its residential investments, with an increasing focus on growing the PRS 
business and investing £850m by 2020. 
The net asset metrics below measure the value of our residential assets and liabilities and capture the year-on-year capital growth. 
The loan to value (‘LTV’) reflects the capital structure of the business while cost of debt shows the cost effectiveness of our financing. 
Please refer to the Remuneration report 
for details on how our strategy and key 
financial metrics are linked to remuneration. 
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17
Strategic report Strategic report – Strategy in action
A clear and effective three 
pillar strategy:
1. Significantly grow net  
rental income
2. Simplify and focus the business
3. Build on our heritage by 
leveraging our regulated tenancy 
assets to grow our PRS business
Growing net rental income
Swift progress on our PRS 
investment pipeline
T o significantly grow net rental income, 
we are investing £850m into the PRS by 
2020. Coupled with our co-investment 
partners’ share, this totals £1. 1bn of 
investment by 2020. The resultant 
growth in net rental income will 
supplement the capital returns 
generated from our regulated tenancy 
portfolio and provide enhanced 
and balanced total returns to 
our Shareholders. 
This investment plan requires no 
additional capital raising. Our dividend 
policy is directly linked to net rental 
income for this investment period, 
and therefore will rise in line with our 
investments. Our 2020 objective is for 
net rental income to more than cover 
all operating costs and to exceed gross 
sales revenue from our regulated 
tenancy portfolio. 
We are focused on driving net rental 
yields and are taking significant  
strides in reducing operating costs, 
improving efficiency and creating 
greater scalability.
Growing rents
Inject pace and accelerate 
the acquisition of existing and 
newly built rental homes
“ Clippers Quay is a highly attractive 
place to invest, driven by its 
connectivity and proximity to 
Manchester and MediaCityUK.”
Helen Gordon, Chief Executive
18 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Net rental income up by
15% to  
£37.4m
Our 2020 targets
 Invest over £850m by 2020 in 
order to grow net rental income 
 More than half of our portfolio 
comprising PRS assets
 Reduced reliance on sales 
(cost coverage)
 Net rental income to exceed 
profit from sales
Achieving our targets
To achieve our goal of growing 
rents, we must be able to attract 
the best customers and keep 
them for the long-term. This 
will allow us to capture the 
best possible sustainable gross 
rental yield and maximise net 
rental yield. 
We believe that through smart 
investment, good design and 
scalable, customer focused 
operations, we can create more 
sustainable income through more 
efficient, durable buildings and 
happier customers that stay with 
us for longer.

Strategic report
19 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 We have streamlined our business. 
We are now solely a UK business, 
strategically focused on providing 
rental homes.
This year we sold our major non-core 
businesses, German and Equity Release.
We have refocused the operations of the 
business. Our development team is now 
focused solely on developing PRS assets 
(build-to-rent). We will no longer seek 
additional fund management mandates 
while our focus is on growing our own 
balance sheet and shareholder returns. 
We have significantly reduced operating 
costs. These costs, including overheads, 
are being reduced by 24% from £36. 1m 
in FY15 to £27 .5m for FY17 . We achieved 
this through a combination of the 
non-core disposals, restructuring 
and operational efficiency measures.
We have begun to reduce the cost 
of managing our assets, with the 
leakage ratio between gross to net 
yield improving from 30.7% to 28.0% 
in the year.

Our portfolio of regulated tenancies  
(£1.2bn, 3,652 homes) is predicted 
to generate over £100m of gross 
cash per annum for at least the next 
decade. This will provide a significant 
proportion of the capital to support 
our investment in PRS assets and 
grow rents.
The majority of cash flow from regulated 
tenancies is generated through sales of 
these properties as the regulated tenants 
vacate their homes and we sell the 
properties on vacancy. About 7% of the 
portfolio is vacated and sold each year.
These assets also generate a stable 
rental yield, which due to the nature of 
the assets is a very solid income stream. 
This is because it is linked to inflation 
and sees very limited levels of arrears.

The Executive Directors are directly 
responsible for people issues, including 
well-being and health & safety. The HR 
Director supports the Executive team 
on a day-to-day basis, and the Board 
receives a standing report on such 
issues at every meeting.
Investing in people to deliver 
strategic performance 
Providing our customers with a good 
home and ensuring that they are happy 
in their home through efficient and 
cost-effective operations is central 
to our business model. Our culture 
and values are about creating a work 
environment whereby staff are focused, 
aligned and working together towards 
these unifying objectives.
This year we restructured the business to 
align everyone’s role and remuneration 
directly to our strategy of delivering a 
balance of capital growth and income 
growth and driving operational efficiency. 
Strategic report – People, relationships and resources
Supporting long-term, sustainable performance 
through our people, relationships and resources
For 104 years Grainger has been 
renting out homes. The importance 
of providing shelter to our customers 
is always at the front of our minds 
and informs every action and decision 
we take. We recognise the weight of 
this responsibility.
Our Property team is responsible for 
delivering capital growth, while our 
Operations team is responsible for 
income growth. See the business model 
section of this report for further details.
Employee engagement has been a key 
focus of the leadership team over the 
course of the year, a period of challenges 
and change within the organisation, 
including internal restructuring and 
the sale of two business divisions.
We have a range of communication 
forums for employees to engage in 
which  occur at regular intervals. They 
are designed to encourage two-way 
communication across all levels within 
the business where we are all able to 
contribute towards Grainger’s strategic 
progress and improvement. Feedback 
from this year’s survey has resulted in a 
number of initiatives, such as the creation 
of new forums for communication.
Through an established set of bi-annual 
performance reviews, we help people 
grow and progress, including career 
planning and development discussions. 
Alongside performance, we monitor key 
metrics, such as turnover and sick days.
Our Share Incentive Plan and Save As You 
Earn Plan (with most employees taking 
advantage of at least one) align staff 
interest with the success of the business 
and our strategy.

A culture aligned to our strategy
Grainger’s success is predicated on 
more than just our property portfolio. 
Critical to our sustainable future are 
our people, our relationships with 
customers, partners and suppliers, 
and our impact on the world around 
us. Our investment in these areas is 
essential to the success of our business.
We are proud to be recognised as 
a responsible business, achieving 
FTSE4Good recognition, ‘Green Star’ 
ratings for both Grainger and GRIP 
REIT by the Global Real Estate 
Sustainability Benchmark (‘GRESB’) 
and a ‘Gold’ for EPRA’s Sustainability 
Best Practice Reporting.
The Board recognises the increasing 
significance of the culture of the business. 
The Board works with the Executives in 
setting the corporate culture and its 
values. As the business goes through a 
period of change, the role of culture in 
the business will be of further importance 
to ensure that Grainger’s values are 
aligned to the newly focused strategy 
and that good standards of behaviour are 
embedded and integrated across the 
Company. In addition, the Board will 
regularly review and monitor Grainger’s 
culture to ensure that it is reflective of the 
Company’s purpose and values.

Diversity
In order for Grainger to be the best 
provider of rental homes to the most 
number of customers, it is critical that 
we understand all our customers. It is 
essential for us to create an environment 
where we can share experiences and 
insights to understand our customer 
base and to make our business more 
resilient. Diversity in the business is 
a core component of this and we 
support diversity in the workplace.

Grainger is committed to protecting 
the health, safety and welfare of our 
employees and customers, and those 
affected by our business. Our culture 
supports a positive and proactive 
approach to health and safety which 
is designed to be both pre-emptive and 
proportionate. Through appropriate 
policies and procedures we ensure that 
we meet our obligations as a 
responsible business through 
influencing our supply chain to the 
greatest extent possible and ensuring 
that everyone in Grainger is responsible 
for health and safety and performing 
their activities in a safe manner. An 
example of this is the introduction 
of an integrated safety, health and 
environmental management system in 
Wellesley, which allows us to maintain 
and control standards across our supply 
chain on this large, diverse project.
Protecting human rights
Due to the nature of our business and 
our supply chain, we do not consider 
the risk of human rights abuses a 
material risk. Following the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015, we are undertaking 
an internal review of the requirements 
and implications for our business and 
within our supply chain. We will publish 
a Modern Slavery Act Transparency 
Statement as required in 2017 . 
Working with our partners 
and suppliers
The relationships we have with our 
partners and suppliers are fundamental 
to our business model. Our partners 
supplement and complement Grainger’s 
position and enable us to amplify our 
business activities, and they are an 
extension of our business. We therefore 
work very closely with them and ensure

We report on all EPRA Sustainability 
Performance Measures for all our property 
portfolios. Detailed tables that illustrate our 
performance in line with the EPRA Sustainability 
Best Practice Recommendations are available

that our contracts require them to 
uphold the high standards we set so 
that we deliver the products and 
services that our customers expect, 
and ensure that we make a positive 
impact, drive performance and 
manage risk accordingly. 
Working with our neighbours 
towards a better future
We believe that much of our success 
relies on the success of the communities 
and areas in which we operate.
We are therefore committed to 
working alongside our neighbours 
where we are either based or have 
significant investments. We do this 
through a number of ways, including 
everything from organising family fun 
days for residents through to supporting 
local community events and working 
closely with other stakeholders to 
positively influence the future. For 
instance, at our development at Young 
Street in Kensington, London, we are 
working with our building contractor, 
Ellmer, and have introduced a residents 
panel to provide an open forum for 
communication and engagement. At 
Wellesley we have a Residents T rust 
which consists of a board of residents 
who will make decisions about the 
future management of the estate 
and community.
Grainger is an active contributor to 
the UK housing debate and engages 
proactively with central and local 
government to positively influence 
policy to enable our sector to invest 
in more good-quality homes for rent.
Through charitable giving, both employer 
(£14,467) and employee-led (£29,280), we 
collectively gave £43,7 47 to both local and 
national charities, including our charity 
partner, LandAid, which is committed 
to ending youth homelessness by 2026. 
Through Grainger’s policy of providing 
a day’s paid leave for volunteering, 
employees provided 35 days for 
charitable causes this year.
Where we are developing new 
homes and neighbourhoods, we 
undertake and also support initiatives 
that underpin the future success of 
the area and community. 
Our business model enables us to offer 
a range of housing options, including 
those at a more affordable level for those 
on low incomes, while ensuring that each 
asset is still commercially viable.
Managing our impact on 
the environment
As both an owner and developer of 
property, we are mindful of our impact 
on the environment and our approach 
helps secure the future success of the 
business and protect the value of 
our investments. 
Creating new homes that are desirable but 
also resilient and sustainable is critical to 
protecting future value for Grainger and is 
central to the specifications and designs of 
our developments.
We actively monitor and take 
action to reduce our impact on the 
environment. Our policies, procedures, 
governance structure and decision 
making processes, such as our 
Environmental Management System and 
refurbishment programmes, are designed 
to take our environmental impact into 
account and reduce it wherever possible. 
Energy efficiency is a particular focus as 
we look to the introduction of Minimum 
Energy Efficiency Standards in 2018. This 
year, we achieved full EPC coverage on 
GRIP REIT’s portfolio and have developed 
a strategy to understand and manage 
the risk across our other portfolios, 
while at Wellesley, one of our major 
Strategic report – People, relationships and resources

of all waste is recycled back into 
the development.
Greenhouse gas emissions report
We are committed to measuring 
and reducing the carbon emissions 
associated with our property portfolios 
and our own operations. In accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Director’s Report) 
Regulations 2013, we report on all 
greenhouse gas emissions within our 
operational control (pages 87 and 88). We 
continued to improve our performance in 
the CDP Climate Change programme, 
achieving a ‘B’ score for 2016, reflecting 
our commitment to good environmental 
management and effective disclosure of 
our processes and procedures.
Adviser’s statement
Grainger has engaged Upstream 
Sustainability Services, JLL, as advisers 
on its sustainability strategy and 
implementation since 2005. Our 
programme of work includes assisting 
Grainger plc with setting sustainability 
targets and reviewing performance against 
these targets at year end. Due to JLL ’s 
long-standing relationship with Grainger 
plc, the review of target achievement and 
this statement itself cannot be considered 
entirely independent. 
JLL ’s observations and recommendations 
are based on analysis of documents, 
interviews and/or other secondary 
evidence provided by Grainger plc and 
relevant third parties. All reasonable 
efforts were made to check the quality, 
accuracy and credibility of the available 
information but this did not include 
site visits or audits on primary data 
(e.g. meter readings and invoices). 
Consequently, this statement does 
not represent formal assurance or 
verification of the sustainability 
content of Grainger plc’s 2016 
Annual Report and Accounts. 
Summary of target performance 
Grainger’s target performance 
must be placed in the context of the 
significant changes to the Company’s 
leadership and operations that have 
taken place over the past 12 months. 
Overall, Grainger achieved four of its 
seven new targets for 2016, and two 
out of the five targets that were 
carried over from 2015. 
Progress was made as Grainger 
continued to embed sustainability 
into its core processes and procedures, 
with successes this year including the 
creation of a green lease clause to be 
rolled out to commercial leases, the 
integration of sustainability into 
Grainger’s development specification 
and successful pilots of whole life 
costing and tenant focus groups.
A full review of Grainger’s operating 
model resulted in the decision to place 
two 2016 targets on hold. The remaining 
four targets that are in progress will be 
carried over for completion in 2017 . 
Observations and recommendations 
The significant organisation and 
strategic changes that have taken place 
during 2016 have meant that three of 
Grainger’s sustainability targets were 
either made redundant or had to be put 
on hold until the changes have been 
fully implemented. The organisational 
changes nonetheless provide Grainger 
with an opportunity to realign its 
sustainability strategy to reflect its new 
business model. It is an opportunity we 
encourage Grainger to capitalise on, and 
over the next year we recommend that 
the Company reviews its sustainability 
strategy to ensure that it continues to 
deliver value for its business. 
Key to this will be making sure that 
Grainger focuses on its most significant 
sustainability impacts in order to channel 
its resources most effectively. An updated 
materiality review, which the Company 
was not able to complete in 2016, will 
support this goal and strengthen the 
Company’s commitment to transparency 
(as evidenced by the welcome decision to 
align its 2016 sustainability reporting with 
the ‘Core’ in accordance with requirements 
of the recently published Global Reporting 
Initiative (‘GRI’) Standards). 
Grainger continues to perform strongly 
in relation to the real estate sector more 
broadly. Both Grainger plc and GRIP REIT 
(formerly GRIP Unit T rust) achieved 
‘Green Star’ status in the 2016 Global 
Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark 
(‘GRESB’) Assessment, and achieved four 
out of five stars in the new GRESB Rating. 
This places it in the top two quintiles for 
real estate companies globally based on 
its performance and disclosure. 
While Grainger has put on hold its 
target to study the impact on staff 
wellbeing of its offices, health and 
wellbeing is also an area where the 
Company deserves praise. Grainger was 
one of only 174 real estate organisations 
globally to complete the voluntary 
Health and Wellbeing module in the 
2016 GRESB Assessment. Its score of 
75% places it comfortably above the 
global average of 58% and reflects its 
sector-leading approach. We encourage 
Grainger to build on this strong start 
and investigate further the benefits to 
both tenants and Company that can 
be captured by integrating health and 
wellbeing into its sustainability strategy.

A strong and robust risk 
management framework
Strategic report – Risk management
To achieve our objective of being 
the UK’s leading PRS landlord we 
recognise that we must have a clear 
understanding of the risks we face, 
both those inherent in our strategy 
and operations and those posed by 
external conditions. Our systematic 
and robust approach aims to 
continuously monitor those risks, 
our risk management and internal 
controls systems and evolve our 
approach accordingly.
Risk management approach
Good risk management is fundamental 
to our ability to meet our operational 
and strategic objectives. The competitive 
market in which we operate requires 
effective decision making; ensuring 
that the risks the business takes are 
adequately assessed and challenged  
and appropriate returns are achieved.  
We must also retain our overall resilience 
to risks over which we have limited 
control through our disaster recovery  
and business continuity procedures.
During the reporting period we 
have endeavoured to embed our 
risk management approach in the 
restructured and simplified business 
following the strategic review in 
early 2016.
Our overall risk management ambition 
remains – to foster and embed a 
culture of risk management that is 
responsive, forward looking, 
consistent and accountable.
Robust risk assessment
Our systematic risk management 
approach is designed to identify risks 
to the business using both a bottom-
up and a top-down approach.
Once identified, the impact and 
probability of risks are determined 
and scored on both a Gross (before 
mitigation) and Net (after mitigation) 
basis. This allows the business to identify 
those risks which are heavily dependent 
on internal mitigating controls. When 
forming this assessment the business 
considers a range of risk categories, 
including strategic, market, financial, 
legal/regulatory, operational, IT, project 
and people risks. 
A risk scoring matrix is used to ensure 
that a consistent approach is taken 
when assessing the overall impact to 
the Group. Likelihood is based on the 
frequency of occurrence in a rolling 
12-month period for risks arising within 
operational areas. These risks, and their 
impact and likelihood scores, are 
documented in divisional, unit and 
project risk registers. The risk registers 
are reviewed at least quarterly, and 
more frequently as required, then 
collated into a Group top risk report 
for consideration by the Executive 
Committee and the Audit Committee.

Risk control framework and assurance
The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
Grainger’s risk management and internal 
control systems and for determining its 
risk appetite. The Board approves the 
risk management framework developed 
by the Executive Committee. This 
framework has been restructured during 
the course of the year to align itself with 
the reshaped business that has been 
adopted pursuant to the new PRS- 
focused strategy. This structure also 
complements Grainger’s evolution 
to a ‘three lines of defence’ model as 
discussed in the 2015 Annual Report. 
This included the introduction of 
various management committees in 
respect of key property, operational 
Risk control framework
and corporate functions. These 
management committees and 
the Executive Committee provide 
appropriate challenge and input to 
the identified risks, reported controls, 
mitigants and the Group top risk report. 
The Audit Committee supports the 
Board by monitoring and reviewing 
the control processes and mitigants 
in respect of the identified risks. It 
also ensures that the process for 
reconsidering the principal risks is 
carried out on an ongoing basis. The 
internal controls framework for these 
risks is monitored through the Internal 
Audit monitoring plan and the resulting 
audit outcomes. For more information 
on internal controls please refer to 
page 51.
Assurance on risk controls is currently 
provided by internal management 
information, internal audits, external 
audits and Board oversight. There 
is also an externally supported 
anonymous whistleblowing hotline 
that staff can utilise if other methods 
of notification are not suitable in the 
circumstances. In addition to embedding 
the revised risk management framework, 
in 2017 we plan to introduce a software 
solution which will improve efficiency 
and quality of risk reporting. The usage of 
this software will result in top or common 
risks being more visible when reported 
centrally and also assist in ensuring 
that focused and consistent controls 
are applied.

Impact on 
strategy
Risk appetite Mitigation
1. Market Weak macro-
economic conditions 
leading to long-term 
flat or negative 
house price inflation.
Economic uncertainty 
may cause drop in 
home ownership; 
asset values fall; 
subsequent 
investment 
constraints on 
delivery of PRS 
business model; 
covenant compliance 
risk; business 
unattractive 
to investors.
Grainger’s business 
is based on taking 
well-judged risks 
on house price and 
rental inflation.
 Wider market risk is largely 
dependent on factors we 
cannot influence
 Reducing reliance on trading 
income and house price inflation
 Maintenance of capacity against 
banking covenants
 High proportion of liquid assets 
to enable sales where necessary, 
as evidenced in last economic 
downturn
 Focus on PRS potentially 
leverages greater customer 
flexibility and lower overall 
financial commitment compared 
with home ownership which could 
be attractive for customers during 
uncertain economic periods
 Geographically diverse portfolio, 
exercising active asset 
management and implementing 
future strategic focus on 
economically active locations
2. Financial Lack of availability 
or volatile pricing in 
respect of debt or 
equity finance for the 
Group to achieve its 
strategic objectives; 
inability to obtain 
sufficient, diverse or 
appropriately priced 
funds to implement 
the current strategy.
Reduced or severely 
limited ability to 
take advantage 
of business 
opportunities; 
unable to grow

4. People Failure to attract, 
retain and develop 
our people to ensure 
that we have the right 
skills in the right place 
at the right time to 
deliver our strategy. 
This is an acute risk 
issue as there is 
currently a limited 
pool of individuals in 
the market with the 
relevant requisite skill 
set in acquiring and 
managing PRS assets. 
Reduced ability to 
deliver business plan 
and strategy; reduced 
control; inability to 
grow market share of 
PRS; failure to 
innovate and evolve 
to maintain 
competitiveness in 
a customer driven 
market.
We have no appetite 
to accept a lack of 
appropriate skills, 
expertise and 
experience that 
would materially 
diminish our ability to

compliance failings; 
reputational damage.
We accept that 
problems may occur

doing business. 
However, all such 
problems should be 
contained within an 
effective control 
framework and 
supporting culture. 
Our focus is on 
continuously 
improving this 
framework on a 
standard ‘three lines 
of defence’ model.
 Implementation of an operating 
model bespoke to the new 
strategy which includes a robust 
framework of controls, 
governance, processes and 
systems that are specifically 
designed to mitigate vulnerability

implement PRS 
strategy due to 
failure to transact 
and acquire assets 
on acceptable terms 
and/or inability to 
integrate PRS assets 
efficiently in the

Strategic report
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 33 The Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group, taking account 
of the Group’s current position and 
the potential impact of the principal 
risks documented in the Strategic 
report. Based on the assessment, 
the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the four year period to the end 
of 2020.
This assessment was made recognising 
the principal risks that could have an 
impact on the future performance 
of the Company (see pages 30 to 33). 
The business plan process incorporates 
planning for severe scenarios, with 
the amalgamation of multiple risks 
to assess impact and longer-term 
viability of the Company.
The Company has developed a 
business planning process, which is 
conducted annually and comprises 
of a five year strategic plan, a financial 
forecast for the current year and a 
financial projection for the next five 
years. The plan is reviewed each year 
by the Board as part of its budget 
and strategy review process. Once 
approved by the Board, the plan is 
cascaded down across the Company and 
provides a basis for setting all detailed 
financial budgets and strategic actions 
that are subsequently used by the Board 
to monitor performance and for the 
Remuneration Committee to set targets 
for the annual incentive.
Strategic report – Viability statement
The Group’s business model has 
proved to be strong and resilient 
throughout the different economic 
cycles even with higher levels of gearing 
and over the long term, with consistent 
demonstration through its ability to 
sell assets and let vacant properties to 
provide stable income returns and cash 
generation, throughout challenging 
market conditions. Currently the Group 
directly owns £1.7bn of residential 
property assets which are relatively 
liquid, as has been proved in the past. 
The Group would remain viable even in 
the event of very severe and sustained 
house price deflation as it would be able 
to accelerate the natural conversion 
of its assets to cash and reduce or 
suspend development and acquisition 
activity. Only an unprecedented and 
long-term lack of liquidity in UK 
residential property markets would 
cause any threat to the Group.
The Board has reviewed its strategic 
and financial plans in detail and believes 
that a viability assessment period to 
September 2020 is appropriate as any 
of the principal risks during this period 
could be managed. The financial plan 
budget has been stress tested against 
severe and prolonged reductions in 
house prices.
The financing risks of the Group are 
also considered to have an impact on 
the Group’s financial viability. The two 
principal financing risks for the Group are 
the Group’s ability to replace expiring 
debt facilities and adverse movements in 
interest rates. A substantial amount of 
the group’s debt facilities mature by 
2020. A Board approved funding strategy 
will address this as we put in place new 
facilities to align with the transition to 
PRS investment assets. The Group has 
currently secured funding to deliver the 
planned PRS pipeline and has prepared 
the strategic plan on a fully funded basis. 
In addition the Group manages its hedge 
exposure with interest rate swaps, caps 
and fixed rate facilities.
Based on the results of this analysis, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the four-year period of their 
detailed assessment.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 34 Strategic report – Financial review
Delivering performance as  
we reposition for growth
FY16 has been a transformational 
year, with significant progress made 
in delivering our private rented sector 
(‘PRS’) growth strategy. We have 
secured £389m of investment, disposed 
of our non-core businesses, improved 
the capital structure of the Company 
and reduced financial and operational 
costs following our internal 
restructuring which has enhanced 
Grainger’s income generation. 
Performance overview
These positive changes have been 
achieved alongside the delivery of strong 
financial results, with an improved 
income return and good capital growth: 
 Net rental income increased by 15% 
to £37 .4m (FY15: £32.4m);
 Adjusted earnings increased by 69% 
to £53.1m (FY15: £31.5m);
 EPRA NNNAV increased by 9% 
(24p per share) to 287p (FY15: 263p);
 Profit before tax up 64% to £84.2m 
(FY15: £51.4m);
 Net debt reduced by 33%, loan to 
value reduced to 35.9% (FY15: 45.5%), 
and cost of debt at the period end 
was down to 3.9% (FY15: 4.6%); and
 Total return (return on shareholder 
equity) of 10.6% (FY15: 10.0%).
Substantial progress has been made 
during the year to simplify and focus  
the business, which has delivered a 
significant reduction in finance and 
operational costs. We have completed 
our internal restructuring and are on 
track to deliver an £8.6m (24%) 
overhead saving in FY17 to £27 .5m from 
the FY15 reported result. 
The strategic disposals of our Equity 
Release and German businesses are 
key milestones, which have enabled a 
£374m reduction in net debt to £764m 
(FY15: £1, 138m) and, combined with 
financing activity, cost of debt is now 
below our 4% target.
With a strengthened balance sheet and 
loan to value (‘LTV’) of 35.9% (FY15: 
45.5%) we have the capacity to invest 
and grow our rental income. Coupled 
with reduced overhead and finance 
costs, this will further enhance Grainger’s 
income returns in FY17 and beyond.
A new dividend policy, aligned to our 
strategy to grow rental income, is now in 
place, with distribution during Grainger’s 
strategic transition to be equivalent to 
50% of net rental income. The total 
dividend for the year of 4.5p per share is 
64% up on the prior year (FY15: 2.75p).

Rental income
Gross rental income has increased by 11% to £51.9m (FY15: £46.7m), driven by 3.6% average rental growth on our PRS portfolio 
and the acquisition of tenanted rental homes that deliver immediate income. Net rental income has increased by 15% (£5.0m) 
to £37 .4m (FY15: £32.4m) further benefiting from improvements made in operational efficiencies.

Sales
Profit from sales at £71.5m for the 12 months to 30 September 2016 was slightly ahead of the prior year (FY15: £70.6m) with 
increased profits from development activities more than offsetting a small reduction in residential sales profit, which is linked  
to the natural unwind of our regulated tenancy portfolio.
Over the year, sales on vacancy achieved average prices 8.6% over the September 2015 vacant possession value, illustrating 
the resilience of our valuations and liquidity of our assets. 
Residential sales on vacancy generated revenue of £110.0m which was 11% ahead of 2015 (FY15: £99.5m) with profit marginally 
lower at £52.2m (FY15: £53.2m). The predominant driver of the revenue growth related to the Chelsea Houses portfolio, 
although this reduced the overall margin to 47 .4% (FY15: 53.5%). We expect margins from this portfolio to improve over time 
from reversionary gains, refurbishment and further asset management activities.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 36 Development sales activity delivered £11.8m of profit primarily driven by the final phase of Macaulay Walk, a residential

Kennel Farm, Basingstoke (£5.8m).
In addition, we recorded revenue of £24. 1m on our PRS development for The Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea (RBKC).

Operating expenses
The overhead cost for this year was £31.8m for continuing operations (FY15: £32.4m). We are on track to achieve our FY17 
overhead cost target of £27 .5m, which is 24% (£8.6m) lower than the reported FY15 overhead of £36. 1m (before restatement for 
discontinued operations). This has been achieved through restructuring savings, corporate overhead reductions and lower costs 
following the disposal of non-core businesses. 
Other expenses relate to pre-contract transaction costs. Through improved acquisition targeting and effective cost 
management, our other expenses have reduced to £1. 1m (FY15: £3.2m). 
Fee income is associated with the recovery of overheads. Overall operating expenses net of fee income which is associated with 
the overhead cost totalled £27.0m as set out in the table below (FY15: £30.6m).

Net debt has reduced by 33% to £764m (FY15: £1, 138m), LTV is down to 35.9% (FY15: 45.5%) and cost of debt is now below our 
4% target, ahead of plan. 
The reduction in net debt was driven by the non-core disposals and supplemented by resilient cash generation from sales of 
vacant regulated tenancies; this more than offset £162m of new investment predominantly in PRS assets. Cost of debt 
benefited from the non-core disposals and refinancing activities.
Our strengthened balance sheet provides capacity for our planned PRS investment. As funds are deployed our optimal target 
range for LTV is 40-45%.

In the second half of the year, immediately following the EU Referendum we took the opportunity to recoupon two legacy 
swaps, securing lower rates at a discount to market value. The upfront cost (before tax savings) was £37 .8m (£30.2m after tax) 
and the benefit to cost of debt is c.55bps (£4.8m saving per annum). 
Net finance costs for the year are £11.8m lower, a 24% reduction, at £37 . 1m (FY15: £48.9m). Average cost of debt over the year 
was 4.4%, a 90bps improvement, while cost of debt at the period end was 3.9%.
Subsequent to the year end, we have refinanced a £100m loan which is expected to reduce the average cost of debt by a 
further c.20bps in 2017 (3.7% proforma). With our incremental cost of debt less than 2%, we have the potential to prudently 
utilise leverage to deliver strong earnings accretion as we invest.

We have delivered adjusted earnings (previously referred to as recurring profit) of £53. 1m which is 69% ahead of the prior year

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 38 Tax
Grainger is a UK based, taxpaying Group with a tax charge of £9.7m for the year from continuing operations. 
Grainger works in an open and transparent manner with the tax authorities. HM Revenue & Customs has graded the Group  
as a ‘low risk’ taxpayer. We are committed to maintaining this status.
Discontinued operations
The disposal of our non-core Equity Release and German businesses were accretive to EPRA NNNAV, adding £23m, 6p per 
share. These delivered a discontinued profit before tax of £62.0m: £48.3m from the Equity Release disposal, £8.3m from the 
sale of the German operations and £5.4m from pre-disposal trading. 
Dividend
The Board revised and implemented a new dividend policy in the year, which is supported by strong underlying cash generation 
to enhance distribution returns to shareholders during Grainger’s strategic transition, with payment aligned to the group’s 
strategy of growing rental income. 
The policy is to distribute the equivalent to 50% of annual net rental income. Around one-third of the payment will be made 
through the interim dividend based on half year results, with the balance paid through the final dividend. As the shape of  
the business evolves to a more balanced total return model, we are committed to delivering progressive and sustainable 
dividend returns. 
The dividend payment for the year will be £18.7m, 50% of the £37 .4m net rental income reported. This delivers 64% growth 
in the total dividend for the year to 4.5p per share, comprising 1.45p interim dividend and 3.05p proposed final dividend. 
The dividend is 4.0x covered by diluted EPS. 
If approved at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 10 February 2017 to Shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 30 December 2016.

Strategic report
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 39 EPRA NNNAV is an important metric for Grainger as it reflects overall assets and liabilities (including deferred and contingent 
tax and fair value adjustments for fixed rate debt). These future liabilities are presented in current terms (not discounted) and 
neither EPRA NNNAV or EPRA NAV include the future benefit of the reversionary surplus, which as at 30 September 2016 was 
valued at £327m, or 78p per share.
EPRA NNNAV increased by 9% (24p per share) to 287p (FY15: 263p), supported by a strong trading performance, valuation 
growth, accretive strategic disposals and reduced deferred and contingent tax liabilities associated with lower corporation tax 
rates. This growth was achieved despite the negative impact from movements in bond markets which resulted in an adverse 
movement of £16m (4p per share) from the mark to market of fixed rate debt.
EPRA NAV increased by 7% to 341p, reflecting a strong trading and valuation performance, before the adjustment for 
discontinued operations and the recoupon of legacy swaps. 3% growth (11p per share to 330p (FY15: 319p)) is reported after 
these adjustments. The Equity Release disposal was accretive to EPRA NNNAV but dilutive to EPRA NAV by £15m (4p per 
share). The recoupon of two legacy swaps after tax had an adverse impact of £30m (7p per share) on EPRA NAV.

Strategy financial targets to 2020
The three strands of the 2020 strategy are to: 
1)  grow rents (and increase distributions to shareholders);
2) simplify and focus; and 
3) build on our heritage as the UK’s leading listed residential landlord. 
The four financial benchmarks used to monitor progress against our strategy are:
1) Invest over £850m into PRS assets by 2020
 £389m secured, £347m in planning or legal process.
2) More than half of our portfolio comprising PRS assets
 27% of PRS assets (FY15: 23%).
 We expect to see an acceleration towards 2020 as assets being constructed are completed and let. 
3) Net rental income to exceed profit from sales
 FY16 net rental income was the equivalent to 52% of profit from sales (FY15: 44%).
 Sales profit will benefit from development activity over the next two to three years as we work through current schemes 
and projects. Net rental income growth should accelerate towards the end of the strategy period as assets being 
constructed are completed and let out. 
4) Reducing reliance on sales (cost coverage)
 FY16 income covered 74% of costs (FY15: 53%).
 This benchmark was designed to reflect the transition to an increasingly income focused model with reduced reliance on 
capital growth and profit from sales. Substantial progress has been made in FY16. Reduced finance costs and lower 
overheads have been the key drivers. Rental growth and tightly controlled overheads and finance costs are expected to 
deliver further benefits. 
Conclusion
This year’s results demonstrate that the Company is performing strongly in conjunction with delivering against its strategic 
objectives as set out in January. 
It has been a year of significant change and progress, with £389m of investment secured, the disposal of two major non-core 
businesses, an improved capital structure, materially reduced finance costs and restructured operations which will deliver 
further efficiencies in FY17 . Alongside these changes, the Company has delivered a 69% increase in adjusted earnings to £53. 1m 
and a total return (return on shareholder equity) of 10.6%. The actions we are taking to make Grainger a more balanced total 
return business with an increased focus on income returns will support further strategic progress in the coming years.
Our 2016 Strategic report, from pages 1 to 42, has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on 1 December 2016.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 42 Shareholder engagement
The Board regards strong engagement 
with stakeholders and investors as 
fundamental to maintaining an active 
ongoing dialogue with them and to 
understand their views. 
Helen Gordon and Vanessa Simms had 
regular meetings with the Company’s 
Shareholders and analysts, while I have 
met with both fund managers and 
corporate governance officers of our 
major Shareholders throughout the 
year. Further meetings will also be 
held in advance of the AGM in 
February 2017. 
How the Board supports strategy
The Board spent a significant portion 
of its time during the year working 
together to develop the PRS strategy. 
On leading this year’s Board evaluation 
it was clear to me that the Directors 
felt that this strategic review was 
carried out in a highly effective and 
collaborative way with appropriate 
challenge throughout.

Board Activity see page 48.
Baroness Margaret Ford 
Chairman 
1 December 2016
The Directors are committed 
to applying effective corporate 
governance and promoting the 
highest standards. I am therefore 
pleased to introduce this year’s 
corporate governance report.
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (the ‘Code’)

Details of the Directors are set out 
below, together with a summary of their 
experience, competences and skills.
Diversity
Grainger believes that a diverse 
culture and perspective is a key factor 
in driving its success, and supports 
the Davies Report’s aspiration to 
promote greater female representation 
on listed company boards. Whilst all 
appointments are made on merit, an 
example of our commitment to diversity 
is that the Company currently has a 
female Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director, Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer. 
We will continue to look to follow the 
procedures recommended by Lord 
Davies and by the Code to maintain a 
balanced and diverse Board. However, 
diversity is much wider than gender. 
Diversity of thought is also hugely 
important amongst the Board. By 
bringing together Non-Executive 
Directors with diverse backgrounds 
and experience, we gain enormously 
from varied perspectives across a range 
of issues. The Nominations Committee 
report contains further details of 
diversity in our business. 
Board evaluation
This year the Company Secretary and 
I have led the evaluation of the Board. 
In addition, I have reflected on the 
recommendations and action points 
from last year and the areas to focus 
on for next year. Further details are 
set out below.

The Board
The Board is responsible to the

The role of the Board
The Board provides leadership of 
the Group and, either directly or 
through the operation of committees 
of Directors and delegated authority, 
applies independent judgement on 
matters of strategy, performance, 
resources (including key appointments) 
the overall approach to risk mnagement 
and internal control, culture and 
standards of behaviour. 
The Board sets the Group’s strategic

of matters reserved to the Board is 
reviewed and approved annually by

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 46 The Executive Committee is supported 
by sub-committees each focusing on an 
area of the business. The key objectives 
of these sub-committees are to ensure: 
 the delivery of the strategic plan;
 that all business functions and 
operations provide a competitive 
advantage to the Company; and 
 effective oversight of the systems 
and controls in order to manage risk. 
Chairman and Chief Executive
The posts of Chairman and Chief 
Executive are separate and their 
roles and responsibilities are clearly 
established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. The Chairman 
is responsible for running the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness. The Chief 
Executive reports to the Chairman, as 
does the Company Secretary on matters 
of corporate governance. The Chairman 
is the guardian of the Board’s decision 
making and is responsible for ensuring 
a constructive relationship between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
and for fostering an open culture where 
debate is an appropriate balance of 
robust challenge and support.
The Chief Executive is responsible for 
running the business and implementing 
the Board’s decisions. She chairs a regular 
meeting with the other Executive 
Directors and the additional members 
of the Executive Committee. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are 
responsible for bringing independent 
and objective judgement and scrutiny 
to all matters before the Board and its 
Committees, using their substantial and 
wide-ranging skills, competencies and 
experience. The key responsibilities of 
Non-Executive Directors are set out in 
their letters of appointment and include 
requirements to:
 challenge and contribute to  
the development of the  
Company’s strategy;
 scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed 
goals and objectives and monitor 
the reporting of performance; and
 to satisfy themselves that financial 
information is accurate and that 
financial controls and systems 
of risk management are robust 
and defensible.
A copy of the standard letter of 
appointment for a Non-Executive 
Director is available from the Company 
Secretary on request. The Non-
Executive Directors meet periodically 
without the Executive Directors present. 
There have been three such meetings 
since 1 October 2015 and an additional 
meeting of the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Chairman or the Executive 
Directors present where the Chairman’s 
performance was discussed.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director 
is available to Shareholders if they 
request a meeting or have concerns, 
where contact through the normal 
channels has failed to resolve the issue 
or where such contact is inappropriate. 
No such requests were received from 
Shareholders during the year. The Senior 
Independent Director leads the annual 
performance review of the Chairman.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 47 Following feedback from the Directors in 
the 2015 Board evaluation, the standard 
Board schedule increased the number 
of formal meetings throughout the year 
from six to seven, with the additional 
meeting being focused on strategic 
matters. These meetings were duly 
held together with a further meeting to 
discuss the role of the regulated tenancy 
portfolio in relation to the strategic 
business plan. The Board also spent a day 
Governance – Effectiveness
visiting a number of Grainger properties 
and sites in London. 
The Board has a list of matters 
reserved to it and a rolling annual plan 
of items for discussion, agreed between 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive. 
The list of reserved matters and annual 
plan are reviewed regularly to ensure 
that all matters reserved to the Board, 
as well as other key issues, are discussed 
at the appropriate time. At each Board 
meeting the Chief Executive provided a 
review of the business setting out how it 
was performing and details of strategic 
issues arising.

examples of the range of subjects that 
were debated and considered by the

Board Committees
The Board has established three 
principal Board Committees to 
which it has delegated certain of its 
responsibilities. They are the Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and Nominations Committee. The roles, 
membership and activities of these 
Committees are described in more 
detail later in the Corporate 
Governance Statement.
Information flow
The Chairman, together with the 
Company Secretary, ensures that the 
Directors receive clear information on 
all relevant matters in a timely manner. 
Board papers are circulated sufficiently 
in advance of meetings for them to be 
thoroughly digested to ensure informed 
debate. The Board papers contain the 
Chief Executive’s written report, 
high-level papers on each business area, 
key metrics and specific papers relating 
to agenda items. The Board papers 
are accompanied by a management 
information pack containing detailed 
financial and other supporting 
information. The Board also received 
presentations from various business 
units, including Human Resources, 
Legal, Risk and Governance, IT and 
Health & Safety.
Time commitment
The Board, supported by the Nominations 
Committee, carefully considered the 
external commitments of the Chairman 
and each of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board is satisfied that each such 
Director committed sufficient time during 
the year to enable them to fulfil their 
duties as Directors of the Company and 
has capacity to continue to do so. None 
of the Non-Executive Directors has 
any conflict of interest that has not been 
disclosed to the Board in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association.
Access to independent advice
All Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary who ensures that Board 
processes are followed and high 
corporate governance standards are 
maintained. Any Director who considers 
it necessary or appropriate may take 
independent, professional advice at 
the Company’s expense. None of the 
Directors sought such advice in the 
current year.
Induction and professional 
development
The Chairman, supported by the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for 
ensuring that a comprehensive and 
tailored induction to the Company is 
provided to each Director. This was duly 
carried out in relation to Helen Gordon, 
Rob Wilkinson and Vanessa Simms who 
joined the Board during the course of 
the year. 
Each new Director met with the 
Company Secretary in the year and 
discussed their particular induction and 
training requirements. This covered 
matters such as Directors’ duties, 
corporate governance, share dealing 
and the use of the Company’s electronic 
Board portal. 
In the case of Rob Wilkinson, to give 
him an insight into the Group, he met 
with Executive Directors and senior 
managers from across the property, 
operational and central functions of 
the business. Rob also met with key 
third-party relationships such as the 
external auditor and principal 
corporate lawyers. 
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 49 In addition, Rob visited Grainger’s 
Abbeville development to view 
Grainger’s purpose built PRS units. 
As Executive Directors, Helen’s and 
Vanessa’s inductions adopted a different 
emphasis and focused on familiarising 
them with the business, its staff, 
operations and core processes. Having 
this understanding of the business at the 
commencement of their employment 
was fundamental in order to identify the 
strategic change that was required and 
the consequential reshaping of the 
Group’s operating model. 
Training and updating in relation to a 
range of matters is provided to Board 
members throughout the year. Subjects 
include the business of the Group, legal 
and regulatory responsibilities of the 
Company and changes to accounting 
requirements. This training and 
updating is delivered by a combination 
of presentations by Grainger senior 
management and external advisers 
and by circulation of appropriate Board 
papers and briefing materials. Individual 
Directors are also expected to take 
responsibility for identifying their own 
training needs and to ensure that they 
are adequately informed about the 
Group and their responsibilities as 
a Director.
Governance – Effectiveness
continued
The Board is confident that all 
its members have the knowledge, 
ability and experience to perform 
the functions required of a Director 
of a listed company.
Performance evaluation
The annual evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees for 2016 was led 
by the Chairman and the Company 
Secretary through completion of a 
detailed questionnaire relating to the 
effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees and thereafter individual 
meetings with each of the Directors. 
The Company Secretary collated the 
results of the questionnaire and these 
were considered by the Chairman and 
reported to the Board as a whole. 
The overall results were positive and 
indicated that the Board, its Committees 
and individual Directors were all 
operating effectively and demonstrated 
a commitment to the role. A selection 
of the key findings arising from the 
evaluation are summarised as follows:
 Board meetings are conducted in an 
effective manner which encourages 
open discussions, with appropriate 
time allocated to key issues and 
strategy in particular. 
 Committees are performing to a 
high standard.
 Whilst there is always room for 
improvement, good progress on the 
quality of Board information has been 
made, which strikes an appropriate 
balance between being concise and 
having sufficient detail.
 Input from each of the Directors 
during this year of strategic change 
was effective and constructive.
 Further improvements can be made in 
relation to the structure and approach 
of Non-Executive Director training 
 and development. The Chairman, 
Company Secretary and Human 
Resources Director will consider 
this feedback accordingly and make 
proposals to the Board to seek to 
improve this area.
The review of the Chairman’s 
performance, which was led by 
Belinda Richards as Senior Independent 
Director, concluded that the Chairman’s 
leadership and performance were 
effective and of a high standard. 
The Board and its Committees will 
monitor progress and continue their 
critical review of its effectiveness during 
the year ahead. In accordance with the 
prevailing provisions of the Code, it is the 
current intention of the Board that the 
next external facilitation of the Board 
evaluation will be carried out in 2017 , 
being three years since the previous 
external evaluation.
Re-election of Directors
We continue to adopt the 
recommendations of the Code that 
all of the Directors offer themselves for 
re-election annually, notwithstanding 
that the Company’s Articles of 
Association require the Directors to offer 
themselves for re-election every three 
years. Therefore, in accordance with the 
Code all current Directors, with the 
exception of Vanessa Simms, will stand 
for re-election at the 2017 AGM. As it 
will be Vanessa’s first AGM as a Director 
of the Company, she will be subject 
to election by the Shareholders at the 
2017 AGM.
In light of the performance evaluation 
summarised above and the provisions 
of the Company’s Articles of Association, 
the Board recommends that all of those 
Directors proposed for election and 
re-election are so elected and re-elected 
(as applicable).

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 50 Internal control
The Board is responsible for reviewing 
and approving the Group’s system of 
internal control and its adequacy and 
effectiveness. The Group has a cyclical 
process for identifying, assessing and 
managing its significant risks, which has 
been in place for the full year under 
review and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The process is designed to enable the 
Board to be confident that such risks 
are mitigated or controlled as far as 
possible. It should be noted, however, 
that no system can eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
entirely and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The Audit Committee is delegated the 
task of reviewing all identified risks, with 
the ultimate key risks retained for full 
Board review. The Audit Committee 
reports to the Board at every Board 
meeting subsequent to a meeting  
of that Committee. Risks and controls  
are reviewed to ensure effective 
management of appropriate strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance 
issues. The Audit Committee also reviews 
the half year and full year financial 
statements. In addition, the Group 
outsources its Internal Audit function 
which performs relevant reviews as part 
of a programme approved by the Audit 
Committee. The Committee considers 
any issues or risks arising from an Internal 
Audit review, so that appropriate actions 
are undertaken to ensure satisfactory 
resolution. Internal Audit has a direct 
reporting line to the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. 
A detailed annual budget is produced 
each year, together with longer-term 
projections in accordance with the agreed 
strategy, which are presented to the 
Board for consideration and approval. 
A fundamental part of the control 
process is the diligent monitoring of 
actual performance against this budget 
by the Board. Where applicable, revisions 
are made to expected out-turn against 
which further progress can be monitored. 
A detailed monthly management 
information pack is prepared, which 
covers each major area of the business 
and includes detailed consolidated results 
and financial information for the business 
as a whole. The performance of each 
business area is reviewed monthly by 
both divisional management and the 
Executive Committee and is 
subsequently reported to the Board.
The Board also discusses in detail the 
projected financial impact of major 
proposed acquisitions and disposals, 
including their financing. All such 
proposed substantial investments are 
initially considered by the Investment 
Committee which comprises all the 
Executive Committee and certain senior 
managers. The Board is also responsible 
for reviewing and approving the Group’s 
treasury strategy, including mitigation 
against changes in interest rates. The 
Group’s processes for internal control 
have been in place throughout the year 
and have sought to implement the FRC 
Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. Further details are 
contained in the Audit Committee report.
The Board regularly reviews the 
Group’s processes for internal control 
and conducts a formal annual review 
of these processes and the risks relating 
to the business. No significant failings 
or weaknesses were identified from 
this review in the year.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 52 The Board of Grainger believes 
that understanding the views of 
its Shareholders is a fundamental 
principle of good corporate governance; 
therefore strong engagement with 
stakeholders and investors is key to 
achieving this and progressing the 
business and its strategy.
The framework of investor 
relations is set around the financial 
reporting calendar, with additional 
engagement taking place throughout 
the year when regarded beneficial to the 
Company. Grainger has held more than 
100 meetings with Shareholders, 
analysts and potential investors in the 
year, in addition to the usual half-yearly 
results announcements and briefings. 
Helen Gordon and Vanessa Simms 
have held the vast majority of these 
meetings and manage the Group’s 
investor relations programme with 
the Director of Corporate Affairs. 
Feedback is always sought following 
such meetings, which is then presented 
to the Board. In addition, the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary also met 
with a combination of fund managers 
and corporate governance officers 
of the Company’s major Shareholders 
in advance of the 2016 AGM. It is 
anticipated that a similar pre-AGM 
engagement process will take place 
in advance of the 2017 AGM.

available for download and similar 
materials. All the Directors, standing 
for election or re-election (as applicable), 
intend to be in attendance at the 2017 
AGM and to be available to answer 
questions. All Shareholders have the 
opportunity to attend the AGM, which 
continues as a route for communication 
with smaller and private Shareholders.
The notice of meeting and Annual 
Report and Accounts are sent out 
at least 20 working days before the 
meeting. Separate votes are held for 
each proposed resolution. A proxy count 
is given in each case after the voting on 
a show of hands. Grainger includes, as 
standard, a ‘vote withheld’ category, 
in line with best practice.
Shareholders are also able to lodge 
their votes through the CREST system.
Examples of the issues raised as part of the corporate governance shareholder engagement programme include:
Grainger’s strategic review and focus on PRS The impact of legislative change and Brexit
The Company’s capital structure, 
in particular discussion of share buy-backs
Director succession, in particular in respect  
of new CEO and CFO appointments
Optimal overall debt levels and cost of debt
Remuneration policy proposals  
and alignment to strategy
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 53 The Audit Committee currently 
comprises four independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
Dear Shareholder
This is my first year of chairing 
Grainger’s Audit Committee. In that 
time, we have refined the process of 
governance having regard to the change 
in committee structure since 2015, 
and reviewed the work-streams for 
consideration by the Committee. In 
particular, during this year of strategic 
change, the Audit Committee has 
carefully considered the risk 
management framework designed 
by the Executive and the processes in 
connection with internal controls that 
were applied during the year under 
review and going forward. Details  
of this framework and Grainger’s  
risk appetite are contained on pages  
30 to 33.
As a matter of course the Committee 
considers its terms of reference each 
year, taking into account changes to 
Grainger and to external governance 
requirements. In addition, we develop 
a clear work plan through the year to 
ensure that we fulfil all our 
responsibilities. At the core of those 
responsibilities is ensuring that the 
Company is operating an effective risk 
assessment and management process 
and that an appropriate control 
framework is in place. We are helped by 
the Internal Audit team at Deloitte LLP 
(‘Deloitte’) which reports directly to the 
Committee and which works against 
an agreed plan to ensure that controls 
are effective.
One of the Committee’s other key 
responsibilities is ensuring that the 
Group’s published accounts have integrity 
and are consistent with accounting 
and governance requirements. In 
achieving this we have given particular 
consideration to the viability statement 
having regard to the new strategic focus 
of Grainger. This included interrogating 
the financial models and related 
sensitivity analysys of various economic 
scenarios. In addition, we have 
concentrated on the fair, balanced and 
understandable requirements for the 
Annual Report. In this regard we are 
helped by receiving a number of 
appropriate papers from the Chief 
Financial Officer and her team and  
by the independent work of our internal 
and external auditors.
We respond to developments during 
the year as required, focusing on key 
matters which arise in addition to our 
planned work programme. This year, 
the sale of the German and Retirement 
Solutions businesses were key events. 
We have concentrated on appropriate 
accounting for these disposals and the 
risk and control environment as the 
Company restructured in order to 
implement its PRS strategy.
As part of the FRC’s work programme 
we were fortunate to receive a report 
on the quality of the external audit 
carried out by KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) 
of our prior year accounts, it being 
the first audit carried out by KPMG 
since its appointment following 
successful tender in 2014. We found 
this independent input both helpful 
and reassuring.
The regular challenge and engagement 
with management, the external auditor 
and the internal audit team, together 
with the timely receipt of high-quality 
reports and information from them, has 
enabled the Committee to discharge its 
duties and responsibilities efficiently.
I would like to record my thanks for the 
support of the other members of the 
Committee, to Grainger’s Finance team, 
to Deloitte and to KPMG for their 
thorough approach.

Governance – Audit Committee report
Audit Committee report
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 54 Significant matters relating to the Group’s 2016 financial statements
The most significant matters considered by the Committee and discussed with the external auditor in relation to the Group’s 
2016 financial statements were as follows:
1 
Property valuations We received reports from management on the assumptions 
to be used in valuing the Group’s property assets. In considering 
the proposals we met with external valuers. We reviewed the valuations 
and, in the case of reversionary assets, the suggested discount rates 
provided. We also confirmed that the external valuers were sufficiently 
independent from the Group. Management’s recommendations in relation 
to the Directors’ valuations were scrutinised against external evidence 
and the verification work completed by the external valuers. We were 
content, after due challenge and debate, with the assumptions and 
judgements applied.
2 
Exceptional and  
non-recurring items
The Committee considered management’s accounting proposals 
in respect of:
 the costs and profits of the disposals during the year of Grainger’s 
Retirement Solutions and German businesses, and the classification 
of these divisions as being held-for-sale and presented as discontinued 
operations; and 
 the costs being incurred in connection with the restructuring of the 
business in order to implement the PRS focused strategy.
The Committee concurred with the accounting treatment of such matters.
3 
 
Accounting for unusual contracts The Committee reviewed management’s proposal for accounting for the 
Company’s contractual arrangements with the Royal Borough of 
Kensington and Chelsea in respect of the various sites located around the 
borough. The contract will be accounted for as a cost plus contract in line 
with International Accounting Standard (‘IAS’) 11 Construction Contracts. 
In line with the provisions of this standard, revenue will be recognised as it 
is earned through the duration of the contract. Profits will be recognised 
to the extent that recoverability is considered probable. The Committee 
concurred with the accounting treatment for this arrangement.
4 
Fraud risk from revenue 
recognition and management  
override of controls
In respect of the presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition by 
overstatement and management override of controls, the Committee 
considered the presumed risk of fraud as defined by auditing standards 
and was content that there were no issues arising.
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 55 Fair, balanced and understandable 
The Committee has undertaken a 
detailed review in assessing whether 
the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 
is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and whether it provides the necessary 
information to Shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. The Committee 
reviewed and made suggestions to the 
processes put in place by management 
to provide the necessary assurance 
that appropriate disclosures are 
made. The Committee considered 
management’s assessment of items 
included in the financial statements 
and the prominence given to those 
items. This review process also included 
receiving a near final draft of the Annual 
Report in advance of the November 
2016 Committee meeting. This was 
accompanied by a reminder of the areas 
the Committee should focus on having 
regard to the Audit Committee Institute 
guidance in this respect, and how such 
guidance can be applied to the draft 
Annual Report. The Committee, and 
subsequently the Board, were both 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 2016 
Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable. 
Going concern
The Committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of adopting the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the full year financial statements and 
assessed whether the business was 
viable in accordance with the new 
requirement of the Code. The 
assessment included a review of the 
principal risks facing the Group, their 
financial impact and how they were 
being managed, together with a 
discussion as to the appropriate period 
for assessment. The Group’s viability 
statement is on page 34.
Invitations to attend meetings
A standing invitation has been made by 
the Committee to the Chairman of the 
Board and the Executive Directors to 
attend the Committee’s meetings. 
Senior management from Grainger’s 
Finance team and representatives of 
the internal and external auditors attend 
all meetings at the invitation of the 
Committee. During the year the external 
and internal auditors attended all 
meetings and also met privately with 
the Committee.
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s role and 
responsibilities are concerned with 
financial reporting, narrative reporting, 
whistleblowing and fraud, internal 
controls and risk management systems, 
internal audit and external audit. 
Terms of reference 
The Committee has documented terms 
of reference which are approved by the 
Board. They are reviewed at least 
annually and were last reviewed at the 
Committee’s meeting in March 2016. 
The Committee’s terms of reference 
comply with the Code and can be 
found on the Group’s website.

Objectives 
The Board has delegated authority to 
the Committee to oversee and review 
the Group’s financial reporting process, 
system of internal control and 
management of business risks, the 
internal audit process, the external audit 
process and relationship with the 
external auditor, and the Company’s 
process for monitoring compliance with 
applicable laws and external regulations. 
Final responsibility for financial 
reporting, compliance with laws and 
regulations and risk management rests 
with the Board, to which the Committee 
regularly reports back.
Meetings
The Committee’s core work is driven 
by a structured programme of activity 
settled at the start of the year between 
the Committee Chairman, management 
and the external auditor. As well as its 
core work, the Committee undertakes 
additional work in response to the 
evolving audit landscape. The following 
non-exhaustive list provides highlights 
of the Committee’s core and additional

Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 57 External auditor objectivity 
and independence
The objectivity and independence of 
the external auditor are critical to the 
integrity of the Group’s audit. During 
the year the Committee reviewed 
the external auditor’s own policies 
and procedures for safeguarding its 
objectivity and independence. There are 
no contractual restrictions on the Group 
with regard to the external auditor’s 
appointment. The audit engagement 
partner provided his annual 
representation to the Committee as  
to the external auditor’s independence 
and confirmed that KPMG’s reward and 
remuneration structure includes no 
incentives for him to cross sell non-audit 
services to audit clients. KPMG duly 
applies the requirement to rotate audit 
partners every five years and therefore 
such rotation will be due in respect of 
the 2020 audit. 
The Committee’s assessment of KPMG’s 
independence is underpinned by the 
Group’s policy on the use of KPMG for 
the provision of non-audit services.  
This policy was reviewed during the year, 
having particular regard to the impact 
of the recent introduction of new audit 
regulations. The policy contains a 
presumption against the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit services. 
KPMG may only be engaged for the 
provision of non-audit services in 
contravention of that presumption 
where those services are expressly 
permitted under the policy and where 
it is demonstrable that the external 
auditor is best suited to undertake 
the services. The policy includes the 
requirement that non-audit services 
must not be carried out by the external 
auditor unless prior approval of the 
Audit Committee Chairman has  
been obtained.
Services which the external auditor is 
prohibited from providing to the Group 
include, amongst others:
 Bookkeeping services and 
preparation of financial information
 The design, supply or implementation 
of financial information systems
 Appraisal or valuation services
 Internal audit services
 Actuarial services
Fees paid to KPMG during the year are 
set out in the table below:
Schedule of fees
Year ended  
30 September 
2016
Statutory audit of 
Grainger Group
210,000
New UK GAAP 
conversion work
32,000
Total audit fees 242,000
Half year review 30,000

11,500
German tax advisory 
services
48,000
Luxembourg tax 
compliance services
4,000
Work relating to disposal 
of retirement solutions
27,000
Total non-audit fees 120,500
In addition, a further £8,000 for 
audit services was billed by KPMG 
to Walworth Investment Properties 
Limited, the joint venture in which 
Grainger has a 50% shareholding.
The Committee was satisfied that 
the overall levels of audit related and 
non-audit fees were not material relative 
to the income of the external auditor 
firm as a whole. It was satisfied that the 
objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor was maintained 
throughout the year. 
External auditor appointment
KPMG has been Grainger’s external 
auditor since successfully tendering 
in 2014 and carried out its first audit 
in 2015.
The Committee discussed the 
implications of the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s Order requiring 
FTSE 350 companies to hold an audit 
tender every ten years, as well as the 
recently introduced Statutory Auditors 
and Third Country Auditors Regulations 
2016. Due to the relatively recent 
appointment of KPMG, the Committee 
was satisfied that it was not optimal  
to tender external audit services in the 
current year. The Committee noted that, 
based on the prevailing legislation, a 
competitive tender for external auditor 
must be held no later than 2025.
The Committee monitors the 
performance of the external auditor 
throughout the year and formally 
concludes the assessment of its 
performance following conclusion of 
the annual external audit. Thereafter, 
the Committee makes a corresponding 
recommendation to the Board on the 
appointment of the external auditor 
for the forthcoming financial year. 
Shareholders formally appoint the 
external auditor at the AGM in February. 
In light of the assessments and review 
undertaken, the Board endorsed the 
Committee’s recommendation which 
was approved by shareholders in 
February 2016. When considering the 
appropriateness of the re-appointment 
of KPMG as the Group’s external auditor 
for the forthcoming year, the Audit 
Committee took account of its review 
of the external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity, the ratio of audit to 
non-audit fees and the effectiveness of 
the audit process, together with other 
Governance – Audit Committee report
continued
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 58 relevant review processes conducted 
throughout the year. The Committee 
also had regard to the positive results of 
the Audit Quality Review carried out by 
the FRC in respect of the 2015 audit. 
The Committee was satisfied that it 
should recommend to the Board the 
re-appointment of KPMG as the 
Company’s external auditor. 
Internal Audit 
As referred to above, Deloitte is 
appointed by the Company as Internal 
Auditor. Internal Audit undertakes audits 
across Grainger using a risk-based 
methodology and in accordance with the 
changing risk profile of the Company. 
Individual audits are supported as 
appropriate by specialist skills and subject 
matter expertise. Audits are identified 
during an annual audit planning cycle, 
which is informed by the results of 
current and previous audit testing, the 
Company’s strategy and performance 
and the risk management process.
Additional audits are identified during  
the year in response to changing priorities 
and requirements. All Internal Audit 
findings are graded, appropriate remedial 
actions, responsibilities and timeframes 
are agreed with management, and 
progress monitored and reported.
Internal Audit’s plans and resources 
are considered, monitored and approved 
by the Audit Committee, together with 
all internal control findings and remedial 
actions. Internal Audit has a direct 
reporting line to the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. The effectiveness 
of Internal Audit is assessed by the 
review of its reports, meetings with 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
without management being present, 
and feedback from senior management 
and the Chief Financial Officer to assess 
views on the effectiveness of 
Internal Audit.
In respect of the Internal Audit 
programme for 2017 and thereafter, 
pursuant to the strategic change in 
the business to focus on the PRS sector, 
and the related restructuring of the 
Group’s operating model, the Internal 
Audit strategy and forward plan have 
similarly been redesigned. The revised 
approach will focus on providing 
assurance, process improvement and 
value adding insights around Grainger’s 
core processes, complemented by an 
appropriate and proportionate number 
of targeted risk reviews on principal risks 
and/or areas of management request 
and concern.

Non-Executive Directors.
Dear Shareholder
The Nominations Committee plays 
a fundamental role in ensuring the 
selection and recommendation of 
strong candidates for appointment 
to the Board. The Committee monitors 
the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Board and its Committees, with any 
changes recommended to the Board for 
its review and decision. The Committee 
is also responsible for succession 
planning and monitors talent 
development at senior management 
level. 2015 was a particularly busy year 
for the Nominations Committee with 
significant change to the Board and its 
Committees. 2016 has therefore been 
focused on embedding the changes that 
took place. This report details the main 
activities of the Nominations Committee 
undertaken during the course of the 
year in fulfilling its responsibilities.

Process for Board appointments
Prior to making an appointment, the 
Nominations Committee will evaluate 
the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board. Pursuant to 
this evaluation, a specification of the 
personal attributes, experience and 
capabilities required to effectively 
perform the relevant appointment will 
be drafted. The Committee will also 
make any recommendations to the 
Board concerning the appointment 
of any Director and of the Company 
Secretary. In circumstances where 
external recruitment or benchmarking 
of an internal candidate is appropriate, 
the Committee will engage the services 
of an independent external search 
consultancy to assist in preparing the 
appointment specification.
Main activities of the Committee 
during the year
The Committee met twice formally 
during the year to 30 September 2016. 
The Committee has a number of 
standing agenda items which relate to 
its key responsibilities detailed above. 
In applying those responsibilities, the 
Committee considered, discussed and 
made decisions in relation to a range of 
matters throughout the course of the 
year, the most significant of which are 
specified below. It is highlighted that the 
2015 Nominations Committee report 
specified certain changes to the Board 
that would take place during the course 
of the 2016 financial year. These 
changes have now taken place and, for 
completeness, are also included below:
Baroness Margaret Ford
Committee Chairman
Key responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to:
 review the size, balance and constitution of the Board, including the diversity 
and balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Non-Executive Directors;
 consider succession planning for Directors and other senior executives;
 identify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill  
Board vacancies;
 review annually the time commitment required of Non-Executive Directors; and
 make recommendations to the Board, in consultation with the respective 
Committee Chairmen, regarding membership of the three Board Committees.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 60 Board changes
 Andrew Cunningham and Mark 
Greenwood retired from Grainger  
in January 2016 and December  
2015 respectively. 
 Helen Gordon joined Grainger  
as Chief Executive designate on  
3 November 2015 and took up  
the role in January 2016. 
 Vanessa Simms joined Grainger as 
the Company’s Chief Financial Officer 
in February 2016.
 Rob Wilkinson joined the Board as an 
independent Non-Executive Director 
in October 2015. 
Committee changes
 As previously reported, Belinda 
Richards was appointed Senior 
Independent Director and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee in 2015. 
Therefore, the Nominations 
Committee reflected on the 
appropriate balance of the Committee 
Chairmen and members, whilst having 
due regard to time commitment, skills 
and experience, and was of the view 
that it was in the best interests of the 
Company to appoint Andrew Carr-
Locke as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee in place of Belinda. It was 
further agreed that in the interests 
of continuity Belinda would remain 
a member of the Audit Committee. 
 Following a review of the membership 
of the Committees having regard to 
the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience, it was subsequently 
decided to appoint Rob Wilkinson as 
a member of the Audit Committee. 
In addition, Rob has a standing 
invitation to attend meetings of 
the Nominations Committee should 
he choose to do so. 
Search consultants
The Committee engaged the Zygos 
Partnership (‘Zygos’), an independent 
executive search consultancy, for the 
recruitment of Directors during the 
course of the year. The Board confirms 
that Zygos is not connected with the 
Company in any other way. 
Diversity
The Directors are committed to 
having a balanced Board which 
includes diversity of perspectives, 
skills, knowledge and background. In 
respect of gender diversity specifically, 
the Board supports Lord Davies’ 
aspiration to promote greater female 
representation on listed company 
boards, and notes the significant positive 
progress that has been made in this area 
in respect of FTSE 350 companies since 
the original Davies report was published. 
All appointments to the Grainger Board 
are made on merit, and within this 
context the Directors will continue to 
have regard to the recommendations 
of the Davies report and the issue of 
diversity as it and best practice develop 
further. As at the date of this report, 
female representation at Board level 
was 50%. Page 25 contains details 
of the gender split of all Grainger staff.

I am pleased to present on behalf 
of the Board the 2016 Directors’ 
Remuneration report.
Dear Shareholder
This Directors’ Remuneration report 
sets out our proposed Remuneration 
Policy which we expect to apply for 
three years from the 2017 AGM, 
subject to shareholder approval. 
It provides a summary of how we intend 
to implement the new Remuneration 
Policy in the year ahead and discloses 
the amounts paid to our Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors for the year 
ended 30 September 2016. 
What is in this report?
The report complies with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013. The report has been prepared in 
line with the recommendations of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(set out on pages 65 to 72) will be put to 
shareholders for approval in a binding 
vote at the forthcoming AGM. The 
effective date of the updated policy 
is 8 February 2017 which is the date 
Shareholder approval is being sought 
for the revised policy.
This Annual Statement (pages 62 to 64) 
and the Annual Report on Remuneration 
(set out on pages 73 to 85) will be 
subject to an advisory vote at the AGM. 
2016 performance and reward
Aligned with our focus on generating 
shareholder returns through the active 
management of our assets, the majority 
of our annual bonus in 2016 was subject 
to a combination of OPBVM and ROSE 
targets. These metrics combined to 
ensure that Executive Directors were 
focused on driving profit from our 
day-to-day activities at the same time 
as maximising the value of our 
underlying assets. In addition, a minority 
of bonus opportunity was based on how 
well our Executive Directors performed 
against an individually tailored scorecard 
of key performance metrics. 
With regard to the performance 
achieved during the year, we delivered 
OPBVM of £88.7m and ROSE of 10.6%. 
The performance against OPBVM was 
£7 .8m ahead of the target set for the 
year of £80.9m and ROSE was 
marginally above mid-range of 5% 
to 15%. When performance against 
these metrics was aggregated with 
achievement against individually 
tailored strategic targets, annual 
bonuses ranged from 67% to 76% as 
a percentage of the maximum available. 
Full disclosure of the actual targets set, 
and performance against those targets, 
is set out on pages 74 to 76. 
Belinda Richards
Committee Chairman
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 62 Over the longer term, we have 
historically operated a Long-Term 
Incentive Scheme (‘LTIP’) that measured 
our success based on performance 
against NNNAV (50% of an award) 
and absolute total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) (50% of an award) targets. 
Operating in tandem, these metrics are 
aligned with creating a strong balance 
sheet and creating shareholder value. 
The awards granted in 2013 under 
the LTIP will be eligible to vest in 
December 2016. With regard to NNNAV 
performance over the period ending 
30 September 2016, NNNAV has 
increased by 47 .2% against the 22.4% 
increase in the Halifax and Nationwide 
House Price indices. This will result in 
40% vesting of this part of the award. 
In terms of TSR, it is currently forecast  
to show an annual compound increase 
in the region of 10.7% over the three-
year performance period (ending 
10 December 2016). Should this level of 
TSR be maintained to the conclusion of 
the performance period, this would result 
in 57% of this part of the award vesting.
In light of the strong performance 
delivered over the relevant performance 
periods to date, the Committee is 
comfortable, overall, with the level 
of variable pay earned and forecast 
in light of the performance delivered. 
Alignment of remuneration 
with strategy
As detailed in the Strategic report, 
the year under review has been a year 
of change at Grainger. Under new 
executive leadership we undertook 
a deep review of every aspect of our 
business and announced a refined 
strategy in January 2016. At the heart 
of our refined strategy is targeting 
improved long-term shareholder 
returns. This is to be achieved through 
a combination of growing rents following 
the application of a targeted residential 
investment programme and 
simplification and focus within our 
business model through exiting non-core 
assets and reducing operating costs.
In light of our refined corporate 
objectives, and having had regard to the 
feedback received from Shareholders 
in relation to our remuneration practices 
at the time of our 2016 AGM, the 
Committee undertook a full review of 
our approach to remuneration during 
the year under review. The objective 
was to ensure that future policy will 
support Grainger through its next 
three-year remuneration policy 
period, which will commence from 
the 2017 AGM.
The key conclusions of the Committee’s 
review were that the current approach 
to weighting remuneration to long-term 
performance remained aligned with our 
overall strategic objective of improving 
long-term returns to Shareholders. 
However, it was agreed that the current 
policy should be simplified and updated 
to take account of developments in 
‘best practice’. As a result, subject to 
shareholder approval at the AGM, there 
are a number of revisions to be made to 
our current Remuneration Policy which 
are detailed below:
 Simplifying the annual bonus 
structure with the removal of the 
‘exceptional’ bonus maximum and 
introducing part-deferral of annual 
bonus into Grainger shares
 Streamlining the LTIP so that only 
performance shares will be granted 
in future years (i.e. there will be no 
further awards of matching shares 
under the LTIP)
 The introduction of a two-year 
holding period on vested LTIP shares
 A tailoring of incentive plan 
performance metrics to better align 
with Grainger’s refined strategy. This 
includes increasing the weighting on 
return and profitability in the annual 
bonus and introducing relative total 
shareholder return and total property 
return into the LTIP
 Introducing Committee discretion 
to override incentive pay outcomes 
based on the application of the 
conditions set if payouts are not 
considered reflective of overall 
company performance 
 Increasing our share ownership 
guidelines from 100% to 200% 
of salary
 The above changes are considered, 
in aggregate, to create a more 
strategically aligned and long-term 
focused Remuneration Policy. 
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 63 Implementation of policy for 2017
The base salaries of the Executive 
Directors will not be increased with 
effect from 1 January 2017 (see 
Note 12 to the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for more details).
An overview of the changes to our 
general approach to remuneration  
which we intend to operate from the 
AGM are detailed above. Full details  
of the intended application of the 
Remuneration Policy are set out on  
pages 82 to 84 of the Annual Report  
on Remuneration. 
With regard to the current LTIP , as 
the scheme will shortly reach the end 
of its ten-year duration, shareholder 
approval is being sought at the AGM for 
a replacement. Subject to Shareholders’ 
approval of the replacement LTIP , this 
will enable Grainger to continue to 
operate a LTIP in line with the proposed 
Remuneration Policy. 
In addition, I would highlight that the 
current HMRC approved all-employee 
Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) share scheme 
will also reach the end of its ten-year life. 
Consequently, a resolution requesting 
shareholder approval in respect of a 
successor SAYE scheme on similar terms 
will also be sought at the 2017 AGM. 
The Committee firmly supports the 
principle of broad employee share 
ownership and the previous SAYE 
scheme was successful in encouraging 
employees to become owners in 
Grainger. Renewal of the scheme will 
enable all our employees, including the 
Executive Directors, to continue to 
acquire Company shares on a consistent 
tax favoured basis in the future.
Governance – Remuneration Committee report

Shareholder engagement
The changes proposed to the 
Remuneration Policy noted above were 
the subject of extensive shareholder 
engagement during the year under 
review. The Board values the opinions of 
its Shareholders and other stakeholders 
and has proactively taken their views 
into account when finalising the 
proposed Remuneration Policy and  
its application for 2017 . 
The Committee is committed to 
maintaining an ongoing dialogue with 
Shareholders on the issue of executive 
remuneration and we welcome any 
further feedback you may have. 
We look forward to your support on the 
resolutions relating to remuneration at 
the AGM on 8 February 2017 .

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 64 Governance – Remuneration policy
Remuneration policy
Set out below is the Remuneration Policy for the Company that will be effective from 8 February 2017 (the ‘Effective Date’), 
subject to shareholder approval at the AGM to be held on that day.
The following table summarises the main elements of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy for 2017 onwards, the 
key features of each element, their purpose and linkage to our strategy. Details of the remuneration arrangements for the 
Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 72. 
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy To enable the recruitment and retention of individuals of the necessary calibre to execute the 
Company’s business strategy.
Operation Reviewed annually and effective from 1 January.
Decision influenced by:
 role, experience and personal performance;
 average change in total workforce salary;
 total organisational salary budgets; and
 Company performance and other economic conditions.
Salaries are benchmarked periodically and are set by reference to companies of a similar size 
and complexity.
Opportunity Salaries will be eligible for increases during the three-year period that the Remuneration Policy 
operates from the Effective Date. 
During this time, salaries may be increased each year (in percentage of salary terms) in line with 
increases granted to the wider workforce. 
Increases beyond those granted to the wider workforce (in percentage of salary terms) may be 
awarded in certain circumstances such as where there is a change in responsibility, experience or 
a significant increase in the scale of the role and/or size, value and/or complexity of the Group. 
Where new joiners or recent promotions have been placed on a below market rate of pay initially, 
a series of increases above those granted to the wider workforce (in percentage of salary terms) may 
be given over the following few years’ subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Framework to assess performance The Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate Committee meeting each year after 
having due regard to the factors noted in operating the salary policy.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy To aid recruitment and retention of high-quality executives.
Operation Car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, ill health income protection,  
travel insurance, health check-up.
Other ancillary benefits (including relocation expenses) may be offered, as required.
Opportunity The value of benefits may vary from year to year depending on the cost to the Company  
from third-party providers.
Framework to assess performance N/A
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy To aid recruitment and retention of high-quality executives and enable long-term savings through 
pension provision.
Operation The Company may contribute directly into an occupational pension scheme (an Executive Director’s 
personal pension) or pay a salary supplement in lieu of pension. If appropriate, a salary sacrifice 
arrangement can apply.
Opportunity The pension contribution or allowance is based on 15% of basic salary.
Framework to assess performance N/A
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 65 Annual bonus
Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise the achievement of annual targets, rewarding strong operational performance  
set with reference to target performance levels for the year.
Operation Compulsory deferral of 25% of any bonus paid into shares for three years with the balance of the 
bonus paid in cash. Deferred shares typically vest after three years and are normally subject to 
continued employment.
Dividend equivalent payments may be made in cash or shares on deferred shares at the time 
of vesting and may assume the reinvestment of dividends.
Opportunity Maximum bonus potential is capped at: 
  140% of salary for the Chief Executive; and
 120% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
Framework to assess performance Details of the performance measures used for the current year and targets set for the year under  
review and performance against them will be provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Bonus will be predominantly based on a challenging range of financial targets set in line with the 
Group’s KPIs tailored to each individual role as appropriate, for example, targets relating to ROSE 
and adjusted earnings (previously called recurring profit). For a minority of the bonus, targets relating 
to the Group’s other KPIs will operate (for example strategic targets).
For financial targets, and where practicable in respect of strategic targets, bonus starts to accrue once 
the threshold target is met (0% payable) rising on a graduated scale to 100% for outperformance. 
The Committee may adjust bonus outcomes, based on the application of the bonus formula set at 
the start of the relevant year, if it considers the quantum to be inconsistent with the Company’s overall 
performance during the year. For the avoidance of doubt this can be to zero and bonuses may not 
exceed the maximum levels detailed above. Any use of such discretion would be detailed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
In the event that there was (i) a misstatement of the Company’s results; (ii) a miscalculation or an 
assessment of any performance conditions that was based on incorrect information; or (iii) misconduct 
on behalf of an individual, recovery and/or withholding provisions may apply for three years from the 
date of payment of any bonus.
Long-Term Incentive Schemes
Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise the delivery of sustained performance over the longer term.
To encourage greater shareholder alignment through personal investment in the Company’s shares.
Operation Long Term Incentive Schemes have been provided under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan and  
will be provided, with effect from the 2017 AGM and subject to Shareholder approval, under the  
2017 Long Term Incentive Plan (collectively referred to as ‘LTIP’). The LTIP provides for awards  
of free shares (i.e. either conditional shares or nil-cost options) normally made annually which are  
eligible to vest after three years subject to continued service and the achievement of challenging 
performance conditions.
Shares (as a minimum on an after tax basis) are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period  
for awards granted from the Effective Date of the Remuneration Policy. 
Dividend equivalent payments may be made (in cash or shares) on LTIP shares at the time of vesting 
on vested shares and may assume the reinvestment of dividends.
Opportunity Annual awards are capped at:
 175% of salary for the Chief Executive; and 
 130% of basic salary for the other Executive Directors. 
The Committee may grant awards at up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances 
(e.g. recruitment to compensate for value forfeit from a previous employer).
Governance – Remuneration policy
continued
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 66 Long-Term Incentive Schemes continued
Framework to assess performance Granted subject to a blend of challenging financial (e.g. total property return) and total shareholder 
return performance targets tested over three years.
25% of awards will vest for threshold performance with full vesting taking place for equalling, or 
exceeding, the maximum performance targets. No awards vest for performance below threshold. 
A graduated vesting scale operates between threshold and maximum performance levels.
The Committee may adjust LTIP vesting outcomes, based on the result of testing the performance 
condition, if it considers the quantum to be inconsistent with the Company’s overall performance 
during the three-year performance period. For the avoidance of doubt this can be to zero. Any use 
of such discretion would be detailed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In the event that there was (i) a misstatement of the Company’s results; (ii) a miscalculation or 
an assessment of any performance conditions based on incorrect information; or (iii) misconduct 
on behalf of an individual, recovery and/or withholding provisions may apply for three years from 
an award becoming eligible to vest.
Savings related share schemes
Purpose and link to strategy To encourage employees to make a long-term investment in the Company’s shares.
Operation All employees, including the Executive Directors, are eligible to participate on the same terms in the 
Company’s Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) scheme and Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’), both of which are 
approved by HMRC and subject to the limits prescribed. 
Opportunity SAYE: Participants may invest up to £500 per month (or such other amount as may be permitted by  
HMRC from time to time) for three or five-year periods in order to purchase shares at the end of the 
contractual period at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of the shares at the commencement  
of the saving period.
SIP: Participants can invest up to £150 per month (or such other amount as may be permitted by HMRC 
from time to time) in shares in the Company, and the Company may then, subject to certain limits, double 
that investment. The Company may also allocate free shares annually on a percentage of basic pay, subject 
to a maximum of £3,600 (or such other amount as may be permitted by HMRC from time to time).
Dividend payments on SIP shares are reinvested in dividend shares and must be held in trust for 
three years.
Framework to assess performance N/A
Shareholding guidelines
Under the Shareholding Guidelines Executive Directors are expected to build up over time a shareholding equivalent to 200% of their base 
salary. Executive Directors are required to retain a minimum of half the after tax number of vested shares in relation to future LTIP awards 
to satisfy the guideline. The Committee will also operate a general expectation that the guideline will be met within five years of its 
introduction, although the Committee reserves the right to take into account vesting levels and personal circumstances when assessing 
progress against the guideline. 
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 67 Changes to the Remuneration Policy
The above Remuneration Policy includes 
a number of revisions when compared 
against the Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM. The changes have been made 
to better align remuneration with the 
refined Company strategy detailed in 
the Strategic report, as well as taking 
into account the feedback from our 
major institutional investors.
The key changes included:
 simplifying the annual bonus 
structure so that in future a single 
bonus maximum will operate as 
opposed to separate ‘normal’ and 
‘exceptional’ maximum bonus 
opportunities. This change reduced 
the aggregate maximum potential 
bonus in any year for the Chief 
Executive from 150% to 140% of 
salary and from 125% to 120% for 
other Executive Directors;
 the ability to grant matching shares 
under the LTIP (being up to 30% of 
salary linked to the deferral of annual 
bonus or purchase of shares) has 
been removed with only a single type 
of share award (performance shares) 
to be granted in future years. 
Accordingly, the LTIP maximum 
award limit has been revised to 175% 
of salary for the Chief Executive and 
130% of salary for the other 
Executive Directors. The revised 
limits compare to aggregate award 
limits of matching shares and 
performance shares of 180% of 
salary and 130% of salary under the 
previous Remuneration Policy;
 the introduction of a two-year 
holding period on vested LTIP shares;
 the performance metrics to be 
operated in incentive plans, as 
detailed below, have been refined 
to better align with the Company’s 
refined strategy as detailed in the 
Strategic report;
 introducing Committee discretion 
to override incentive pay outcomes 
based on the application of the 
conditions set if payouts are not 
considered reflective of overall 
company performance; and
 increasing the share ownership 
guideline from 100% to 200% 
of base salary.
Choice of performance measures 
and approach to target setting
The performance metrics that are 
used for annual bonus and long-term 
incentive plans are a sub-set of the 
Group’s KPIs.
Under the annual bonus plan for the 
first year of operating the Remuneration 
Policy in 2017 , bonuses will be based 
40% on ROSE, 40% on adjusted 
earnings and 20% on individually 
tailored strategic targets.
The use of adjusted earnings as a metric 
is intended to incentivise operational 
success in achieving specified levels of 
rental growth, income from sales and 
reduction in overheads which reflect  
the current key strategic priorities of  
the Company and feed through to 
adjusted earnings. 
The term ‘adjusted earnings’ 
has replaced the term ‘recurring profit’. 
In the context of recently published 
guidance from ESMA and the FRC; the 
Directors considered the use of the term 
‘recurring profit’ and determined that a 
description as ‘adjusted earnings’ more 
appropriately reflects the adjustments 
between statutory profit and this 
measure (see Note 4 to the financial 
statements). The calculation of the 
measure is unchanged. 
Use of ROSE is aligned with delivering 
targeted overall returns from the 
Company’s property portfolio which is 
supported by a strong balance sheet. 
Use of strategic targets enables the 
Committee to incentivise delivery against 
the evolving strategy of the Group.
In respect of long-term performance 
targets, LTIP awards will vest subject 
to: (i) challenging total property return 
targets that are aligned with the 
long-term levels of return targeted 
by the Company; and (ii) relative TSR 
targets which incentivise the Executive 
team to outperform sector peers and 
provide clear alignment of interests 
between Shareholders and Executives. 
Targets are set based on sliding scales 
that take account of internal planning 
and external market expectations for 
the Company. Only modest rewards 
are available for delivering threshold 
performance levels with maximum 
rewards requiring substantial 
outperformance of the challenging 
plans approved by the Board at the 
start of each financial year.
The incentive metrics, their weightings 
and the range of targets set will be 
subject to review each year and may be 
adjusted to better reflect the strategic 
priorities of the Company at that time 
(subject to the constraints set out in 
the policy above). 
No performance targets are applied 
to the all-employee plans which are 
aimed at encouraging broad based 
equity ownership.
Further details of the annual bonus 
metrics to be used for the current 
financial year are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. The targets 
for awards to be granted under the 
LTIP in the current financial year are 
consistent with the policy set out above 
and are also specified in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.

Bonus plan and LTIP policy
The Committee will operate the annual 
bonus plan, LTIP and all-employee plans 
according to their respective rules and 
in accordance with the relevant Listing 
Rules and HMRC rules consistent with 
market practice. The Committee retains 
discretion, within the confines and 
opportunity detailed above, in a number 
of respects with the operation and 
administration of these plans. 
These include:
 the individual(s) participating in 
the plans;
 the timing of grant of award  
and/or payment;
 the size of an award and/or payment;
 the determination of vesting; 
 dealing with a change of control 
(e.g. the timing of testing performance 
targets) or restructuring;
 determination of a ‘good/bad leaver’ 
for incentive plan purposes based 
on the rules of each plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen;
 adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring and special 
dividends); and
 the annual review of performance 
conditions for the annual bonus plan 
and LTIP .
The Committee also retains the ability 
to adjust the targets, and/or set 
different measures and alter weightings 
for the annual bonus plan and to adjust 
targets for the LTIP if events occur 
(e.g. material divestment of a Group 
business) which cause it to determine 
that the conditions are no longer 
appropriate and the amendment is 
required so that the conditions achieve 
their original purpose and are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy.
Reward scenarios for 
Executive Directors
The Company’s Remuneration Policy 
results in a significant proportion of 
remuneration received by Executive 
Directors being dependent on  
Company performance. The graph 
below illustrates how the total pay 
opportunities for the Executive 
Directors varies under three different 
performance scenarios: 
 Below target
 On-target 
 Maximum 
When reviewing the graph, it should be 
noted that it has been prepared based 
on the policy detailed above and 
ignores, for simplicity, the potential 
impact of future share price growth.
Assumptions: 
 Below target = fixed pay only  
(base salary, benefits and pension)
 On-target = 55% payable of the 2017 
annual bonus and 62.5% vesting of 
the 2017 LTIP awards
 Maximum = 100% payable of the 
2017 annual bonus and 100% vesting 
of the 2017 LTIP awards
Salary levels (on which other elements 
of the package are calculated) are based 
on those applying on 30 September 
2016. The value of taxable benefits is 
based on the cost of supplying those 
benefits (as disclosed on page 73) for 
the year ending 30 September 2016. 
The Executive Directors can participate 
in the all-employee share plans on the 
same basis as other employees. The 
value that may be received under these 
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 69 schemes is subject to tax approved 
limits. For simplicity, the value that may 
be received from participating in these 
schemes has been excluded from the

How the Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy relates 
to the wider Group
The Remuneration Policy provides an 
overview of the structure that operates 
for the Company’s Executive Directors 
and senior executive population. 
However, it is highlighted that there 
are differences in quantum within this 
determined by the size and scope of 
individual positions. 
The Committee is made aware of pay 
structures across the Group when 
setting the Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors. The key difference 
is that, overall, the Remuneration Policy 
for Executive Directors is more heavily 
weighted towards variable pay than for 
other employees. 
Base salaries are operated under 
the same policy as detailed in the 
Remuneration Policy table with any 
comparator groups used as a reference 
point. The Committee considers the 
general basic salary increase for 
the broader Company (if any) when 
determining the annual salary review 
for the Executive Directors. 
Outside of the most senior tiers of 
executives, the LTIP is not operated 
as this arrangement is reserved for 
those anticipated as having the 
greatest potential to influence 
Company level performance.
However, the Committee believes in 
wider employee share ownership and 
promotes this through the operation of 
the HMRC tax approved all-employee 
share schemes which are open to all 
UK employees. 
How the views of employees are 
taken into account
The Company, in line with current 
market practice, does not currently 
actively consult with employees on 
executive remuneration.
The Committee takes due account of 
remuneration structures elsewhere in 
the Group when setting pay for the 
Executive Directors. For example, 
consideration is given to the overall 
salary increase budget and the 
incentive structures that operate 
across the Company.
How the views of Shareholders 
are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee 
considers shareholder feedback 
received in relation to the AGM each 
year and guidance from shareholder 
representative bodies more generally. 
This feedback, plus any additional 
feedback received during any meetings 
held with Shareholders from time to 
time, is then considered as part of 
the Committee’s ongoing review 
of remuneration policy. 
Approach to recruitment 
remuneration
When setting the remuneration 
package for a new Executive Director, 
the Committee will apply the same 
principles and implement the policy 
as set out in the preceding tables. 
Base salary will be set at a level 
appropriate to the role and the 
experience of the Executive Director 
being appointed. This may include 
agreement on future increases up 
to a market rate, in line with increased 
experience and/or responsibilities, 
subject to good performance, where 
it is considered appropriate.
In relation to external appointments, 
the Committee may offer compensation 
that it considers appropriate to take 
account of awards and benefits that will 
or may be forfeited on resignation from 
a previous position. Such compensation 
would reflect the performance 
requirements, timing and such other 
specific matters as the Committee 
considers relevant. This may take the 
form of cash and/or share awards. The 
policy is that the maximum payment 
under any such arrangements (which 
may be in addition to the normal 
variable remuneration) should be no 
more than the Committee considers 
is required to provide reasonable 
compensation to the incoming 
Executive Director.
If the Executive Director will be required 
to relocate in order to take up the 
position, it is the Company’s policy 
to allow reasonable relocation, travel 
and subsistence payments. Any such 
payments will be at the discretion of 
the Committee.
In the case of an employee who is 
promoted to the position of Executive 
Director, it is the Company’s policy 
to honour pre-existing award 
commitments in accordance 
with their terms.
Non-Executive Director appointments 
will be through letters of appointment. 
Non-Executive Directors’ base fees, 
including those of the Chairman, will 
be set at a competitive market level, 
reflecting experience, responsibility and 
time commitment. Fees will be reviewed 
bi-annually. Additional fees are payable 
for the chairmanship of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees and for the 
additional responsibilities of the Senior 
Independent Director.
Governance – Remuneration policy

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 70 Directors’ service contracts and 
provision on payment for loss of office
Executive Directors’ service contracts 
are terminable by the Company on up  
to one year’s notice and by the Director 
on at least six months’ notice. 
If an Executive Director’s employment 
is to be terminated, the Committee’s 
policy in respect of the contract of 
employment, in the absence of a 
breach of the service agreement by 
the Executive Director, is to agree a 
termination payment based on the value 
of base salary and contractual pension 
amounts and benefits that would have 
accrued to the Executive Director during 
the contractual notice period. The policy 
is that, as is considered appropriate 
at the time, the departing Executive 
Director may work, or be placed on 
garden leave, for all or part of their 
notice period, or receive a payment in 
lieu of notice in accordance with the 
service agreement. The Committee 
will also seek to apply the principle of 
mitigation where possible so as to 
reduce any termination payment to a 
leaving Executive Director, having had 
regard to the circumstances.
In addition, the Committee may also 
make payments in relation to any 
statutory entitlements, to settle any claim 
against the Company (e.g. in relation to 
breach of statutory employment rights 
or wrongful dismissal) or make a modest 
provision in respect of legal costs or 
outplacement fees.
The Company has an enhanced 
redundancy policy allowing redundancy 
amounts to be calculated by reference 
to actual basic weekly salary and the 
policy may be extended to Executive 
Directors where relevant.
With regard to annual bonus for 
a departing Executive Director, 
if employment ends by reason of 
redundancy, retirement with the 
agreement of the Company, ill health 
or disability or death, or any other  
reason as determined by the Committee 
(i.e. the individual is a ‘good leaver’), the 
Executive Director may be considered 
for a bonus payment. If the termination 
is for any other reason, any entitlement 
to bonus would normally lapse. Under 
any circumstance, it is the Committee’s 
policy to ensure that any bonus 
payment reflects the departing Executive 
Director’s performance and behaviour 
towards the Company.
Any bonus payment will normally 
be delayed until the performance 
conditions have been determined for 
the relevant period and be subject to 
a pro-rata reduction for the portion 
of the relevant bonus year that the 
individual was employed. 
The treatment for share-based incentives 
granted to an Executive Director will be 
determined based on the relevant plan 
rules. The default treatment will be for 
outstanding awards to lapse on cessation 
of employment. In relation to awards 
granted under the Company’s long-term 
incentive plans, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as injury or disability, 
redundancy, transfer or sale of the 
employing company, retirement with 
the Company’s agreement or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee (reflecting the circumstances 
that prevail at the time) ‘good leaver’ 
status may be applied. 
If treated as a good leaver, awards will be 
eligible to vest subject to performance 
conditions, which will be measured 
over the original performance period 
(unless the Committee elected to test 
performance to the date of cessation 
of employment), and be subject to 
a pro-rata reduction (unless the 
Committee considered it inappropriate 
to do so) to reflect the proportion of 
the vesting period actually served. 
With regard to the deferral of annual 
bonus, deferred share bonus awards 
will normally lapse on cessation of 
employment other than where an 
Executive Director is a ‘good leaver’ 
(as detailed above) with awards then 
vesting on the normal vesting date. 
It is the Company’s policy to honour 
pre-existing award commitments in 
accordance with their terms.
Where the Executive Director 
participates in one or more of 
the Company’s HMRC approved 
share plans, awards may vest or be 
exercisable on or following termination 
of employment in certain good leaver 
circumstances, where permissible, 
in accordance with the rules of the 
plan and relevant legislation.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted 
to accept external non-executive 
appointments with the prior approval 
of the Board. It is normal practice 
for Executive Directors to retain 
fees provided for non-executive 
appointments.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters 
of appointment
The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors have letters of appointment 
for an initial fixed term of three years 
subject to earlier termination by either 
party on written notice. In each case, 
this term can be extended by 
mutual agreement. 
Non-Executive Directors have  
no entitlement to contractual 
termination payments. 
The dates of the initial appointments of 
the Non-Executive Directors are set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 71 Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The policy on Non-Executive Directors’ fees is set out below:
Non-Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy To provide a competitive fee which will attract those high-calibre individuals who, through their 
experience, can further the interests of the Group through their stewardship and contribution to 
strategic development.
Operation The fees for Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) are typically reviewed every second  
year or more frequently if required. 
Fee levels are set by reference to the expected time commitment and responsibility, and are periodically 
benchmarked against relevant market comparators as appropriate reflecting the size and nature of 
the role. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual fee which is paid at least monthly in cash 
and do not participate in any of the Company’s incentive arrangements or receive any pension provision. 
The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with additional fees payable for chairmanship 
of the Company’s key Committees and for performing the Senior Independent Director role. 
All Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably 
incurred in performing their duties. 
The Committee recommends the remuneration of the Chairman to the Board. 
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Committee (during which the Chairman has no part in 
discussions) and recommended by it to the Board. The Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined  
by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
Opportunity Fee levels will be eligible for increases during the period that the Remuneration Policy operates to 
ensure that they continue to appropriately recognise the time commitment of the role, increases  
to fee levels for Non-Executive Directors in general and fee levels in companies of a similar size  
and complexity.

1 As detailed in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, Helen Gordon was appointed on a base salary of £460,000 with effect from 3 November 2015 and 
the value included in the table above reflects her salary paid for the part of the financial year that she was employed. Full details of her recruitment terms 
were included in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. Vanessa Simms was appointed on a base salary of £320,000 with effect from 4 February 2016  
and the value included in the table above reflects her salary paid for the part of the financial year that she was employed. There was no compensation for 
incentive value forfeit on joining Grainger provided to Vanessa in connection with her appointment. Her salary was set with reference to current market rates 
for the role and the calibre and experience of the individual. Nick Jopling’s base salary during the year under review was £356,842 with effect from 1 January 
2016 and the value included in the above table reflects the total salary received following the application of the staff-wide salary increase on 1 January 2016 
for part of the year.
2 Taxable benefits include a car allowance and private medical insurance.
3 In line with the contractual provisions specified in their service agreements and having reference to the Company’s policy for departing Executive Directors, 
Andrew Cunningham and Mark Greenwood were not eligible for a bonus in relation to 2015, or for the part of 2016 for which they were in employment, 
having given notice to the Company to terminate their employment in connection with their retirements during 2015.
4 In line with the requirements of the Remuneration Reporting Regulations, the 2016 LTIP vesting values are based on the forecast value of the awards due 
to vest on 9 December 2016 (50% of the award is based on NNNAV performance measured over the three years to 30 September 2016 and 50% of the 
award is based on absolute total shareholder return measured over the three-year period to 9 December 2016). The NNNAV performance measured to 
30 September 2016 was 2.11% and so 40% of this part of the award is due to vest and forms part of the 2016 LTIP value. Absolute TSR performance (based 
on an assessment of performance measured to 30 September 2016) is forecast to be 10.7% based on absolute TSR growth of 33%. The share price for 
the purposes of valuing the award is the share price at 30 September 2016 (230p) for the NNNAV element, and the three-month average share price to 
30 September 2016 (221.7p) for the TSR element. This value will be trued up in next year’s report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the 
vesting date. The 2015 LTIP value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in January 2016. Andrew Cunningham and Mark 
Greenwood retired and stepped down from the Board on 4 January 2016 and 22 December 2015 respectively. Their outstanding LTIP awards were retained 
and will vest and be exercisable in accordance with the LTIP Rules. These awards will vest at the end of their respective performance periods pro-rata to the 
time elapsed between the date of grant of the relevant award and their termination date, and to the extent that the relevant performance targets have been 
met over the full performance period including following cessation of employment.
5 The pension costs are based on 15% of base salary.

Please see Note 4 on page 78 in relation to the vesting of the Tranche 1 buy-out award made to Helen Gordon.
7 With regard to the single total figure of remuneration for each Director in relation to the year under review, the Committee was comfortable with the 
amounts payable given the performance achieved. In forming this view the Committee noted the delivery of a ROSE of 10.6% and an OPBVM of £88.7m and 
that this was delivered in a challenging market context. In addition, substantial strategic progress was also made with a refined strategy being developed and 
embedding in the organisation. From a longer-term perspective, three-year forecast annualised TSR of 10.7% was delivered at the same time as an 
increasing NNNAV relative to the increase in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices of 2.11.

 Annual bonus awards – performance assessment for 2016
Actual performance against the targets set for 2016 are set out below (straight-line payouts occur between the relevant 
performance points). 
Helen Gordon and Vanessa Simms both participated in the 2016 annual bonus on a pro-rata basis, reflecting the proportion 
of the year for which they were employed. Neither Andrew Cunningham nor Mark Greenwood was eligible to participate in 
the 2016 annual bonus plan.
The detail below sets out the financial targets that were set at the start of the year (which were considered equally challenging 
to those set in prior years allowing for the prevailing trading environment) and performance achieved against them together

for the year divided by the opening NNNAV per share of 263.4p. 
In respect of the personal performance targets set for each Executive Director, these were set against a range of strategic and 
personal targets at the start of the year (or on appointment where appropriate). The targets set were aligned to Grainger’s 
corporate objectives having due regard to the refocused strategy being the key overarching deliverable during the year.
Chief Executive

a) £87 .4m of core sales was achieved with a margin of 59.5%;
b) £11.8m in respect of development profit; and
c) £14.1m of Chelsea sales, it being noted by the Committee 
that this market has faced considerable external macro-

quality pipeline in 2016.
Partial achievement with approximately £300m commitment to 
acquire pipeline in the context of challenging market conditions 
in certain areas.
Following consideration of the performance against the objectives set, the Committee determined that payment of 64% of the 
maximum 25% of this part of the bonus was appropriate in the circumstances. 
The total bonuses earned, therefore, were 73%, 76% and 67% of the maximum bonus opportunity (based on pro-rata base 
salaries as appropriate) for the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Property Director respectively.
The 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration highlighted that certain matters were excluded due to commercial sensitivity. This 
related to Nick Jopling’s personal target to “Lead the strategic plan to secure a private rented sector portfolio of scale against 
the projected timeline”. The outcome of that target as specified in the 2015 report can now be supplemented by reference to 
the Clippers Quay, Salford transaction, which since the production of the 2015 report has been secured and duly announced. 
This transaction was well progressed at the time of the 2015 report and formed part of the PRS pipeline but was subject to 
typical confidentiality provisions until the date of exchange.

business days immediately preceding the award that was made on 11 January 2016. The face value for Vanessa Simms is based 
on a price of 217 . 1p being the average share price from the five business days immediately preceding the award that was made 
on 11 February 2016 which was shortly after she commenced employment with the Company.

 Share scheme interests awarded during the year continued
The face value of performance shares awarded were 150% of salary in the case of Helen Gordon, 89% of salary in the case 
of Vanessa Simms (being a pro-rata award to reflect her joining part way through the year) and 100% of salary in the case  
of Nick Jopling.
The awards of both performance and matching shares will be eligible to vest in three years contingent upon continued 
employment and satisfying the performance criteria. Half of the award is subject to a TSR growth condition (measured over 
three years from the grant of the award) with the other half subject to a NNNAV growth condition (measured over three 
financial years starting with the year in which the award was granted). The performance targets require three year growth  
in NNNAV to be 1.5 times the average growth recorded by the Halifax and Nationwide indices for threshold vesting (0%)  
and 3 times the indices for full vesting. 
In terms of TSR, annual compound growth of 5% per annum is required for threshold vesting (0%) with 15% per annum growth 
is required for full vesting. Straight line vesting takes place between performance points.
In addition to the above, as disclosed in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, Helen Gordon received performance 
adjusted and/or related buy-out awards to replace share awards forfeited from her previous employer on joining Grainger. 
The awards were structured (where practicable) so that performance related Grainger share awards replaced the 
performance linked awards from her former employer.

In relation to Tranche 1, 27 ,602 shares comprised in this award lapsed with the remaining 5,520 shares vesting in May 2016. 
The lapsed element arose pursuant to the Committee’s assessment of the value actually forfeit in connection with the award 
received from her previous employer it was granted to replace. 
In relation to Tranche 2 and Tranche 3, the same performance targets as detailed above for the awards granted during the year 
under review will apply save for the fact that the three year performance period of Tranche 2 runs from 1 October 2013 to 30 
September 2016 for the NNNAV part of the award with the TSR part of the award having a performance period that runs from 
December 2013 to December 2016. For Tranche 3, the performance period runs from 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2017 
for the NNNAV part of the award with the TSR part of the award having a performance period that runs from December 2014 
to December 2017 . These conditions are the same as those applying to other Grainger employees receiving awards in 2013  
and 2014.

 Payments to past Directors
Peter Couch, who retired from the Board on 31 January 2014, retained a pro-rated entitlement to 115,507 shares granted on 
10 December 2012 under the terms of the Company’s LTIP. This award vested at 98% when the value of the shares that vested 
at 233.6p per share was £264,426. The payments to Andrew Cunningham and Mark Greenwood, who retired during the year, 
are detailed elsewhere in this report. 
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 78 6
 Payments for loss of office
In relation to the retirement of Andrew Cunningham and Mark Greenwood, which took place on 4 January 2016 and 
22 December 2015 respectively, in line with the Company’s Remuneration Policy, they were treated as ‘good leavers’ for 
the purposes of their outstanding long-term incentive awards. Accordingly, their outstanding awards will remain eligible 
to vest at the normal vesting date subject to: (i) a pro-rata reduction for the proportion of the vesting period elapsed to 
the date of their retirement; and (ii) the application of performance targets over the original performance period. 
There have not been, nor will there be, any other payments made in connection with their retirement.

Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors
The Committee believes that it is important for a significant investment to be made by each Executive Director in the shares of 
the Company and has established share ownership guidelines for the Grainger Executive Directors. These guidelines state that 
Executive Directors are expected and encouraged to build over a five-year period a shareholding equivalent in value to at least 
200% of salary from the 2017 AGM, which is an increase from the previous guideline of 100% of salary.
Current levels of share ownership by the Executive Directors in post during the financial year under review are as follows. 
The values were calculated as at 31 October 2016 when the share price was 221p. These values do not include the value 
of any shares that are scheduled to vest on 9 December 2016.

 Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2017
Base salary
Pursuant to the strategic focus on management of overheads and the wider prevailing executive remuneration environment, 
the Remuneration Committee (following consultation with management) determined that in respect of three Executive 
Directors there should be no increase to the base salary during the 2016/17 pay review process. 
Annual bonus
As detailed in the Annual Statement and Remuneration Policy, the structure and metrics to operate for the 2017 annual bonus 
are being revised.
The revised bonus opportunities that will operate for 2017 will be as follows:
 Chief Executive: 140% of salary
 Chief Financial Officer: 120% of salary
 Property Director: 120% of salary
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 82 Deferral of part of the annual bonus into Grainger shares is being introduced for the first time in 2017 with 25% of any bonus 
earned to be deferred into Grainger shares for three years. This change will provide a clear link between the short-term actions 
that will determine bonus out-turn and the longer-term implications on Company performance.
The performance metrics to apply will be as follows:
Metric Targets Rationale for metric
Adjusted earnings (40% of bonus opportunity) Performance level Budget Payout
Threshold 90% 0%
Target 100% 60%
Maximum 120% 100%
Straight line between performance points
Incentivises operational success in achieving 
rental growth, income from sales and 
reduction in operational and finance cost 
relative to a challenging budget.
ROSE (40% of bonus opportunity) Performance level ROSE Payout
Threshold 5% 0%
Maximum 15% 100%
Straight line between performance points
Incentivises the delivery of targeted levels of 
return from our property portfolio which is 
aligned with a strong balance sheet in respect 
of the NNNAV performance and dividend level.
Strategic targets (20% of bonus opportunity) The metrics for each Executive Director will 
be as follows:
Chief Executive: (i) deliver on strategy 
and business plan; (ii) improve operational 
performance; and (iii) secure increased 
rental growth to enhance dividend.
Chief Financial Officer: (i) improve 
debt maturity and cost of debt; (ii) 
secure technology transformation; and 
(iii) secure overhead reduction.
Property Director: (i) deliver agreed 
PRS pipeline; (ii) secure sales in line with 
target; and (iii) improve gross to net leakage 
and property operational performance. 
Each of the headline metrics are underpinned 
by defined measurable milestones or a range 
of targets set with reference to budgeted 
objectives. These are consistent with the 
strategy and targeted objectives for the 
year agreed by the Board.
With regards to the above targets, full retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration (subject to considering any perceived areas of price sensitivity). 
LTIP
As detailed in the Annual Statement and Remuneration Policy report, the LTIP is being simplified in its operation for awards to 
be granted from 2017 with no further awards of matching shares to take place. As a result, only awards of performance shares 
will take place in future years. The LTIP is also to expire in 2017 and so a replacement LTIP is being proposed at the AGM. 
The replacement LTIP mirrors the general terms of the previous LTIP other than for the removal of the matching share element 
and introduction of a two-year holding period on vested shares. The award levels to operate in 2017 are the same as, or lower 
than, the maximum award levels previously operated under the LTIP when account was taken of both awards of performance 
and matching share awards.
Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, it is anticipated that the following awards will be granted to the Executive 
Directors under the scheme in 2017:
 Chief Executive: 175% salary
 Chief Financial Officer: 130% of salary
 Property Director: 130% of salary

As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, robust recovery and withholding provisions will apply to both LTIP and annual bonus 
awards which will enable the Committee to reclaim or adjust future variable pay awards in the event of a misstatement of the 
Company’s results, any errors in calculation of actual performance against a target set or in the event of misconduct.
Furthermore, the Committee will retain the right to reduce overall pay outcomes if it considers the variable pay out-turn is not 
reflective of broader Company performance over the relevant performance periods.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
There is no current intention to change the prevailing fee levels of the Non-Executive Directors in respect of the current 
financial year. The fees were most recently reviewed with effect from 1 October 2015. Current fee levels are as follows: 
 Basic Non-Executive Director fee: £45,000

The Company Secretary and the Human Resources Director and other members of the senior management team may be 
invited to attend Committee meetings as appropriate. No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration.
The Committee appointed New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a trading name of Aon plc, as advisers to the Committee for part of the 
year under review. Korn Ferry Hay Group (‘KFH’) was subsequently appointed by the Committee. The role of the adviser is to 
keep the Committee informed of developments in the market and best practice and to support the Committee in the design 
and implementation of Remuneration Policy. Total fees paid or payable (as applicable) to NBS and KFH in respect of services 
to the Committee during the 2016 financial year were £93,280 (2015: £63,000) and £10,800 (2015: N/A). Both NBS and KFH 
are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct and any advice provided is governed by that Code. 
The Committee reviews the adviser relationship periodically and remains satisfied that the advice it receives from its advisers 
is independent and objective.

the information to be included in the 
Annual Report and Accounts, where 
applicable, under LR 9.8.4, is set out in

Directors’ interests in

No Directors were materially interested 
in any contract of significance.
Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and parent 
company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; 
 for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent company financial 
statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the parent 
company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ Remuneration report 
and Corporate Governance statement 
that comply with that law and 
those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the 
Directors in respect of the annual 
financial report 
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
 the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
 the Strategic report and Directors’ 
report include a fair review of the 
development and performance 
of the business and the position 
of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties

The Directors have taken all the steps 
that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
The maintenance and integrity 
of the Grainger plc website is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the work 
carried out by the auditors does not 
involve consideration of these matters 
and, accordingly, the auditors accept 
no responsibility for any changes that

legislation in other jurisdictions.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 86 Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
The Company has in place contractual 
entitlements for the Directors of 
the Company and of its subsidiaries to 
claim indemnification by the Company in 
respect of certain liabilities which might 
be incurred by them in the course of their 
duties as Directors. These arrangements, 
which constitute qualifying third-party 
indemnity provision and qualifying 
pension scheme indemnity provision, 
have been established in compliance with 
the relevant provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. They include provision for the 
Company to fund the costs incurred by 
Directors in defending certain claims 
against them in relation to their duties 
as Directors of the Company or its

Summary
Grainger complies with the greenhouse 
gas (‘GHG’) emissions reporting 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. Emissions are reported 
for our operations in the UK for the full 
reporting period and Germany until the 
sale of that business which was finalised 
in April 2016. Grainger reports all 
material GHG emissions, wherever 
possible using ‘tonnes of CO
2 equivalent’ 
(tCO 2e) as the unit of measurement. Our 
reporting period for GHG emissions is 
1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. 
Our portfolio in 2016 changed part-way 
through the year with the sale of our 
German business in April. 
Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse 
gas emissions reduced by 16% between 
2015 and 2016. This was driven by the 
sale of our German business, and a 
reduction in energy consumption in our 
UK offices and the GRIP REIT portfolio 
on a like-for-like basis.
Our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 
greenhouse gas emissions from our 
UK residential and GRIP REIT property 
portfolios have increased due to the 
acquisition and development of large 
properties including our first Build to 
Rent property, Abbeville Apartments.
Governance
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 87 Our greenhouse gas emissions per £m 
value of assets under management have 
increased slightly due to a reduction in 
the number of assets following the sale 
of our German assets and our Equity 
Release Division.
Methodology
Grainger follows the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Standard (revised edition) 
and ISO14064: Part 1 standard for its 
reporting. In alignment with the UK 
Government Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines, we have used the 2016 
emissions conversion factor for the 
Oct 2015 – Sep 2016 reporting year. 
We have reported on all emissions 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013. We have used 
the operational control consolidation 
method. These sources fall within our 
consolidated financial statement. 
In 2015 the GHG Protocol guidance 
was updated advising organisations to 
provide separate figures to reflect the 
market and location based emissions 
resulting from purchased electricity.  
The location-based method uses 
average emissions intensity of the grid 
network for that area; the market-based 
method uses emissions based on 
purchasing decisions made by Grainger. 
For market-based emissions there is a 
reporting hierarchy and Grainger has 
used contractual instruments where 
there is data readily available. We 
purchase 100% renewable electricity 
tariffs for GRIP REIT plc which has 
resulted in reduced Scope 2 emissions 
using the market-based approach. 
Where no contractual data is available 
we use residual mix factors.
Scope 1 data
This includes landlord-obtained gas 
consumed in common areas and by 
tenants on an unmetered basis as well 
as fuel consumption in vehicles owned 
or leased by Grainger plc. Fugitive 
emissions are not included as they 
have been assessed to be immaterial.
Scope 2 data
This includes landlord-obtained 
electricity consumed in common 
areas and by tenants on an unmetered 
basis as well as electricity consumed 
by Grainger plc in its own offices. 
There is no purchased heat or steam.
Scope 3 data
This includes emissions from electricity 
used by Grainger’s tenants in its 
UK buildings based on EPC analysis 
and extrapolation. Emissions from 
the transmission and distribution of 
Grainger’s Scope 2 electricity are 
included. We also report emissions from 
business travel and from contractors on 
our development sites and for services 
delivered by our repairs and maintenance 
contractor. No other Scope 3 emissions 
are included.
Restatements
We have recalculated emissions for 2015 
as we are able to report more accurate 
data for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
from energy consumption in owned 
properties and fuel consumption in 
leased vehicles. In addition we have also 
restated our Scope 3 emissions from 
electricity transmission and distribution 
losses for our offices and owned 
properties. We are also able to report 
more accurate data for our business 
travel Scope 3 emissions.
Intensity metrics
We have used three intensity metrics: 
emissions by market value of assets 
under management (tCO
2e/£m value 
of AUM), emissions per the number of 
owned units (tCO
2e/owned unit) and 
emissions per number of employees 
in line with our financial reporting 
(tCO
2e/employee).
International operations
The remainder of our German portfolio 
is managed on our behalf by local asset 
and property managers.
Health and safety
Grainger has a well-developed 
Health and Safety Management 
System for the internal and external 
control of health and safety risks, which 
is managed by the Health and Safety 
Director. This includes the use of 
online risk management systems for 
the identification, mitigation and 
reporting of real time health and safety 
management information. The Group 
Health and Safety Committee consists of 
members from across the organisation. 
The Committee continues to monitor the 
delivery of legal compliance in health and 
safety through audit and implementation 
of improvements to enable the Group to 
become ‘best in class’.
Employment of disabled persons
The Company gives full and fair 
consideration to applications for 
employment made by disabled persons, 
having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities. In the event of 
an employee becoming disabled every 
effort is made to ensure that their 
employment within the Company 
continues and that appropriate training is 
arranged where necessary. It is the policy 
of the Company that the training, career 
development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of other employees.
Governance – Directors’ report

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 88 Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value 
on the involvement of its employees 
and has continued its practice of keeping 
them informed on matters affecting 
them as employees, for example, 
eligibility to join Company share 
schemes, and on the various factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. 
Communication is made using the 
Company intranet, ‘The Source’, through 
regular newsletters, team meetings, 
presentations by senior management 
and quarterly all-staff conference calls 
hosted by the Executives.
Independent auditors and disclosure 
of information to auditors
As far as each Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Each Director has taken steps that they 
ought to have taken as Directors in 
order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information. 
Political donations
In accordance with the Company’s 
policy, no political donations were 
made in 2016 (2015: £nil).
Takeover directive
On a change of control, the core 
bank facility (included in Note 27 of 
the financial statements) will become 
repayable should alternative terms for 
continuing the facilities not be agreed 
with the lenders within 45 days. In 
addition the corporate bond (also 
referred to in Note 27) may become 
repayable following a change of control.
There are no other material matters 
relating to a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid. 
The Directors have confirmed approval 
of the Directors’ report.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 89 Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial 
statements of Grainger plc for the year 
ended 30 September 2016 set out on 
pages 94 to 167 . In our opinion: 
 the financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 30 September 2016 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the 
European Union; 
 the parent company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework; and
 the financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006; and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above 
on the financial statements the risks 
of material misstatement that had 
the greatest effect on our audit, in 
decreasing order of audit significance, 
were as follows (unchanged from 2015):
Valuation of investment properties 
(investment properties £261.3m) 
(2015: £357.8m) 
Risk vs 2015: Unchanged
Refer to Annual Report page 55 (Audit 
Committee report), Annual Accounts 
pages 103 to 106 (critical accounting 
estimates and assumptions) and 
Annual Accounts pages 126 and 127 
(accounting policy and financial 
disclosures).
The risk:
Investment property is carried at 
fair value which relies on assumptions 
which are inherently judgemental, in 
some cases unobservable and reflective 
of changing market factors. A small 
adjustment in one or more of these 
assumptions could result in a material 
change in the carrying value of 
investment properties.
The valuation approach adopted by 
the Directors varies between portfolios 
in order to reflect the nature of each 
type of asset:
 For the Tricomm portfolio, 
valuation is based on a discounted 
cash flow model produced by an 
external valuer. There is a risk that 
the significant assumptions of house 
price inflation (‘HPI’) and discount 
rates are inappropriate.
 For properties let into the private 
rental market, valuation is derived 
by applying a gross initial yield to 
the estimated rental value of the 
property. The yield applied is based 
on market evidence for comparable 
properties and rental growth 
prospects. Rental value is based 
on existing tenancy agreements, 
condition and comparable market 
evidence. Assessing these factors 
and determining the appropriate 
comparable evidence involves a 
high degree of judgement.
 Property held in UK residential 
portfolios is valued by determining 
vacant possession value (‘VP’) and 
deriving fair value by applying a 
discount to reflect the fact that the 
property is tenanted. The Directors 
are assisted in arriving at VP by the 
in-house surveying team and engage 
an external valuer to re-perform a 
sample of valuations. The external 
valuer also provides recommendations 
for the level of discount to apply from 
VP to fair value. VP and the discount 
are based on data derived from 
comparable market transactions. 
The determination of the appropriate 
data requires significant judgement.
For all valuations there is a risk that 
inaccurate or incomplete information is 
used by the in-house surveying team or 
the external valuers in their valuation.
Our response:
We engaged a property valuation 
expert to assist us in assessing the 
methodologies and key assumptions 
used in the valuations adopted 
by the Directors for use in the 
financial statements.
Our procedures to address the risks 
in relation to the three categories of 
property identified above included:
The Tricomm portfolio
 comparing the key assumptions, 
included in the discounted cash 
flow model relating to HPI and 
to market indices;
 assessing discount rates against 
market information including 
gilt rates and benchmarked 
risk premiums;
Private rented sector blocks
 considering the degree of 
comparability and the quality of 
the market evidence used by the 
valuer in determining estimated 
rental value; and
 assessing the yield rates applied 
through our understanding of 
the nature of the assets and 
benchmarking against market data.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 90
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Grainger plc only Property held in UK residential portfolios
 assessing the design of the valuations 
process and sample testing Directors’ 
valuations to evaluate if they have 
been prepared in accordance with 
the process; 
 attending the regional meetings 
between the independent external 
valuer and the Group, for properties 
where there is a variance above a set 
percentage between the VP from the 
external valuer and the Director’s 
valuation. By attending these 
meetings, together with our valuation 
expert, we assessed the degree of 
challenge, evidence presented and 
the conclusions reached;
 evaluating the inputs used in the 
valuations against our knowledge 
and experience of the industry, 
including challenging the valuations 
by comparison with market 
comparable transactions and 
changes in industry benchmarks; and
 performing sensitivity analyses over 
the identified key assumptions.
For each separate valuation our 
procedures included testing whether 
the property information provided 
by the Group to the independent 
external valuers and/or used by 
the in- house surveying team was 
complete and accurate. This was 
carried out by assessing the key 
inputs in the Group’s property 
database, such as address, rental 
income, occupancy and current 
tenancy details, through a mixture 
of controls testing, including IT 
controls, and agreeing inputs to 
Group property contracts on a 
sample basis.
We compared the investment 
property value recorded in the 
financial statements to the independent 
external valuers’ reports and assessed 
the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
about the sensitivities and inputs to the 
valuations in accordance with relevant 
accounting standards.
Carrying value of inventories (trading 
properties) (£904.3m) (2015: £1,152.2m) 
Risk vs 2015: Unchanged
Refer to Annual Report page 55 
(Audit Committee report), Annual 
Accounts pages 103 to 106 (critical 
accounting estimates and assumptions) 
and Annual Accounts page 133 
(accounting policy and financial 
disclosures). 
The risk: 
Trading properties are held in 
inventories at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value (‘NRV’). Generally, the 
Group’s strategy is to sell trading stock 
on vacancy, and therefore the NRV of 
existing residential properties is the net 
proceeds expected on sale with vacant 
possession. An assessment of the NRV 
is carried out by reference to VP which, 
as outlined in relation to investment 
property, requires significant judgement 
to determine.
For land and property developments 
where the intention is to sell on 
completion, NRV is the forecast 
selling price less the remaining costs 
to construct and sell. The key risk is 
that development inventories continue 
to be held at cost when an impairment 
should be recognised, because the 
total forecast profits on the individual 
developments may be overestimated. 
Our response: 
Residential trading property
The procedures outlined above in 
relation to assessing the process for 
the valuation of residential portfolio 
investment properties also formed 
part of the response to this risk. Other 
procedures included:
 comparing the value carried in the 
balance sheet with the sales price 
achieved for a selection of property 
sales after the balance sheet date, 
and for sales throughout the year 
as a review of the past accuracy 
of the Group’s estimates; and
 confirming the mathematical 
accuracy of, and completeness 
and accuracy of inputs to, the 
Directors’ assessment and 
sensitising the assessment.
Development trading property
We performed a detailed risk assessment 
at an individual development level to 
identify the sites where an impairment 
may be required to reduce the carrying 
amount below cost. This included 
comparison of the carrying value 
with market value, estimated by the 
independent external valuer of the site 
in its current condition, based on 
comparable sales.
For sites where the intention is to 
sell without further development, 
comparing the carrying value of 
inventory to the market value of the 
site in its current condition, was one 
of our key procedures in challenging 
NRV assessment.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 91
Financial Statements For sites where the intention is to sell 
on completion, for a sample informed 
by our risk assessment, we inspected 
the Group’s plans and forecasts used 
to support the NRV assessment, 
challenged assumptions against 
third- party data, and against experience 
of actual costs and revenues and 
performed sensitivity analyses to assess 
the headroom before an adjustment to 
the carrying value is required. 
We also considered the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures about the 
degree of estimation involved before 
an adjustment to the carrying value 
is required.
3 Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
We applied materiality at the financial 
statement level and a lower materiality 
for specific significant accounts. The 
materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at 
£15.0m (2015: £4.0m), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of 
Group total assets, of which it 
represents approximately 1% (2015: 
£4.0m representing approximately 5% 
of Group profit before tax normalised to 
exclude non-recurring items, as 
disclosed in Note 4 and averaged over 
three years to reduce volatility, of 
£74. 1m). We concluded that determining 
materiality based on total assets was 
more consistent with industry peers and 
appropriately reflects the nature of 
the business.
In addition, we applied lower materiality 
of £3. 1 million to the specific income 
statement items which depict the 
trading performance of the Group, 
which exclude valuation movements, 
taxation and results of discontinued 
operations. We believe misstatement of 
these specific income statement items 
of a lesser amount than materiality for 
the financial statements as a whole 
could reasonably be expected to 
influence the Company’s members’ 
assessment of the financial 
performance of the Group.
We report to the Audit Committee 
any corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £0.45m (2015: 
£0.20m), or exceeding £0. 15m where 
they relate to specific significant trading 
balances listed above, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Following the business disposals in 
Germany (as disclosed in Note 3), the 
Group team performed the audit of the 
Group as if it was a single aggregated 
set of financial information. The audit 
was performed using the materiality 
levels set out above and covered 100% 
of total Group revenue, Group profit 
before tax and total Group assets (in 
2015, we identified two components, 
the UK and Germany. The UK 
component was subject to a full-scope 
audit performed to component 
materiality of £3.7m. The German 
component was subject to audit of 
specific balances and classes of 
transactions. German component 
materiality was £2.0m. The UK and 
German component audits covered 
100% of Group revenue, 100% of 
Group profit before tax and 100% 
of Group total assets).
4 Our opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 the information given in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial 
statements.
5  We have nothing to report on the 
disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to: 
 the Directors’ viability statement 
on page 34, concerning the principal 
risks, their management, and, based 
on that, the Directors’ assessment 
and expectations of the Group’s 
continuing in operation over the four 
years to September 2020; or 
 the disclosures in Note 2 to the 
financial statements concerning 
the use of the going concern basis 
of accounting. 
6  We have nothing to report in respect 
of the matters on which we are 
required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, based on the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in 
the Annual Report that contains a 
material inconsistency with either that 
knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading.

Consolidated statement of cash flows
For the year ended 30 September 1
 Accounting policies
Accounting policies applicable across the financial statements are shown below. Accounting policies that are specific to a 
component of the financial statements have been incorporated in the relevant note. 
(a) Basis of preparation
Grainger plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. It is a public limited liability company listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred 
to as the ‘Group’, and equity account the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The parent company financial 
statements present information about the Company and not the Group.
These financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2016 have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has prepared its company financial statements in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101) for the first time this year. Details of the 
change in basis of preparation and its impact are shown in Note 1 to the parent company financial statements. These are 
presented on pages 159 to 167 .
The accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial statements, have, unless otherwise stated, been 
applied consistently to all periods presented in the Group financial statements. Other than the new accounting policy for 
construction contracts, set out in Note 8, no new accounting policies have been adopted in the year and there has been no 
change to the basis of accounting estimates in the year.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and 
liabilities, and corresponding income statement accounts, which are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative 
financial instruments, financial interest in property assets and assets classified as held-for-sale.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income 
and expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, 
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.
(b) Basis of consolidation
 i) Subsidiaries – Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the entity.
 Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-
consolidated from the date control ceases. 
 Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
100 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements – 
Notes to the financial statements  ii) Joint ventures and associates – Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint 
control, established by contractual agreement. Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant 
influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. 
Where the Group owns less than 50% of the voting rights but acts as property and/or asset manager an assessment 
is made as to whether or not the Group has de facto control over an investee. This includes a review of the Group’s 
rights relative to those of another investor or investors and the ability the Group has to direct the investees’ relevant 
activities (further detail is provided in Note 19).
 Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially 
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Group’s share of the profit  
or loss after the date of acquisition. 
 The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income 
statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Where the Group’s interest has been reduced to £nil, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, 
only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
joint venture or associate. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount  
of the investment. 
 Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The accounting policies of joint ventures and 
associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
 iii) Business combinations – At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents 
the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset. The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business 
combination where an integrated set of activities are acquired in addition to the property. When the acquisition  
of a subsidiary does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of asset and liabilities. The cost  
of acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, and no goodwill or  
deferred tax is recognised.
 iv) Goodwill and impairment – Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of 
the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given and equity instruments issued. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of net identifiable assets including intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date 
of acquisition. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Costs attributable to an acquisition are expensed 
in the consolidated income statement under the heading ‘Other expenses’. 
 Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included within this caption on the statement of financial position. Goodwill  
on acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates. 
 Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for 
impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

 Accounting policies continued
(c) Foreign currencies
i) Functional and presentation currency – Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities 
are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional 
currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Group’s functional 
and presentation currency.
ii)  Foreign currency transactions – Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
the statement of financial position date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that 
date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions are recognised in 
the income statement.
iii)  Foreign operations – The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the statement of financial 
position date. Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for 
the relevant period. Foreign exchange gains and losses, net of deferred income tax, are recognised within other 
comprehensive income.
iv) Net investment hedges – Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow 
hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in 
other comprehensive income within the translation reserve as part of retained earnings. Any gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within ‘Finance costs’. Gains and losses accumulated 
in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
(d) Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting standards and interpretations
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the current financial year 
that have a material impact on the Group. 
The Group is assessing the impact of the following revised standards and interpretations that are not yet effective. Where 
already endorsed by the EU, these changes will be adopted on the effective dates noted. Where not yet endorsed by the EU 
the adoption date is less certain. 
 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 – 2014, effective 2017 financial year;
 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, effective 2019 financial year (not yet endorsed by the EU);
 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective 2018 financial year (not yet endorsed by the EU);
 IFRS 16 Leases, effective 2020 financial year (not yet endorsed by the EU). This standard replaces the exisiting standard, 
IAS17 Leases, where lessee’s are required to make a distinction between a finance lease (on balance sheet) and an operating 
lease (off balance sheet); and 
 IAS 40 Investment Property, proposed amendment. In November 2015 the IASB issued an Exposure Draft on  
a proposed amendment to clarify situations in which properties can be transferred from investment property to  
trading property and vice versa. The IASB further announced in July 2016 that it has now recommended finalising  
this amendment. The Group anticipate that a number of trading properties will be reclassified as investment property 
as a consequence of the amendment. 
Of the other IFRSs that are available for early adoption, none are expected to have a material impact on the  
financial statements.

 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group’s significant accounting policies are stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements. Not all of these 
accounting policies require management to make subjective or complex judgements or estimates. The following is intended 
to provide further detail relating to those accounting policies that management consider critical because of the level of 
complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
The Group performs sensitivity analysis as part of the risk management process and we have set out below on page 106 the 
impact of changes to key assumptions adopted. 
Valuation of residential property 
The Group’s residential trading property is carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. The Group’s investment property is carried in the statement of financial position at fair value. The Group does, however, 
in its principal non-GAAP net asset value measures, EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, include trading stock at market value. The 
market value of the Group’s property which, in the case of investment property, is the same as fair value is detailed below. 
The results and the basis of each valuation and their impact on both the statutory financial statements and market value for 
the Group’s non-GAAP net asset value measures are set out below:

 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
i) Residential
The Group’s own in-house qualified surveying team provided a vacant possession value for the majority of the Group’s UK 
residential properties as at 30 September 2016. A structured sample of these in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP ,  
an external independent valuer. Valuing the large number of properties in the portfolio is a significant task. For this reason,  
it is undertaken on an external inspection basis only. Invariably, when the in-house valuations are compared to those of the 
external valuer, around 75% of the valuations are within a small acceptable tolerance. Where the difference is more significant  
this is discussed with the valuer to determine the reasons for the difference. Typically, the reasons vary but it could be, for 
example, that further or better information about internal condition is available or that respective valuers have placed a 
different interpretation on comparable sales. Once such reasons have been identified the Group and the valuer agree the 
appropriate valuation that should be adopted as the Directors’ valuation. 
Overall, across all of the properties valued by Allsop LLP, the Directors’ valuations were approximately 0.03% lower than the 
Allsop LLP values.
Allsop LLP has provided the Directors with the following opinion on the Directors’ valuation: ‘Property held in the UK Residential 
portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2016 by Grainger’s in-house surveyors. These valuations were reviewed and approved 
by the Directors. Allsop LLP has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Directors’ valuation and they are satisfied with the 
process by which the in-house valuations were conducted. As part of the review, Allsop LLP valued approximately 53% of the 
UK Residential portfolio, independently of the Group. Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP has concluded that they 
have a high degree of confidence in those Directors’ valuations.’ Allsop LLP also recommend the discount to apply to the vacant 
possession valuations to establish the market value of each property. For property in the UK Residential portfolio the discounts 
are established by tenancy type and are based on evidence gathered by Allsop LLP from recent transactional market evidence. 
After due consideration and challenge of Allsop LLP , the Directors have adopted all of the recommendations made by Allsop LLP in 
relation to the discounts. Compared to the discounts adopted in 2015, the discounts adopted in 2016 have increased the market 
value of trading stock in the Group’s non-GAAP net asset measures by £8.0m and increased the valuation gain in the income

ii) Grainger Invest (‘GInvest’)
All of the property owned by the Group in the GInvest portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2016 by Allsop LLP .
The market values of the properties subject to the assumption that the dwellings would be sold individually, which is deemed to 
be the highest and best use, in their existing condition, and subject to any existing leases or tenancies was provided by Allsop LLP . 
The valuer’s opinion of market value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’s-length terms. 
iii) Tricomm Housing 
Allsop LLP has also valued as at 30 September 2016 the property assets owned by the Group and let under a long-term lease 
arrangement with the Secretary of State for Defence under a PFI Project Agreement. Allsop LLP has provided an Investment 
Valuation which is defined as ‘the value of an asset to the owner or a prospective owner for individual investment or operational 
objectives’. The Investment Valuation has been made in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards, and is based 
on a discounted cash flow model.
Significant unobservable inputs within the valuation relate to assumptions for house price inflation and the discount rates to 
apply to the cash flows. The assumptions adopted for house price inflation are 2.5% in 2017 , 3.5% in 2018 and 2019, 3.0% in 
2020 and 2021 and 2.75% thereafter. The discount rates applied to the cash flows range between 3.5% and 9.25%.

continued iv) CBRE – Development
The current market value of the Group’s land and property held within the development segment has been assessed by CBRE 
Limited who are external independent valuers. Their valuation, representing 94% of the total value of development trading 
stock, is on the basis of fair value as defined in the RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same  
as market value. The remaining 6% of the portfolio is a Directors’ valuation. 
v) CBRE – Abbeville Apartments
CBRE have also assessed the current market value of the Abbeville Apartments. The principal approach was to value the 
apartments on an income capitalisation basis, having regard to prevailing market conditions and evidence, and with close 
regard to the relativity between the Market Value and the aggregate vacant possession value. The valuation has been 
prepared in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.
v) Joint ventures and Associates
Property assets in the joint venture Walworth Investment Properties Limited (‘WIP’) are valued on the same basis as the 
GInvest portfolio. Property assets in the associate, GRIP REIT Plc were valued at 30 June 2016 by external valuers, CBRE 
Limited. In aggregate, the valuation of the individual dwellings as at 30 June 2016 was £599.9m for all assets still held at 
September. After full consideration of house price movements in those areas where GRIP property assets are situated 
the Group’s Directors made no adjustment to the 30 June 2016 valuations based on the movement in house price indices 
to 30 September 2016, in assessing the Group’s share of GRIP net assets for the purposes of the Group’s accounts to 
30 September 2016. 
The Directors consider the valuations provided by external valuers to be representative of fair value.
As required by RICS Valuation Professional Standards, all of the external valuers in the UK mentioned above have made full 
disclosure of the extent and duration of their work for, and fees earned by them from, the Group, which in all cases are less  
than 5% of their total fees.
Valuation of financial interest in property assets (CHARM)
The valuation methodology adopted for the CHARM asset is set out in Note 21 to the accounts. 
The key assumptions affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate. The assumptions used to value 
the asset adopt an increase in house prices of between 2.5% and 4.0% per annum. 
A discount rate of 3.5% has been applied to the interest income and a rate of 6.5% has been applied to the projected proceeds 
from sales of the underlying properties, reflecting the risk profile of each individual stream. In previous years, a single discount 
rate had been adopted. 
The fair value of the interest changes as cash flows are realised and an increase of £2.9m (2015: increase of £nil) in the fair value 
has been recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the available-for-sale reserve. 
Credit risk arises from the credit exposure relating to cash receipts from the financial instrument. All of the cash receipts are 
payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired 
amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.

 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
Net realisable value of trading property
The Group’s residential trading properties are carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. 
As the Group’s business model is to sell trading stock on vacancy, net realisable value is the net sales proceeds which the Group 
expects on sale of a property with vacant possession. 
The Group has a net realisable value provision of £3.2m as at 30 September 2016 (2015: £2.3m) to write down the value of its 
trading properties to the lower of cost and net realisable value. This provision relates primarily to properties expected to be sold 
ultimately at vacant possession value. The provision includes specific properties which are vacant and properties we expect to 
become vacant on the assumption of an annual vacancy rate of 7 .3%.
After releasing part of the opening provision against sales made in the year, in aggregate, a charge of £2.7m has been made 
in the 2016 income statement (2015: charge of £1.2m).
For land and property held within the Development segment of the business, net realisable value is the expected net sales 
proceeds of the developed property and a provision is made when, and to the extent that, total projected project costs exceed 
total projected project revenues. Where land and property is sold without development, net realisable value is the current 
market value net of associated selling costs. Decisions regarding whether to develop a site or to sell a site undeveloped are 
made by the Directors based on market conditions prevailing at the time. 
A charge of £0. 1m has been made in the 2016 income statement (2015: charge of £0.2m) in adjusting the book value of 
development stock to net realisable value.

Distinction between investment and trading property
The Group considers the intention at the outset when each property is acquired in order to classify the property as either an 
investment or a trading property. Where the intention is to either trade the property or where the property is held for immediate 
sale upon receiving vacant possession within the ordinary course of business, the property is classified as trading property. 
Where the intention is to hold the property for its long-term rental yield and/or capital appreciation, the property is classified 
as an investment property.

Notes to the financial statements 
continued Derivative financial instruments
Fair value measurements for derivative financial instruments are obtained from quoted market prices and/or valuation 
models as appropriate. When not directly observable in active markets, the fair value of derivative contracts must be computed 
internally based on internal assumptions as well as directly observable market information, including forward and yield curves for 
commodities, currencies and interest. Changes in internal assumptions and forward curves could materially impact the internally 
computed fair value of derivative contracts, particularly long-term contracts, resulting in corresponding impact on income or loss 
in the consolidated income statement. The Group utilises an external independent valuer, J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to 
provide recommendations on the internal assumptions which have been fully adopted by the Directors.
Accounting for unusual contracts 
In 2012, the Group entered into a contractual arrangement to build PRS properties on behalf of the Royal Borough of 
Kensington and Chelsea (‘RBKC’). The Group will manage and fund the construction of a number of sites, and will receive 
a developers priority return from the sale of units to third parties as they are completed. The construction contract is being 
accounted for as a cost plus contract in line with International Accounting Standard 11 – Construction Contracts. Revenue 
of £24.1m has been recognised in the year but, as the project is in the early stage of development, no trading profit has yet 
been recorded. 
Once completed, under a separate arrangement, Grainger will manage the retained units on behalf of RBKC. 
Adjusted earnings 
Adjusted earnings is one of Grainger’s key performance indicators. The metric is utilised as a key measure to aid understanding 
of the performance of the continuing business and excludes valuation movements and non-recurring items that are one-off in 
nature, which do not form part of the normal ongoing revenue or costs of the business and, either individually or in aggregate, 
are material to the reported Group results. The classification of amounts as non-recurring is a significant judgement made by 
management and is a matter referred to the Audit Committee for approval.
Non-recurring in 2016 primarily comprises a £10.7m profit from our investment in Prague, restructuring costs of £2.6m, 
an additional provision of £1.3m relating to the provision of a pension and BUPA medical cover to former employees of 
the company and BPT Limited, and income of £0.8m related to the outcome of a claim against a contractor.
As the business simplifies, management’s view is that the need for items to be classified as non-recurring will reduce.
Going concern
The Directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future. The Directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded that it is appropriate to  
prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis. The main considerations were as follows:
i) Covenant compliance 
The Group’s core banking facility has two covenants, being loan-to-value (‘LTV’) and interest cover. At 30 September  
2016, the LTV was 35.9% compared to a default level of 75% and the interest cover ratio was 3.86 times compared to 
a minimum requirement of 1.35 times. The Group has other bank debt and a £275m corporate bond on which there are 
also covenant requirements. As at 30 September 2016, the Group is operating comfortably within these requirements. 
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s financial projections covering a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond 
the date of signing of these financial statements, and which include covenant compliance forecasts. These projections 
show that the Group will comfortably meet its covenant requirements.

 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
ii) Banking facilities 
The Group’s existing core facilities were £580.0m on 30 September 2016, of which £302.1m were drawn. The Group had 
free cash balances plus available overdraft of £43.1m and undrawn committed facilities of £277.9m, in total, ‘headroom’, of 
£321.0m at 30 September 2016. The Directors have reviewed the available headroom of the Group, and confirmed that even 
without any further management actions, the Group has sufficient resources to meet future repayments as they fall due. 
As has been demonstrated over the past few years, the Group is able to generate strong cash flows even in very difficult 
general market conditions. The Group’s cash flow projections confirm that the Group will remain well within its facilities for 
a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements.
In addition, as set out on page 34, the Directors have considered the Group’s viability in detail over a four-year period to 
September 2020.

 Discontinued operations
Accounting Policy
Discontinued operations 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly 
distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:
 represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
 is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale. 
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be 
classified as held-for-sale. For the discontinued operation, the comparable statement of profit or loss and OCI has been 
re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year. 
Assets held for sale 
Assets are classified as held-for-sale, as defined by IFRS 5, when the assets are available-for-sale in their present condition, 
the sale is highly probable and it is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. 
Non-current assets classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to  
sell. Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial 
position. On re-classification, investment property that is measured at fair value continues to be measured at fair value.
The Group identified certain of its investment properties as held-for-sale in 2016 in accordance with the criteria set out 
in IFRS 5. 
During the financial year, the Group has disposed of the Retirement Solutions division, other than the CHARM portfolio which 
has been retained, and the majority of the German operations. These operations have been classified as discontinued and the 
prior period consolidated income statement, and where appropriate, related supporting notes to the financial statements, have 
been restated to exclude these operations. The Retirement Solutions business has been classified as a discontinued operation 
despite the retention of the CHARM assets as these are clearly distinguishable cash flows.

 Segmental information
Accounting Policy
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be identified based upon the Group’s internal reporting to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) so that the CODM can make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments 
and assess their performance. The Group’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. Following the disposal of the Retirement 
Solutions and German Residential operations, the three significant segments for continuing operations are outlined below. 
 Residential;
 Development; and
 Funds
The two segments Retirement Solutions and German Residential, which are now classified as discontinued, are combined 
and analysed in Note 3. The title “Other” has been included in the tables below to reconcile the segments to the figures 
reviewed by the CODM. The key operating performance measure of profit or loss used by the CODM is adjusted earnings 
before tax, valuation and non-recurring items. The CODM reviews by segment two key balance sheet measures of net asset 
value. These are EPRA Net Asset Value (‘EPRA NAV’) and EPRA Triple Net Asset Value (‘EPRA NNNAV’).
Information relating to the Group’s operating segments is set out in the tables below. The tables distinguish between 
adjusted earnings, valuation and non-recurring items and should be read in conjunction with Note 4.

Segmental revenue from external customers for continuing operations is all derived from UK customers.

Segmental assets
The majority of the Group’s properties are held as trading stock and are therefore shown in the statutory statement of financial 
position at the lower of cost and net realisable value. This does not reflect the market value of the assets and, accordingly, our 
key statement of financial position measures of net asset value include trading stock at market value. The two principal net 
asset value measures reviewed by the CODM are EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV.
NAV is the statutory net assets plus the adjustment required to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts 
value of the lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value. In addition, the statutory statement of financial position 
amounts for both deferred tax on property revaluations and derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including 
those in joint ventures and associates, are added back to statutory net assets. Finally, the market value of Grainger plc shares 
owned by the Group are added back to statutory net assets.
NNNAV reverses some of the adjustments made between statutory net assets and NAV. All of the adjustments for the value 
of derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are reversed. The 
adjustment for the deferred tax on property revaluations is also reversed. In addition, adjustments are made to net assets 
to reflect the fair value, net of deferred tax, of the Group’s fixed rate debt and to deduct from net assets the contingent tax 
calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the adjustment to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory 
accounts value of the lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value.
These measures are set out below by segment along with a reconciliation to the summarised statutory statement of 
financial position.

 Profit on disposal of trading property – continuing operations
Accounting Policy
Property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the buyer. This is deemed 
to be on legal completion. Profits or losses are calculated by reference to the carrying value of the property sold. For a 
development property this is assessed through the use of a gross margin for the site as a whole or such other basis that 
provides an appropriate allocation of costs.
Contract revenue and expenses from construction contracts is recognised in the income statement in accordance with 
the stage of completion of the contract. Contract costs incurred that relate to future activities are deferred and recognised 
as inventory.

 Tax 
Accounting Policy
The taxation charge for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The charge is recognised in 
the income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior 
periods and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with 
a release of the associated deferred tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will give rise to a future 
tax liability against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax 
authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Deferred tax balances are disclosed as follows:  
Deferred tax assets: non-current assets 8.6 12.0
Deferred tax liabilities: non-current liabilities (30.2) (32.3)
Deferred tax (21.6) (20.3)
Deferred tax has been predominantly calculated at a rate of 17% (2015: 20%). 
In addition to the tax amounts shown above, the Group has a contingent tax liability representing the difference between the 
carrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value. This contingent tax, which is 
not provided in the financial statements, amounts to £110.4m (2015: £137.5m). 
It is not possible for the Group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year 
and those expected in greater than one year. This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities, will 
be determined by factors outside the control of the Group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve 
movements. However, given the long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly 
be crystallised in a period greater than one year.

Factors that may affect future tax charges
Changes to the main rate of corporation tax, which falls to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020, have been 
reflected in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, a number of changes to the UK corporate tax 
system have been proposed and will be reflected in the Group’s tax accounts, as required, once substantively enacted.

 Earnings per share
Accounting Policy
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and 
held both in Trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), Deferred Bonus 
Plan (‘DBP’) and SAYE schemes, on which the dividends are being waived. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue by the dilutive effect  
of ordinary shares that the Company may potentially issue relating to its share option schemes and contingent share awards 
under the LTIP and DBP , based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2016 was the end of the 
contingency period. Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of 
diluted earnings per share.

 Investment property
Accounting Policy
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the companies 
in the consolidated Group, is classified as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, 
if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specified asset. If this information is not available, 
the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow 
projections. Investment property falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13. Further details are 
given in Note 28.
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of the property when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs 
and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the Group’s investment properties are included in the income 
statement of the period in which they arise.
Where specific investment properties are expected to sell within the next 12 months their fair value is shown under assets 
classified as held-for-sale within current assets. Any loss on the reclassification of these assets from investment properties 
to assets held-for-sale is charged to the income statement of the period in which this occurs.

The Group has valued all of its investment property as at 30 September 2016 at fair value. The current use of the property  
is considered to be highest and best use.
Information relating to the basis of valuation of investment property, the use of external independent valuers, and the 
judgements and assumptions adopted by management is set out in Note 2 ‘Critical accounting estimates and assumptions’. 
The fees paid to the independent valuers were not on a contingent basis.

Notes to the financial statements 
continued A net revaluation gain of £19.4m has arisen on valuation of investment property to fair value as at 30 September 2016 
comprising £20.3m on the continuing business and a deficit of £0.9m on the discontinued operations (2015: £13.9m of which 
£14.6m is continuing and a deficit of £0.7m is discontinued operations) and this has been taken to the income statement. 
The historical cost of the Group’s investment property as at 30 September 2016 is £219.8m (2015: £362.2m). 
Rental income from investment property during the year was £19.6m (2015: £20.8m).
Direct property repair and maintenance costs arising from investment property that generated rental income during the year 
was £5. 1m (2015: £7 .6m). 
Exchange adjustments of £7.6m (2015: decrease of £8.0m) relate to the Group’s German Residential property prior to its 
disposal. This reflects the movement in the Sterling/Euro exchange rate and is recognised within other comprehensive income.

 Investment in associates continued
Although the Group acts as property and/or asset manager for the GRIP REIT PLC, the remaining equity is held by a single 
investor. This investor is actively involved in the business and in controlling the key financial and operational activities of the 
business. Accordingly, the Group does not have de facto control of the entity. 
G:Res 1 Limited has now been voluntarily wound up and the Group no longer provides any management services to it. Although 
the Group’s equity interest in Vesta LP is 15%, the investment is being equity accounted as an associate as the Group is 
exercising significant influence through its representation on the Board. 
The accounting period end for the GRIP REIT PLC is 31 December 2016. The results for the 12 months to 30 September 2016

is 31 March. The results for the 12 months to 30 September 2016 and the financial position as at that date have been equity 
accounted in these financial statements.
The proposed High Speed Rail Link (‘HS2’) from London to Birmingham indicates that the potential route will cover at least 
part of our development site at Curzon Park in Birmingham. We are assessing the long-term impact with our advisers and 
aim to collaborate with other affected owners in the area as well as with HS2 Ltd, the company responsible for developing 
and promoting this new rail link. 
The Group has reversed part of the impairment provision held against the investment, crediting £4.7m to the income 
statement in the year (2015: £3.2m impairment provision). The carrying value at 30 September 2016 of £9.5m (2015: £4.8m) 
has been provided by CBRE Limited, the Group’s external, independent valuers for its development assets. This is based 
on the value the site may have as a development opportunity discounted to reflect the uncertainty around HS2 and the 
Compulsory Purchase Order process. 
In August 2016 the three companies in Prague in which the Group held a 50% equity stake, sold all of their development land. 
The Group’s share of proceeds amounted to £16.7m. The Group has recorded a profit of £10.7m from its Prague Investment

 Financial interest in property assets
Accounting Policy
Financial interest in property assets is initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at 
fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, the net change in value recorded is as follows: i) the carrying value of the assets 
is increased by the effective interest rate; ii) Cash received from the instrument in the year is deducted from the carrying 
value of the asset; and iii) the carrying value of the assets is revised to the net present value of the updated projected cash 
flows arising from the instrument using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition. The change in value arising 
from i) and iii) above is recorded through the income statement and is shown on the line ‘Income from financial interest in 
property assets’.
Differences between the updated projected cash flows using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition compared 
to updated projected cash flows using a year end effective interest rate, assessed as the rate available in the market for an 
instrument with a similar maturity and credit risk, are taken through other comprehensive income with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying value of the assets. When gains or losses in the assets are realised, the accumulated fair value 
adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement as gains and losses from financial interest in 
property assets.

Financial interest in property assets relates to the CHARM portfolio, which is a financial interest in equity mortgages held 
by the Church of England Pensions Board as mortgagee. It is accounted for under IAS 39 in accordance with the designation 
available-for-sale financial assets and is valued at fair value. 
The CHARM portfolio is considered to be a Level 3 financial asset as defined by IFRS 13. The key assumptions used to value 
the asset are set out within Note 2 ‘Critical accounting estimates and assumptions’, and the financial asset is included in the 
fair value hierarchy within Note 28.

Accounting Policy
Intangible assets comprise computer software and goodwill.
IT software is amortised on a straight-line basis over 4 to 7 years being the estimated useful lives of the assets, from the date

Goodwill is tested for impairment based on a value in use calculation at each reporting date.

 Inventories 
Accounting Policy
Tenanted residential properties held-for-sale in the normal course of business are shown in the financial statements as a 
current asset at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes legal and surveying charges and introducer fees 
incurred during acquisition together with improvement costs. 
Land and property held within the development segment of the business are shown in the financial statements at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents the acquisition price including legal and other professional costs associated with the acquisition together 
with subsequent development costs net of amounts transferred to costs of sale. 
Net realisable value is the expected sale proceeds that the Group expects on sale of a property or current market value 
net of associated selling costs.

 Trade and other receivables
Accounting Policy
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment in trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. The amount of the provision is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective 
interest rate. The movement in the provision is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability 
for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

Information about the Group’s exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risks is included in Note 28. 
The £0.6m debit shown above under current liabilities for the Corporate bond and the £1.5m debit shown under bank loans 
represent issue costs that will be amortised to the income statement during the next financial year. The Corporate bond and 
bank loans do not mature until 2020.
The analysis of the loans and borrowings in the below tables (a) to (d) is before deducting unamortised issue costs of £9.0m 
(2015: £11. 1m) relating to the raising of the loan finance. It also includes the premium raised on the second issue (tap issue) on 
the corporate bond, which is treated as a liability on the balance sheet and amortised using the effective interest rate method. 
As at 30 September 2016, the unamortised premium was £0.6m (2015: £0.7m). In addition, for 2015 only, the balances shown 
are before adding a fair value adjustment of £8.2m arising from the acquisition of debt.

 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments
Accounting Policies
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative instruments to help manage its interest rate risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group 
does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. Derivatives are classified as current assets and current liabilities. 
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is 
recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting in which 
case any gain or loss is taken to equity in a cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item 
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective 
on an on-going basis. This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains 
highly effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on a discounted cash flow model using market information.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Derecognition is the point at which the Group removes an asset or a liability from its statement of financial position. The 
Group’s policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset 
expires. The Group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party provided that the transfer of the 
assets also transfers the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset. When the transfer does not result in the Group 
transferring the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset but it does result in the Group assuming a corresponding 
obligation to pay cash flows to another recipient, the financial asset is derecognised.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are the financial interest in property assets. Derivative financial instruments 
not in hedge accounting relationships are classified as fair value through profit and loss.

to revalue these loans to fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Included in cash above is £10.7m (2015: £10.6m) relating to cash held on behalf of tenants, leaseholders and clients comprising 
Service Charge amounts, Sinking Fund balances, tenant deposits and cash held on behalf of joint ventures. These cash amounts 
are held by the Group as agent in separate ring-fenced client bank accounts and are excluded from net debt. In addition £37 .9m 
(2015: £39.8m) of the cash balance is restricted in use by underlying financing arrangements comprising either reserve fund 
amounts or amounts where the release of cash is contingent upon proof of qualifying expenditure.

Financial risk management
The Group’s objectives for managing financial risk are to minimise the risk of adverse effects on performance and to ensure the 
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern while securing access to cost-effective finance and maintaining flexibility to 
respond quickly to opportunities that arise.
The Group’s policies on financial risk management are approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by Group treasury. 
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments 
and investment of excess liquidity. Compliance is monitored by internal audit. Group treasury reports to the Audit Committee.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for 
speculative purposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, 
liquidity risk and market risk, which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit availability risk, house price risk in 
relation to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. The Group’s principal financial 
assets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables. The carrying 
amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk 
without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.

Financial Statements
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 28
 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
The Group’s financial interest in property assets relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of 
England Pensions Board. The Group’s cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered 
to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at 
the year end.
The Group sometimes enters into sales contracts within the Development division under which a proportion of the consideration 
is deferred. Each purchaser is subject to financial due diligence prior to sale and the Group retains a legal charge over the land 
until full and final settlement is received. At 30 September 2016, £nil (2015: £nil) was outstanding. 
The Group also has credit risk relating to trade receivables. Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful, a provision for 
impairment is made. For all Assured Shorthold Tenancies, credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant. 
Regulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent. Lifetime 
tenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk. Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held 
in respect of some leases. Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk 
of trade receivables is considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in 
prior years.
Tenant deposits of £2.0m (2015: £1.5m) are held which provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations 
caused by the tenant. The Group does not hold any other collateral as security. Of the net trade receivables balance of £2.6m, 
we consider Nil to be not due and not impaired. We consider that all of the £4.2m other receivables balance, and all of the 
£50.5m amounts recoverable on contracts as not due and not impaired.
As at 30 September 2016, tenant arrears of £0.5m within trade receivables were impaired and fully provided for (2015: £1.8m). 
The individually impaired receivables are based on a review of outstanding arrears and an assessment of collectability. Impaired 
receivables and receivables not considered to be impaired are not material to the financial statements and, therefore, no 
further analysis is provided. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the Group’s policies of monitoring 
counterparty exposure, monitoring the concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of 
counterparties of good financial standing. At 30 September 2016, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives that had a positive 
value was £0.3m (2015: £2.0m). 
At 30 September 2016, the combined credit exposure arising from cash held at banks, money market deposits and interest rate 
swaps was £80.3m (2015: £80.2m), which represents 5.0% (2015: 4.7%) of total assets. Deposits were placed with financial 
institutions with A- or better credit ratings.
The Group has the following cash and cash equivalents:
2016 
 £m
2015

Pounds Sterling 79.4 83.5
Euros 11.3 5.3
 90.7 88.8
At the year end, £42.3m was placed on deposit (2015: £23.4m) at effective interest rates between 0.2% and 0.3% (2015: 0.4% 
and 0.5%). Remaining cash and cash equivalents are held as cash at bank or in hand.
The Group has an overdraft facility of £1.0m as at 30 September 2016 (2015: £1.0m).

Notes to the financial statements 
continued Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities. 
Although the Group’s core funding is supported by covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the 
entities in the Group of obligors and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the Group level, the loan is not secured 
directly against any property allowing operational flexibility. The Group has operated well within its covenants during 2016  
and as at 30 September 2016 (see Note 2 ‘Critical accounting estimates and assumptions’).
The Group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times. The Group also ensures that it  
has sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks and other sources to allow for operational 
flexibility and to meet committed expenditure. The business is highly cash generative from its sales of vacant properties, gross 
rents and management fees. In adverse trading conditions, tenanted sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be 
stopped. Consequently, the Group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
The following table analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities at the statement of financial 
position date into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date. The amounts 
disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. As the amounts included in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these amounts will not equal the amounts disclosed on the statement of financial position for borrowings, 
derivative financial instruments, trade and other payables and provisions for liabilities and charges. A reconciliation to the statement 
of financial position amounts is given below for borrowings only. T rade and other payables due within 1 2 months equal their carrying 
balances as the impact of discounting is not significant. The cash flows are calculated using yield curves for floating rate interest-
bearing liabilities. Foreign currency related cash flows are calculated by means of the forward rates relevant to each maturity date.

Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, the availability of credit and house 
price movements relating to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio. The Group internally measures its 
market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses. The Directors consider that a +/– 1 percent (2015: 1 percent) 
movement in interest rates, a +/– 10 percentage point (2015: 10 percentage point) movement in Sterling and a +/– 1 percentage 
point (2015: 1 percentage point) movement in house prices represents a reasonable possible change. The approach the Group 
takes to each of these risks is set out below. The Group is not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity 
price risk.
Fair values
IFRS 13 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value. These are as follows:
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
Level 2 –  inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
or indirectly; and
Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at 
rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments. As all significant inputs required to value 
the swaps are observable, they all fall within Level 2.
The CHARM portfolio falls within Level 3, inputs not based on observable market data. The significant unobservable inputs 
affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate. Further details regarding the basis of valuation 
and the sensitivity to changes in the key valuation assumptions are documented in Note 2, ‘Critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions’. Note 21 provides a reconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the income statement and other 
comprehensive income. 
142 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements – 
Notes to the financial statements 
continued Investment property falls within Level 3. The Investment valuations provided by Allsop LLP and CBRE Limited are based on 
RIC’s Professional Valuation Standards, but include a number of unobservable inputs and other valuation assumptions. In prior 
years, investment property has been included within Level 2. However, as all inputs to their valuation on a property by property 
basis are not always observable, investment property is better shown within Level 3 and a transfer has been made in the 
current year to reflect this. Further details of these assumptions and significant unobservable inputs are documented in Note 2, 
‘Critical accounting estimates and assumptions’. The reconciliation between opening and closing balances for Level 3 is detailed 
in the table below.

The Group’s trading property is carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. As trading property is only shown at market value within the Group’s non-GAAP EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV measures 
it has been excluded from the fair value hierarchy table above. If the market value of trading property were included it would 
fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13. The statutory book value of trading property is £904.3m and 
its market value is £649.4m higher at £1,553.7m.
The Group’s fixed rate loans are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised cost. As the fixed rate 
loans are only shown at fair value in the Group’s non-GAAP EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV measures they have been excluded 
from the fair value hierarchy table above. Had they been included they would fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as 
defined in IFRS 13. The statutory book value of fixed rate loans is £275m and their fair value is £301.8m.
Interest rate swaps and caps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap and cap contracts as at 30 September 2016 was 
£462.2m (2015: £493.1m). 
All of the financial derivatives included in the above table were valued by external consultants, J C Rathbone Associates 
Limited, using a discounted cash flow model and market information and were checked internally using a software package.

 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
In accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed its interest rate hedges. In the absence of hedge accounting, movements 
in fair value are taken directly to the income statement. However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective, 
and have been designated as such, any gains or losses have been taken to other comprehensive income through the cash flow 
hedge reserve.
As at 30 September 2016 the Group’s only fixed rate debt was the £275m quoted corporate bond due December 2020, 
which has been valued using quoted market prices, consistent with the approach as at 30 September 2015. JC Rathbone 
Associates Limited has valued the Group’s fixed rate debt on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between 
the fixed rates for the Group’s borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rates of appropriate debt instruments, 
as a fair value adjustment. The fair values compared to the carrying amounts of the Group’s fixed rate financial liabilities are 
analysed below:

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings. The Group 
mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps and caps. This subjects the Group to fair value risk as 
the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates. However, the Group seeks to cash flow 
hedge account where applicable. The Group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk 
and is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving 
the best commercial arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the Group’s hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the Board to 
ensure compliance with this policy. The Board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing 
that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment. The current Group treasury policy is to maintain 
floating-rate exposure of no greater than 30% of expected borrowing. As at 30 September 2016, 87% (2015: 77%) of the 
Group’s net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
Based on the Group’s interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would 
decrease annual profits by £1.8m (2015: an increase of £7 .4m). Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by 
£1.8m (2015: a decrease of £7.4m). 
Based on the Group’s interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would 
increase the Group’s equity by £14.5m (2015: £15.6m). Similarly, a 1% decrease would decrease the Group’s equity by 
£14.5m (2015: £15.6m). 
Upward movements in medium- and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase  
the value of the Group’s interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves. The converse is true for downward 
movements in the interest yield curve. Where the Group’s swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements 
in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.

Notes to the financial statements 
continued As at 30 September 2016, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 
£13. 1m (2015: £5.0m). The total ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges recognised within the income statement totals a gain of 
£nil (2015: £0.4m). The fair value movement on derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships and amounts reclassified 
from equity to the income statement amounted, in aggregate, to a charge of £9.9m (2015 charge restated: £6.3m) in the

Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s foreign exchange risk arises from the exposure due to translating overseas trading performance and overseas net 
assets into Sterling. The Group does not have foreign currency trading with cross border currency flows. The Group hedges 
foreign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency and aims to ensure 
that it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Profit translation is not hedged.

As at 30 September 2016, it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling 
against the Euro would decrease/increase the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.4m (2015: £0.2m) and equity  
by Nil (2015: £0.5m).
Credit availability risk
Credit availability risk relates to the Group’s ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional 
financing where necessary. The Group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom through 
cash and committed borrowings. As at 30 September 2016, the Group had available headroom of £321m. The £100m loan from 
M&G Investments Management Limited was repaid on 6 October 2016. There are no other material maturities of committed 
borrowings until 2020. 
House price risk
The cash flows arising from the Group’s financial interest in property assets (CHARM) and the Tricomm Housing portfolio are 
related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices. 
However, consistent with the Group’s approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties, 
the Group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the Group’s business model.
Capital risk management
The Board manages the Group’s capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections, the ability of the Group to 
meet contractual commitments, covenant tests, dividend cover and gearing. The current capital structure of the Group 
comprises a mix of debt and equity. Debt is both current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as set out 
in the consolidated statement of financial position. Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group loans and borrowings have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios. 
The Board regularly reviews all current and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom 
against key thresholds. Loan to value is reviewed in the context of the Board’s view of markets, the prospects of, and risks 
relating to, the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business. The Group is now operating within a range of gearing 
of 35%–45%, which it considers to be appropriate in the medium term.
The Group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on a regular basis. At 30 September 2016, the 
weighted average cost of debt was 3.9% (2015: 4.6%) and the WACC was 6.02% (2015: 6.22%). Investment and development 
opportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.

 Pension costs
Accounting Policy
i) Defined contribution pension scheme – Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period to which they relate.
ii)  Defined benefit pension scheme – The Group currently contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme that was 
closed to new members and employee contributions in 2003. The full deficit in the scheme was recognised in the 
statement of financial position as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each statement of financial position date by a 
qualified actuary, also under the Projected Unit Credit Method, for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reflected 
in the Group’s financial statements under IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
statement of financial position date less the fair value of scheme assets. The defined benefit obligation is valued by 
projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings (allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation  
to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) and then discounting to the statement 
of financial position date.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and employee contributions. The net 
interest amount, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability, is reflected in the income 
statement each year. Actuarial gains and losses net of deferred income tax are reflected in other comprehensive income 
each year.
Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately 
from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the 
current and prior periods. Pension arrangements for Directors are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Directors’ Remuneration report on pages 62 to 85. The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents 
contributions payable by the Group. The charge of £1.0m (2015: £1.0m) is included within employee remuneration in Note 11. 
Defined benefit scheme
In addition to the above, the Group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement 
Benefits Scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by T rustees and are invested with Rathbones 
Investment Management Limited, an independent investment manager. Pension benefits are linked to the members’ final 
pensionable salaries and service at their retirement date (or date of leaving if earlier). The T rustees are responsible for running 
the scheme in accordance with the scheme’s trust deed and rules, which sets out their powers. The Trustees of the scheme 
are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme. There is a requirement that at least one-third of the 
T rustees are nominated by the members of the scheme. 
There are three categories of pension scheme members:
 Active members: currently employed by the Group. Note no benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003, although active 
members retain a final salary link;
 Deferred members: former employees of the Group; and
 Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.

 Pension costs continued
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments (allowing for future salary 
increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) 
and then discounting to the statement of financial position date. In the period up to retirement, benefits receive increases linked 
to CPI inflation (subject to a cap of no more than 5% p.a.). After retirement, benefits receive fixed increases of 5% p.a. The 
valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Method. The approximate overall duration of the scheme’s defined 
benefit obligation as at 30 September 2016 was 17 years.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the results of the actuarial valuation carried out as at 
1 July 2013, updated to 30 September 2016, by a qualified independent actuary.

Risks
Through the scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks:
 Asset volatility: the scheme’s defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate 
bond yields; however, the scheme also invests in equities. These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in 
the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
 Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the scheme’s defined benefit obligation; 
however, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings. 
 Inflation risk: some of the scheme’s defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result  
in a higher defined benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place). The majority of the scheme’s assets are 
either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also  
increase the deficit.
 Life expectancy: if scheme members live longer than expected, the scheme’s benefits will need to be paid for longer, 
increasing the scheme’s defined benefit obligation.

Future funding obligation 
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was 
performed by the Actuary for the Trustees as at 1 July 2013. This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of £4.4m. As a result 
of this valuation, the Group agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to pay additional contributions to eliminate the deficit 
by 31 January 2020. Based on this plan, the Company expects to pay £0.6m p.a. to the scheme, until 31 January 2020. 
A full actuarial valuation is currently in progress based on the scheme assets and liabilities as at 1 July 2016. The Group and the 
Trustees will review the results of the valuation on completion. In line with paragraph 23 of IFRIC 14, no additional liability is 
recognised as the additional contributions under the funding plan will reduce the future contributions payable into the Scheme. 
Sensitivity analysis
Set out below is an analysis of how the scheme deficit would vary with changes to the key actuarial assumptions:
Discount rate movement of 0.1% p.a. Increase/decrease in deficit of £0.6m
RPI Inflation movement of 0.1% p.a. Increase/decrease in deficit of £0.1m
Life expectancies movement of one year Increase/decrease in deficit of £1.6m

Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans comprising awards under a Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), a Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’), a Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) and a Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) scheme. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee 
expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares 
and options granted. For market-based conditions, the probability of vesting is taken into account in the fair value calculation 
and no revision is made to the number of shares or options expected to vest. For non-market conditions, each year the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of options or shares that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to 
original estimates, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Awards that are subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation 
model. Awards not subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Black Scholes 
valuation model.
When options are exercised the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium.

Acquisition of and investment in own shares
The Group acquires its own shares to enable it to meet its obligations under the various share schemes in operation. No gain or 
loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own shares. The acquisition cost 
of the shares is debited to an investment in own shares reserve within retained earnings. 
Where the Group buys back its own shares as treasury shares it adopts the accounting as described above. Where it 
subsequently cancels them, issued share capital is reduced by the nominal value of the shares cancelled and this same amount 
is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.
The Company operates a SAYE share option scheme available to employees. The number of shares subject to options as at

the third year at which point a 50% matching element is added to their award entitlement. In addition to the normal DBP 
scheme, an enhanced DBP scheme (EDBP) is also provided. The enhanced scheme operates in exactly the same way as the 
normal DBP scheme except that if participants retain their awards within the plan until the end of the fifth year, a further 
additional 50% matching award is added to their award entitlement. Awards under the DBP/EDBP have been valued based 
on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends 
during the vesting period.
Awards under the SAYE scheme have been valued at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Awards under the SIP scheme have been based on the share price at the date of the award.
Shares were awarded, subject to any vesting conditions set out above, to Executive Directors and selected employees during 
the year under the LTIP . Share options were granted to employees of the Group during the year under the SAYE scheme. The 
main assumptions used to value the share awards and SAYE options granted during the year are set out in the tables below.

 Changes in equity
The consolidated statement of changes in equity is shown on pages 97 and 98. Further information relating to the merger 
reserve and cash flow hedge reserve is provided below. Movements on the retained earnings reserve are set out in Note 33. 
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose when the Company issued shares in partial consideration for the acquisition of City North Group plc 
in the year ended 30 September 2005. The issue satisfied the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 (formerly 
Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985) and the premium relating to the shares issued was credited to a merger reserve.
Cash flow hedge reserve 
The fair value movements on those derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are taken  
to this reserve net of tax. 
Available for sale reserve 
The fair value movements in the valuation of the CHARM financial asset, net of tax, are taken to this reserve.

 Operating leases
Accounting Policy
i) Group as lessor – The net present value of ground rents receivable is, in the opinion of the Directors, immaterial. 
Accordingly, ground rents receivable are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Properties leased out to tenants are included in the statement of financial position as either investment property or as 
trading property under inventories.
ii) Group as lessee – The Group occupies a number of its offices as a lessee. After a review of all of its occupational leases, 
the Directors have concluded that all such leases are operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under 
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the lease.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments payable by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
2016 
£m
2015
 £m
Operating lease payments due:
Not later than one year 0.8 1.1
Later than one year and not later than five years 3.7 4.3
Later than five years 1.1 1.9
5.6 7.3
Operating lease payments represent the lease payments made in the year relating to renting of office space used by the Group, 
car leases under contract hire arrangements and operating lease payments relating to office equipment such as photocopiers. 
Leases relating to office space used by the Group have initial terms of varying lengths, between one and ten years. 
Rent reviews generally take place every five years. Contract hire car leases generally have a three-year term. There are no other 
significant operating lease arrangements requiring disclosure under IAS 17 . 
There are no contingent rents recognised within net rental income in 2016 or 2015 relating to properties where the Group acts 
as a lessor of assets under operating leases. A significant proportion of the Group’s non-cancellable operating leases relate to 
Regulated Tenancies under which tenants have the right to remain in a property for the remainder of their lives. It is therefore 
not possible to estimate the timing of future minimum lease payments.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 37
 Contingent liabilities
The properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a ‘guarantee Group’ with a market value of £1,181.1m provide the 
security for the Group’s core debt facility. 
Barclays Bank plc and Lloyds Bank plc have provided guarantees under performance bonds relating to the Group’s UK 
Development division. As at 30 September 2016, total guarantees amounted to £2.3m (2015: £2.8m).
The Group has an obligation, under an agreement for sale in relation to its land at West Waterlooville, to pay further 
consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts. It also has an obligation under a profit sharing 
agreement to share profits above an agreed threshold. It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future 
payments due to the long-term nature of the site’s development and the associated uncertainties. However, our current best 
estimate is that the earliest payment under these arrangements will not be before October/November 2017 and any payments 
are likely to be spread over a number of years.
As explained in more detail in Note 20, there is uncertainty relating to the future of the site at Curzon Park in which the Group 
has a 50% joint venture interest. Should the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to 
recover the carrying value of our investment, the Group may incur further charges in excess of those provided in these financial 
statements, in respect of obligations to the joint venture.

 Post balance sheet events
An irrevocable prepayment notice was delivered to M&G Investments Management Limited on the 29 September 2016, setting 
out the early repayment terms of the £100m term loan due 2021. The loan was subsequently repaid in full on 6 October 2016 
utilising headroom on the Group’s Core Facilities.
On 28 November 2016, the Group agreed and signed two new £50m bi-lateral term loans with HSBC and RBS. The initial term 
of each loan is 5 years. The HSBC facility agreement has an option to extend the maturity for a further one year.
On 28 November 2016, the Group agreed to aquire a PRS, build-to-rent development at Finzels Reach in Bristol for £45.7m.  
The site will deliver 194 private rental homes and is expected to complete at the beginning of 2019.

 Accounting policies
(a)  Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (FRS101). The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost 
convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
These are the first financial statements of the Company to be prepared under FRS 101. The Company’s date of transition to 
FRS 101 is 1 October 2014. The previous financial statements were prepared in accordance with previously applicable UK 
accounting standards. The adoption of FRS 101 has not resulted in any change to the recognition and measurement principles 
previously adopted and so the disclosure requirements of IFRS 1 are not included and the comparatives have not been restated, 
other than for certain presentational changes. The Company has notified its shareholders in writing about, and they do not 
object to, the use of the disclosure exemptions used by the Company in these financial statements. 
The application of FRS 101 has enabled the Company to take advantage of certain disclosure exemptions that would have been 
required had the Company adopted International Financial Reporting Standards in full. The exemptions that have been applied 
in the preparation of these financial statements are:
 A cash flow statement and related notes have not been presented. 
 Disclosures in respect of new standards and interpretations that have been issued but which are not yet effective have not 
been provided.
 Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries have not been made. 
 Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments: DIsclousres have not been made. 
The Company has taken the exemption allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to 
present its own profit and loss account. The loss for the year was £19.7m (2015: £20.5m). These financial statements present 
information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation  
to the Company’s financial statements. 
(b) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost less provision for impairment based upon an assessment of the net 
recoverable amount of each investment. To the extent that the assessment of recoverable amount improves due to change 
in economic conditions, impairment provisions are reversed. 
(c) Tax
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits or losses at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences 
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 161
Financial Statements
 
Notes to the parent company financial statements 1
 Accounting policies continued
(d)  Own shares including treasury shares
Transactions of The Grainger Employee Benefit Trusts are included in the Company’s financial statements. The purchase  
of shares in the Company by each trust and any treasury shares bought back by the Company are debited direct to equity. 
(e) Share-based payments
Under the share-based compensation arrangements set out Note 31, employees of Grainger Employees Limited have been 
awarded options and conditional shares in the Company. These share-based arrangements have been treated as equity-settled 
in the consolidated financial statements. In the Company’s financial statements, the share-based payment charge has been 
added to the cost of investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
(f) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability  
for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

 Introduction
The EPRA Best Practice Recommendations (EPRA BPR) were issued by EPRA’s Reporting and Accounting Committee in  
August 2011 and the guidance has subsequently been updated in December 2014. Included within EPRA BPR are six EPRA 
Performance Measures deemed to be of key importance to investors in property companies and which aim to encourage  
more consistent and widespread disclosure. The EPRA Performance Measures are set out below:
Performance Measure Definition
1) EPRA Earnings Recurring earnings from core operational activities. This is a key measure of a company’s underlying 
operating results providing an indication of the extent to which current dividend payments are 
supported by earnings.
2) EPRA NAV Net asset value adjusted to include properties and other investment interests at fair value and to 
exclude certain items not expected to crystallise in a long-term property business model. This 
measure is consistent with NAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 to the 
Group financial statements.
3) EPRA NNNAV EPRA NAV adjusted to include the fair values of i) financial instruments, ii) debt and iii) deferred taxes. 
This measure is consistent with NNNAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 
to the Group financial statements.
4i) EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY) Annualised rental income based on cash rents at the balance sheet date, less non-recoverable property 
expenses, divided by the market value of the property, increased with (estimated) purchasers’ costs.
4ii) EPRA ‘topped-up’ yield This measure incorporates an adjustment to EPRA NIY in respect of the expiration of rent-free 
periods (or other unexpired lease incentives such as discounted rent periods and step rents).
5) EPRA Vacancy Rate Estimated Market Rent Value (ERV) of vacant space divided by ERV of the whole portfolio.
6) EPRA Cost Ratios This measure includes all administrative and operating expenses including share of joint ventures’ 
overheads and operating expenses, net of any service fees, all divided by gross rental income.
Grainger is supportive of EPRA’s initiative and, in this report, is disclosing against five of the EPRA measures, EPRA Earnings, 
EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY) and EPRA Vacancy Rate. EPRA topped-up NIY is not appropriate to 
Grainger’s business. The EPRA Cost Ratios, too, is less relevant to Grainger as it is distorted by the fact that in the reversionary 
portfolio rental levels are at a sub-market level.
In relation to EPRA NIY and EPRA vacancy rate, the figures shown are in respect of the Grainger wholly-owned market rented 
assets only. Not included in these numbers are Grainger’s wholly-owned reversionary assets or any assets within joint ventures 
or associates.
The numbers presented in the tables below for EPRA Earnings, EPRA Earnings per share, EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy 
Rate, relate to continuing operations only. The 2015 comparatives have been restated to exclude discontinued operations. 
See Note 3 to the financial statements for further details of discontinued operations.

1 Sales of trading property is a fundamental part of Grainger’s business model. Therefore, it is not appropriate to show any measure of earnings that excludes 
profit on sale of trading property and so no adjustment has been made for this in the table above. The adjustment made under this heading in both years 
relates to an impairment provision made against trading stock.

1 The Grainger measures of NAV and NAV per share disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements is equal to the EPRA NAV presented above. The 
adjustment to add the value of the Group’s own shares is recognised as these shares do have a market value and this has been the historical basis of the 
Group’s calculation. In addition, the number of shares used in the NAV calculation is the total number of shares in issue including those held by the Company 
in treasury or trust for the purposes of settling future share awards. This should be a close representation of the fully diluted number of shares and so is very 
unlikely to produce materially different NAV measures.

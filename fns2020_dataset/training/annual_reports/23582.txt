Chairman’s statement
A disciplined approach in a 
challenging environment
Introduction
Welcome to the esure Group plc 2014 
Annual Report, as we look back on 
another year of discipline for the Group, 
in challenging market conditions.
The UK personal lines insurance markets 
remained competitive in 2014, with rate 
reductions characterising both the motor 
and home markets. Some signs of rating 
stabilisation did start to appear in the 
motor market in the latter part of the 
year, but claims inflation returned during 
the second half of the year, with market 
data showing an increase in the 
frequency of small bodily injury claims. 
The industry has been through many 
rating cycles in the past, as indeed have I. 
The Board and management team 
continue to make the right decisions  
to position the Business for further 
growth, when market conditions permit, 
with the aim of delivering long term 
stakeholder value.
In December, the Group announced that 
it is to acquire the outstanding 50% of 
Gocompare, for £95.0 million, valuing 
Gocompare at £190.0 million. 
Gocompare.com is one of the UK’s 
leading financial services brands and a 
leading price comparison website in the 
UK. Personally, I am excited about the 
opportunities available to the Group 
through full ownership of Gocompare as 
we begin to drive its strategic direction.
Performance
The Group’s approach to underwriting 
and focus on expenses enabled us to 
deliver a solid set of financial results in 
2014. Gross written premiums reduced  
in 2014 to £517.8 million, as the Group 
remained disciplined in its rating actions 
during the industry’s transition through 
the soft part of the motor rating cycle.
The Group has a strong financial position 
with robust reserves, a conservative 
investment portfolio and capital 
significantly in excess of the minimum 
regulatory requirement. In December 
2014, the Group issued £125.0 million 
6.75% ten year tier two Subordinated 
Notes (“the Notes”) to fund the 
acquisition of the outstanding 50%  
of Gocompare. 
In light of this performance and position, 
the Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 11.7 pence per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 5.1 pence 
per share, takes the full year dividend  
to 16.8 pence per share. The full year 
dividend of 16.8 pence per share 
represents a payout ratio of 85% of post 
tax profits. The payout ratio comprises  
a base dividend of 50% and a special 
dividend of 35%, demonstrating the 
Group’s commitment to returning excess 
capital to shareholders.
Market
We now have multiple third party pricing 
indices which track market pricing for 
motor and home insurance. In 2014, all 
the indices reported year-on-year rate 
reductions in both the motor and home 
markets. Signs of motor rate stabilisation 
were noted in the third quarter and these 
were followed by modest rate increases 
across the market in the fourth quarter  
of 2014. There were market movements 
in January, although perhaps not as 
significant as those in some years 
previously. We will watch with interest to 
see if the market is prepared to increase 
its rates as we move through 2015.
People
The Group has benefited from the 
Board’s impressive breadth and depth  
as we continue to push forward with our 
strategic objectives. 
On 3 December 2014, Dame Helen 
Alexander and Anthony Hobson 
announced that they will be stepping 
down from their respective positions  
on the Board at the completion of the 
Annual General Meeting in May 2015.

Anthony Hobson have been exceptionally 
valuable members of the Board pre, 
during and post the Group’s IPO. I, along 
with the rest of the Board, would like to 
offer our sincerest thanks and best 
wishes to them both for the future.
Anthony Hobson will leave the Board 
after 12 years, having been with the 
Group through many of its significant 
milestones. Anthony Hobson’s role as 
Chairman of the Investment Committee 
has passed to Anne Richards, who 
assumed the role with effect from 1 
January 2015.
Dame Helen Alexander has been with the 
Group for three years as Deputy Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director. On 1 
January, the role of Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee passed from 
Dame Helen Alexander to Mike Evans.  
On completion of the Annual General 
Meeting, Dame Helen Alexander’s role  
of Senior Independent Director will pass  
to Shirley Garrood. 
There have also been two further 
personnel changes to two of the Group’s 
Committees. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank Peter Ward for his 
time as Audit Committee Chairman, and  
I am pleased that Shirley Garrood has 
taken over the role of Audit Committee 
Chairman, with Peter Ward remaining on 
the Committee. María Dolores Dancausa 
has also joined the Nomination Committee.
The Group’s executive management team 
has been led by Stuart Vann, Chief 
Executive Officer, Darren Ogden, Chief 
Finance Officer, and further strengthened 
by the addition of David Pitt, Chief 
Operating Officer. This team continue  
to be supported by a highly skilled and 
dedicated workforce throughout the 
Group, for which the Board and I  
are grateful. 
Customers
Finally, our customers are the lifeblood  
of our Business and I would like to thank 
them for their continued support. We will 
continue to listen to their feedback and 
enhance our propositions to meet their 
ever-changing needs.
Summary
During 2014, market expectations  
of inevitable rate increases in motor 
insurance grew but, as we suspected, 
rates did not move tangibly. We 
continue to focus on the opportunities 
for growth that will arise when 
conditions improve. In competitive 
conditions, we remain very well placed. 
Again, it is our people and customers 
who make esure Group what it is today 
and to all of them, I am thankful.

& Claims
How we create value
People & Culture
The Group works hard to 
encourage and promote the 
highest standards of customer 
service, conduct and 
professionalism throughout 
the Business. Our people 
make the Group a success 
and make it a rewarding place 
to work.  
Without its skilled and 
dedicated workforce the 
Group would not be able to 
provide the excellent level  
of customer service that  
its customers expect. 
Underwriting & Claims
The Group targets statistically 
lower risk customers in  
both its Motor and Home 
underwriting segments. 
Through its focused approach 
to underwriting, the Group has 
been able to remain disciplined 
in its pricing decisions.
When a customer is 
unfortunate enough to be 
involved in an accident, it  
is important that the Group 
offers the best customer 
service to assist them in  
their time of need.
In Motor, for example, 
through its in-house designed 
Claims System and approved 
repairer network, all of which 
are PAS 125 compliant, the 
Group aims to settle claims in 
a timely and efficient manner, 
assisting customers at every 
stage of the process. The 
same can also be said for 
Home, where the Group 
strives to deliver a quality 
service during the  
claims process.
Through its continued focus 
on underwriting discipline  
and claims handling processes 
the Group is able to offer 
customers competitive prices 
without compromising  
on service.
The Group’s business model has been designed to ensure  
the customer is always at its heart.
Customers
The Group attracts new customers 
through its trusted brands and by 
offering competitive prices for its 
insurance products and services. 
By providing an excellent customer 
service and competitive prices at 
renewal, the Group aims to retain 
these customers, creating a long 
term mutually beneficial 
relationship.  esure Group Annual Report 2014

to our customers.
Distribution
The Group distributes its products via  
a multi-channel approach including: 
price comparison websites, direct 
phone and direct web. 
All the Group’s ‘quote and buy’ websites 
have been mobile optimised allowing 
customers to buy seamlessly through

Diversified income streams
The Group underwrites its core Motor 
and Home insurance products and 
these products have been rated 5 Star 
by independent financial research and 
software company, Defaqto. This 
demonstrates that our core insurance 
products provide one of the highest 
quality offerings in the market. 
Customers are able to enhance their 
core Motor and Home insurance 
products through the purchase of 
complementary additional insurance 
products, protecting them from 
additional unforeseen events.
The Group has a 50% holding in  
the price comparison website,  
Gocompare.com, which provides 
customers with the opportunity to find 
the right product coverage at the best 
price, while saving time and money. 
The Group has agreed to acquire the 
outstanding 50% of Gocompare and 
expects to take full ownership of the 
business on 31 March 2015.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Continuing to evolve the 
customer proposition
2014 Overview
2014 has been a year of discipline and 
developments for the Group as we 
enhanced our customer propositions 
through operational and underwriting 
improvements. 
The Group has delivered a solid set of 
results against a backdrop of competitive 
market conditions. The Group’s combined 
operating ratio of 91.9% is a good 
performance and testament to our focused 
and disciplined approach to underwriting 
in combination with our efficient expense 
base. The Group continues to adopt a 
prudent approach to reserving and the 
Group’s reserves remain comfortably in 
excess of our actuarial best estimate.
The UK motor rating environment was 
mixed in 2014, with rate declines in the 
first half of the year appearing to stabilise 
in the second half. We have not been 
afraid to increase rates above the 
market, slowing down new business 
volumes in the second half of 2014,  
as we aimed to protect the medium to 
long term profitability of the portfolio.
I am delighted that we have agreed  
to acquire the outstanding 50% of 
Gocompare for £95.0 million and expect 
to complete the acquisition on 31 March 
2015, with the acquisition funded 
through the issuance of the Notes. 
Through full ownership, we will be able  
to drive the strategic direction of 
Gocompare and I strongly believe  
that there are opportunities to enhance 
the business over time. It will remain 
entirely separate in its partnership and 
comparison service functions, while 
benefiting from operating under the 
umbrella of the wider Group. Many 
exciting opportunities will be explored  
as we look to grow the business over  
the medium to long term, while taking 
steps to further diversify the Group’s 
income streams.
Motor
We remained focused and disciplined in 
our approach to underwriting throughout 
the year and this resulted in a 3.9% 
reduction in Motor gross written 
premiums to £429.3 million. In 2014, the 
continued competitive rating environment 
in Motor was not conducive to profitable 
growth; however, the Group did manage 
to implement targeted rate increases in 
Motor as it looked to mitigate the impact 
of claims inflation. Despite the 
challenging market conditions in 2014, 
the Group achieved a combined operating 
ratio in Motor of 92.4%.
However, the inherent competitiveness  
of our market – where many participants 
are looking to grow or maintain market 
share – meant our rate increases resulted 
in a lower level of new business in the 
second half of the year. As a 
consequence, in-force policies were 
broadly flat at the year end compared  
to 2013, which is a position I am 
comfortable with, as we get nearer to  
a potential upturn in the rating cycle. 
The Group’s segment re-entry 
programme, where the Group has 
re-entered segments of the market that 
it had previously exited, continues to 
perform well and has provided great 
insight into further opportunities available 
to the Group across the wider motor 
market. A number of additional 
underwriting initiatives were rolled out on 
a ‘test and learn’ basis in 2014, as the 
Group looks to expand its quote footprint 
over the medium to long term. The 
performance of these new segments has 
been encouraging and further initiatives 
will be rolled out in 2015, as we look to 
grow outside our core segments.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Home 
In Home, we have continued to grow  
our portfolio, albeit at a slower rate than 
in previous years. The rating environment 
has been challenging, as in Motor, but  
we have remained disciplined in our 
approach to underwriting and only 
reduced rates to a level where we believe 
we can make an acceptable contribution 
to the Group.
We have delivered a combined operating 
ratio of 89.9% and this is testament to 
our good risk selection and efficient 
expense base. 
The Group remains well-placed to  
benefit from any shift in consumer  
buying behaviour towards price 
comparison websites as consumers  
look to obtain a more competitive rate 
for their home insurance.
People
The Group continues to benefit from our 
nimble, focused and adaptable approach. 
All my colleagues throughout the 
Business use their skill and expertise to 
service our customers, as we all work to 
deliver the Group’s strategic objectives. 
During the year, we have welcomed to 
the Group two new executive members, 
with David Pitt and Helen Taylor taking 
on the roles of Chief Operating Officer 
and HR Director, respectively. I am 
delighted to have them both in my 
management team and we are already 
seeing the benefits of their expertise, 
enthusiasm, drive and fresh ideas, as we 
look to push the Business forward. I 
would also like to take this opportunity to 
thank Gordon Hannah, who has retired, 
and Carole Timms, who has left us, for 
their hard work and dedication during 
their time with the Group; and I wish 
them both all the best for the future.
In 2014, 95% of my colleagues in the 
Business completed a customer focused 
training programme called OPEN. This is  
a key stage in our mission to keep our 
customers firmly at the heart of all we do.
Our commitment to our people enables 
us to deliver a quality of service that I 
believe sets us apart from the 
competition. The drive from my 
colleagues to 
understand our 
customers’ needs  
– and their desire to 
help those customers 
– really does give us an 
edge in a competitive 
market and there is 
more to come here too! 
Customers
During 2014, a number of customer 
initiatives were rolled out across the 
Group, including The Voice of the 
Customer. This is a system of feedback 
loops which will allow us to identify better 
what our customers like about our 
Business and what they don’t like, 
helping us to improve continuously.
The Group achieved a customer retention 
rate of 78% in 2014, which is testament 
to our commitment to provide 
competitively priced products and 
excellent customer service. 
In August 2014, the Group launched an 
Alternative Business Structure (“ABS”),  
in partnership with one of the UK’s 
leading law firms, Irwin Mitchell, 
enhancing the customer experience for 
those unfortunate enough to be involved 
in an accident.
Outlook
We have made a positive start to 2015 
and expect to achieve modest growth  
in in-force policies and gross written 
premiums in the first quarter. We expect 
the combined operating ratio trend  
in 2014 to continue into 2015 largely 
reflecting ongoing claims inflation.  
The Group continues to enhance its 
underwriting and customer platforms  
and remains well positioned for further 
growth when market conditions permit.
We have received Competition and 
Markets Authority clearance to proceed 
with the acquisition of Gocompare and 
expect to complete the acquisition on  
31 March 2015. We will invest in 
Gocompare to take advantage of the 
significant opportunities available in  
the medium term.
Summary
In summary, 2014  
has been a year of 
challenges from a 
market perspective,  
but also a year of 
developments. While 
competition never 
ceases in our market, 
there is much we can do to help 
ourselves to serve our customers and 
colleagues even better. We are delivering 
on this.
I would like to end by thanking all our 
customers for their continued support 
and all our colleagues in the Business  
for their dedication and hard work 
throughout 2014. 
Thank you!

Strategy
Straightforward  
and effective
The strategy of the Group is 
straightforward. 
Through a focused approach to 
underwriting, and by offering 
a diversified range of products, 
the Group is able to attract and 
retain customers with its strong 
brands, competitive prices and 
excellent customer service.
The Group’s strategy is 
designed to deliver value to 
all stakeholders – including 
customers, staff and 
shareholders alike.

Underwriting focus
The Group takes a disciplined approach to risk selection 
which is founded on:
• Active monitoring and management of underwriting  
risk exposure
• Continued data enrichment programmes
• Tight risk control at policy inception and renewal  
which includes:
 – anti-fraud measures in the sales process, policy 
management and claims functions
 – segment exposure monitoring
A conservative approach is taken to the Group’s risk 
selection and it targets statistically lower risk customers  
in both Motor and Home.
Extensive management information is produced and 
analysed which underpins the Group’s pricing decisions and 
growth ambitions. The Group prices risks at a level where it 
believes it can make an underwriting contribution. If market 
conditions do not permit the Group to grow profitably, then 
it will remain disciplined in its pricing actions to protect 
future profitability.
Supplementing the disciplined approach to underwriting is 
an efficient cost base, with a low cost philosophy embedded 
throughout the Business.
Through its efficient expense base and focused underwriting 
approach the Group is able to provide competitive prices to 
customers, without compromising on service.
See pages 32 to 37 for Risk management.
Targeted growth
The number of licensed cars for use on the roads in the UK 
was approximately 26 million at the end of 2013, and the 
Group insured approximately 5% of the market. There were 
approximately 26 million households in 2013, of which the 
Group insured just over half a million, giving it a market 
share of approximately 2%. The Group therefore has 
further scope to grow within these markets.
The Group pursues targeted growth within market segments 
where it sees the opportunity for positive underwriting 
performance. The Group seeks to acquire and retain 
customers via excellent customer service, keen pricing and 
its strong brands.
In 2013, the Group re-entered certain segments of the UK 
motor market that it had previously exited during the 
personal injury phenomenon of 2008/2009.
During 2014, the Group implemented a number of new 
initiatives to increase its ‘quote footprint’ in the motor 
insurance market. These initiatives are being rolled out on a 
‘test and learn’ basis to customers and will aid the Group’s 
growth ambitions over the medium to long term.
Growth needs the appropriate infrastructure and the Group 
has made significant investments in its IT platform, Claims 
System and business premises in recent years. These 
investments will support the Group’s future growth.
Revenue diversification
The Group derives income from a range of revenue streams 
across its Motor and Home underwriting segments which 
are supplemented by complementary additional insurance 
products and services. In addition, the Group also earns 
income on its investment portfolio and its share of profits 
from Gocompare.

performance of the Group, calculated as 
the loss ratio plus the expense ratio.
The loss ratio is the Group’s claims 
incurred net of reinsurance as a 
percentage of earned premiums,  
net of reinsurance.
The expense ratio is the Group’s net 
insurance expenses plus claims handling 
costs as a percentage of earned 
premiums, net of reinsurance. 
Commentary
The combined operating ratio is an 
industry wide metric that measures 
underwriting profitability and ultimately 
drives the profitability of the Group.
Definition
The Group’s profitability before finance 
and non-trading costs including 
transaction costs, amortisation of 
acquired intangibles and tax expenses.
Commentary
Trading profit is management’s measure 
of the overall profitability of the Group’s 
operating activities.
Definition
Pro forma earnings per share is 
calculated as profit after tax divided by 
the number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
as at the reporting date.
Commentary
The earnings per share figure 
demonstrates the level of profitability  
the Group has achieved after all 
expenses incurred in the financial year.

Operating review
Group performance
Gross written premiums and 
in-force policies
Gross written premiums reduced by 
3.4% to £517.8 million in 2014, with 
Motor and Home 3.9% and 0.9% lower, 
respectively. In-force policies were 
marginally higher year-on-year at 1.946 
million (2013: 1.933 million), with Motor 
broadly flat at 1.378 million and Home  
up 3.6% at 0.568 million.
Profitability
The Group delivered a combined 
operating ratio of 91.9% as it continued 
to focus on underwriting discipline and 
cost efficiency during 2014. Trading profit 
of £115.4 million was impacted by the 
soft rating environment continuing to 
earn through in both Motor and Home, 
and claims inflation in the second half  
of the year with respect to small bodily 
injury claims.
Profit after tax of £82.4 million was  
lower than 2013 (2013: £93.2 million), 
partly impacted by £3.8 million of 
expenses (pre taxation) associated with 
the Group’s agreement in December 
2014 to acquire the outstanding 50%  
of Gocompare.
Dividend
The Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 11.7 pence per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 5.1 pence 
per share, takes the full year dividend  
to 16.8 pence per share. The full year 
dividend of 16.8 pence per share 
represents a payout ratio of 85% of post 
tax profits. The payout ratio comprises a 
base dividend of 50% and a special 
dividend of 35%.
Financial position
The Group has a strong financial position 
with robust reserves, a conservative 
investment portfolio and capital 
significantly in excess of the minimum 
regulatory requirement. In December 
2014, the Group issued the Notes to fund 
the acquisition of the outstanding 50%  
of Gocompare.
Customers 
Operational enhancements to the 
customer experience have been made in 
2014 as the Group looks to continuously 
improve and align its operations with the 
needs of its customers. 
In addition, on 11 August 2014, the 
Group launched an ABS, in partnership 
with one of the UK’s leading law firms, 
Irwin Mitchell, to enhance the claim 
experience for those Motor customers 
who are unfortunate enough to have to 
make a claim.

Introduction
The Group provides Motor insurance 
products and services to its customers 
through its two key brands, esure and 
Sheilas’ Wheels. esure and Sheilas’ 
Wheels core Motor insurance products 
have been rated 5 Star by independent 
research and software company, Defaqto. 
This demonstrates that our core Motor 
insurance products provide one of the 
highest quality offerings in the market.
Underwriting
The foundations of the Group’s approach 
to underwriting are focus and discipline. 
The Group targets customers who are 
statistically lower risk drivers; for 
example, those with over four years’  
no claims discount.
The Group has continued with its 
segment re-entry programme which  
was launched in 2013, where the Group 
started to re-enter certain segments  
of the market it had previously exited 
during the personal injury phenomenon 
in 2008/09. This segment continues  
to perform well. Through the Group’s 
segment re-entry programme, insight 
was gained into wider market 
opportunities. In light of this, the Group 
launched a number of underwriting 
initiatives to increase its ‘quote footprint’ 
on a ‘test and learn’ basis and further 
initiatives will be launched during 2015, 
as the Group looks to expand its offering 
to customers over the medium to  
long term. 
In addition, the Group has undertaken  
a data enrichment programme in 2014  
to further improve the sophistication of 
its rating algorithm; this, in turn, has led 
to a full risk and rate review across the 
Motor portfolio.
Claims 
The Group operates a well-resourced  
and skilled claims function. The Group’s 
specialised claims staff use its in-house 
designed Claims System, which provides 
an efficient and effective claims 
management process. The claims 
function is supported by a dedicated 
anti-fraud unit who investigate fraudulent 
claims, as well as providing a strong 
defence against application fraud.
Rating 
The motor market remained competitive 
throughout 2014 as demonstrated by all 
the major rating indices. Rate reductions 
were seen in the early part of 2014, 
before signs of rating stabilisation in the 
second half of the year. According to the 
major rating indices rates reduced 
between 4% and 10% year-on-year.
Performance
Motor gross written premiums at £429.3 
million were 3.9% lower than 2013. This 
reduction was driven by the competitive 
market conditions, with the Group 
maintaining in-force policies broadly flat 
year-on-year at 1.378 million.
The combined operating ratio of 92.4%  
is a good result and is testament to the 
Group’s focused approach to underwriting 
and efficient cost base. Trading profit of 
£31.1 million, while lower than 2013, is a 
good performance in competitive market 
conditions, as the soft rating environment 
continues to earn through and has been 
impacted by an increase in small bodily 
injury claims frequency in the second half 
of 2014. Prior accident year reserves 
continued to develop favourably in 2014 
and the Group expects this to continue  
in 2015.
Throughout 2014, the Group remained 
disciplined in its rating actions and 
implemented targeted rate increases 
during the second half of the year, with 
the aim of protecting the longer term 
profitability of its Motor segment. The 
Group did notice a reduction in its new 
business volumes as a result of its pricing 
actions in the second half of 2014, which 
indicated that the wider market was not 
yet willing to accept rate increases.

Introduction
The Group provides Home insurance 
products and services to its customers 
through its two key brands, esure and 
Sheilas’ Wheels. esure and Sheilas’ 
Wheels Home core insurance products 
have been rated 5 Star by independent 
research and software company, Defaqto. 
This demonstrates that our core Home 
insurance products provide one of the 
highest quality offerings in the market.
Underwriting
As in Motor, the Group targets statistically 
lower risk Home customers. This requires 
the Group to apply strict underwriting 
rules in selecting risks; for example, areas 
at a lower risk of river or coastal flood and 
buildings of standard construction. 
Rating
The UK home market rating environment 
was competitive throughout 2014. 
According to public data, rates reduced 
between 4% and 8% year-on-year for a 
buildings and contents policy.
Claims
The Group manages claims in an efficient 
and effective manner, through its 
well-resourced and skilled claims 
function. In response to the severe 
weather events in Q1 2014, the Group 
implemented its ‘surge plan’, deploying 
employees from around the Business 
with the appropriate skills to its claims 
function, to meet the needs of its 
customers during those difficult times. 
The severe weather events that occurred 
in Q1 2014 impacted the Group’s claims 
costs by £2.0 million more than expected 
in the first half of the year; however, 
benign weather in the second half of  
the year resulted in the Group incurring 
weather related claims costs which were 
broadly in line with that expected for the 
full year. 
Performance
In-force policies increased 3.6% to  
0.568 million, which together with a 
lower rating environment, resulted in  
a modest reduction in gross written 
premiums to £88.5 million. The Group 
continues to use its additional insurance 
products pricing strategy to aid  
customer conversion.
The combined operating ratio of 89.9% 
and trading profit of £8.4 million is a 
strong performance reflecting the Group’s 
good risk selection and efficient expense 
base. The Group’s prudent approach  
to reserving has resulted in favourable 
development of prior accident year 
reserves and this is expected to  
continue in 2015.

The competitive rating environment across both Motor and Home,

£517.8 million in 2014 (2013: £535.8 million), with Motor and 
Home, 3.9% and 0.9% lower year-on-year, respectively. 
Motor in-force policies were broadly flat at 1.378 million  
(2013: 1.385 million) as the Group remained disciplined in  
its pricing actions throughout 2014 in continued challenging 
market conditions. In 2014, the Group launched a number  
of initiatives as it looks to cautiously expand its underwriting 
footprint, alongside the continuation of its segment re-entry 
programme which was launched in 2013. These opportunities 
have mitigated some of the impact from the soft rating 
environment with gross written premiums 3.9% lower at 
£429.3 million (2013: £446.5 million). 
In Home, gross written premiums remained broadly flat at 
£88.5 million (2013: £89.3 million), reflecting the increasingly 
competitive conditions in the UK home market. Home in-force 
policies grew by 3.6% through pricing competitively the core 
insurance products, in combination with the Group’s pricing 
strategy of its additional insurance products, which aids 
customer conversion.

The Group’s trading profit at £115.4 million is lower than in 
2013 as the impact of the soft rating environment continues to 
earn through in Motor, alongside higher claims frequency 
particularly on small bodily injury claims in Motor. In addition, 
the returns from the Group’s assets under management are 
lower at £12.4 million (2013: £14.7 million) as a consequence 
of a lower investment return on lower average assets under 
management, alongside an increase in investment expenses.
Underwriting
The Group’s contribution to trading profit from its underwriting 
activities was £39.5 million (2013: £50.6 million). 
In Motor, the Group continued to focus on underwriting 
discipline as the soft rating environment prevailed, while 
maintaining its focus on cost control and expense management. 
However, as a consequence of the competitive rating 
environment and an increase in small bodily injury claims 
frequency in the second half of the year, partly offset by an 
increase in favourable development of prior accident year 
reserves in 2014 compared to 2013, trading profit in Motor  
was lower at £31.1 million (2013: £41.0 million).
Home underwriting continues to perform well and achieved a 
trading profit of £8.4 million (2013: £9.6 million). The current 
accident year performance was better than 2013; however ,  
a lower level of strong favourable development from prior accident 
year reserves partly offset the current accident year performance.

The Group’s combined operating ratio for 2014 was 91.9% 
compared to 89.7% in 2013. The combined operating ratio of 
91.9% comprises a loss ratio of 68.0% (2013: 65.9%) and an 
expense ratio of 23.9% (2013: 23.8%). 
In Motor, the combined operating ratio of 92.4% was higher 
than in 2013, largely driven by a deterioration in the current 
accident year loss ratio. The Motor expense ratio remained 
broadly flat at 22.5%, testament to the Group’s efficient 
expense base and lower acquisition costs as a result of a lower 
new business run rate in the second half of 2014.
In Home, the combined operating ratio of 89.9% was higher 
than in 2013. There was a slight improvement in the loss ratio 
in 2014 to 59.1%; however, this was offset by an increase in 
the expense ratio to 30.8%, largely driven by the costs 
associated with an increase in in-force policies.

relationship with the customer.
3  Claims income comprises income generated by the Group from legal 
panel membership fees and fees generated from the appointment of 
firms used during the claims process, including medical and car hire 
suppliers. Since the implementation of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and 
Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which came into effect during the 
year ended 31 December 2013, applicable legal panel membership fees 
are no longer received.

reporting segment.
5  Underwritten additional insurance products revenue is calculated by 
deducting the Group’s claims costs associated with its underwritten 
additional insurance products from the gross written premiums relating 
to these products in a particular period.
The Group achieved total income from additional services of 
£103.0 million (2013: £103.9 million). The reduction is largely 
due to the decline in the receipt of legal panel membership 
fees, which were prohibited under the Legal Aid, Sentencing 
and Punishment of Offenders Act implemented in 2013.
In 2014, the Group grew total income from additional services 
revenue broadly in line with in-force policies to £97.3 million 
(2013: £95.7 million) after adjusting for claims income. 
Investments
The Group derives income from its investment portfolio and 
receives a share of profits from its 50% investment in the price 
comparison website, Gocompare. The Group has agreed to 
acquire the outstanding 50% of Gocompare, which will increase 
its holding to 100%.

a reduction in the Group’s average assets under management 
in 2014 compared to 2013 and volatility in the investment 
markets in the second half of 2014. In 2013, the Group 
appointed a new fund manager and subsequently a full year of 
management charges have been incurred in 2014, which along 
with a small reallocation of internal costs has impacted the 
Group’s investment charges.

venture (2.6) (2.9) 10.3%
Profit before tax 103.3 118.4 (12.8)%
Profit before tax for the year was £103.3 million (2013: £118.4 
million) which is lower than 2013 primarily due to the Group’s 
underwriting performance, alongside £3.8 million of additional 
non-trading costs attributable to the acquisition of the 
outstanding 50% of Gocompare.
Taxation
The Group’s tax expense was £20.9 million (2013: £25.2 
million). The decrease in the Group’s tax expense was largely 
due to a reduction in the Group’s profit before tax and a 
reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate from 23.0% to 21.0% 
with effect from 1 April 2014. The Group incurred an effective 
tax rate of 20.2% (2013: 21.3%).
Pro forma earnings per share
Pro forma earnings per share was 19.8 pence per share (2013: 
22.4 pence). This is in line with the reduction in profit after tax. 
Dividend per share
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 11.7 pence per 
share, which together with the interim dividend of 5.1 pence per 
share, gives a full year dividend of 16.8 pence per share. The 
full year dividend of 16.8 pence per share represents a payout 
ratio of 85% of post tax profits. The payout ratio comprises a 
base dividend of 50% and a special dividend of 35%. 
The special dividend has been set with reference to the Group’s 
capital resource requirements, prospective premium growth 
expectations and a prudent margin for contingencies.
The ex-dividend date is 9 April 2015, the record date is 10 April 
2015 and the payment date is 22 May 2015.
Return on capital employed
The Group achieved a strong return on capital employed of 
30.6% (2013: 37.7%) reflecting its solid financial performance 
and efficient capital base.
Financial Position
The Group has a strong financial position with robust reserves, 
a conservative investment portfolio and capital significantly in 
excess of the minimum regulatory requirement. In December 
2014, the Group issued the Notes to fund the acquisition of  
the outstanding 50% of Gocompare. 
Investments and cash
The Group deploys a conservative investment strategy  
with the primary objectives of capital preservation and 
maintaining liquidity.

The Group’s assets under management increased to £835.1 
million in 2014. In December 2014, the Group issued the Notes 
to fund the acquisition of Gocompare. While the Group awaits 
the completion of the acquisition, the net proceeds from the 
Notes, £122.1 million, have been placed into a ‘AAA’ rated 
liquidity fund. Upon completion of the acquisition, the majority 
of these funds will be used to fund the acquisition of 
Gocompare. Adjusting for this, the Group’s assets under 
management are 7.3% lower than 2013 at £713.0 million.
The Group’s strategic asset target remains unchanged 
compared to 2013 and is as follows:
• Fixed income: 80%
• Cash and liquidity funds: 15%
• Equities: 5%
As a result of the Group’s transition towards its strategic asset 
allocation, the holding in equities increased to £40.8 million 
from £27.3 million in 2013. Adjusting for the net proceeds 
received from the Notes, the asset allocation at the end of 2014 
is broadly in line with the strategic asset allocation.
Asset allocation decisions made by the Investment Committee 
give due consideration to the duration and profile of liabilities to 
avoid any significant mismatch in the asset and liability profiles. 
In order to preserve capital and to reduce the risk of an 
investment loss due to interest rate movements, it is acceptable 
for the duration of the asset portfolio to be shorter but not 
longer than the average duration of the liabilities.
In 2014, the duration was short at under one year largely 
driven by its fixed income portfolio.

Debt
On 19 December 2014, the Group issued £125.0 million of 
6.75% ten year tier two Subordinated Notes. The Notes were 
issued to fund the acquisition of the outstanding 50% of 
Gocompare and for general corporate purposes. The issue  
of the Notes resulted in the Group receiving net proceeds  
of £122.1 million.
Reserving
The Group holds claims reserves, to cover the future cost of 
settling claims that have been incurred but not settled at the 
balance sheet date, whether already known to the Group or  
not yet reported, net of associated reinsurance recoveries.
The ultimate costs and expenses of the claims for which  
these reserves are held are subject to a number of material 
uncertainties. As time passes between the reporting of a claim 
and the final settlement of the claim, circumstances can change 
that may require established reserves to be adjusted either 
upwards or downwards. Factors such as changes in the legal 
environment, results of litigation, propensity of personal injury 
claims in light of the recent Ministry of Justice reforms, changes 
in medical and care costs, and costs of vehicle and home 
repairs can all substantially impact overall costs and expenses 
of claims, and cause a material divergence from the bases and 
assumptions on which the reserves were calculated. 
Claims subject to periodic payment orders (“PPOs”) are an area  
of uncertainty relating to the claims reserves. For known PPOs  
and claims which have been identified as potential PPO awards, 
indexed cash flow projections are carried out in order to estimate 
an ultimate cost on a gross and net of reinsurance basis.  
The cash flow projections were undertaken on a discounted  
basis. The total net claims provision recognised for PPOs and 
potential PPOs in the consolidated statement of financial  
position represents less than 5% of net claims outstanding at  
31 December 2014. These factors can cause actual developments  
to vary materially from the projections and assumptions on which 
the Group’s technical reserves were calculated.
Given this uncertainty, the Group looks to maintain a consistent 
and prudent reserving philosophy and the Group has always 
established its Claims Outstanding Reserves and Incurred But 
Not Reported (“IBNR”) Reserves at a prudent level in excess  
of the best estimate level determined through standard 
actuarial techniques.
This prudent approach to reserving has meant that the Group 
has historically experienced favourable development in its 
claims reserves over time as claims have ultimately settled  
at a lower cost than initially calculated for the purposes of its 
booked Claims Outstanding Reserves and IBNR Reserves.  
This prudent approach can be evidenced by the gross and net 
claims development tables that are shown in Note 19 to the 
financial statements. The tables illustrate, that for all accident 
years, the latest booked loss ratio is lower than the initial 
booked loss ratio. In 2014, the total release from prior accident 
year reserves was £90.0 million (2013: £82.4 million), 
equivalent to 18.3% of net earned premiums (2013: 16.8%).
The amount of the Group’s Claims Outstanding Reserves and 
IBNR Reserves, net of outward reinsurance, salvage and 
subrogation, together with the related reserve in respect of  
the requirement for claims handling expenses, is comfortably  
in excess of the actuarial best estimate.
Reinsurance
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer mechanism 
to mitigate risks that are outside the Group’s appetite for 
individual claim or event exposure and to reduce the volatility 
caused by large individual and accumulation losses. By doing 
so, the Group protects its capital and the underwriting result  
of both Motor and Home.
Currently, the Group has in place non-proportional excess  
of loss reinsurance programmes for its Motor and Home 
underwriting activities. The purpose of these programmes is  
to provide cover for both individual large losses, for Motor and 
Home, and accumulation losses arising from natural and other 
catastrophe events for Home. Motor reinsurance treaties are in 
place covering all years in which the Group has underwritten 
Motor policies. In 2014, the Group renewed its Motor 
reinsurance programme with a deductible of £1.0 million (in 
2013 the deductible was £0.5 million). The Group has no quota 
share reinsurance or co-insurance arrangements in place.
The Group’s reinsurance programmes are reviewed on an 
annual basis and capital modelling is used to identify the most 
appropriate structure and risk retention profile, taking into 
account the Group’s business objective of minimising volatility 
and the prevailing cost and the availability of reinsurance in  
the market.

inflow under the line item ‘financing activities’. 
In 2014, net cash generated from operating activities includes 
the cash outflow of the £122.1 million net proceeds received 
from the issue of the Notes into a liquidity fund while the  
Group awaits completion of the acquisition of the outstanding 
50% of Gocompare. In addition, the Group received a cash 
inflow from the net reduction in its assets under management 
of £53.5 million. In 2013, the Group received a cash inflow  
of £38.0 million from the net reduction in its assets under 
management which was used to partly fund the repayment  
of its capital instruments. 
Net cash generated from financing activities includes the cash 
inflow of the net proceeds of £122.1 million received from the 
issue of the Notes and the cash outflow from dividend payments 
of £76.4 million made in 2014. In 2013, the Group’s net cash 
generated from financing activities included the cash outflow of 
£84.9 million to repay its capital instruments, the cash outflow 
of £50.0 million to repay its Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes, 
the cash inflow of £44.0 million received from the net proceeds 
raised on Admission and the cash outflow of £10.4 million to

Capital
Capital management
The Group maintains a capital structure consistent with the 
Group’s risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements 
of its business. 
The Group’s objectives in managing capital are:
• To match the profile of its assets and liabilities, taking 
account of the risks inherent in the business
• To maintain financial strength to support growth
• To satisfy the requirements of its policyholders and 
regulators
• To retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity 
and access to a range of capital markets
The Group manages, as capital, all items that are eligible to be 
treated as capital for regulatory purposes. This includes equity, 
allowing for regulatory adjustments, the Notes and a mark to 
model based valuation of the Group’s interest in Gocompare. 
Insurance Group’s Directive (IGD)

The Notes meet the criteria of a lower tier two capital 
instrument. Only £20.2 million of the Notes qualifies as capital 
under the IGD as the amount of qualifying lower tier two debt is 
restricted to a maximum of 25% of the lesser of either the 
Group’s available solvency margin or required solvency capital.
Economic capital
In addition to the Group capital requirements established under 
the IGD, the solo insurance company, esure Insurance Limited, 
is also subject to Individual Capital Guidance (“ICG”) set by the 
Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). The guidance is set  
by the PRA on a periodic basis following the submission of a 
risk-based Individual Capital Assessment (“ICA”). The ICA,  
and thus ICG, are typically greater than the IGD and it is with 
reference to these that the Group determines its economic 
capital requirements.
Solvency II
The Group remains on track for the implementation of  
Solvency II on 1 January 2016. There remains ambiguity  
around some specific details and the phasing of implementation; 
however, the Group is confident in the delivery of its  
Solvency II programme.
On implementation, the Group will report using the standard 
formula, while continuing to develop its internal model. The 
Group’s internal economic capital model continues to support its 
business and strategic decisions, including the assessment  
of the regulatory and business capital requirements.
The Group expects the Notes to be permitted as qualifying 
capital up to a maximum value of 50% of the solvency capital 
requirement under Solvency II.

People
Our people, partnerships and 
environment
esure Group staff lead the way in forging 
strong, valuable and sympathetic 
relationships with our customers, 
partners, suppliers and local communities.
Their contribution ranges from their pride 
in the efficient handling of the policies 
and claims of our customers to their part 
in our Corporate and Social Responsibility 
when promoting Macmillan Cancer 
Support, local charities and adopting  
high environmental standards.
As such, we invest in them and seek to 
engage them personally, professionally 
and socially in the life of esure.
Our commitment to corporate social 
responsibility focuses on all parties 
associated with our Business – staff, 
customers and stakeholders. We set 
these out below in the following 
categories:
• Our people and our culture
• Community and issues engagement
• Charitable involvement
• Sustainability and the environment
Our people and our culture
We value and reward our staff. We have 
established a culture that is conducive to 
a positive working environment with 
emphasis on opportunity, equality and 
diversity – as well as performance and 
career development.
This starts with our induction training  
for new staff, with each new team 
member required to sign off the Equality 
and Diversity Policy and our Code of 
Conduct Policy, with refresher training 
provided annually. 
Financially, we are committed to ensuring 
members of staff are well rewarded for 
the value they bring to the Group and the 
service they deliver to customers. We 
know that high quality service drives 
retention and satisfaction, so this is key 
to our reward structure. We also operate 
an esure Group Sharesave Plan enabling 
members of staff to invest in the 
Business through share ownership at 
80% of market value.
We encourage our staff to join the  
Group as customers as well as employees 
through staff discounts on esure 
products. In addition, we operate a 
festive bonus scheme as well as a profit 
share award for eligible members, 
childcare vouchers, a performance and 
Group award scheme for management, 
interest free season ticket loans for 
travel, flexible working practices as well 
as long service awards of which there  
are many.
Keeping staff abreast of the latest 
developments from around our Business 
is central to engagement. In 2014, we 
placed an increased focus on our intranet 
tool, enabling people from around the 
Business to share stories of success, 
policy updates, team changes and 
general news.
At least twice each year, our Chief 
Executive Officer and members of our 
Executive Team share company news 
through a series of staff briefings that 
take place on location in our Glasgow, 
Manchester and Reigate offices. Each 
briefing provides an opportunity for staff 
to learn more of our strategy and 
performance but also to ask questions  
of our senior management. Our Chief 
Executive Officer also operates a series  
of Chief Executive Officer Lunches inviting 
people from every level of the Business 
to meet and discuss topics of interest. 
There is a ‘no holds barred’ attitude to 
the questions that staff can ask – we 
encourage frankness in debate and see 
each challenge or question as an 
opportunity to educate and engage staff.
The Group takes all feedback very 
seriously. Each year, our Human 
Resources team invites staff opinions 
through the esure Group Pulse Survey to 
identify how the business can continually 
improve. Results are fed back to staff 
along with the outcomes of very simple 
‘dip surveys’ of all staff asking: “How 
happy are you at work this month?” and 
“How supported do you feel?” 
Our Employee Consultation Group meets 
regularly throughout the year, providing 
another forum for direct feedback to 
management. In addition, the Group has 
recently updated its whistleblowing policy 
to enable staff to raise concerns 
anonymously without concern that they 
take responsibility for suspicions raised. 
We are proud that, in our view, we 
employ some of the most ambitious and 
committed members of staff across the 
insurance industry. This pride is put into 
action with the Group seeking and 
providing opportunities for our people  
to develop in their careers. 
Our Chief Executive Officer operates an 
annual Talent Development Programme. 
This is an organised and planned training 
programme providing an opportunity for 
members of staff to learn from senior 
leaders within the Business, helping them 
grow as industry professionals. 
As the Business focuses on innovation, 
specialist project teams are established 
throughout the year pulling together 
people with different skills from around 
the Business to contribute to the next  
era of change. In addition, the Group 
provides on the job training as well as 
the opportunity to partake in off-site 
training to help staff develop and grow 
with the Business. 
But it’s not all about work. esure Group is 
also an environment where we encourage 
people to enjoy working; fun is a key 
ingredient in the success of the Business. 
Alongside annual Festive Competitions 
running every weekday in December  
with winning members of staff awarded 
significant prizes, we encourage teams  
to engage in healthy and developmental 
activities together including sports 
tournaments and challenges, team 
fitness activities, quizzes, book events, 
football leagues and participating in 
activities for local charities. esure Group Annual Report 2014

Engaged staff are the building blocks of 
our focus on providing a positive customer 
experience across the Business. We 
measure this through both customer focus 
groups and our Voice of the Customer 
surveys to ensure we are delivering 
against our objectives. These allow our 
customers to feed back their experiences 
and perceptions of how we are delivering. 
The results are circulated to executive 
members and the wider business to seek 
out places for improvement.
Furthermore, a new approach to 
communicating our brand coherently and 
enthusiastically to our customers has 
been established through our Tone of 
Voice project in 2014. We have identified 
the key tenets of a transparent and 
straightforward approach to customers 
through the language we use and aim  
to uphold this with a can-do, supportive 
attitude. We look forward to rolling this 
out further over the coming year for the 
benefit of our customers and staff.
Community and issues engagement
As a business operating out of three offices 
in Glasgow, Manchester and Reigate we 
are particularly conscious of those 
communities around us. We understand 
that investing in a community is not just 
about providing employment opportunities. 
We encourage nominations to local causes 
from people around the Business so we 
never lose sight of our role in those 
communities and give back where possible.
We operate a structured community 
giving programme, working and investing 
in organisations that share our core 
values in and around our office locations. 
This year, we continued our engagement 
with national organisations such as 
BRAKE, Road Peace, Thatcham Research, 
and the Parliamentary Advisory Council 
for Transport Safety. 
Our relationship with Surrey Fire Brigade 
and its Safe Drive Stay Alive campaign 
has been longstanding. We have 
supported this programme for ten years 
and are proud to be part of an initiative 
that has taught over 100,000 young 
drivers in Surrey about road safety, 
saving lives and making local roads safer.
Charitable involvement
Supplementing our community 
engagement activity, the Group 
supports some excellent charitable 
causes. Our Sheilas’ Wheels brand was

the founding partner of the Macmillan 
Cancer Support Night In campaign in 
2013 and we partnered with Macmillan 
again this year with sponsorship, staff 
and customer engagement.
At esure, teams throughout the company 
were involved through cake sales, dress 
down days, quizzes, raffles and a special 
Sheila Selfie initiative which saw the 
Sheilas have their picture taken with staff 
members for a donation. 
All the activity created a 25% increase  
on last year’s fundraising total to help 
Macmillan Cancer Support make a real 
difference to the lives of those living  
with cancer and its effects. This was 
supplemented by a corporate donation.
In addition, we supported other local 
charities throughout the year nominated 
by staff members in each of our offices, 
including larger national activities such  
as Children In Need alongside smaller, 
localised initiatives close to team 
members’ hearts such as The Beatson 
Cancer charity in Glasgow who cared for 
a member of staff who lost her battle 
with cancer in 2014.
The team in Glasgow managed to raise 
over £20,000 through a variety of 
charitable initiatives in 2014. 
As well as supporting nationwide charities 
such as Macmillan Cancer Support, 
Sports Relief and Children in Need, the 
Glasgow staff nominated local charities  
to benefit from its monthly dress down 
days and quarterly fun days which they 
fit in throughout the year. The fun days 
included bake sales, raffles, sweepstakes 
and various other fundraising activities 
throughout the office.
In addition to monetary donations, the 
Glasgow team collected Christmas lunch 
boxes for Loaves & Fishes, a local charity 
providing essential food items to families 
in the Glasgow and surrounding area. It 
has been supporting the charity for ten 
years and is something the team are very 
passionate about.
Our Manchester team selected Macmillan 
Cancer Support as its nominated charity 
in 2014 following a vote taken at the 
Manchester office at the end of last year.
The team set a donation target of 
£2,800 based on previous year results 
and managed to raise approximately 
£6,000 by year end 2014 through a 
series of events such as a Christmas 
raffle, book sale and a variety of dress 
down days for staff. 
In March, the team ran a Sport Relief 
initiative. The event included activities 
such as a 5k fun run around the City 
centre and cake sale with all proceeds 
donated to Sport Relief. As always, the 
focus for the fun run was on inclusivity, 
with the team welcoming all abilities and 
encouraging as many people as possible 
to take part.
In addition, the Manchester team 
supported Children in Need; the Points 
Parents’ Forum, a local organisation who 
support families with children who have 
additional needs; as well as Homeless 
Hounds, whose mission is to rescue and 
re-home abandoned and abused dogs 
and give them a forever home.
Sustainability and the environment
The Group offers a financial service  
rather than a manufactured product. 
Consequently, its effects on the 
environment hinge on its office space  
and its production of documentation 
internally and for customers. We are 
conscious of these effects and work hard 
to mitigate them. 
We source all of our electricity from 
renewable sources, and invest in our 
systems – such as auto-shutdown 
facilities and our efficient thin-client 
desktop environment to ensure each  
of our buildings run efficiently. 
Each year, our facilities team undertakes 
UK GHG Mandatory Reporting looking at 
the Group’s carbon footprint and presents 
this to the executive team to include in 
the Directors’ Report (further details and 
results can be found on page 66). 
The headlines are that esure Group 
managed a 12% reduction in its carbon 
footprint in 2014 vs 2013 with our Head 
Office in Reigate managing a reduction of 
27%. Overall, esure Group is responsible 
for operations that saw 5.53 tCO
2
e per 
£million of turnover emitted in 2014 – a 
reduction from 6.23 tCO
2
e in 2013. On a 
per employee basis, we emitted 1.68 
tCO
2
e in 2014 – a reduction of 16% 
against 2013.
We continue to work hard on initiatives 
that will make us even more efficient and 
environmentally conscious in our 
day-to-day activities. 
As a Business that has traditionally relied 
on paper for product dissemination, we 
have made major steps in 2014 to reduce 
our paper usage. Our new systems that 
allow customers to migrate to the 
e-fulfilment of their policies became fully 
operational in September 2014. The 
launch saw the introduction of fully online 
policy documents and certificates for  
our customers. 
During 2014, these early stages in 
e-fulfilment saw the Group reduce the 
number of customer policy and document 
packs it sends out by 477,000, saving  
69 tonnes of paper that would have 
otherwise been used in printing these 
packs. We are incredibly proud of  
this result. 
As the penetration of e-fulfilment grows 
within our customer base we expect to 
see this part of our resource usage and 
carbon footprint from printing and 
postage further reduce in years to come.
Also this year, we adopted the 
Government-led Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme which is to become 
compulsory for businesses in December 
2015. Our early start with this will allow 
the Group to make further strides. 
Through our approved repairers we 
undertake many thousands of repairs 
each year for customers. We have 
mandated compliance with PAS 125 for 
all our approved repairers providing 
quality guarantees for our customers. 
This also sets safety standards for the 
qualified staff who conduct repairs.
Summary
Overall, 2014 has been a successful year 
for our people, our partnerships and our 
effect on the environment. We are proud 
of a suite of improvements in our 
Corporate and Social Responsibility and 
look forward to finding new ways to 
positively impact the world around us in 
2015. There is always more that we can 
do and as a listed business, we will work 
towards and report on the enhancements 
we make. These will include the ways we 
work with our key stakeholders, how we 
contribute towards charitable giving and 
community involvement, reducing the 
environmental impact we may have and, 
most of all, ensuring that esure is a 
people business at every level. esure Group Annual Report 2014

Risk management and principal risks
Risk management
The Board is responsible for prudent 
oversight of the Group’s Business and 
financial operations, ensuring that they 
are conducted in accordance with sound 
business principles and with applicable 
law and regulation. This encompasses 
responsibility to articulate and monitor 
adherence to quantifiable and 
measurable statements of the Board’s 
appetite for exposure to all risk types. 
The Board also ensures that measures 
are in place to provide independent and 
objective assurance on the effective 
identification and management of risk 
and on the effectiveness of the controls 
in place to mitigate those risks.
In order to set boundaries to the 
acceptance of risk exposures, the Board 
has set out the following Strategic Risk 
Statements that underpin our risk 
appetite and how the Group operates 
(see diagram below).
The Board has set a robust risk 
management strategy and framework  
as an integral element in its pursuit of 
business objectives and in the fulfilment 
of its obligations to shareholders, 
regulators, customers and staff.
The Group’s risk management framework 
is proportionate to the risks that we face 
and organised around the core elements 
of Risk Strategy and Appetite, Risk 
Governance, and the associated  
Risk Reporting.
The Group’s risk management 
framework is dynamic and continues to 
be enhanced and developed to ensure 
it meets the needs of the Group. 
Risk Strategy and Appetite
The Group’s Risk Appetite incorporates  
a range of quantitative and qualitative 
measures of risk supporting our Strategic 
Risk Objectives, against which the actual 
or planned exposures and uncertainties 
can be monitored. This monitoring is 
reflected in regular reporting to the 
Executive Risk Committee and the Board 
Risk Committee.
The Risk Appetite forms a fundamental 
part of the way we think about and 
assess risk, setting out the types and 
level of risk that we are willing to accept 
or avoid in the pursuit of our strategy. 
These are considered within our strategic 
decisions and business planning but also 
form a critical element in the way that we 
think about risk within the Business. This 
ensures that our staff understand how 
Earnings
Our goal is to manage volatility within a cyclical market for our 
shareholders through targeted growth opportunities, continuous 
adaptation in our underwriting and a focus on expense management.
Capital and 
Liquidity
We ensure there are appropriate financial resources in place to  
deliver on our corporate and policyholder obligations.
Reputation
Our brands represent our promise to our customers 
and are central to our continued success.
Conduct  
Risk & Culture
How we treat our customers is at the core of everything we do and, 
through our strategy, culture and service delivery, we aim to deliver 
fair outcomes to our customers.
People
Our people are what makes us successful and we aim to continue  
to invest in our employees, ensuring the Group is a rewarding  
place to work.
 
“ Our open and 
transparent culture 
underpins our 
approach to managing 
and understanding risk 
within the business.”

their day-to-day decisions support the 
Risk Appetite and Strategic Risk 
Objectives through our business risk 
dashboard. This feedback loop ensures 
that our Risk Appetite is cascaded and 
embedded within the Group.
Risk reporting
The risk management framework is 
designed to ensure that the Risk 
Committee receive timely and 
appropriate reporting on our exposure  
to existing and emerging risks in each  
of the core risk categories – insurance, 
market, counterparty credit, operational, 
regulatory and liquidity. Strategic risks 
and the reputational consequences of 
these risk exposures are considered 
within this risk reporting.
Such reporting is supported by:
• Updates to the Group’s risk registers 
covering current and emerging risks
• Reports on events that have resulted 
in actual or potential financial or 
reputational losses to the Group or  
its customers
• The results of stress, scenario and 
sensitivity testing and the findings, 
recommendations and management 
actions arising from reviews 
conducted by the compliance and 
internal audit functions
A key strength of the Group’s risk 
management strategy is the integration 
of risk assessment and evaluation into 
the Group’s business planning and capital 
management processes.
Risk governance
In accordance with recognised good 
practice, the Group operates a “three lines 
of defence” governance framework. This  
is set out below. The Group’s risk 
governance is underpinned by a risk 
management function headed by the 
Chief Risk Officer, a member of the 
Executive team reporting to the Chief 
Executive Officer, but with independence 
assured through direct and independent 
access to the Chairmen of the Audit 
Committee and the Risk Committee.
The Risk Strategy, Appetite and 
framework are articulated in a suite of 
policies covering material risks that we 
face. Each of these policies is subject to 
annual review and approval.
Regulation 
The UK motor and home markets are 
regulated by various bodies, including  
but not limited to Prudential Regulation 
Authority (“PRA”), Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”) and the Competition 
and Markets Authority (“CMA”). 
A summary of their findings in 2014 can 
be found below:
• The FCA conducted a thematic review 
titled “Insurers’ management of claims 
– household and retail travel” in 2013 
and published its results in May 2014
• Communication and ownership 
throughout claim
• Management of supply chains
• Clarity of product documentation
In addition, a Market Study was conducted 
on “General Insurance Add-Ons: Final 
Report – Confirmed Findings of the Market 
Study” in July 2014.
ORSA
Our Board and senior management have confidence in 
how we are embedding our strategic risk objectives.
Strategic Risk 
Objectives
There is a clear linkage between  
our Strategic Risk Objectives and  
our Risk Appetite.
The Risk Appetite is cascaded down 
to our Business units and their 
performance on a daily basis 
supports this.
Risk Appetite Strategic Decisions Business Plan
Our strategic decisions and plans  
are aligned to and support our  
Risk Appetite.

The findings from this market study are 
as follows:
• Proposed banning default opt-out sales
• Improvements to how price 
comparison websites provide add-on 
options and pricing
• Proposed publishing claims ratios
Formal consultation is expected in the 
first half of 2015 by the FCA.
In September 2014, the CMA reported  
its final report into the UK private motor 
insurance market and issued the 
following findings:
• Wide Most Favoured Nation clauses 
(“MFNs”) have been banned for  
Price Comparison Websites  
(“PCWs”) contracts
• Improved transparency on No Claims 
Bonus protection
• Recommendation that the FCA give 
further consideration to add-ons in 
relation to how price information and 
product descriptions are provided to 
consumers on PCWs
On 1 October 2014 the latest stage  
of the government reforms aimed at 
combating fraudulent claims and 
reducing the cost of motor insurance 
came into effect. This legislation set the 
cost of the initial medical report in a 
personal injury case at £180. This reform 
also prohibits the medical expert who 
produced the medical report from 
offering treatment to the injured. 
In November 2014, the FCA published  
its findings from its thematic review into 
“Complaint handling”. The thematic 
review made the following 
recommendations: 
• Increasing the time that firms can 
deal with the initial expression of 
dissatisfaction
• Making all complaints reportable
• Banning the use of telephone 
numbers which charge more than  
the ‘basic’ rate
• Giving all complainants the right  
to refer their complaint to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service if  
they remain dissatisfied
Solvency II is scheduled for 
implementation on 1 January 2016.  
The PRA have released further 
clarification points during 2014 and  
the Group remains on track to meet the 
aims of Solvency II, which includes the 
following key ideas:
• Market consistent balance sheets
• Risk-based capital
• ORSA
• Senior management accountability
• Supervisory assessment
Further information on Solvency II can  
be found on page 37 of the Risk 
Management section.
Flood Re is due for implementation in  
late 2015 with the aim of providing 
affordable home insurance cover to all. 
Flood Re is a not-for-profit flood 
reinsurance fund, owned and managed 
by the insurance industry. The Group 
continues to work closely with the 
Association of British Insurers (“ABI”)  
in developing the scheme.

Principal risks
The Directors consider that the principal  
risks and uncertainties facing the Group are  
as follows:
Insurance Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation and management
Underwriting risk from pricing 
strategy – the risk of an 
inappropriate pricing strategy could 
lead to business being written at 
uneconomic rates and result in lower 
than expected profitability. This 
could be driven by internal pricing 
changes or changes in the rating 
environment within the market.
If the Group’s general pricing 
strategy is not managed 
correctly, it could result in an 
unintended change in the 
Group’s risk profile, market 
share and loss ratio.
The Group continues to monitor developments 
through regular sensitivity testing of the key variables 
affecting loss performance, including loss ratios, risk 
mix, pricing, quote conversion, renewal retention 
ratios, claims costs, claims frequency and the 
adequacy of reserves.
Action regarding these risks is taken in an integrated 
approach between the executive team, underwriting, 
claims and risk management.
There is strong and regular monitoring in place to 
understand and react to the changing market rating 
environment, ensuring that we are well placed to 
benefit from any movements.
Underwriting risk from claims  
costs – the risk that a material 
increase in claims costs could 
negatively impact the Group’s 
financial performance. This includes 
risks arising from adverse claims 
litigation outcomes, increases in 
frequency of PPOs and potential 
changes to the Ogden discount rate.
An unplanned deterioration  
in the loss ratio, arising  
from inflation in claims  
costs beyond planned and 
achievable increases  
in premiums.
Loss ratio risk is managed through a robust claims 
management process and regular monitoring and 
sensitivity testing of the key variables affecting loss 
performance, including risk mix, pricing relative to the 
market, quote conversion and renewal retention 
ratios, claims costs, claims frequency and the 
adequacy of reserves.
Reserving risk – the risk that 
insufficient funds have been set 
aside to settle and handle claims as 
the amounts fall due.
Adverse development in  
prior year reserves resulting 
in deterioration of financial 
performance.
We have a prudent approach to reserving risk – the 
Group’s actuarial function analyses and projects 
historical claims development data and uses a number 
of actuarial techniques to both test and forecast 
claims provisions. In addition, the Group also provides 
data to independent external actuaries who assess the 
adequacy of the Group’s claims provisions.
Apart from historical analysis, the Group also takes 
into account changes in risk profile and underwriting 
policy conditions, changes in legislation or regulation 
and changes in other external factors (including 
assumptions on PPOs) and potential changes to the 
Ogden discount rate.
Financial Risk
Financial risk – the risk that 
inaccurate financial estimates or 
judgements could misrepresent our 
financial position and change key 
strategic decisions.
The preparation of financial 
information requires 
management to make 
judgements, estimates and 
assumptions. Actual results 
may differ from these 
estimates, which could impact 
key business decisions.
The Group reviews financial estimates and underlying 
assumptions on an ongoing basis taking into account 
changes in underwriting conditions, changes in 
legislation or regulation, and market movements.
In addition, independent external actuaries assess the 
adequacy of the Group’s technical provisions.
Ultimately, the oversight of the Group’s material 
financial estimates and judgements resides with the 
Audit Committee. esure Group Annual Report 2014

Risk management and principal risks continued
Market Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation and management
Market risk from investment 
activity – the risk that a negative 
financial impact arises from holdings 
in interest rate, currency and equity 
products, all of which are exposed to 
general and specific market 
movements.
Changes in UK interest rates 
or investment markets impact 
the return on and market 
valuation of the Group’s 
investment portfolio.
Our investment strategy does not expose the Group to 
material currency risk or the risks arising from active 
trading of derivatives. Market risk is managed through 
regular monitoring, including the drivers of investment 
return and value at risk measures, counterparty 
exposures and interest rate sensitivities.
Default risk from investment 
counterparty – the risk that an 
investment counterparty will not be 
able to pay amounts in full when due 
in accordance with the term of the 
contract, causing the Group to incur 
a financial loss.
Defaults from investment 
counterparties impact both 
the income from, and market 
valuation of, the Group’s 
investment portfolio.
The Group manages the level of investment 
counterparty credit risk it accepts by placing limits  
on its exposure to a single counterparty or groups  
of counterparties, and on geographical counterparties 
and geographical segments. Such risks are subject  
to regular review within the Investment Committee.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had no direct 
exposure to peripheral Eurozone countries  
sovereign debt.
Counterparty Credit Risk
Credit risk from reinsurance 
counterparty – the largest 
counterparty credit risk we are 
exposed to relates to reinsurers.  
This risk arises if they are not able 
to pay amounts in full when due in 
accordance with the terms of the 
contract, causing the Group to  
incur a financial loss.
Reinsurance counterparty 
defaults reduce the protection 
provided through our prudent 
reinsurance structure. This 
will have a direct impact on 
the reinsurance asset and 
earnings in the year of 
default. In addition, the 
reduction in the level of 
reinsurance due to the default 
may increase the volatility in 
earnings in subsequent years.
The creditworthiness of reinsurers is managed on  
an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength 
prior to finalisation of any contract. In addition, 
management assesses the creditworthiness of all 
reinsurers by reviewing credit grades provided by 
rating agencies and other publicly available 
information, as well as the concentration risk within 
different reinsurers and the Group. 
An analysis of reinsurers by Standard & Poor’s and  
AM Best ratings is produced and reviewed on a 
quarterly basis.
Conduct Risk
The risk we conduct ourselves, 
culturally and operationally, in a 
manner that is disadvantageous  
to our clients and cause them 
detriment.
Potentially resulting in 
reputational issues and 
regulatory censure.
Our culture and tone from the top ensures the 
interests of our customers and their fair treatment  
is paramount.
We have a strong governance framework and our 
Conduct Risk and Customer Committee reviews all 
aspects of our customer service.
Board oversight is ensured by upward reporting  
of a suite of Conduct Risk Appetite statements  
and measures.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk – the risk that the 
Group, although solvent, does not 
have available sufficient financial 
resources to enable it to meet its 
obligations as they fall due or can 
only secure them at excessive cost.
A reduction in liquidity could 
have an impact on our ability 
to meet our financial 
commitments as they fall due 
or restrict our ability to pay 
dividends to shareholders.
The Group continues to monitor its liquidity risk by 
considering the Group’s operating cash flows, stressed 
for catastrophe scenarios, dividend payouts, liquidity 
strains and investment strategy to mitigate this risk.
The Group also considers the matching of the 
investment portfolio with its insurance liabilities to 
mitigate and manage this risk.
In addition to monitoring cash flows, the matching of 
the duration of assets and liabilities is also monitored 
within the Investment Committee.
Oversight of the Group’s investment strategy and  
the associated liquidity risk is undertaken by the 
Investment Committee. esure Group Annual Report 2014
37
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Operational Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation and management
Financial crime – the risk that 
there is an increase in losses 
through crime.
Increased exposure to actual 
or attempted financial crime 
activity could result in 
financial loss, reputational 
impact or regulatory 
intervention.
A range of preventative, monitoring and detective 
controls are in place to combat such fraudulent 
activity at the key points of entry – policy inception 
and claims.
The monitoring and mitigation of financial crime is 
managed by the Group’s financial crime team 
supported by the rest of the Business.
Data Security – the risk of 
compromise to the integrity, 
confidentiality or availability of 
customer or staff personal 
information, or of commercially 
sensitive information.
This could have a detrimental 
impact on our customers or 
staff, on the reputation of the 
Group, or on our profitability 
and share price. There is also 
the potential for regulatory 
intervention or fines resulting 
from such a compromise.
The Group has robust systems in place to mitigate 
such risks, including perimeter firewalls and intrusion 
detection systems, anti-virus protection, laptop 
encryption, logical and physical access restrictions, 
rigorous vetting of new and existing staff and a clear 
desk policy. These controls are rigorously enforced 
within the Group.
Systems failure – the risk that the 
current systems fail to deliver the 
expected performance.
The failure or degradation of 
our key platforms (including 
websites from which the 
majority of new business is 
sourced), compromise of 
corporate data or, in 
particular, the personal data 
with which we are entrusted 
and material performance 
failures by key infrastructure 
suppliers.
The Group has systems monitoring and incidence 
management processes in place to mitigate this risk.
A key element to the prevention of this risk is a robust 
change management programme which is subject to 
rigorous project management disciplines from 
programme development through to deployment.
The Group has a Reportable Events process which 
reports and manages any systems failure, which is 
reported to the Board Risk Committee.
Legal and Regulatory Risk
Regulatory or legal intervention 
or changes – the risk that legal or 
regulatory reforms could negatively 
impact the Group’s financial 
performance or position.
There are a number of 
ongoing and future regulatory 
reviews of the general 
insurance retail sector. These 
reviews could have an impact 
on the revenue streams that 
we currently have in place 
and future revenue streams.
The Group continues to monitor legal and regulatory 
developments in the UK and Europe, through our close 
relationship with our regulators (the FCA and PRA) 
and other official bodies and the use of proactive risk 
management tools and processes to mitigate our 
exposure to regulatory risk.
There is continued focus on the evolution of additional 
insurance products and how we sell these products 
with the customer in mind.
Solvency II
Solvency II implementation – the 
risk that Solvency II is not 
appropriately implemented within 
esure or that there are unforeseen 
changes that impact the capital 
position. In addition, the focus on 
management in meeting the needs  
of Solvency II increases the likelihood 
of another risk arising.
Until Solvency II is 
implemented in January 2016 
there remains some 
uncertainty regarding the 
potential implications on 
esure and the market.
The Group continues to monitor developments and 
engage with the PRA to ensure that we are able to 
mitigate potential issues before they arise. The 
current risk management, actuarial and finance teams 
have been enhanced to ensure that there are 
appropriately skilled individuals available to implement 
the Solvency II requirements effectively.
This section together with the reports set out on pages 1 to 37 of the Annual Report constitute the Strategic Report.
Signed on behalf of the Board.

Corporate Governance
Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Group’s 
Corporate Governance Report for the 
year ending 31 December 2014. 
As a Board we are committed to high 
standards of corporate governance that 
underpin our sound framework for the 
control and management of our Business. 
Our Board Committees play a vital role  
in ensuring the effectiveness of our 
corporate governance. Each Committee 
Chairman has provided a report on the 
Committee’s role; you can read these 
reports on pages 46 to 51.
As previously announced, Dame Helen 
Alexander and Anthony Hobson have 
decided to step down as Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
on 13 May 2015. Dame Helen will 
continue as Deputy Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director until then. 
As a prelude to their departure from the 
Board, Dame Helen and Anthony Hobson 
stepped down as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and 
Investment Committee respectively. I 
am pleased to report that Mike Evans 
was appointed Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Anne 
Richards was appointed as Chairman of 
the Investment Committee with effect 
from 1 January 2015.
Dame Helen’s role as Senior Independent 
Director will pass to Shirley Garrood at 
the conclusion of the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting. 
I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank Dame Helen and Anthony for their 
support over the years; they have both 
been exceptionally valuable members of 
the Board.
I continue to keep the membership of 
our Board under review, ensuring we 
have the right mix of skills, experience 
and background. Currently 40% of our 
Board members are women. This 
compares extremely favourably with our 
peers. We remain committed to diversity 
and equality at the top of our 
organisation, whilst continuing to make 
appointments based on objective criteria 
to ensure we appoint the best individuals 
with diverse experience and 
backgrounds for the role. At our 
executive and senior management level, 
25% and 23% respectively are women.
After three successful years, Peter Ward 
decided to step down as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee but agreed to remain a 
member. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank Peter for his 
commitment during his chairmanship of 
the Audit Committee. I am delighted to 
report that Shirley Garrood was appointed 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee with 
effect from 1 October 2014.

The UK Corporate Governance Code
We are firmly committed to high 
standards of corporate governance 
and maintaining a sound framework 
for the control and management of 
the Business. Throughout the period 
from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 
2014, the Group has been in 
compliance with the principles and 
provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
As a major UK general insurer, the 
Group has, since 2000, been 
regulated, most recently by the FCA 
and the PRA. We are, therefore, 
familiar and comfortable with the 
corporate governance practices  
and principles expected of a listed 
company as many have been long 
established in the Business.
The Group also complies fully with the 
corporate governance requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Financial 
Services and Markets Act 2000 (and 
regulations made thereunder) applicable 
to it as a result of its insurance and 
insurance mediation businesses.
Further information on the UK 
Corporate Governance Code can be 
found at www.frc.org.uk
As part of our ongoing succession 
planning I am pleased to report that 
María Dolores Dancausa was appointed 
as a member of the Nomination 
Committee with effect from  
1 October 2014. 
I believe this report demonstrates how, 
through its actions, the Board and its 
Committees fulfil their governance 
responsibilities and how the Board works 
proactively to embed good governance 
practices across the Group on an 
ongoing basis.

Corporate Governance Report
Leadership
The Board is responsible for leading and 
controlling the Group and has overall 
authority for the management and 
conduct of the Group’s Business, strategy 
and development. The Board is also 
responsible for ensuring the maintenance 
of a sound system of internal control and 
risk management (including: financial, 
operational and compliance controls, and 
for reviewing the overall effectiveness of 
systems in place), and for the approval of 
any changes to the capital, corporate and 
management structure of the Group.
To assist the Board in carrying out its 
functions and to ensure there is 
independent oversight of internal control 
and risk management, the Board has 
delegated certain responsibilities to Board 
committees, which, except for the 
Investment Committee and the 
Nomination Committee, are comprised of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Nomination Committee is comprised 
of a majority of Independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Chairman of 
each Board Committee reports to the 
Board on its proceedings after each 
committee meeting. Each Board 
Committee has agreed Terms of 
Reference approved by the Board.
The full schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board’s decision along with the Terms 
of Reference of the Board’s key 
committees are available to view online 
at www.esuregroup.com/corporate-
information/corporate-governance 
Board meetings
The Board holds regular scheduled 
meetings throughout the year. Eight 
scheduled Board meetings were held in 
2014. Going forward, there will be seven 
scheduled Board meetings held each 
year, plus an annual strategy meeting.
When necessary, we hold additional 
Board meetings, and in 2014, we held 
two additional meetings primarily to 
discuss the proposed acquisition of 
Gocompare. If unable to attend a 
meeting, Directors are encouraged to 
provide their views and comments to the 
Chairman on the matters to be discussed 
so these can be shared with the other 
Directors at the meeting. Meeting 
attendance by each of the Directors is 
shown below.
At each meeting, the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Finance Officer reported 
on operational and financial performance. 
Diversity
esure Group is strongly committed to the 
merits of diversity at Board level and 
throughout the Business. We are 
committed to carrying out candidate 
searches across the widest possible pool 
of talent against a set of objective criteria 
based on merit; but with due regard to 
the benefits of diversity, including gender. 
Currently 40% of the Board are female.
Our Operational Executive Committee  
has two women on a committee of eight 
members (25%). Of our senior managers 
23.1% (5) are female; this increases to 
31.2% (34) for managers. Our overall 
percentage of female staff is 50.1% (817). 
We shall continue to develop the potential 
of women throughout the Group.
Directors’ external activities and 
conflicts of interest 
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid 
situations in which they have a direct or 
indirect conflict of interest or possible 
conflict of interest with the Company. 
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association the Board has the authority 
to authorise such potential conflicts and 
there is a procedure in place to deal  
with any actual or potential conflicts of 
interest. Prior to taking on additional 
responsibilities or external appointments, 
Directors are obliged to obtain 
authorisation from the Chairman and  
it is their responsibility to ensure that 
they will be able to meet the time 
commitment expected of them in their 
role at esure Group. Any potential 
conflicts approved by the Board are 
recorded in an Interests Register, and are 
noted by the Board at its next meeting.
Executive Directors may take up only one 
FTSE 100 non-executive directorship and 
are allowed to retain any fees they 
receive for such appointments. Stuart 
Vann and Darren Ogden do not hold any 
such directorships.
The Board of Directors
The Board comprises ten members: the 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and 
seven Non-Executive Directors. This will 
reduce to eight members (two Executive 
Directors and five Non-Executive 
Directors) following the departure of 
Dame Helen Alexander and Anthony 
Hobson in May 2015.
Group Executive Committee and 
Operational Executive Committee
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Finance Officer are complemented by  
a strong and experienced senior 
management team comprising seven 
executives with an average of 20 years’ 
experience in the insurance industry.  
The Group Executive Committee is 
chaired by the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Operational Executive Committee 
is chaired by the Chief Operating Officer.

Group Executive and Operational Executive Committees
The roles of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer are separate 
with responsibilities clearly divided.
The Chairman
The Chairman is responsible for the 
leadership of the Board and ensuring  
its effectiveness in all aspects of its role. 
He promotes the highest standards  
of corporate governance and ensures 
effective communications with 
shareholders. The Chairman sets  
the agenda for Board discussions to 
promote effective and constructive 
debate and to support a sound  
decision-making process, ensuring  
that the Board receives accurate,  
timely and clear information, in 
particular about the Group’s 
performance. He is also Chairman  
of the Nomination Committee. 
The Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer is 
responsible for the performance and 
management of the Group’s Business. 
In addition to membership of the Board, 
the Chief Executive Officer leads the 
Executive team in running the business 
and is charged with recommending and 
then implementing the Board’s strategy. 
He is also responsible for ensuring 
effective internal controls and risk 
management systems are in place.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer meet regularly and keep in close 
contact as they are a critical link between 
the Board and senior management. They 
also liaise on strategic and other issues. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring a 
very broad level of experience and 
independent judgement to the Board 
and make a valuable contribution to 
achieving our objectives. They provide 
a strong independent element on the 
Board and are well placed to 
challenge constructively and help 
develop proposals on strategy.
Dame Helen Alexander is the Deputy 
Chairman and also the Senior 
Independent Director. She supports the 
Chairman in his role and is also 
available as an additional point of 
contact for shareholders. Following 
Dame Helen’s departure in May 2015, 
Shirley Garrood will become the Senior 
Independent Director. 
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary provides 
administrative and logistical support to 
the Board. Advice and support are also 
given on governance, compliance and 
regulatory matters. The Company 
Secretary is available to advise all 
Directors and ensure that Board 
procedures are complied with. The 
Directors may also seek independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. No such advice was sought 
during the year.

Corporate Governance Report continued
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises ten 
members: the Chairman, two  
Executive Directors and seven  
Non-Executive Directors.
Two of the Non-Executive Directors, 
Dame Helen Alexander and Anthony 
Hobson, have decided to step down as 
Non-Executive Directors at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
on 13 May 2015. 
The Chairman, Peter Wood, has served in 
this role since 2000 and, on appointment, 
was not independent. Of the seven 
Non-Executive Directors:
• Dame Helen Alexander, Mike Evans, 
Shirley Garrood, Anne Richards  
and María Dolores Dancausa are 
considered by the Board to be 
independent for the purposes of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code
• Anthony Hobson and Peter Ward  
have served on the Board for more 
than nine years from the date of  
their respective first elections, but  
are considered by the Board to be 
independent for the purposes of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, 
notwithstanding the length of  
their service
In reaching these conclusions regarding 
the independence of Anthony Hobson and 
Peter Ward, the Board has:
• Considered the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the nature of the relationships and 
circumstances outlined above which 
are relevant to the Board’s 
determination of independence
• Evaluated the historic contribution  
of these Directors to the Group in 
scrutinising the performance of 
management, monitoring the 
reporting of performance and 
constructively challenging and 
assisting the development of the 
Group’s proposals on strategy
In addition to the assessment of 
independence pursuant to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
also believes that the ongoing 
involvement of Peter Ward as a Non-
Executive Director is in the best interests 
of the Group and shareholders bearing in 
mind his extensive experience of, and 
detailed knowledge of, the Business.
The Company therefore considers that it 
complies with the relevant requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
relation to the balance of Executive and 
independent Non-Executive Directors on 
the Board and with the requirements for 
composition of the Group’s Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and Nomination Committee.
Directors’ election and re-election
All Directors, except for Dame Helen 
Alexander and Anthony Hobson, are 
being proposed for re-election at the 
AGM, to be held on 13 May 2015.
Biographical details of each of the 
Directors, together with details of their 
skills and experience, may be found on 
pages 38 to 39. Following a formal 
performance evaluation, the Board has 
concluded that each Director’s 
performance continues to be effective 
and that they continue to demonstrate 
commitment to the role.
We believe that sufficient biographical 
and other information on Directors 
seeking re-election is provided in this 
Annual Report and the AGM Circular  
to enable shareholders to make an  
informed decision.
Executive Directors’ service 
contracts and Non-Executive 
Directors’ terms of appointment
The Chairman and each of the Executive 
Directors have a service contract with the 
Group. The service agreements of the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors 
can be terminated by not less than 12 
months’ notice by the Chairman or the 
Executive Director (as appropriate) and 
12 months’ notice by the Group. 
As the Chairman is also a controlling 
shareholder in the Company, a 
Relationship Agreement between  
Peter Wood and the Company is in  
place to ensure that the independence 
provisions as set out in the Listing  
Rules are complied with.
The Non-Executive Directors have a letter 
of appointment that sets out the terms 
and conditions of their directorship, 
including the fees payable and the 
expected time commitment. Each 
Non-Executive Director is expected to 
commit sufficient time, as is reasonably 
necessary, for the proper performance of 
their duties. Additional time commitment 
is required to fulfil the roles of Chairman 
or Board committee member.
Succession planning and Board 
appointments
The Nomination Committee has 
continued to work on ensuring an 
appropriate mix among both the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors.  
It also kept under review the succession 
planning for Executive Directors,  
Non-Executive Directors and other  
Senior Executives.
Dame Helen Alexander and Anthony 
Hobson will step down as Non-Executive 
Directors at the conclusion of the AGM  
in 2015. The Nomination Committee, 
having reviewed the skills required, 
recommended to the Board the 
appointment of Mike Evans as the 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, Anne Richards as the 
Chairman of the Investment Committee 
and Shirley Garrood as the Senior 
Independent Director.
The Board believes that with the reduced 
size of the Board it will continue to possess 
the relevant skills and competencies for 
the future under its succession plan.
No new Board appointments were made 
in 2014.
Board induction and professional 
development
On joining the Board, Directors take part 
in an induction programme to increase 
their knowledge and understanding of  
the Business. They are provided with 
information about the Group, the role of 
the Board and the matters reserved for  
its decision. Each Director is provided with 
Effectiveness esure Group Annual Report 2014
45
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
the terms of reference and membership 
of the main Board committees as well  
as corporate governance policies and 
procedures. Meetings are arranged with 
each of the Executive Directors, members 
of the Group Executive and Operational 
Executive Committees and senior 
managers across the Business as part  
of the induction programme.
The induction programme also includes 
training on:
• Legal and regulatory duties of a UK 
Listed Company Director
• Board procedures and corporate 
governance practices within esure
• Conflicts of interest
• Procedures for dealing in esure Group 
plc shares
Evaluation of Board performance
The Chairman and Company Secretary 
carried out a Board performance 
evaluation, comprising written 
questionnaires followed by one-to-one 
meetings with the Chairman. 
In addition, the Audit, Nomination, 
Investment, Risk and Remuneration 
Committees undertook an evaluation  
of their effectiveness.
The resulting report, which was 
presented and discussed at the Board 
meeting in February 2015, described a 
number of areas where we were effective 
and functioning well. We also identified a 
small number of improvements. 
The Senior Independent Director met with 
the Non-Executive Directors and Executive 
Directors to review the Chairman’s 
performance and then discussed the 
feedback with the Chairman.
Shareholder engagement
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Finance Officer, as well as other senior 
executives, held meetings with a number 
of the Group’s shareholders and 
prospective shareholders to discuss the 
Group’s strategy and financial 
performance. All Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Senior Independent 
Director, have an invitation to attend 
investor meetings if they wish. The 
Directors are provided with regular 
reports on shareholders’ and analysts’ 
views and of changes in the holdings of 
the principal shareholders.
The Group has established procedures  
to ensure the timely release of inside 
information and the publication of 
financial results and regulatory financial 
statements. The Disclosure Committee,  
a committee of senior executives and 
chaired by the Company Secretary, also 
reviews all significant announcements for 
accuracy and compliance requirements.

Corporate Governance Report continued
Composition
The Audit Committee currently has five 
serving members, all are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. During the year 
Peter Ward stepped down as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee and Shirley Garrood 
was appointed as the new Chairman with 
effect from 1 October 2014. The members 
of the Committee and attendance at 
scheduled meetings in 2014 are set out in 
the table. Although not members of the 
Committee, the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Finance Officer, Chief Risk 
Officer and General Counsel & Company 
Secretary are invited to attend each 
meeting as well as senior representatives 
from both external and internal audit. 
Other members of senior management 
are invited to present reports as necessary 
to enable the Committee to discharge its 
duties. The Board considers that all 
members of the Committee have recent 
and relevant financial experience (see 
biographies on page 39) and that the 
skills, qualifications and commercial 
experience of its members are sufficient 
for it to be able to perform its duties.
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee 
are to assist the Board in discharging its 
duties in respect of: agreeing the scope 
of the external audit, receiving and 
reviewing reports from the Group’s 
external auditor, monitoring their 
effectiveness and independence, and 
making recommendations to the Board  
in respect of their remuneration, 
appointment and dismissal; monitoring 
and reviewing internal audit activities; 
reviewing the Annual Report and 
Accounts of the Group and other 
announcements relating to its financial 
performance; reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal controls 
and reviewing the Group Whistleblowing 
policy. The Committee is authorised to 
investigate any activity within its terms  
of reference and to seek any information

The Committee’s Chairman reports

Meetings
The Committee meets at least four times 
a year, or more frequently if required, and 
any two members constitute a quorum.
Five of the Committee’s meetings in 2014 
were scheduled.
Terms of Reference
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference 
can be viewed on our website at  
www.esuregroup.com/corporate-
information. These are reviewed annually 
and were updated on 9 March 2015.
Overview of the actions taken by 
the Audit Committee to discharge 
its duties
In discharging its responsibilities  
the Committee concentrated on five  
main areas.
1  Financial reporting 
With support and input from the external 
auditor, the Committee has considered, 
challenged and reviewed the financial 
reporting for the Group, assessed 
whether suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted, whether management 
have made appropriate estimates and 
judgements and whether disclosures in 
this Annual Report for the Group are fair, 
balanced and understandable.
The Committee has also considered, 
challenged and reviewed the annual 
PRA return for the Group’s regulated 
general insurance underwriter and  
the Group’s annual return to the PRA 
under the Insurance Groups’ Directive 
solvency regime.
The Group’s control environment 
underpins the integrity of the financial 
statements. The Committee has 
considered reports from the Chief Risk 
Officer, internal audit function and 
external auditor to satisfy itself that the 
control environment supporting the 
financial statements is properly designed 
and operating effectively.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Significant financial judgements 
and financial reporting for 2014
As part of its work in the year, the Audit 
Committee, on behalf of the Board, has 
reviewed the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, the Interim Report and 
Financial Statements and the Group’s 
significant annual regulatory returns. 
In doing this, the Audit Committee has 
considered various issues and discussed 
how these are addressed:
Claims outstanding
After discussion with management and 
the external auditor, the Committee 
determined that the most significant 
judgement relating to the Group’s 
financial statements is the estimation  
of claims outstanding, which comprise 
provisions for the cost of settling all 
claims incurred but not settled at the 
balance sheet date, whether reported 
or not, and including related 
reinsurance recoveries and claims 
handling expenses. The Group’s policy 
is to hold sufficient provisions to meet 
all liabilities as they fall due, inclusive  
of a margin by reference to the Board 
approved risk appetite.
Whilst considering this issue, the 
Committee received reports and 
presentations from the external actuary 
(Towers Watson), and, for the first time, 
the internal actuary following 
management’s decision to transition to 
placing reliance on its in-house function, 
with the results of the external actuary 
now being considered as the second line 
of defence.
The Committee challenged and debated 
the process, key judgements and 
assumptions supporting the internal 
actuary’s best estimate projection, 
including a range of sensitivities and 
possible alternative scenarios and 
explanations for any significant 
differences compared with the projections 
undertaken by the external actuary.
The Committee noted the inherent 
uncertainties associated with reserving 
for certain types of claim. Factors such 
as changes in the legal environment, 
results of litigation, propensity of 
personal injury claims, changes in 
medical and care costs, and costs of 
vehicle and home repairs can all 
substantially impact overall costs and  
 
expenses of claims, and cause a 
material divergence from the bases  
and assumptions on which the reserves 
were calculated. In addition, the 
Committee gave specific consideration 
to the Group’s approach to reserving  
for claims subject to periodic payment 
orders (“PPOs”), noting that the 
methodology and discount rate applied 
are both reasonable and prudent in the 
context of market practice. 
Management confirmed to the Committee 
that they remain satisfied that claims 
outstanding included in the financial 
statements provide an appropriate margin 
over projected ultimate claims costs.
The Committee also received and 
debated reports from both the internal 
and external auditor which provided 
additional challenge and assurance 
around the work undertaken by both the 
internal and external actuary, including 
an assessment of their competence, 
capabilities and objectivity and the 
governance around the end to end 
reserving process. 
The external auditor explained to the 
Committee the work they had conducted 
during the year, including how their audit 
procedures were focused on those areas 
of claims outstanding that involve the 
most judgement. On the basis of their 
audit work, the external auditor reported 
no inconsistencies or material 
misstatements in the context of the 
financial statements, and in the 
Committee’s view this supports the 
appropriateness of the Group’s reserving 
methodology and valuation.
After further discussion and debate, the 
Committee agreed that the internal and 
external reserve projections were equally 
appropriate and supportable projections 
and that the differences between them 
were reasonable in the context of the 
overall size of the reserves.
Having considered and challenged the 
results of the internal reserving review 
compared with the independent external 
review and reports from both the internal 
and external auditor, the Committee 
concluded that the Group’s outstanding 
claims reserves are appropriate and 
include a reasonable margin above the 
internal actuary’s best estimate. 
Other matters
The Committee also considered a number 
of less significant issues, including the 
disclosure and regulatory reporting 
relating to the Group’s acquisition of 
Gocompare.com Holdings Limited and 
the Group’s IT estate refresh.
The Company has in place arrangements 
to ensure that the Annual Report,  
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced  
and understandable and provides 
shareholders with the information 
necessary to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy. The Committee examined  
the 2014 Annual Report and was 
specifically tasked by the Board to 
advise on whether the report is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
The Committee questioned and provided 
comments to those charged with 
governance and oversight of the drafting 
and production of the Annual Report, 
including the Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Finance Officer and Chief Risk 
Officer. The Committee focused on the 
overall tone and messages conveyed by 
the report and consistency with internal 
reports and information presented to the 
Committee throughout the year.
Following full consideration of all available 
information, including discussion and 
debate with both management and  
the external auditor, the Committee 
concluded that it could recommend to the 
Board that the 2014 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements are fair, balanced 
and understandable. 
2  Internal controls and key risks
Throughout the year the Audit 
Committee received reports from the 
Chief Risk Officer and Internal Audit. 
The Internal Audit function is fulfilled by 
a third-party organisation, Mazars LLP, 
who have fulfilled this function since 
2010. The Committee challenged the 
executive team on the content and 
reliability of those reports and the 
Committee has been satisfied that 
appropriate arrangements, actions or 
mitigating controls are in place in 
response to Internal Audit and Chief 
Risk Officer’s findings. 
This year the Committee reviewed all 
internal audits; of these, the most 
significant internal audits addressing key 
risk areas, during the year were: esure Group Annual Report 2014

3  Effectiveness of internal audit
The Audit Committee supports the Board 
in fulfilling its responsibilities to review 
the activities, resources, organisational 
structure and the operational 
effectiveness of the internal audit 
activities. Following discussion with the 
Committee Chairman, Mazars LLP 
present their internal audit plans for 
approval, to the Committee at the start 
of each year and provide an update and 
further plans mid-year. The Committee 
reviewed the internal audit work plans 
during the year and concluded that they 
were satisfied with the plans and that 
they were addressing the key risks. 
As part of the annual review referenced 
above, and considering management’s 
opinion, the Committee were satisfied 
that the internal audit function remains 
effective and fit for purpose.
The Internal Audit Charter can be  
viewed on our website at  
www.esuregroup.com/corporate-information
4   Effectiveness and independence 
of the external auditor
The Audit Committee oversees the 
Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor and formally reviews the 
relationship, policies and procedures to 
ensure independence. The Group’s policy 
on the provision of non-audit services is 
reviewed regularly to ensure that the 
independence and objectivity of our 
external auditors is maintained. It sets 
out the categories of non-audit services 
which the external auditors will and will 
not be allowed to provide to the Group. 
The policy states that our external 
auditors may only be used for non-audit 
work where specific services have been 
approved by the policy. However, there 
may be occasions when the external 
auditors are best placed to undertake 
other accounting, advisory and 
consultancy work on behalf of the Group.
The Group’s policy on non-audit work  
can be found on the Group’s website at 
http://www.esuregroup.com/corporate-
information/corporate-governance. 
The Committee receives reports twice  
a year detailing the fees paid to the 
external auditor for the provision of 
non-audit services. Non-audit fees paid  
to the external auditor in 2014 were 
£307,000, including £30,000 for tax 
compliance services and £235,000 
relating to the due diligence and issue of 
subordinated loan notes relating to the 
proposed acquisition of Gocompare. 
These due diligence and issuance services 
are typically performed by the external 
auditor as they are mostly assurance 
related, require detailed knowledge of  
the Group and the fee was not contingent 
or success based. Therefore, they were 
approved by the Audit Committee as they 
were not considered a threat to the 
independence of the external auditor. 
For the purposes of evaluating the 
independence of the external auditor,  
the Committee classifies the interim 
review fee as an external audit fee. 
Excluding the work performed in respect 
of the proposed acquisition of Gocompare 
and issue of subordinated loan notes, 
non-audit fees paid to KPMG were  
25% of external audit fees in the year. 
Non-audit fees were principally related  
to tax compliance services. A full 
breakdown of non-audit fees paid during 
the year is disclosed within the notes to 
the financial statements on page 90.
The Committee decided that no conflicts 
of interest were found to exist between 
the work performed for the purpose of an 
external audit and non-audit services 
provided by KPMG.
KPMG’s external audit of esure Group 
plc’s 2013 year-end Annual Report and 
Accounts was reviewed by the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Audit Quality 
Review (AQR) team. We have considered 
the findings of the AQR review as part of 
the Audit Committee’s assessment of the 
effectiveness of KPMG’s external audit.
As well as receiving and discussing the 
AQR’s final letter which summarised their 
conclusions, we had transparent 
conversations with KPMG’s external audit 
engagement partner on the areas of the 
external audit that were reviewed by the 
AQR. This included understanding the 
nature of the discussions between KPMG 
and the AQR during the review and the 
actions that will be taken in response to 
the AQR’s findings.
Specifically, the AQR recommended 
increased oversight of the IT related 
aspects of KPMG’s audit. KPMG’s initial 
risk assessment of the 2014 year-end 
audit had already addressed the need  
for increased oversight of the IT related 
aspects of the audit, given the planned IT 
investments that esure commenced in 
2014. Therefore, no modifications were 
required to the 2014 year-end external 
audit approach which was presented to 
the Audit Committee in July 2014, as a 
result of the AQR findings finalised in 
December 2014.
The Committee welcomes KPMG’s policy 
of audit partner rotation every five years, 
which facilitates independence and 
objectivity within the external audit team. 
The current external audit engagement 
partner is Murray Raisbeck, who was 
appointed to lead the audit in 2010 and 
therefore will step down following 
conclusion of his duties relating to the 
2014 audit. A new external audit 
engagement partner for the 2015 audit 
has been appointed.

performance and effectiveness of KMPG 
and has concluded that KPMG continues  esure Group Annual Report 2014

Key activities
The activities of the Nomination 
Committee during 2014 included: 
succession planning for Executive 
Directors, Non-Executive Directors and 
the Executive Team, composition of the 
Board Committees, selection of a new 
Senior Independent Director (“SID”) and 
developing talent within the business.
Meetings
The Committee meets at least twice  
a year, or more frequently if required. 
Two members, both of whom must be 
independent Non-Executive Directors, 
constitute a quorum. Other regular 
attendees at Committee meetings include 
the Chief Executive Officer and the 
General Counsel & Company Secretary.

Composition
The Nomination Committee comprises a 
majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Peter Wood, the Chairman of 
the Board, Chairs the Committee, except 
when the matters under consideration 
relate to him or succession to his role. 
The members of the Committee and 
attendance at scheduled meetings in 
2014 are set out in the table above. The 
Board considers that all members of the 
Committee have recent and relevant 
experience (see biographies on page 39).
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Committee 
include reviewing the size, structure and 
Nomination Committee
to display the necessary attributes of 
independence and objectivity.
The Committee considers the 
requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the 
appropriateness of tendering the external 
audit contract as part of normal business 
practice. Based on its ongoing 
assessment, for example through the 
quality of the external auditor’s report to 
the Committee, the findings of the AQR 
review, the audit partner’s interaction 
with the Committee and the rotation of 
the engagement partner, the Committee 
remains satisfied with the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the audit. The Committee 
therefore has not considered it necessary 
to require the audit to be put out to 
tender this year. Under the new CMA 
guidance and transitional process the 
Group will carry out a competitive tender 
and enter into a new statutory audit 
service agreement before 17 June 2023.
The Committee meets at least once  
a year with the Group’s internal and 
external auditors without management 
present and this year held four  
such meetings.
5  Audit Committee effectiveness
During the year, the Committee undertook 
an online evaluation of its effectiveness 
and the results were discussed at the 
Board meeting in February 2015, 
concluding that the Committee was 
effective and functioning well.
Conclusion
As a result of its work during the year, 
the Committee has concluded that it 
has acted in accordance with its terms 
of reference. The Chairman of the 
Committee will be at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer any 
questions about the activities of the 
Committee from shareholders.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to introduce our report on Directors’ Remuneration for 
this, our second year of being listed. In accordance with the 
directors’ remuneration reporting regulations, the report is 
divided into three sections:
1.  This Annual Statement which summarises the major 
decisions taken in respect of the Directors’ remuneration;
2.  The Directors’ Remuneration Policy setting out the 
remuneration policy for the Company’s Directors; and
3.  The Annual Report on Remuneration. This sets out how the 
Committee will implement the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy for the financial year ending 31 December 2015 and 
also the remuneration payable in respect of the financial 
year ended 31 December 2014.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was put to a binding 
shareholder vote at our AGM on 13 May 2014 and is provided 
for reference. The Remuneration Report will be subject to an 
advisory vote at the 2015 AGM. The votes for 2014 were 
99.02% in support of the Remuneration Policy and 99.85%  
in support of the Remuneration Report.
Our remuneration policy
2014 has been the first full year of the Group Remuneration 
Policy and there has been no change to the Policy that was 
adopted at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). 
The balance between annual and long-term variable pay 
remains weighted to the long-term. Flexibility has been 
incorporated into the maximum limits to allow for this weighting 
to be adapted, if appropriate, during the life of this 
remuneration policy. However, the Committee would engage 
with major shareholders before changing the annual bonus or 
performance share award limits from their current levels.
Management’s performance in 2014
During 2014 the Executive Directors’ disciplined approach to 
underwriting and focus on expenses delivered a solid set of 
financial results within challenging market conditions. Good 
progress was made on a range of important strategic initiatives, 
enhancing our customer propositions and positioning the 
Business for growth when market conditions permit. Key 
regulatory requirements were progressed, particularly towards 
the introduction of Solvency II and the executive team was 
strengthened with two important hires. The year finished with 
the announcement of, and the successful fundraising for, the 
acquisition of the remaining 50% of Gocompare.
The annual bonus for 2014 was based 75% on financial 
measure and for the first time in 2014, 25% on personal and 
customer measures. Our performance assessment resulted in 
awards of 39.70% and 26.47% of salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Finance Officer respectively, marginally over 
half the bonus opportunity.
Key activities
The Remuneration Committee met five times in 2014 and  
its key activities included: approving the 2013 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report; setting and reviewing annual bonus  
and Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) performance targets; 
remuneration benchmarking; reviewing policy on extended 
holding periods; reviewing the sharesave plan; agreeing 
employer pension contributions as salary supplement; 
considering an expected Group life scheme proposal; approving 
the packages for the Chief Operating Officer and the HR 
Director and reviewing executive and Chairman salaries.
Awards for 2015
The annual bonus for 2015 will again be based 75% on trading 
profit performance and 25% on personal and customer 
measures. The maximum opportunity remains unchanged for 
2015 at 75% of salary for Chief Executive Officer and 50% of 
salary for the Chief Finance Officer. 
The PSP awards for 2015 will continue to be based on Earnings 
per Share (“EPS”) and relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
targets. The EPS target for the 2015 awards will require EPS 
growth of 15% to 39% over the three year performance period. 
The Remuneration Committee considers these targets to be 
challenging given the current market conditions, providing the 
opportunity for management to receive some reward if they do 
very well in difficult conditions but with exceptional performance 
required for full vesting. These targets should not be interpreted 
as providing guidance on the Group’s performance over the 
relevant period.
I believe that the remuneration received by our Executive 
Directors in respect of the financial year 2014 fairly rewards 
them for the business performance achieved, and also that  
their remuneration arrangements for the year ahead will 
appropriately incentivise and reward them to deliver our 
business strategy, which will promote the long-term success  
of the Company.
I trust that this report provides a clear and helpful explanation 
of our remuneration policy and that we will receive your support 
at our AGM to be held on 13 May 2015.
Yours sincerely

This Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) 
has been provided for reference as this is not 
subject to a binding vote at the 2015 AGM. 
Information on how the Policy will be applied 
in the coming year, including the scenario 
charts, have been updated to reflect the Policy 
to be applied in 2015. The Policy, as approved 
by shareholders, can be found in last year’s 
Remuneration Report. The Policy was subject 
to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and became 
effective on 13 May 2014, following approval 
from shareholders.
Directors’ 
Remuneration 
Policy
Policy overview
The Group seeks to attract and retain the best talent for the 
benefit of the Business and to align the interests of Executive 
Directors, senior management and employees with the long-
term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.
To that end, the Group’s remuneration policies aim to provide 
appropriate reward for good performance without creating 
incentives that will encourage excessive risk taking. In setting 
the Policy, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the 
provisions within the FCA’s Remuneration Code (even though 
the Group is not required to comply with that code) and to the 
anticipated requirements of Solvency II. In particular, the 
Committee considers carefully the link between remuneration 
and risk and there is cross-membership of the Risk Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. As well as financial risk, this 
also ensures that there is an appropriate focus on Environment, 
Safety and Governance (“ESG”) issues.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee had discussed with major shareholders the 
Policy that was put to shareholders at the 2014 AGM. In the 
event that future changes to the Policy are proposed, the 
Committee would consult with its major shareholders in advance 
of changes being put to shareholders for approval at an AGM. 
The Committee will also consider any shareholder feedback 
received in relation to the AGM at the next scheduled meeting 
after the AGM and any other feedback received at any other 
time as part of the review of Executive Directors’ remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Company
The Committee regularly reviews remuneration trends across 
the Group, including the differential between the total 
remuneration at the highest and lowest levels of employees 
within the Group, and these were taken into account when 
setting the Policy. However, there has been no formal 
consultation with employees in determining the Policy.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Salary
To pay Executive Directors at a level 
commensurate with their contribution 
to the Group and appropriately based 
on skill, experience and performance 
achieved.
Set at a level that maintains an 
appropriate balance between fixed  
and variable pay ensuring good risk 
management and no undue emphasis 
on variable pay.
Takes account of individual performance, experience and responsibilities and pay as well as conditions in 
the workforce.
Set with reference broadly to mid-market levels and to remuneration generally within the Group and other 
appropriate comparator companies.
Normally reviewed annually with changes effective from 1 January. 
Paid monthly in cash three weeks in arrears and one week in advance.
Details of the current salaries for the CEO and CFO are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. However, the Committee 
is guided by the general increase for the broader employee population.
Larger increases may be awarded where the Committee determines it appropriate to take 
into account a change in role and/or responsibilities, a significant change in the size, 
composition and/or complexity of the Group, the increased experience or performance in 
role of the Executive or where other exceptional circumstances exist.
Annual bonus
Incentivises and rewards  
annual delivery of financial and 
non-financial objectives.
The Committee sets the performance measures, targets and the weighting between them annually to 
reflect the key priorities for the Business for the year ahead and may vary them from year-to-year.
All or a majority of the annual bonus will be weighted to one or more financial measures set on a sliding 
scale basis. Non-financial metrics (up to a maximum of 25% of the total bonus) may be set by the 
Committee if it determines it appropriate.
The Committee has overriding discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, 
risk or regulatory compliance issues and in the event that the level of bonus represents an excessive 
proportion of the Group’s overall profit.
The Committee may claw back bonuses already paid in the event of financial misstatement, an error in the 
performance condition assessment or gross misconduct.
Bonuses are paid in cash.
The maximum bonus opportunity under the Policy has been set at 125% of salary for the 
CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO.
Bonuses for 2015 will be a maximum of 75% of salary for the CEO and 50% of salary  
for the CFO.
No more than 25% of the maximum opportunity is payable for threshold performance.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) 
To encourage and reward delivery  
of the Group’s longer-term  
strategic objectives.
Aligns the interests of Executive 
Directors with the interests of 
shareholders through the use  
of shares.
EPS is a measure of the Company’s 
overall financial success and TSR 
provides an external assessment  
of the Company’s performance. It  
also aligns the rewards received by 
Executive Directors with the returns 
received by shareholders.
Awards are made annually. Awards vest subject to continued employment and satisfaction of applicable 
performance measured over three years.
Rewards can be made as contingent share awards or nil cost options.
Performance conditions are based on relative TSR and growth in EPS. The Committee may use alternative 
measures for future awards if it deems this appropriate. However not less than one-third of the total award 
will be determined by relative TSR.
The Committee has an overriding discretion to scale back vesting of the awards in the event that the level 
of vesting represents an excessive proportion of the Group’s overall profit.
The Committee may claw back awards paid in the event of financial misstatement, an error in the 
performance condition assessment or gross misconduct.
Dividend equivalents may be payable on vested shares in respect of dividends earned over the vesting period.
50% of any vested awards (net of tax) must be held until the minimum shareholding requirement is met 
(see below).
The maximum award limit under the Policy is 200% of salary (face value at date of grant) 
being the maximum under the plan rules.
25% of the award vests for threshold performance with a sliding scale of targets to 100% 
vesting for maximum performance. Threshold vesting under the relative TSR measure is 
for median ranking or above.
Award levels for 2015 will be limited to 175% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary  
for the CFO.

All or a majority of the annual bonus will be weighted to one or more financial measures set on a sliding 
scale basis. Non-financial metrics (up to a maximum of 25% of the total bonus) may be set by the 
Committee if it determines it appropriate.
The Committee has overriding discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, 
risk or regulatory compliance issues and in the event that the level of bonus represents an excessive 
proportion of the Group’s overall profit.
The Committee may claw back bonuses already paid in the event of financial misstatement, an error in the

Notes to the Policy Table
(1) A description of how the Committee intends to 
implement the Policy in 2015 is set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration page 59. 
(2) EPS is a key financial performance for the Group 
providing a good assessment of profitability, 
dividend cover and efficient use of share capital to 
fund the Business. TSR is measured against other 
companies and therefore provides a good measure 
of relative stock market performance, with 
management only being rewarded for the delivery 
of superior stock market levels of return. A blend  
of these measures is considered to be a 
complementary mix of financial and stock market 
performance and focuses on sustainable increases 
to profitability and superior stock market returns. 
The Committee, in selecting performance measures 
and setting targets, ensures that there is a strong 
link between the strategies adopted for the 
Business and the targets set for each PSP award 
and annual bonus cycle. Performance targets will 
be set annually prior to awards being made with 
regard to the business strategy and economic and 
market environment at that time. The Committee 
has the discretion to vary the performance 
conditions and vesting periods set for an existing 
PSP award in exceptional circumstances provided   
an event has occurred which causes the Committee 
to consider that it would be appropriate to do so 
and provided that the altered performance 
condition is, in the reasonable opinion of the 
Committee, not materially less difficult to satisfy 
than the unaltered condition would have been but 
for the event in question. The Committee shall act 
fairly and reasonably in making the alteration.
(3) The PSP plan rules contain various discretions  
which may be exercised by the Committee in the 
operation of the plan. Those discretions were set 
out in the Prospectus for the Group’s Listing and 
are incorporated into the Policy by reference.
(4) Where appropriate the Committee aims for as  
much consistency as possible between the 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors and  
for employees across the Group as a whole. For 
example all employees (including Executive 
Directors) participate in similar pension and 
benefits arrangements, and all participate in an 
annual bonus plan or profit sharing plan. The key 
difference is that only senior employees participate 
in the PSP, which is considered appropriate as 
senior executives are more able to influence the 
long term strategic (as opposed to operational) 
success of the Business, as evidenced by long-term 
EPS and TSR performance. The Company 
encourages and helps facilitate share ownership  
by all employees by offering participation in the 
Company’s Save As You Earn Plan.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. esure Group Annual Report 2014

Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
The following chart provides an indication of the remuneration 
that each Executive Director might receive in accordance with 
the Policy for 2015 in respect of minimum (fixed pay), on-target 
and maximum performance.
The following assumptions have been made in compiling these 
illustrations of remuneration.
• Fixed pay for all three scenarios is based on salary levels 
for 2015, the cost of supplying the benefits received for 
2014 and the current pension policy applied to 2015 salary
• For illustrative purposes, on-target performance under the 
annual bonus and PSP is shown at 50% of maximum
• Consistent with the Policy to be applied in 2015, the 
maximum bonus opportunity is shown as 75% of salary for 
the Chief Executive Officer and 50% of salary for the Chief 
Finance Officer. The PSP grant level is 175% of salary for 
the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of salary for the 
Chief Finance Officer
• No assumptions are made as to share price growth and 
dividend accrual, and these have been excluded from  
the analysis.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Director’s 
remuneration package in line with the Policy approved  
by shareholders.
In arriving at a total package and in considering quantum for 
each element of the package, the Committee will take into 
account the skills and experience of a candidate, the market 
rate for a candidate of that experience, as well as the 
importance of securing the preferred candidate. Annual bonus 
potential will not exceed 125% of salary and long-term 
incentives will not exceed 200% of salary (not including any 
arrangements to replace forfeited deferred remuneration). 
Participation in the annual bonus plan will normally be pro-rated 
for the year of joining and different performance measures may 
be set from those applying to the other Executive Directors, if it 
is appropriate to do so to reflect the individual’s responsibilities 
and the point in the year in which they joined the Board.
The Committee may make additional cash and/or share-based 
awards (on a one-off basis) as it deems appropriate and if the 
circumstances so demand to replace deferred pay forfeited by 
an Executive Director on leaving a previous employer.
The Committee has the discretion to make these awards under 
the PSP in excess of the 200% of salary limit or as permitted 
under the Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules (which allows 
companies to make one-off share awards in exceptional 
circumstances, including recruitment). Awards to replace 
deferred remuneration forfeited would, where possible, be 
consistent with the awards forfeited in terms of delivery 
mechanism (cash or shares), time horizons, attributed expected 
value and whether or not they were subject to performance 
conditions. Other payments may be made in relation to 
relocation expenses, recruitment from abroad, legal and other 
costs reasonably incurred by the individual in relation to their 
appointment or the relocation of an existing Executive Director. 
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed 
to vest according to its original terms, or adjusted if appropriate 
to take into account the appointment.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee would be set in accordance with the approved 
Policy in force at that time. The length of service and notice 
periods shall be set at the discretion of the Committee, taking 
into account market practice, corporate governance 
considerations and the particular candidate at that time.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss  
of office 
The Company’s policy is that service contracts do not have a 
specific duration but may be terminated with 12 months’ notice 
from the Company or the Executive Director.
Under their letters of appointment Non-Executive Directors 
serve for an initial three-year period subject to annual 
reappointment at the AGM. Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointment is terminable by either party on three months’ 
written notice except where the Director is not reappointed  
by shareholders, in which case termination is with immediate 
effect. The appointment letters for the Non-Executive Directors 
provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other 
than for accrued fees and expenses.
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are 
available for inspection at the Group’s registered office.
The obligations of the Group in respect of remuneration and 
payments for loss of office are set out on the next page. esure Group Annual Report 2014
57
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Under their service contracts the Executive Directors are 
entitled to salary (reviewed annually), pension contributions 
and benefits. The Chairman is entitled to salary (reviewed 
annually), private health cover and use of a driver (for business 
and a portion of personal travel) and these are payable for their 
notice period with an obligation to mitigate.
The service agreements of the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors can be terminated by not less than 12 months’ notice 
by either party. The Company may put the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors on gardening leave during their notice 
period, and can elect to terminate employment by making a 
payment in lieu of notice equivalent to up to 12 months’ salary. 
This payment may be made as either a lump sum on 
termination or with an amount equivalent to up to six months’ 
salary payable in a lump sum on termination and six months’ 
salary payable in monthly instalments from the seventh month 
to the twelfth month, subject to offset against any earnings 
elsewhere during that period in any new role. In addition, 
statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims 
in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
The Committee has a policy framework for payments for loss  
of office by an Executive Director, both in relation to the service 
contract and incentive pay, which is summarised below.
The recent performance of the Executive Director will be taken 
into account as a determining factor in the reason for the 
cessation and, therefore, the termination payment and exercise 
of the Committee’s discretion as are set out below.
Category A Category B Category C
Voluntary resignation and 
termination for cause
Agreed terms Death or cessation by reason 
of disability, injury, or where

Paid only until employment 
ceases.
Paid for the notice period,

Paid only until employment

Annual bonus. No entitlement. Treatment will normally  
fall between A and C, subject  
to the discretion of the 
Committee, the terms of any 
termination agreement and  
the reasons for the Executive 
Directors’ departure.
Cessation during the financial 
year or after the financial year 
end, but before payment date, 
may result in bonus being 
payable (pro-rated for the 
proportion of the financial year 
worked unless the Committee 
determines otherwise).
PSP awards. Vested unexercised, and 
unvested long-term incentive 
awards lapse on cessation of 
employment.
Treatment will normally  
fall between A and C, subject  
to the discretion of the 
Committee, the terms of any 
termination agreement and  
the reasons for the Executive 
Directors’ departure.
Awards will normally vest at the 
usual time subject to performance 
conditions being met.
In the event of death of a 
participant, awards will typically 
vest early. In other exceptional 
circumstances, awards may vest 
early subject to performance at 
the date of cessation of 
employment.
Awards are usually scaled back 
pro rata to reflect the shorter 
period of service (but with the 
Committee having discretion not 
to scale back or to reduce the 
scale back).
Other payments. None. Possible disbursements such as legal costs and outplacement services.
Note 1 – If the Committee determines, in the circumstances of a leaver, that a PSP award shall vest before the end of the full performance period then 
(where the performance condition does not specifically provide for early measurement), the Committee has the discretion to determine, on such 
reasonable basis as it decides, whether the performance condition has been satisfied. esure Group Annual Report 2014
58
Provisions on a takeover and other corporate events
In the circumstances of a takeover or other corporate event, 
outstanding PSP awards will vest at that time subject to 
satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions and scaled 
back to take account of the shorter period of service (but with 
the Committee having discretion not to scale back or to reduce 
the scale back if it considers it appropriate to do so). Where the 
performance condition under the PSP does not specifically 
provide for early measurement, the Committee has the 
discretion to determine, on such reasonable basis as it decides, 
whether the performance condition has been satisfied.
In the event of a takeover or other corporate event the 
Committee shall determine the extent (if at all) that any 
applicable performance targets have been achieved under the 
annual bonus plan, taking into account such factors as it 
considers appropriate given the curtailed performance period.
External appointments of Executive Directors
The Executive Directors may accept outside appointments, with 
prior Board approval, provided these opportunities do not impact 
negatively on the individual’s ability to perform their duties at the 
Group and the Committee shall decide whether the Executive 
Director may retain the fee payable for such appointments.

This report, together with the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM. The information that has been audited is separately identified as audited.
How the remuneration policy will be applied for the year ending 31 December 2015
A summary of how the Policy will be applied during the forthcoming year is set out below.
Salaries for Executive Directors
The Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed in December 2014. 
The table shows the salaries as at 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2015. 
Salary as at

Darren Ogden (Chief Finance Officer)* £325,500 £310,000 5%
*   Darren Ogden received an increase of 5% in comparison to the 2.6% average employee increase in 2014. This increase reflects his increased experience  
in the role. His last salary review was at the time of the IPO in March 2013. This gives an effective annual increase of 2.5%.
Salary for the Chairman
The Chairman’s salary has not been increased for 2015. The current salary is as follows:
Salary as at  
1 January 2015
Salary as at  
1 January 2014 % increase
Chairman £730,000 £730,000 0%
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have not been increased for 2015. A summary of current fees policy is as follows:
2015 2014 % increase
Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director* £125,000 £125,000 0%
Base fee £60,000 £60,000 0%
Committee Chairman £10,000 £10,000 0%
*  The role of Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director is held by one person for which a single annual fee is payable encompassing all Board duties.
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December 2015 will remain at 75% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer 
and 50% of salary for the Chief Finance Officer. The performance measures will be Group trading profit for 75% of the maximum 
bonus available and personal and customer performance measures for the remaining 25%. The forward-looking targets are 
considered to be commercially sensitive.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
PSP awards to be granted to the Chief Executive Officer in 2015 will be shares worth 175% of salary and to the Chief Finance 
Officer 150% of salary (the same as 2014). The 2015 awards will be subject to two independent performance conditions.  
Two-thirds of the award will be determined by reference to growth in earnings per share and one-third will be determined by 
reference to relative total shareholder return as set out below. Performance will be measured over a three-year period beginning 
on 1 January 2015. Awards will vest, subject to performance, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.

The annual bonus for 2014 was based 75% on a financial measure and, for the first time in 2014, 25% on personal and customer 
measures. The financial measure is assessed on Group’s trading profit with reference to a sliding scale. Actual trading profit was 
£115.4 million which was between threshold and target performance and represented a solid set of financial results given market 
conditions. The personal measures focus on the delivery of esure’s strategic priorities and developing organisational capability and 
enhancing succession plans. The customer measure focuses on embedding a culture that places customers are at the heart of 
esure’s business and is based on achievement against a wide range of measures which are assessed monthly and cover the broad 
range of customer outcomes. The scale for the personal and customer measures ranges from not achieved to fully achieved. The 
Committee deemed the objectives to be fully achieved for 2014 and this was independently reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer. The 
outcome during 2014 is set out below:
         Max opportunity % of salary          Actual % achieved
          Total Executive Financial Non-financial Overall Financial Non-financial
Stuart Vann 56.25% 18.75% 75.00% 20.95% 18.75% 39.70% £188,575
Darren Ogden 37.50% 12.50% 50.00% 13.97% 12.50% 26.47% £82,057
The 2014 financial targets are not disclosed in this report as they are considered commercially sensitive by the Board, given the 
close link between performance targets and long term strategy. In addition, the Committee believes disclosing targets would put 
esure at a competitive disadvantage. The Committee will disclose targets when they are no longer deemed commercially sensitive.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, risk or regulatory 
compliance issues and also in the event that the level of bonus represents, in the Committee’s view, an excessive proportion of the 
Group’s overall profitability. There were no events in 2014 which led the Committee to determine that a scale back of the annual 
bonus payment was appropriate. In addition, the Committee did not consider that the level of bonus represented an excessive 
proportion of the Group’s overall profitability such that it should be scaled back.

Outstanding PSP awards 
PSP awards are subject to an Earnings per Share (“EPS”) growth target for two-thirds of the award and a relative Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) target for one-third of the award.
Earnings per share growth targets 2013 Awards 2014 Awards
Threshold (25% vesting) 21% 15%
Stretch (100% vesting) 39% 39%
 The table provides the target growth at threshold and maximum for 
2013 and 2014. EPS targets rise from threshold to maximum and vest  
in between on a straight-line basis. EPS is measured over a three-year 
period (from the 2012 and 2013 EPS respectively). 
TSR target – the Group’s TSR is ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 250 index at the date of grant (excluding investment 
trusts and the Company). 25% of this part of the award subject to the TSR target vests for median performance rising on a straight-
line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile ranking or above. TSR is measured over the period starting with the Listing date and 
ending on 31 December 2015 for the 2013 award and between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016 for the 2014 award. 
PSP post-vesting holding periods
Under the PSP Executive Directors have agreed to retain any shares (net of tax) for a six-month period post-vesting.
Sourcing of shares (dilution limits)
In compliance with the ABI guidelines, the rules of the PSP, the Group Sharesave Plan (the “Sharesave Plan”) and Share Incentive 
Plan (“SIP”) provide that, in any period of ten calendar years, not more than 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
may be issued under the PSP, Sharesave Plan or SIP and any other employee share scheme adopted by the Company. In addition, 
the PSP provides that in any period of ten calendar years, not more than 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital may 
be issued under the PSP and any other executive share plan adopted by the Company.
The Company operates within these limits, currently 1.3% in all employee share scheme plans and 0.9% in Executive Plans. 
Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited)
To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build up shareholdings 
equivalent to 150% of salary, through the retention of shares vesting under the Company’s share plans. Executive Directors are 
required to retain at least 50% of their net-of-tax value of any vested PSP awards, until such time as the share ownership target 
has been met.

Corporate Governance Code.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer, 
Chief Risk Officer and HR Director may, by invitation, attend 
meetings, except when their own remuneration is discussed. No 
Director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration. 
None of the Committee members have had any personal 
financial interest, except as shareholders, in the matters decided. 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
External advisors
The Committee is advised by New Bridge Street (“NBS”), a 
trading name of Aon Hewitt being a subsidiary of Aon plc. NBS 
was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2011. NBS 
meets with the Remuneration Committee Chairman at least 
once a year to discuss matters such as topical issues in 
remuneration which are of particular relevance to the Company, 
and how best it can work with the Company to meet the 
Committee’s needs.
Aon Benfield (which is part of Aon but is a separate business 
division to Aon Hewitt) are the Group’s reinsurance brokers.
The total fees paid to NBS in respect of its services to  
the Committee for the year ending 31 December 2014  
were £91,922. Fees are predominantly charged on a  
“time spent” basis.
NBS were appointed as external advisors prior to the 
Company Listing in 2013, after a robust tending process.  
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice 
received from external advisors was independent.

Directors’ and Officers’ insurance and indemnities
The Group maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
which gives appropriate cover should legal action be brought 
against its Directors. In addition, indemnities are in force under 
which the Group has agreed to indemnify the Directors against all 
liabilities and related costs that they may incur in the execution of 
their duties. Copies of these indemnities are kept at our registered 
office and are open for inspection by any member . These 
indemnities do not cover the Directors for fraudulent activities. 
Employees
During 2014, the Group employed an average of 1,613 people. 
The Group is committed to creating an environment in which 
individual differences and contributions are recognised and 
valued, and to safeguard a working environment that promotes 
dignity and respect to all. No form of victimisation, 
discrimination, bullying or harassment will be tolerated.
We seek to promote equal opportunities for all, through the 
provision of employment practices and policies which recognise 
the diversity of our employees and ensure that neither our 
employees nor prospective employees receive less favourable 
treatment on the basis of their perceived or actual age, 
disability, race, religion or belief, sex (including gender, marital 
status, pregnancy or maternity, or gender reassignment or 
sexual orientation), working hours (part-time, full-time or 
fixed-term employees) or physical characteristics.
The Group is committed to employing people who are disabled 
or who become disabled during their career by making 
reasonable adjustments as appropriate. Actively working with 
the “Access to Work” government scheme enables the Group to 
support the continued employment of disabled employees and 
prospective disabled employees. The training, career 
development and promotion of disabled people is, as far as 
possible, identical to that of other employees.
Employees are kept up to date with regular Chief Executive 
Officer briefings, quarterly business updates, team meetings 
and other internal communications. Employees’ views are 
gathered through our Employee Consultation Group, 
department forums and employee surveys.
Further information in respect of actions taken with the aim of 
encouraging employee involvement and achieving employee 
awareness in the Company has been disclosed in the Strategic 
Report on page 29. esure Group Annual Report 2014

Human rights
The Group resides and offers its products only within mainland 
UK. We are subject to both the European Convention on Human 
Rights and the UK Human Rights Act 1998. We respect all 
human rights and enact these particularly in relation to fair 
treatment, the avoidance of discrimination and privacy for  
our customers, suppliers and staff. We aim to ensure that 
employees comply with all relevant UK legislation and 
regulations, and this is underpinned by the policies in place  
and managed by our Human Resources function.
Political donations
Our policy is not to make any donations or contributions to 
political parties or organisations and no such payments were 
made during the year.
Environment
Global emissions
This report presents a narrative report for the 2014 Greenhouse 
Gas (“GHG”) Mandatory Reporting requirement of esure Group’s 
UK operations. 
Methodology: The footprint is calculated in accordance with the 
GHG Protocol and Carbon Trust (“CT”) guidance on calculating 
organisational footprints. Activity data has been converted into 
carbon emissions using published emissions factors. The data 
used has been provided by the Group and sense checked (but 
not formally verified) by Utilitywise PLC.
Emissions sources: The footprint includes the “Scope 1”  
(fossil fuel and refrigerant leakage) and “Scope 2” (electricity) 
emissions associated with the offices in which the Group is 
based. For the purposes of the report only “Scope 1” (Direct) 
and “Scope 2” (Indirect) emissions sources are required. 
Organisational boundary: The footprint includes data for the 
three offices in which the Group employs staff (Reigate, 
Manchester and Glasgow) as well as the two domestic 
apartments. Note that this does not include outsourced 
activities, for example repair shops and third-party suppliers.

Data quality: The quality of the data used for the footprint 
calculations has been rated as “good”, “average”, “poor” or 
“based on benchmarks”. Around 99.8% of emissions in the 
footprint were based on “good” quality data; this is a weighted 
percentage according to contribution by the emissions source.
esure Group plc’s 2014 GHG Mandatory Report
This report is based on the 12 months between 1 January 2014 
and 31 December 2014, reflecting the financial year of the Group.
The total carbon emissions associated with the Group’s UK 
operations were 3,154 tCO

Change of control
There are no material agreements to which the Group is party 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the Group following a takeover bid.
The provisions of the Company’s employee share plans may 
cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest 
upon a change of control.
Share capital
Our share capital consists of one class of Ordinary Shares of 
1/12p each. Each share ranks equally and carries the same 
rights to vote and receive dividends and other distributions 
declared. There are no restrictions on the transfer or holding of 
shares in the Company. As at 31 December 2014 the Company 
had 416,842,797 Ordinary Shares in issue. The Company does 
not hold any shares in Treasury.
The rights attached to shares which are the subject of awards 
under any of our employee share plans are not available until 
any award or option is exercised and the shares are allotted or 
transferred to the relevant individual. The Trustee of our 
employee benefit trust is obliged to act in the best interests of 
the share plans’ beneficiaries. At General Meetings, the Trustee 
may exercise discretion and vote in respect of Trust shares 
although it may not always choose to do so. Where shares are 
beneficially held by an employee within a share plan they may 
direct the Trustee to vote on their behalf. 
Power of Directors to issue shares
The Directors require express authorisation from shareholders 
to allot new shares. A Resolution will be proposed at the 2015 
AGM to renew the authority to allot shares. 
Purchase of own shares
The Directors require express authorisation from shareholders 
to purchase our own shares. Accordingly, at the 2015 AGM,  
the Company proposes to renew the authority granted by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2014, to repurchase up to a 
maximum of 10% of its issued share capital. At the present 
time, the Company has no plans to exercise this authority and 
did not exercise the authority during 2014.
Further details are provided in the 2015 Notice of the AGM.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2014, the Company had been notified, in 
accordance with Disclosure and Transparency Rule 5.1.2R, of 
interests in 3% or more of the voting rights attached to the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital, as set out in the

Relationship Agreement with controlling shareholder 
Peter Wood, the Company’s Chairman, is a controlling 
shareholder of the Company with a total holding of 
approximately 30.9% of the Company’s voting rights.
The Company entered into a Relationship Agreement with  
Peter Wood on 8 March 2013 which was amended and restated 
on 29 October 2014.
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to 
ensure that the Company is capable at all times of carrying on 
its business independently of Peter Wood and certain persons 
deemed to be connected with him.
In addition to other undertakings and agreements, the 
Relationship Agreement contains the following undertakings: 
(a)  that transactions and arrangements between the Company

Restrictions on voting rights
All shareholders entitled to attend and vote at a General Meeting 
may appoint a proxy or proxies to attend, speak and vote in 
their place. A member may appoint more than one proxy 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights 
attached to a different share or shares held by the shareholder. 
A proxy need not be a shareholder. Proxy forms must be 
received by our registrars at least 48 hours before the time 
appointed for holding a meeting, as set out in any Notice or in 
any form or proxy circulated by us. The appointment of a proxy 
does not preclude a shareholder from attending and voting in 
person at a General Meeting. Further details may be found in 
the Notice of Meeting sent to shareholders in advance of the 
2015 AGM, a copy of which is also available on our website at 
www.esuregroup.com/investors/shareholder-information/agm
Auditor
KPMG LLP have been appointed as auditors after an orderly 
wind down of KPMG audit plc who had been our auditor for  
a number of years. The Audit Committee considers that the 
relationship with the auditor is working well and remains 
satisfied with their effectiveness. The auditor is required to 
rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group and key 
subsidiaries audits in 2015, and will do so. There are no 
contractual obligations restricting our choice of auditor.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Each Director at the date of the approval of this report  
confirms that:
• So far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware.
• He or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditor is aware of that information.
Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
on a going concern basis. The financial performance and 
position of the Group, its cash flows and its approach to capital 
management are set out in the financial review on pages 23  
to 28. The Group has a strong financial position, with robust 
reserves, a conservative investment portfolio and capital 
significantly in excess of the minimum regulatory requirement. 
In addition, the Board has reviewed the Group’s projections for 
the next 12 months and beyond, including cash flow forecasts 
and regulatory capital surpluses. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months.
Material contracts
Save as disclosed below, there are no material contracts (other 
than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business) 
to which the Group is a party:
• An agreement between the Group and CapGemini for  
the outsourcing of IT services. The initial term of the 
agreement was for five years from 1 April 2010 to  
31 March 2015. On 16 May 2014 a new seven year 
agreement between the Group and CapGemini was signed
• Share Purchase Agreement relating to the sale and purchase 
of shares in Gocompare.com Holdings Limited between 
Hayley Parsons and others and esure Services Limited and 
esure Group plc dated 8 December 2014 esure Group Annual Report 2014
68
Directors’ Report continued
• An Option and Shareholders’ Deed relating to Gocompare.
com Holdings Limited. The Group is entitled to appoint up 
to 50% in number of the board of directors of Gocompare
• The Relationship Agreement between the Company and 
Peter Wood remains in force until the Ordinary Shares 
cease to be admitted to the Official List of the FCA and to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange; or the Potential 
Controlling Shareholder ceases to own, when taken 
together, 15% or more of the Ordinary Shares or the 
voting rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares unless at the 
time the Potential Controlling Shareholders shall cease to 
own, when taken together, 15% or more of the Ordinary 
Shares or the voting rights attaching to the Ordinary 
Shares, Peter Wood remains the Chairman of the Company, 
in which event the Relationship Agreement shall terminate 
six months after Peter Wood ceases to be the Chairman of 
the Company
Research and development
In the ordinary course of business, the Group develops new 
products and services in each of its business divisions.
Special rights
There are no persons holding securities that carry special rights 
with regard to the control of the Group.
Appointment, retirement and removal of Directors
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed by 
the Company’s Articles of Association (“the Articles”), the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), the Companies Act 
2006, the Relationship Agreement between the Chairman and 
the Company and related legislation. The Articles may only be 
amended by a special resolution of the shareholders.
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board 
holds office only until the following AGM of the Company and  
is then eligible for reappointment.
Under the Relationship Agreement between the Chairman and 
the Company, as long as the Chairman or any of his associates, 
when taken together, hold at least 15% of the shares or voting 
rights attaching to the shares, the Chairman will be entitled to 
appoint, remove and reappoint one person to be a Director, who 
may be either himself or another person nominated by him. 
The Articles require that at each AGM at least one-third 
(rounded down) of the Directors retire by rotation. The retiring 
Directors are eligible to stand for re-election. The Code 
recommends that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies should 
be subject to annual re-election, and all Directors, except Dame 
Helen Alexander and Anthony Hobson who are both stepping 
down, will stand for re-election at the 2015 AGM.
In addition, to any power of removal conferred by the Companies 
Act, the Company may, by special resolution, remove any 
Director before the expiration of his or her period of office.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management and internal control. To 
ensure that this is achieved and that the risk management and 
internal controls are embedded in the running of the business, 
the Group operates a three lines of defence structure which  
is regularly reported on to the Audit and Risk Committees.  
This framework mitigates the risk of failure to achieve  
business objectives, unforeseen losses and material  
financial misstatement.
There are a number of controls in place within this framework 
to ensure that the Group has robust procedures for preparing 
consolidated accounts and for financial reporting.
The Risk Committee and the Audit Committee respectively, 
regularly review the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. Their monitoring 
focuses on material risks and controls and is based principally 
on reporting upwards within the framework from business 
management, risk management and the internal audit function 
so that the Committees may consider whether significant 
weaknesses exist. During the course of the reviews, the 
Committees have not identified or been advised of any failings 
or weaknesses which they have determined to be significant.
To support Group policies and to facilitate the raising of concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 
any other matters, the Group provides a confidential telephone 
hotline, so that staff or third parties may report anonymously 
any perceived inaccurate or unethical working practices.
The Audit and Risk Committees endeavour to ensure that the 
Group has in place appropriate and effective controls, checks, 
systems, and risk management techniques. 
Internal Audit
The Group’s Internal Audit function is fully outsourced.
The activities and effectiveness of Internal Audit are monitored 
and reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that adequate access to information and 
resource is given to the Lead Internal Auditor and for approving 
the appointment and removal of the Lead Internal Auditor. The 
Lead Internal Auditor reports directly to the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. Internal Audit reports are presented to the 
Audit Committee on the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal controls and the adequacy of these systems to manage 
business risk and to safeguard the Group’s assets and resources. 
Internal Audit uses the Group’s risk registers to plan and inform 
their annual audit programme around the most significant risks 
to the Business to ensure that controls are in place and are 
designed and operating effectively. The Audit Committee reviews 
and approves the Annual Internal Audit Plan.
This section together with the reports set out on pages 40 to 68 
are approved by order of the Board.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of 
the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent 
company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and parent company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent 
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU 
• For the parent company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the parent company financial statements 
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors in respect  
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
• The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report included a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of 
esure Group plc only
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of esure Group plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2014 set out on pages 73 to 121. 
In our opinion:
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended
• The Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
• The parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards
• The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements 
the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
Claims outstanding £597.3m and claims outstanding 
recoverable from reinsurers £194.4m
Refer to page 47 (Audit Committee Report), page 83 
(accounting policy) and pages 104 to 109 (financial disclosures).
The risk – As part of its business model the Group incurs 
significant claims. There is typically a time lag between a claim 
being incurred and being settled. As a result, the Group has 
significant claims outstanding at any point in time, including the 
year-end, and there is inherent uncertainty as to the level at 
which these claims outstanding will be settled. At 31 December 
2014 the Group had claims outstanding representing 57% of 
total liabilities, and claims outstanding recoverable from 
reinsurers representing 15% of total assets.
The valuation of claims outstanding is one of the key 
judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on, due to the 
level of subjectivity inherent in the estimation of the effect of 
uncertain or unknown future events and the resulting potential 
exposure to large losses, including those arising from periodic 
payment orders for Motor insurance (a structured settlement in 
the form of a regular series of payments over the remainder of 
a claimant’s life, see page 105) and extreme weather condition 
losses for Home insurance. The calculation of claims 
outstanding is complex and requires the use of actuarial 
techniques to estimate the reserve for claims incurred but not 
reported (“IBNR”). The Directors set the claims outstanding 
reserves at a level that they consider includes an appropriate 
margin over the esure actuarial best estimate, in order to take 
account of current uncertainties around factors that may 
influence the value of reserves.
The valuation of claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers 
is dependent on the valuation of the underlying claims 
outstanding and as a result is subject to the same estimation 
uncertainties as the claims outstanding. Reinsurance recoveries 
are also subject to credit risk associated with reinsurer credit 
default. There are no indicators of credit default issues on 
reported claims, however credit risk is relevant for the 
recoveries associated with the claims outstanding that have  
a long duration.
During the year, management have shifted the level of reliance 
away from the external actuary to its in-house function with  
the results of the external actuary now being considered as a 
second line of defence. The underlying data used by the external 
actuary and in-house function are the same, and the main audit 
risk as a result of this change in reliance by management relates 
to the competency of the in-house actuarial function and the 
appropriateness of the methodologies adopted. 
Our response – In this area audit procedures included testing 
governance arrangements and key controls around the internal 
reserving process, including controls over the setting of 
reserves for reported claims, controls over the completeness 
and accuracy of the data underlying the actuarial projections 
used to set the reserve for IBNR, as well as substantive 
procedures over the projections made by the actuaries. We also 
considered the findings of the external actuary’s review of 
claims outstanding as part of our audit. Our actuarial specialists 
were involved in the detailed audit work around this risk.
Through critical assessment of relevant documentation, including 
the final report of the external actuary, and discussion with  
both Directors and the internal actuary, we have obtained an 
understanding of the reserving methodology and the key 
assumptions used (including the inflation rate used for the 
average cost of small bodily injury claims and the discount rate 
used for the periodic payment orders (structured settlements  
in the form of a regular series of payments over the remainder  
of a claimant’s life)). We have assessed these assumptions for 
reasonableness, through analytical procedures including claims 
development trends over time and benchmarking of key 
reserving metrics against our expectations, as well as 
consistency with prior periods. We considered the movement in 
reserves relating to claims incurred in prior years to assess the 
reasonableness of Directors’ past assumptions and the 
methodology used to estimate claims outstanding. Where there 
have been changes in the methodology or key assumptions we 
have assessed whether these are reasonable based on changes 
in the industry and the Group’s historical claims experience, and 
have considered whether all changes we would expect to see 
have been made. We have also considered the reasonableness 
of the differences in methodologies, assumptions and projections 
between the internal and external actuary by understanding the 
rationale for both approaches and comparing the impact of these 
differences on the outputs in the context of materiality. 
We benchmarked the Group’s methodology, key assumptions, 
and projected results (such as the ultimate loss ratios) against 
our expectations given our cumulative knowledge of the sector. esure Group Annual Report 2014
71
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
In respect of the margin that the Directors have set over the 
esure actuarial best estimate, we considered the consistency of 
the basis for the margin applied to the actuarial best estimate 
year-on-year. This included an assessment of the potential 
uncertainties that have been reserved for within the margin.
We also evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity 
of the internal and external actuaries, based on discussions with 
them, our knowledge of the actuaries’ qualifications and the 
professional standards that their work is subject to, and by 
providing challenge to their analysis through the procedures 
described above. We used our own actuarial specialists to assist 
in performing the procedures described.
We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures about the degree of estimation uncertainty and the 
sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions, 
and assessed whether the disclosures comply with relevant 
accounting standards.
We evaluated and tested key controls around reinsurers’ share 
of claims outstanding, including controls over approval of 
reinsurance contracts and calculation of reinsurance recoveries, 
and reinsurance credit controls. We used our actuarial 
specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of 
reinsurance recoveries on IBNR by considering the historical 
ratios of paid and reported claims net of reinsurance recoveries 
to paid and reported claims gross of reinsurance recoveries. We 
have also obtained an understanding of the methodology 
applied to calculate the allowance for reinsurance bad debt 
which is included within claims outstanding, and we have 
assessed the methodology for appropriateness and consistency 
with prior periods.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope 
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £7.2m, determined with reference to a benchmark  
of Group profit before taxation (of which it represents 7%).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £0.36m, in addition to  
other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed for all key 
reporting components (material subsidiaries or joint ventures). 
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes were 
undertaken by the Group audit team with the exception of 
Gocompare.com Holdings Limited (‘Gocompare’) where the 
audit was undertaken by UK component auditors who reported 
back to the Group audit team. The Group audit team instructed 
the component auditor as to the significant areas to be covered, 
including the relevant risks and the information to be reported 
back. The Group audit team approved the Gocompare 
materiality of £3.2m for Group reporting purposes.
These Group audit procedures covered 100% of total Group 
revenue; 100% of Group profit before taxation; and 100% of 
total Group assets as audits were performed for all components.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006
• The information given in the Strategic Report and  
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the Annual Report that contains  
a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the

is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• We have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and

shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, or
• The Corporate Governance Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:

the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns, or
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made, or
• We have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:

esure Group Annual Report 2014 
1 General information 
esure Group plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales. Its registered office is The Observatory, Reigate, Surrey RH2 0SG.  
The nature of the Group’s operations is th e writing of general insurance for private cars and homes. The Company’s principal ac tivity 
is that of a holding company.  
All of the Company’s subsidiaries are located in the United Kin gdom, except for esure S.L., which is incorporated in Spain. 
2 Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements present the esure Group plc group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, 
comprising the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes, as well as the comparatives.  
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union.  
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial performance and position of the 
Group, its cash flows and its approach to capital management are set out in the financial review on pages 23 to 28. The Group h as a 
strong financial position with robust reserves, a conservative investment portfolio and capital significantly in excess of the minimum 
regulatory requirement. In addition, the Board has reviewed the Group’s projections for the next 12 months and beyond, includin g 
cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months. 
These consolidated financial statements have been presented in Sterling and rounded to the ne arest hundred thousand. Throughout 
these consolidated financial statements any amounts which are less than £0.05m are show n by 0.0, whereas a dash (–) represents 
that no balance exists. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and land 
and buildings that are measured at fair value at the reportin g date. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Changes to accounting policies 
There have been no new standards or interpretations adopted by the Group during the period. The Group has adopted the following 
amendments to standards during the period, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2014: 
 Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Fina ncial Liabilities. These amendments address inconsistencies in 
current practice when applying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 for financial assets and liabilities. The adoption of these 
amendments has had no impact on the Group’s accounting policies. 
 Amendments to IAS 39 – Novation of Derivatives and Continuati on of Hedge Accounting. These amendments provide relief from 
discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria. The 
adoption of these amendments has had no impact on the Group as the Group has not novated its derivatives during the current 
or prior year.  
 Amendments to IAS 36 – Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets. These amendments remove the unintended 
consequences of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement on the disclosures required under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. In addition, 
these amendments require disclosure of the recoverable amounts for the assets or ca sh-generating units (CGUs) for which an 
impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the peri od. The adoption of these amendments has had no impact on the 
disclosure provided in the Group’s financial statements.  
There are a number of other new standards an d amendments to standards with a date of initial application of 1 January 2014, the 
adoption of which has had no material e ffect on the Group’s accounting policies.  
At the date of approval of these financial statements there were no standards, amendm ents or interpretations in issue and endor sed 
by the EU which the Group had not adopted. The following IFRIC in terpretation has been endorsed by the EU, but is not mandatory 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 and ha s not been early adopted by the Group: 
 Effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 17 June 2014: IFRIC 21 – Levies. This interpretation clarifies that a 
government (or governmental agency) levy is not recognised until the obligating event specified in legislation/regulation occur s, 
even if there is no realistic opportunity to avoid the obligation. The adoption of this interpretation is expected to have no m aterial 
effect on the Group’s accounting policies.  
There are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been i ssued by the IASB but which have not yet 
been endorsed by the EU, thus the date an d impact of applying these is uncertain.

2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights t o, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the en tity. 
Subsidiary companies are consolidated using the acquisition method.  
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtained control, and conti nue  
to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.  
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, any intra- group balances, unrealised gains and losses or income and expen ses 
arising from intra-group trading are eliminated. Where accounting policies used in indi vidual financial statements of a subsidiary 
company differ from Group policies, adjustments are made to bring these policies in line with Group policies. 
Joint ventures  
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint co ntrol, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method of a ccounting. The Group recognises the cost of the investments which, together with the 
Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-acquisition changes to shareholders’ funds, is included in the consolidated statement of 
financial position. The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income is stated after appropr iate 
adjustments to align the accounting policies of the joint venture with those of the Group. In addition, adjustments are made fo r  
the amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets recognised on acquisition and to eliminate unrealised profits rel ating  
to commission charged to esure Group plc by the joint venture. Carrying values are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indi cations exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and 
compared to the carrying value. Impairment losses are recognised through the in come statement. Impairment may be reversed  
if conditions subsequently improve and credited through the income statement. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate  
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of non-controlling interest in the acq uiree, 
plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group has an option to measure any no n-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at 
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Goodwill is recognised at the date of acquisition as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the ident ifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Where the excess is negati ve a gain is recognised in the income statement at the date  
of acquisition. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date.  
All acquisition-related costs are expensed in the income statement when incurred. 
Revenue 
Gross written premiums  
Gross written premiums, being the total premiums receivable for the whole period of cover provided by contracts entered into 
during the accounting period, excluding taxes or duties based on premiums, are recognised on the date which the policy 
commences. Gross written premiums include any adjustments arising in the accounting peri od for premiums receivable in respect  
of business written in prior accounting periods.  
Unearned premiums 
The proportion of gross written premiums that are to be earned in the accounting period after the balance sheet date are deferr ed 
as a provision for unearned premiums. Premiu ms earned are computed separately for each insurance contract and are recognised 
as revenue using the daily pro rata method, which is consistent wi th the incidence of risk assumed over the coverage period of the 
related policy. 
Reinsurance premiums  
Reinsurance premiums are recognised and measured in a manner cons istent with the related insured contracts issued by the Group 
and the specific terms of each reinsurance contract. Reinsurance premiums are expensed over the period that the reinsurance cover 
is provided based on the expected pattern of the reinsured risk s. The unexpired portion of ceded reinsurance premiums is includ ed 
in reinsurance assets. 
Unearned reinsurance premiums 
Unearned reinsurance premiums are those proportions of premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after the repo rting 
date. Unearned reinsurance premiums are deferred over the term of the underlying direct insurance policies for risks-attaching 
contracts and over the term of the reinsura nce contract for losses-occurring contracts.

2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Fees for additional services  
Additional Services Revenues comprise sales of non-underwritten additional insurance products to Motor and Home insurance 
customers; policy administration fees; fees generated from the appointment of firms used during the claims process; car hire 
suppliers; and, prior to the implementation of the Legal Aid, Se ntencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicable legal 
panel membership fees. 
Revenue earned on the sale of additional services includes bo th brokerage fees and commission, where the Group has a continuing 
relationship with the customer, and introducer fees where the Gr oup does not have a continuing relationship with the customer.  
Revenue relating to insurance broking is brought into account at the later of policy inception date or when the policy placemen t has 
been completed and confirmed. Where the Group has an obligation to provide future services to the customer an element of income 
relating to the policy is deferred to cover the cost of fulfillin g the associated contractual obligation plus a reasonable prof it margin. 
Deferred revenue is credited to the income statement over the pe riod matching the Group’s obligations to provide those services . 
Where the Group has no contractual obligation to provide fu ture services, the revenue is recognised immediately. 
In certain circumstances, where the revenue cannot be reliably me asured at the contract or policy inception date, broking fees  
and commission are recognised on a periodic basis when the consid eration becomes due. Rebates of commissions and fees relating 
to the return of premiums for additional insurance products and services are recognised when liability is possible.  
Administration fees are recognised in the period in which the related administration services are provided. Referral fees from credit 
hire are recognised at the later of the point of invoice or when the policy fees are due. 
Investment income and instalment interest  
Investment income (including interest received from policyholde rs who pay by instalment) on assets classified as loans and 
receivables is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated by using the effective interest rate method.  
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the 
interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the asset or liability. The effective interest rate is the rate t hat exactly 
discounts estimated future cash flows to the instrument’s initial carrying amount. Calculation of the effective interest rate t akes into 
account fees payable or receivable that are an integral part of the instrument’s yield, premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue, 
early redemption fees and transaction costs. All contractual terms of a financial instru ment are considered when estimating future 
cash flows.  
Investment income also comprises interest and dividend income and net gains (both re alised and unrealised) on financial assets 
classified at fair value through profit or loss, including deri vative financial instruments. Dividends are recognised when the right to 
receive payment is established. For listed securities, this is the date the security is listed as ex-dividend.  
Investment income also includes rental income. Rental income represents income arising from operating leases and is recognised  
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Government grants 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assu rance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions 
will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the 
grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognis ed as 
deferred income and released to the income statement in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. 
Claims and expenses recognition  
Gross claims incurred and claims handling expenses 
Gross claims include all claims incurred during the year, whether reported or not, le ss other recoveries, together with related 
internal and external handling costs that are directly related to the processing and settlement of claims, and any adjustment t o 
claims outstanding from previous years.  
Reinsurance claims 
Reinsurance claims are recognised and measured in a manner consis tent with the related insurance contracts issued by the Group 
and the specific terms of the reinsurance contract. 
Finance costs 
Finance costs comprise interest paid which is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated by using the 
effective interest rate method. Accrued interest is included wi thin the carrying value of the interest bearing financial liabil ity.

Taxation 
Current tax 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities . The 
tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enac ted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Current tax 
assets and liabilities also include adjustments in respect of tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods.  
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income and not in the income statement. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full using th e balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation purposes. It is calculated at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is recovered, using tax rates ena cted or 
substantially enacted by the reporting date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the income stat ement is also recognised outside the income statement, either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax asset s against 
current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Foreign 
currency differences are recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is recognised on business combinations and the acquisitio n of joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losse s. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is presented in intangible assets. For joint ventures, goodwill is not separately pre sented 
but is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Negative goodwill is recogn ised in the Group income statement at the date 
of acquisition. Positive goodwill is not amortised.  
Impairment of goodwill  
Goodwill arising on a business combination is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of the cash-generating unit (or units) to which the good will is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount. A recognised 
impairment loss is not reversed. 
Goodwill attributed to an investment in a joint venture accounted under the equity method is not tested for impairment separately. 
The entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for im pairment only if there is objective evidence of impairment. A 
recognised impairment loss may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful lives. For intangible asse ts that are recognised as part of business combinations, the G roup 
makes an assessment of the fair value of th e identified intangible assets acquired in the business combination. Intangible asse ts 
other than those arising as part of business combinations are recognised as long as it is probable that the expected future eco nomic 
benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Gr oup and its cost can be measured reliably. The Group holds no in tangible 
assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill. The carr ying value of intangible assets with finite useful lives is re viewed at 
every reporting date for evidence of impairment with the valu e being written down if any impairment exists. If conditions 
subsequently improve, the previously recognised impairment may be reversed and credited through the income statement.  
The economic lives and amortisation methods of acquired intangible assets, other than software, are as follows:  
Customer relationships 5 to 6 years, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits 
Brands 8 to 10 years, on a straight-line basis

Software 
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset, with the carrying value being reviewed at every reporting date for evidence 
of impairment and the value being written down if any impairment exists. If conditions subsequently improve, the previously 
recognised impairment may be reversed. 
Amortisation of software begins when it is available for use, i. e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of purchased software is amortised on a straight-line basis over th e 
expected useful life of the intangible asset. This has been set between two and seven years. 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Costs associated with the 
development of software for internal use are capitalised only if the software is technically feasible for sale or use on comple tion and 
the Group has both the intent and sufficient resources to complete the development. Su bsequent expenditure is capitalised only if 
the cost of the asset can be reliably measured, will generate futu re economic benefits and there is an ability to use or sell t he asset.  
The cost of internally generated software is amortised over the expected useful life of the intangible asset on a straight-line basis. 
The expected useful life is between three and five years. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment comprises land and buildings occupied by the Group and fixtures, fittings and equipment (including 
computer hardware). Land and buildings are stated at their reva lued amount, which is the fair value, less subsequent depreciation 
for buildings. All other assets are stated at cost less deprecia tion and accumulated impairment. Replacement or major inspectio n 
costs are capitalised when incurred if it is possible that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the e ntity and 
the costs can be measured reliably.  
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i. e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the c ost 
less residual values of the assets over their economic lives, wi th the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated. The 
economic lives are as follows: 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment between 3 and 8 years 
Freehold buildings 100 years 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of deprecia tion are reviewed and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognit ion of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year in which the asset is derecognis ed. 
Impairment and revaluation of property, plant and equipment 
Carrying values are reviewed at each reporting date to determin e whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such 
indications exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value. The recoverable amount is th e 
higher of the fair value of the asset, le ss costs to sell and the asset’s value in us e. Impairment losses are recognised through the 
income statement. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve and credited through the income statement. 
Revaluations of land and buildings are und ertaken annually, with more frequent revaluations occurring where an assessment is 
made that the carrying amount may differ materially from its fa ir value. Where a revaluation occurs, any accumulated depreciati on 
at the time of the revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset. 
Increases in the carrying amount arising on the revaluation of Gr oup occupied property are credited to revaluation reserves in other 
comprehensive income, unless they offset previous decreases of the same asset that have been charged to the income statement, 
in which case the increase is also charged to the income statem ent. Similarly, decreases that offset previous increases of the same 
asset that have been credited to a revaluation surplus are record ed directly in other comprehensive income as a reduction in th e 
revaluation surplus; other decreases are charged to the income statement.  
Financial assets  
Classification  
Financial assets falling within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are designated as  
“at fair value through profit or loss”, “loans and receivables”, “available-for-sale” or “held for trading”. The Group determin es  
the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The Group does not classify any financial assets as held to maturity  
financial assets. 
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, other debtors and quoted and unquoted financial investments 
including derivatives. Insurance receivables are also presented as financial assets.

Taxation 
Current tax 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities . The 
tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enac ted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Current tax 
assets and liabilities also include adjustments in respect of tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods.  
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income and not in the income statement. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full using th e balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation purposes. It is calculated at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is recovered, using tax rates ena cted or 
substantially enacted by the reporting date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the income stat ement is also recognised outside the income statement, either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax asset s against 
current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Foreign currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Foreign 
currency differences are recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is recognised on business combinations and the acquisitio n of joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losse s. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is presented in intangible assets. For joint ventures, goodwill is not separately pre sented 
but is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Negative goodwill is recogn ised in the Group income statement at the date 
of acquisition. Positive goodwill is not amortised.  
Impairment of goodwill  
Goodwill arising on a business combination is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of the cash-generating unit (or units) to which the good will is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount. A recognised 
impairment loss is not reversed. 
Goodwill attributed to an investment in a joint venture accounted under the equity method is not tested for impairment separately. 
The entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for im pairment only if there is objective evidence of impairment. A 
recognised impairment loss may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful lives. For intangible asse ts that are recognised as part of business combinations, the G roup 
makes an assessment of the fair value of th e identified intangible assets acquired in the business combination. Intangible asse ts 
other than those arising as part of business combinations are recognised as long as it is probable that the expected future eco nomic 
benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Gr oup and its cost can be measured reliably. The Group holds no in tangible

every reporting date for evidence of impairment with the valu e being written down if any impairment exists. If conditions

Financial assets (continued) 
Initial recognition of financial assets  
The Group designates on initial recognition its financial assets held for investment purposes at fair value through the profit or  
loss (“FVTPL”) with the exception of derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, and certain unquoted financial inve stments 
whose performance is not evaluated on a fair value basis, which are classified as “available-for-sale” (“AFS”). All other finan cial 
assets are classified as loans and receivables. For those financia l investments designated at FVTPL, this is in accordance with the 
Group’s documented investment strategy and is consistent with investment risk being assessed on a portfolio basis. Information 
relating to these investments is provided internally to the Group’s Directors and key managers on a fair value basis.  
The Group’s financial assets are initially recognised at fair valu e, plus any directly attributable transaction costs, with the  
exception of financial assets at FVTPL for which directly attrib utable transaction costs are expensed as incurred. If the Group 
determines that the fair value of a financ ial asset on initial recognition differs from its transaction price, but the fair val ue 
measurement is not evidenced by a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then this difference is 
deferred and is subsequently recognised as in vestment income only to the extent that it arises from a change in factor (includi ng 
time) that a market participant would consider in setting a price. 
Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through profit or loss. Available-for-sale 
financial assets are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss (other than impairments) recognised through other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-sale re serve. When available-for-sale financial assets are derecognis ed, 
the gain or loss accumulated in the available-for-sale reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost less accumu lated impairment losses using the effective interest rate metho d. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash fl ows from the asset and reporting financial difficulty of the iss uer  
or counterparty. 
Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financia l assets held at amortised cost are impaired. Financial asset s 
are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset may lead to a 
reduction in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asse t. Impairment losses on financial assets classified as loans and 
receivables are calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Impairment losses and any reversals of impairments are recognised  
through the income statement 
Available-for-sale financial assets  
Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the availabl e-for-
sale reserve to profit or loss. The amount reclassified is th e difference between the value on initial recognition and the curr ent fair 
value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss. If the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale fi nancial 
asset subsequently increases, then the impairment loss is revers ed through profit or loss to the extent that it offsets impairm ent 
losses previously recognised; otherwise, it is reversed through the available-for sale reserve. 
Derecognition of financial assets  
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired or when the Group transfer s 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. 
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net am ount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position 
if, and only if, the Group has a currently enforceable legal righ t to offset the recognised amounts and it intends to settle on a net 
basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultan eously. Income and expenses are not offset in the income sta tement 
unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or interpretation.

Reinsurance 
The Group cedes insurance risk in the norm al course of business for the purpose of limiting its potential losses from accepting 
insurance risk. Reinsurance assets represent amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers in respect of claims incurred under 
the related insurance contracts and are estimated in a manner cons istent with the outstanding claims provision or settled claim s 
under the related insurance contracts.  
Reinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment arise s 
during the reporting period. Impairment occurs when there is obje ctive evidence as a result of an event that occurred after ini tial 
recognition of the reinsurance asset that the Group may not rece ive all outstanding amounts due under the terms of the contract 
and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts th at the Group will receive from the reinsurer. Any impairment lo ss 
is recorded in the income statement. 
Insurance receivables  
Insurance receivables are recognised when due and are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, insu rance receivables are measured at amortised cost less accumulated 
impairment losses, using the effective interest rate method. The carrying value of insurance receivables is reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amo unt may not be recoverable, with the impairment loss recorded in 
the income statement. 
Insurance receivables are derecognised when the derecognition criteria for financial asset, as described in the financial asset 
accounting policy, have been met. 
Deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) 
Acquisition costs comprise all commission and other direct and in direct acquisition costs arising from the conclusion of insura nce 
contracts. Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that corresponds to the unearned 
premiums provision at the reporting date, and are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable out of future premiums. 
All other acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, DAC assets are amortised over the period in which the related revenues are earned.  
DAC assets are derecognised when the obligations under the re lated insurance contracts are either transferred or settled. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and othe r short-term deposits with  
original maturities of three months or less that are held to meet short-term cash commitments rather than for investment  
or other purposes. 
Insurance contract liabilities  
Provision for unearned premiums  
The provision for unearned premiums represents that portion of prem iums received or receivable that relates to risks that have  
not yet expired at the reporting date. The provision is recognised when the contracts are entered into and premiums are charged , 
and is brought to account as premium income over the term of th e contract in accordance with the pattern of insurance service 
provided under the contract. 
Liability adequacy test 
At each reporting date the Group reviews its unexpired risk an d performs a liability adequacy test to determine whether the 
estimated cost of future claims and deferred acquisition costs exceeds the provision for unearned premiums. This calculation us es 
current estimates of future contractual cash flows after taking a ccount of the investment return expected to arise on assets re lating 
to the relevant technical provision. If these estimates show th at the carrying amount of the unearned premium is inadequate, th e 
deficiency is recognised in the income statement by setting up a provision for unexpired risk. 
Outstanding claims provision 
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for th e estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not settle d at  
the balance sheet date including related claims handling expenses , whether reported or not. Anticipated reinsurance recoveries  
and salvage and subrogation recoveries are disclosed separately as assets. 
Insurance payables 
Insurance payables are recognised when due and measured initially at the fair va lue of the consideration received. Subsequent  
to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Insurance broking debtors and creditors 
The Group recognises on its balance sheet amo unts due to insurers from clients, and mone y held on behalf of insurers in relatio n  
to the insurance transactions that the Compan y handles on behalf of those parties. The cash at bank balances presented in these 
financial statements represent the aggregation of the money held for the benefit of the Company, clients and insurers.

Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities falling within the scope of IAS 39 are classi fied as “derivatives held for trading”, or “other financial liabilities”.  
The Group determines the classification of it s financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
The Group’s “other financial liabilities” include other payables and borrowings. Insurance payables are also presented as other 
financial liabilities. 
Initial recognition  
All financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value less, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable  
transaction costs. 
Subsequent measurement  
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subseque ntly measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised.  
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an integral part of effective interest rate, tra nsaction 
costs and all other premiums and discounts. The amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an exis ting 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing l iability  
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the re cognition 
of a new liability, and the difference in the respective ca rrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. 
Derivatives 
Derivatives are measured at fair value both initially and subseq uent to initial recognition. All changes in fair value are reco gnised  
in the income statement. Derivatives are presented as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair  
values are negative.  
Hedge accounting 
The Group does not currently designate an y derivatives as hedging instruments. 
Share capital 
Shares are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other assets to holders of the  
financial instruments. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it i s 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable est imate 
can be made of the amount of the obligatio n. Where the Group expects some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision 
to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The 
expense relating to a provision is presented in the income statem ent net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre- tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Employee benefits – pensions 
The Group contributes to a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The contributions payable to this scheme are charged  
to the income statement in the accounting period to which they relate. 
Leases  
Group as a lessor  
Leases where the Group does not transfer su bstantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as o perating 
leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operatin g lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset an d 
recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental inco me. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned (i.e. when virtually certain). 
Group as a lessee – operating leases 
Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are 
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-lin e 
basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

esure Group Annual Report 2014 
2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the grant date at the fair value of the equity instruments 
(excluding the effect of non-market vesting conditions but includ ing the effect of market vesting conditions). Fair value is no t 
subsequently remeasured.  
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, based on the best estimate of the number of awards which will ultimately vest unconditionally 
with employees. The estimate of the number of awards expected to vest (excluding the effect of market vesting conditions) is 
revised at each reporting date, with any consequential changes to the charge recognised in the income statement. 
Where equity-settled share-based payments are modified, any incremental fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over  
the revised vesting period. 
3 Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors th at are believed to be reasonable under th e 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making ju dgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that ar e not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates, however, the consolidated financial statements 
presented are based on conditions that existed at the balance sheet date. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affe cts only that period, or in the period of the revision and futu re periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical ju dgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies  
Insurance contract liabilities  
Estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the expected 
ultimate cost of claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) at th e reporting date. It can take a significant period of time befo re 
ultimate claims cost can be established wi th certainty and for some types of claims, IBNR claims account for the majority of th e 
liability in the statement of financial position. 
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by carrying out standard actuarial projections in line with the Institute and 
Faculty of Actuaries Technical Actuarial Standards. These techni ques use past claims information and development patterns of  
these claims to project the expected future claims cost both for notified and non-notified claims.  
Similar judgements, estimates and assumptions are employed in th e assessment of adequacy of provisions for unearned premium 
and hence whether there is a requirement for an unexpired risk provision. 
Please refer to note 19 for additional details.

Initial recognition  
All financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value less, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable  
transaction costs. 
Subsequent measurement  
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subseque ntly measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised.  
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an integral part of effective interest rate, tra nsaction 
costs and all other premiums and discounts. The amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an exis ting 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing l iability  
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the re cognition 
of a new liability, and the difference in the respective ca rrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. 
Derivatives 
Derivatives are measured at fair value both initially and subseq uent to initial recognition. All changes in fair value are reco gnised  
in the income statement. Derivatives are presented as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair  
values are negative.  
Hedge accounting 
The Group does not currently designate an y derivatives as hedging instruments. 
Share capital 
Shares are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other assets to holders of the  
financial instruments. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it i s 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable est imate 
can be made of the amount of the obligatio n. Where the Group expects some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision 
to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The 
expense relating to a provision is presented in the income statem ent net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre- tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Employee benefits – pensions 
The Group contributes to a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The contributions payable to this scheme are charged  
to the income statement in the accounting period to which they relate. 
Leases  
Group as a lessor  
Leases where the Group does not transfer su bstantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as o perating 
leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operatin g lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset an d 
recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental inco me. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned (i.e. when virtually certain). 
Group as a lessee – operating leases 
Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are 
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-lin e 
basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Factors affecting the tax charge for future periods 
The Corporation Tax rate will be reduced to 20% from 1 April 2015 . As the change has been substantively enacted as at the balan ce 
sheet date, the change is reflected in the deferred tax liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial positio n as at  
31 December 2014. 
14 Dividends 
A 2014 interim dividend per share of 5.1p (£21.3m) was declared by the Board of Directors on 1 August 2014 (2013: interim 
dividend per share of 2.5p, £10.4m). Subsequent to the year end, a 2014 final dividend per share of 11.7p (£48.8m) was declared 
by the Board of Directors (2013: final di vidend per share of 13.3p, £55.4m).  
15 Earnings per Share 
Basic 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the owners of the Group and the weighted average  
of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, excl uding Ordinary Shares held as employee trust shares. 
Diluted 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted avera ge  
of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period adjusted for any dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. Share issues during the year are 
set out in note 25. 
The difference between the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, being 607,206 
(2013: 135,848), relates to the dilutive potential of the share-based payment arrangements. Details of share awards are set out  
in note 26.  
Year ended 31 December 2013 
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group undertook a number of capital transactions, in anticipation of Admission  
to trading on the London Stock Exchange.  
On 21 February 2013, the share capital of the Group was reduced by the cancellation of 4,000,000,000 Non-Voting Old Ordinary

On 25 February 2013, each A, B and C Ordinary Share was subdi vided into 12 shares of the same class. Immediately prior  
to Admission, these 399,600,000 shares of 1/12 pence were converted into a single class of Ordinary Share.  
On Admission the Group repurchased from Tosca Penta Investments LP the remaining 4, 485,014,000 Non-Voting Ordinary Shares 
of £0.01 each at par (amounting, in total, to £44.9m) and the 1,000 Redeemable Priority Return Shares of £0.01 each.

Included in fixtures and fittings as at 31 December 2014 is £12. 5m relating to computer hardware assets that are not yet availa ble 
for use in the manner intended by management (31 December 2013: £nil). As a result, no depreciation has been charged on these 
assets during the year. Work on bringing these assets into a co ndition necessary for their intended use is expected to be completed 
by December 2015, after which the assets are expected to have a useful economic life of five years. 
Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers annually, all with re cent 
relevant experience. These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Valuation Standards in the 
UK (“Red Book”). More frequent revaluations are performed by mana gement to assess that the carrying amount does not materially 
differ from its fair value. 
This assessment, on the basis of existing use value and in accord ance with UK Valuation Standard 1.3, is the estimated amount for 
which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length 
transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prud ently and without compulsion, assuming that 
the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the prop erty required by the business and disregarding potential alterna tive 
uses and any other characteristics of the property that would cause its market valu e to differ from that needed to replace the 
remaining service potential at least cost. The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance f rom 
the International Valuation Standards Committee and the re quirements of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment. 
Independent valuations were performed as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013. If land and buildings were not stated at 
their revalued amounts, and were instead held under the cost model, land and buildings would have a carrying value at 31 
December 2014 of £12.0m (31 December 2013: £12.1m).

Subordinated Notes 
£125m 10 year Subordinated Notes were issued by esure Group plc on 19 December 2014 at the rate of 6.75% per annum,  
with payments made biannually. Directly attributable fees were £2.9m. The carrying amount of the 10 year Subordinated Notes 
approximates their fair value.  
The nominal £125m Subordinated Notes have a maturity date of 19 December 2024. The Notes are direct, unsecured and 
subordinated obligations of the Group, ranking pari passu and without preference amongst themselves, and will, in the event of  
the winding-up of the Group or in the even t of an administrator of the Group being ap pointed and giving notice that it intends to 
declare and distribute a dividend, be subordinated to the claims of all se nior creditors and policy holders of the Group. 
Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes 
On 11 February 2010, esure Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, created and issued 50,000,000 unsecured 
perpetual subordinated loan notes of £1 each (the “Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes”). The interest rate was 18.9% per annum, 
paid annually. 
The Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes were listed on the Channel Islands’ Stock Exchange. 
On 28 March 2013 the Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes were repaid by the Group following Admission of esure Group plc to the 
London Stock Exchange. 
18.3 Financial risk management objectives 
The Group is exposed to a range of financial risks through its financial assets, financial liabilities, reinsurance assets and policyholder 
liabilities. In particular, the key financial risk is that the pr oceeds from financial assets are not sufficient to fund the ob ligations 
arising from insurance policies as they fall due. The most import ant components of this financial risk are market risk (includi ng 
interest rate risk, equity price risk and currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.  
(a) Market risk 
These risks arise from open positions in in terest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and s pecific 
market movements. The market risks that the Group primarily faces due to the nature of its investments and liabilities are inte rest 
rate risk and equity price risk.  
The Group manages market risk by virtue of its risk management framework, incorporating the Group’s Risk Appetite and setting  
an appropriate investment strategy. 
The majority of investments held are listed and traded on the UK and other recognised stock exchanges. The Group has a defined 
investment strategy and market risk policy which sets limits on the Group’s exposure by setting, where applicable, duration, is suer 
and concentration limits for each asset class.  
The Group’s Board appoints members to the Group’s Investment Committee who are responsible for recommending future 
investment strategy, guidelines and policies, in line with the Board approved Risk Appetite, for the Board’s approval. Ultimate ly, the 
Board is responsible for setting the investment strategy, defining the risk appetite and appointing investment managers. The da y-
to-day management of investments is delegated to the investme nt fund managers and monitored by the Investment Committee.  
Investment Committee meetings, chaired by a Non-Executive Director, are held at least quarterly. At these meetings, Non-Executi ve 
Directors, Executive Directors and senior managers meet to discuss investment performance, composition and strategy across the 
Group’s portfolio. More frequent meetings are held by the Exec utive Directors and senior managers to monitor investment 
performance, and to determine whether an Investment Committee should be called outside the normal cycle of meetings. 
(i) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises primarily from investments in fixed interest securities. The Investment Committee balances the portfolio  
of investments to manage the exposure to interest rate risk. In addition to the extent that claims inflation is correlated to i nterest 
rates, liabilities to policyholders are exposed to interest rate risk. 
The Group monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis by ca lculating the mean duration of key elements of the investment 
portfolio and of the liabilities to policyholders under insurance co ntracts. The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivi ty of the 
assets and liabilities to changes in current interest rates. The mean duration of the technical liabilities is determined by means of 
projecting expected cash flows using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. Asset allocation decisions made by the 
Investment Committee give due consideration to the duration and profile of liabilities to avoid any significant mismatch in the asset 
and liability profiles. In order to preserve capital and to reduce the risk of an investment loss due to interest rate movement s, it is 
acceptable for the duration of the asset portfolio to be shorte r but not longer than the average duration of the liabilities. T he Group’s 
investment managers also have the ability to use Government bond futures as a mechanism to ensure portfolio duration remains 
within strict limits.

Derivative financial instruments, at fair value through profit or loss 
To eliminate as far as possible the effect of exchange rate fluc tuations on the value of investments denominated in currencies other 
than Sterling, the Group has purchased over-t he-counter forward currency contracts. The Group also uses government bond futures 
as a mechanism to adjust investment portfolio duration. The Grou p’s exposure to currency risk is set out in note 18.3a (iii).

18.3 Financial risk management objectives (continued) 
The sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk illustrates how ch anges in the fair value or futu re cash flows of the financial investments 
bearing interest rate risk will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates at the reporting date. For an increase of 100 
basis points in interest yields the profit before tax for the pe riod would decrease by £5.5m (2013: £7.7m). For a decrease of 2 5 
basis points in interest yields the profit before tax for the period would increase by £1.4m (2013: £1.9m). 
(ii) Equity price risk 
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of its holdings in investments with prices quoted on a stock e xchange 
and classified as financial assets at FVTPL. Exposures to individual companies and to equity shares in aggregate are monitored in 
order to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory limits for solvency purposes. 
If equity market indices had increased/decreased by 10%, the pr ofit before tax for the year would increase/decrease by £4.0m 
(2013: £2.7m). 
(iii) Currency risk 
The Group has exposure to currency risk in respect of certain investments denominated in currencies other than Sterling. At the 
reporting date the most significant currencies to which the Grou p is exposed are Euros and US Dollars (USD). The Group seeks to 
mitigate currency risk by the use of forward contracts and other derivatives, with a maturity of less than three months from the 
reporting date, matching the estimated foreign currency denomina ted assets with liabilities denominated in the same currency. 
Strict agreements are in place with investment managers to ensure all non-Sterling debt securities and other fixed income securities 
are hedged to between 99.5% and 100.5% of the carrying value. 
One investment manager, who holds shares and other variable yiel d securities, is not required to hedge out all currency risk. T he 
maximum permitted value of shares and other variable yield secu rities which may have unhedged currency risk exposure, per the 
investment manager’s mandate, is £11.2m (2012: £8.7m). At the reporting date the Group has direct exposure to both USD and 
Swiss francs (CHF) through shares with a value of £2.3m. If the Sterling rates with either of these foreign currencies had 
strengthened/weakened by 10%, the profit before tax for the year would increase/decrease by £0.2m (2013: £0.0m). 
(b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to pay amounts in full when due in accordance with the term of the 
contract, causing the Group to incur a financial loss. 
Key areas where the Group is exposed to credit risk are: 
 Credit instruments held within the investment portfolio 
 Other amounts due from investment counterparties 
 Reinsurers’ share of insurance contract liabilities 
 Amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid 
 Amounts due from policyholders  
 Subrogation and salvage recoveries  
 Amounts due from claims suppliers 
Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the Group’s liability as primary insurer. If a 
reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the Group remains liable for the payment to the policyholder. 
The creditworthiness of reinsurers is considered on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to finalisation of any 
contract. In addition, management assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers by reviewing credit grades provided by rating 
agencies and other publicly available financial information. An analysis of the credit grade of the Group’s 10 largest exposures to 
reinsurers by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and A.M. Best ratings is produced and reviewed on a monthly basis. The minimum credit 
rating that the Group requires for participation in its reinsuranc e programmes is Standard & Poor’s A- or the A.M. Best equival ent.  
The Group manages the levels of investment counterparty credit ri sk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single 
counterparty, or groups of counterparties, and on geographical counterparties and geographical segments. Such risks are subject  
to regular review by the Investment Committee.

Investments bearing credit risk, and cash an d cash equivalents, are summarised below, together with an analysis by credit ratin g

AA 143.7 164.2 
A 186.7 177.9 
BBB 54.5 62.6 
Below BBB or not rated 59.3 51.5 
Investments bearing credit risk and cash and cash equivalents  794.3 741.5 
Shares and other variable yield securities and units in unit trus ts do not bear credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are “A” rated.  
The analysis by credit rating illustrates an improvement in cred it quality over the period under review, with a higher proporti on  
of assets rated “AAA” in 2014 compared to 2013. This is due to the net proceeds from the Gr oup’s issuance of £125.0m of 
Subordinated Notes being entirely invested in a “AAA” rated liquidity fund. 
Insurance receivables due from policyholders and other debtors are not subject to credit rating and are not included in the tab le 
above. Owing to the high number of indivi dual policyholders through which the Group has minimal individual exposure, the overall 
risk of default to the Group is considered to be insignificant. The Group regularly reviews the ageing and individual characteristics of 
the counterparties of insurance receivables and other debtors to manage credit risk and to ensure that impairments are made whe re 
necessary. No credit limits were exceeded during the year, and no significant financial assets are past due but not impaired at the 
reporting date.  
(c) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, ei ther does not have available sufficient financial resources to e nable it  
to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost. The primary liquidity risk of the Group is the 
obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. Liquidity risk is minimal due to the liquid nature of the Group’s i nvestments 
and the nature of the business, which is such that material lia bilities are driven by claims costs, which have a significant le ad time 
from notification to payment. 
In order to mitigate liquidity risk, the maturity of the techni cal liabilities is determined by means of projecting expected ca sh flows 
using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. Asset allocation decisions made by the Investment Committee give due 
consideration to the maturity and profile of liabilities to ensure that the maturity of assets is equal to or shorter than the maturity  
of liabilities.

 To match the profile of its assets and liabilities, ta king account of the risks inherent in the business 
 To satisfy the requirements of its policyholders and regulators 
 To maintain financial strength to support business growth 
 To retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets 
The Group manages as capital all items that are eligible to be treated as capital for regulatory purposes. This includes equity ,  
allowing for regulatory adjustments, Subordinated Notes and a ma rk to model based valuation of the Group’s interest in Gocompare.

The Group’s Subordinated Notes meet the crit eria of a lower tier two capital instrument. Only £20.2m of the Subordinated Notes 
qualified as capital under the IGD as the amount of qualifying lo wer tier two debt is restricted to a maximum of 25% of the les ser  
of either the Group’s available solvency margin or required solvency capital. 
Economic capital 
In addition to Group capital requirements established under the IGD, the solo insurance company, esure Insurance Limited, is al so 
subject to Individual Capital Guidance (“ICG”) set by the Prudenti al Regulation Authority (“PRA”). The guidance is set by the P RA on 
a periodic basis following the submission of a risk-based Indivi dual Capital Assessment (“ICA”). The ICA, and thus ICG, are typically 
greater than the IGD and it is these that the Group use to determine its economic capital requirements.  
(e) Fair value estimation 
In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement financial instruments reported at fair value and revalued properties have been 
categorised into a fair value measurement hierarchy as follows: 
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities – (Level 1) 
Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. An active market is a mark et in 
which transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or 
indirectly (derived from prices) – (Level 2). 
Fair value measurements that are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, if all significant inputs re quired 
to fair value an instrument are observable, would result in the instrument being included in Level 2. The majority of assets cl assified 
as Level 2 are over-the-counter corporate bonds, where trades are less frequent owing to the nature of the assets. Inputs used in 
pricing the Group’s level 2 assets include: 
 Quoted prices for similar (i.e. not identical) assets in active markets 
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are no t current, or price quotations vary 
among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly 
 Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation 
 For forward foreign exchange contracts, the use of observable forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the 
resulting value discounted back to present value 
The Group’s policy, should there be a change to the valuation techniques or level of activity in the market in which that asset is 
traded, is to transfer the asset between levels effective from the beginning of the reporting period. As a result of the applic ation of 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, from 1 January 2013, the Group revisited the fair value hierarchy and now classifies all corporate 
bonds as Level 2 assets with the exception of Government backed securities which are classified as Level 1 unless they are illi quid. 
As a result of the change, £14.0m was transferred from Le vel 1 to Level 2 in the year ended 31 December 2013.   103

£7.5m of debt securities have been transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 in the year ended 31 December 2014. £2.5m of the assets 
have been transferred as a result of regular pricing data being sourced and evidenced during the year from quoted prices in active 
markets where there is now sufficient frequency and volume of trades to recognise these assets at Level 1 and £5.0m has been 
transferred as a result of the reclassification of a financial a sset that is Government backed (2013: £3.0m of debt securities 
transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 in the year as a result of insufficient trade frequency). 
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) – (Level 3) 
Unobservable inputs have been used to measure fair value to th e extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing 
for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date (or market information f or the 
inputs to any valuation models). As such, unobservable inputs reflect assumptions about the inputs that market participants wou ld 
use in pricing the asset. 
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observab le market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. The Gro up 
held Level 3 AFS financial assets of £0.3m as at 31 December 20 14, representing an investment in an unquoted equity investment 
which has been valued using a discounted cash flow valuation model. There were no Level 3 assets, other than land and buildings , 
as at 31 December 2013.  
Under IFRS 13, land and buildings with a carrying value of £11.6m (2013: £11.6m) are classified as Level 3 assets. Owner-occupi ed 
properties are stated at their revalued am ounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers annually, all with recent relevant 
experience. These values are assessed in accordance with the rele vant parts of the current RICS Valuation Standards in the UK 
(“Red Book”). The valuer’s opinion of fair value was primarily de rived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’s len gth 
terms. No sensitivity analysis has been perf ormed due to the nature of the valuation.

qualified as capital under the IGD as the amount of qualifying lo wer tier two debt is restricted to a maximum of 25% of the les ser  
of either the Group’s available solvency margin or required solvency capital. 
Economic capital 
In addition to Group capital requirements established under the IGD, the solo insurance company, esure Insurance Limited, is al so 
subject to Individual Capital Guidance (“ICG”) set by the Prudenti al Regulation Authority (“PRA”). The guidance is set by the P RA on 
a periodic basis following the submission of a risk-based Indivi dual Capital Assessment (“ICA”). The ICA, and thus ICG, are typically 
greater than the IGD and it is these that the Group use to determine its economic capital requirements.  
(e) Fair value estimation 
In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement financial instruments reported at fair value and revalued properties have been 
categorised into a fair value measurement hierarchy as follows: 
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities – (Level 1) 
Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. An active market is a mark et in 
which transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or 
indirectly (derived from prices) – (Level 2). 
Fair value measurements that are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, if all significant inputs re quired 
to fair value an instrument are observable, would result in the instrument being included in Level 2. The majority of assets cl assified 
as Level 2 are over-the-counter corporate bonds, where trades are less frequent owing to the nature of the assets. Inputs used in 
pricing the Group’s level 2 assets include: 
 Quoted prices for similar (i.e. not identical) assets in active markets 
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are no t current, or price quotations vary 
among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly 
 Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation 
 For forward foreign exchange contracts, the use of observable forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the 
resulting value discounted back to present value 
The Group’s policy, should there be a change to the valuation techniques or level of activity in the market in which that asset is 
traded, is to transfer the asset between levels effective from the beginning of the reporting period. As a result of the applic ation of 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, from 1 January 2013, the Group revisited the fair value hierarchy and now classifies all corporate 
bonds as Level 2 assets with the exception of Government backed securities which are classified as Level 1 unless they are illi quid. 
As a result of the change, £14.0m was transferred from Le vel 1 to Level 2 in the year ended 31 December 2013.

19 Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities 
19.1 Insurance risk 
Insurance risk arises from the inherent uncertainties as to th e occurrence, amount and timing of insured events. These would 
include significant weather related events and personal injury claims. The Board is responsible for setting the overall underwriting 
strategy and defining the Risk Appetite, with monitoring delegated to the Pricing Committee. The Group uses excess of loss 
reinsurance contracts to mitigate insurance risk, essentially by reducing exposure to large individual claims or aggregated los ses 
from single events.  
Underwriting and pricing risk 
The Group underwrites general insurance business for private cars and homes in mainland Britain and the associated additional 
insurance products. The book consists of a large number of individual policies spread across the whole geographic area which he lps 
to minimise concentration risk especially in terms of weather-related risks. As well as pricing, the Group has additional contr ols in 
place to segment the market and target those segments it wishes to underwrite. Further systems and controls are in place to 
mitigate application fraud risk. 
The Group has systems and management in formation in place to continually monitor underwriting performance and pricing 
adequacy through the Pricing Committee.  
Claims management risk 
The Group employs a variety of strategies to ensure the correct claims are paid in a timely ma nner and reserve provisions made  
on a case by case basis to reflect the Group’s future liabilities. 
These include: 
 Well resourced and expertly trained staff benefit from image and workflow technology to control paper flow and procedures  
to enhance efficiency and effectiveness 
 The Group manages its own network of motor repairers and dedicate d teams offer an extensive range of services directly to  
‘not at fault’ third parties to efficiently control credit hire cost and legal fees  
 Comprehensive anti-fraud strategies are in place to chec k both fraudulent claims and new business applications 
 All claims teams operating from the UK and more specialised teams handle large liability and property damage claims in a 
dedicated technical unit 
Reinsurance 
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer mechanism to mitigate risks that are outside the Group’s appetite for indivi dual 
claim or event exposure and to reduce the volatility caused by large individual and accumulation losses. By doing so, the Group 
protects its capital and the underwriting result of each line of business. 
Currently, the Group has in place non-prop ortional excess of loss reinsurance programmes for its motor and home underwriting 
activities. The purpose of these programmes is to provide cover for both individual large losses, for Motor and Home, and 
accumulation losses arising from natural and other catastrophe events for Home. Motor reinsurance treaties are in place coverin g all 
years in which the Group has underwritten Motor policies. In 20 14, the Group renewed its Motor reinsurance programme with a 
deductible of £1.0m (in 2013 the deductible was £0.5m).  
The Group’s reinsurance programmes are reviewed on an annual basis and capital modelling is used to identify the most appropriate 
structure and risk retention profile, taking into account the Gr oup’s business objective of minimising volatility and the preva iling cost 
and availability of reinsurance in the market. 
Counterparty credit risk is a key consideration when the Group enters into reinsurance treaties. See note 18.3 (b) for more detail.  
Reserving risk 
Reserving risk is defined as the uncertainty regarding either th e current level of reserves or the payment distribution over th eir 
lifetime. The Group analyses and projects hi storical claims development data and uses a number of actuarial techniques to both test 
and forecast claims provisions. In addition, the Group also provides data to external actuaries who assess the adequacy of the 
Group’s claims provisions. 
Apart from historical analyses the Group also takes into account changes in risk profile and underwriting policy conditions, changes 
in legislation or regulation and changes in other external factors. 
The ultimate costs and expenses of the clai ms for which these reserves are held are subject to a number of material uncertainti es. 
As time passes between the reporting of a claim and the final se ttlement of the claim, circumstances can change that may requir e 
established reserves to be adjusted either upwards or downwards. Factors such as changes in the legal environment, results of 
litigation, propensity of personal injury claims, changes in me dical and care costs, and costs of vehicle and home repairs can all 
substantially impact overall costs and expenses of claims, and cause a material divergence from the bases and assumptions on 
which the reserves were calculated.    105 
 
 
esure Group Annual Report 2014 
19 Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities (continued) 
19.1 Insurance risk (continued) 
Claims subject to periodic payment orders (PPOs) are an area of uncertainty relating to the claims provision at 31 December 201 4. 
For known PPOs and claims which have been identified as potential PPO awards, indexed cash flow projections are carried out in 
order to estimate an ultimate cost on a gross and net of re insurance basis. The cash flow projections are undertaken on a 
discounted basis. The total net claims provision recognised for PPOs and potential PPOs in the consolidated statement of financ ial 
position represents less than 5% of net claims outstanding at 31 December 2014. In the context of the Group’s approach to the 
mitigation and management of underwriting risk, its reinsurance programme (including its approach to mitigating counterparty 
credit risk) and the Group’s prudent approach to reserving for po tential PPOs, the risk of an adverse development of the Group’ s 
reserves for PPO claims is not considered to be significant.  
In addition, the Ministry of Justice has been reviewing the discount rate used in the calculation of damage awards in bodily in jury 
and fatal claims for some time. At the date these financial stat ements were approved the discount rate used in these calculations 
remained at 2.5% and individual case reserves have been established by applying this discount rate.  
In the context of the Group’s reinsurance pr ogramme and its approach to the mitigation of reinsurance counterparty credit risk,  
a reduction in the discount rate is unlikely to result in a mate rial deterioration of the Group’s financial performance. Were an 
adjustment to be made to total reserves to reflect an assumed reduction of one percentage point, the impact of this allowance 
would be increase the net claims provision recognised in the co nsolidated statement of financial position by less than £2.0m at  
31 December 2014. 
The Group’s policy is to hold sufficient provisions, including th ose to cover claims which have been incurred but not reported  
(‘IBNR’) to meet all liabilities as they fall due. Apart from that part of the provisions relating to PPOs, claims provisions a re not 
discounted. The Directors remain satisfied that the outstanding cl aims reserves included in these financial statements provide an 
appropriate margin over projected ultimate claims costs.

ten years, including a reconciliation to the claims liability repo rted in the consolidated statement of financial position. esu re Group 
plc acquired esure Holdings Limited on 11 February 2010. The es timated claims disclosed in the tables prior to the date of 
acquisition are those of esure Holdings Limited.  
Table (c) expresses the development of net incurred claims by refe rence to the loss ratio for each accident year over the past  
ten years.

23 Insurance and other payables (continued) 
Included within deferred income is £0.3m in Government grants (2013: £0.5m). This is recognised as income over the period 
necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Scottish Executive Grants have 
been received by the Group based on two factors: expenditure on fixed assets and the creation of new jobs. In order for the Gro up 
to avoid repayment of the grants received, the new jobs created in order to meet the grant conditions must remain in existence for 
a period of at least five years.

25 Share capital and other reserves (continued) 
On 25 February 2013, each A Ordinary Share, B Ordinary Share and C Ordinary Share was subdivided into 12 shares of the same 
class (each having a nominal value of 1/12 pence). Immediately prior to the Admission of esure Group plc to the London Stock 
Exchange, the resulting A Ordinary Shares, B Ordinary Shares and C Ordinary Shares, in total amounting to 399,600,000 shares of 
1/12 pence each, were converted into a sing le class of Ordinary Share in accordance with esure Group plc’s articles of association 
such that, following conversion, there were in aggregate 399,600,000 Ordinary Shares of 1/12 pence each.  
Pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated 25 February 2013, esure Group plc agreed on Admission to repurchase the 
remaining 4,485,014,000 Non-Voting Old Ordinary Shares of £0.01 each at par (amounting, in total, to £44.9m) and the 1,000 
Redeemable Priority Return Shares of £0.01 each for an amount equal to the Priority Return (as defined and determined in 
accordance with the Company’s previous articles of association) out of existing financial resources. The Non-Voting Old Ordinary 
Shares and Redeemable Priority Return Shares repurchased were then cancelled. A capital redemption reserve was created for the 
£44.9m share repurchase. The amount payable on Admission to Tosca Penta Investments LP in respect of the Priority Return was 
£0.6m. As a result of the contractual obligations to deliver cash to satisfy the Priority Return on Admission, the Priority Ret urn 
Shares were reclassified as a financial liability. The fair valu e at the date of the reclassification (being £0.6m) was debited directly  
to retained earnings. esure Group plc also issued 17,241,380 Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of 1/12 pence each on 27 Marc h 
2013 for £50.0m, with associated transaction costs of £6.0m debited directly to share premium. 
26 Share-based payments 
The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based compensati on plans. An award will not be granted under the executive 
plans if it would cause the number of shares allocated in the ten calendar year period following flotation to exceed 5% of the 
Ordinary Share capital in issue at that time. Similarly, an aw ard will not be granted under the employee plans if it would caus e the 
number of shares allocated in the ten calendar year period follow ing flotation to exceed 10% of the Ordinary Share capital in i ssue 
at that time. Holders of these awards (other than the three ye ar and five year SAYE schemes) will receive dividend equivalents in 
respect of the dividends that would have been paid between grant date and vesting date for Ordinary Shares which vest under the ir 
awards, calculated on a basis and paid in a manner to be dete rmined by the Remuneration Committee before the awards vest. 
Details of the share-based compensation plans and their financial effect are set out below. 
(a) Performance Share Plan 
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) is a di scretionary share plan for the Group’s Executive and senior management. Awards have 
been made under the PSP plan as follows: 
 
Year ended  
31 Dec 2014 
Year ended  
31 Dec 2013 
Darren Ogden 189,594 160,344 
Stuart Vann  338,926  286,637 
Senior management 1,211,351 263,101 
Under the scheme, the shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon continued employment by the Group and 
achieving predefined performance conditions associated with the Group’s earnings per share (‘EPS’) and total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’). Two-thirds of each award will be based on EPS perform ance and one-third on TSR performance (with the two measures 
applying independently to different parts of each award). 
EPS performance 
The EPS performance measure involves a comparison of the reported pro forma EPS figure for the year ended prior to the granting 
of the award, and the EPS figure reported in the Group’s audite d consolidated financial statements for the year ending three ye ars 
later (e.g. for the awards granted in the year ended 31 December 2014, a comparison of the pro forma EPS reported for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 and the EPS figure reported in the Grou p’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ending 
31 December 2016). For the portion of the 2014 Executive/Senior Management PSP awards subject to the EPS measure: 
(i) 0/25 per cent will vest if EPS for the year ending 31 Dece mber 2016 exceeds the EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 
(calculated on the basis described above) by 10 per cent; 
(ii) 25/50 per cent will vest if EPS for the year ending 31 Dece mber 2016 exceeds the EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 
(calculated on the basis described above) by 15 per cent;  
(iii) 100 per cent will vest if EPS for the year ending 31 Decemb er 2016 exceeds the EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 
(calculated on the basis described above) by 39 per cent; and 
(iv) if EPS for the year ending 2016 falls between targets, vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. 
Refer to the Group’s 2013 annual report for the perfor mance conditions associated with the 2013 awards.

TSR performance  
TSR performance is measured, in the case of the 2014 awards, by comparing the Group’s TSR for the three year period from  
31 December 2013 to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 25 0 Index (excluding investment trusts and the Company) over the 
same period. For the 2013 awards, the comparison is made from th e date of Admission to 31 December 2015. For the portion of the 
PSP awards subject to the TSR measure: 
(i) 25 per cent will vest if the Group achieves medi an TSR performance against this comparator group; 
(ii) 100 per cent will vest if the Group’s TSR performance is at the upper quartile or above; and 
(iii) if TSR performance is between the median and the u pper quartile, vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. 
In addition, the PSP awards are subject to an additional term, which will allow the Remuneration Committee to reduce the level  
of vesting of each award if it considers that the vesting level is not appropriate having regard to the growth in profitability over the 
performance period. The PSP awards will vest at the later of thr ee years’ service and satisfaction of the performance condition s  
(as determined by the Remuneration Committee). The following ta ble provides summarised information regarding all PSP awards:

Valuation of PSP awards 
As one-third of the awards are subject to a share-price related (TSR) performance condition, the fair value of the awards was 
estimated using a Stochastic (Monte-Carlo) model.  
The remaining two-thirds of the awards are not subject to a sh are-price related performance condition (EPS) and the fair value  
of the awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. 
The inputs into the models were: 
 2014 PSP awards 2013 PSP awards 
Share price at grant £2.53 £2.96 
Exercise price nil nil 
Volatility % p.a. 21.0% 23.0% 
Dividend yield % p.a. nil nil 
Risk-free rate % 1.05% 0.27% 
Expected life  3 years 3 years 
The inputs were adjusted as appropriate for those awards granted to employees later up on joining the Group. The total estimated 
fair value of the 2014 PSP options at the date s of grant was £1.6m (2013 PSP awards: £1.8m). 
2014 senior management awards in addition to the PSP 
In addition to the PSP awards disclosed above, a new senior management hire was granted 171,621 shares without performance 
conditions with an estimated fair value of £2.22 at the date of grant. 46% of these awards will vest on 29 May 2015, 37% will vest 
on 31 May 2016 and the remainder will vest on 31 May 2017 dependent upon continued employment by the Group. The

Shareholder security
Shareholders may receive unsolicited and suspicious phone calls from “brokers” offering to buy their shares at a price far in excess 
of their market value. We believe this may be a scam, commonly referred to as a “boiler room”. The callers obtain your details 
from publicly available sources of information.
Shareholders are cautioned to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or to sell your shares at  
a premium. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

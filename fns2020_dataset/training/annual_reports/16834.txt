03 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Aleksey Kalinin
Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
2014 was a significant year for Volga Gas, in 
which the Group achieved its first full year of 
gas and condensate production with its wells 
producing up to their current capacity. The 
average production rate for 2014 was 4,244 
barrels of oil equivalent per day (“boepd”), a 
43% increase over the average 2,965 boepd 
achieved in 2013. With strong cash 
generation arising from this production, it 
was gratifying to see the financial position 
strengthen sufficiently for the Company to 
make its first interim dividend payment and 
still report a significant increase in net cash 
during the year.
The Group now faces a number of challenges, 
not the least of which is the general 
economic situation in Russia, where the 
dramatic fall in international oil prices is likely 
to have a significant impact on the domestic 
economy at least in the short term. While the 
weakness of the Russian Ruble, largely 
matching the drop in the oil price, is likely to 
enable the Group’s profitability to be 
maintained, our profits for future periods as 
reported in US Dollars may be significantly 
lower than in recent years. The declining 
Ruble has also led to a significant shrinking of 
the Group balance sheet as assets have been 
adjusted to the exchange rate prevailing on 
31 December 2014.
Since the year end production based taxes 
have increased significantly – especially as 
applied to condensate, which hitherto had 
been taxed at a rate comparable to gas, but is 
now taxed closer to the level applied to oil. 
While there is nothing that can be done by 
the Group to change the tax rates, 
management is considering ways to optimise 
the business. A key project that is currently 
under consideration is the installation of 
additional units at the Dobrinskoye gas plant 
to extract liquid petroleum gases (“LPG”). 
Initial studies suggest that this could be a 
rewarding investment for the Group and a 
significant enhancement to the value of the 
reserves. More details on this can be found in 
the Chief Executive’s report on page 6 and in 
the Operational Review on page 8.
Most importantly, Volga Gas benefits from 
low operating costs and, with its fields based 
close to market, is able to operate profitably 
even with significantly reduced oil and gas 
prices. The strong balance sheet, with no 
debt and a liquidity position of US$15.8 
million built up from retained cash flow, 
provides a solid foundation for the Group to 
continue the development of its fields and to 
maximise its production profile.
The Group holds significant proven reserves 
in its three principal fields. These fields form 
the basis of sustainable and growing 
production in the near term. Our fields are 
advantageously located and our costs are 
sufficiently low for us to achieve positive 
returns at current oil and gas prices. Most 
importantly, these assets provide a strong 
platform for the Group to grow in the future, 
both through successful exploration and by 
selective value accretive acquisitions.
The Board believes that Volga Gas has a 
strong asset base and the financial and 
operational capability to develop and extend 
these assets to provide long-term value 
growth for our shareholders.
In the light of the current financial conditions 
prevailing in Russia and given the Group’s 
requirement to fund the proposed LPG 
project, which as outlined by the Chief 
Executive on pages 6 and 7 is expected to 
enhance the profitability of the Group’s gas 
and condensate production, the Board has 
decided that it is in the best interests of the 
shareholders for a final dividend to be at a 
level which can be sustained and grown as 
the profits increase in the future. Accordingly, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of US$0.0125 per ordinary share bringing the 
total dividend for the year to US$0.05 per 
ordinary share.
You will be aware that in June 2014 the Board 
was exploring strategic options for the 
business, including seeking potential offerors 
for the Company by means of a “formal sale 
process” under which the Board of Volga Gas 
is able to have discussions with third parties 
interested in such a transaction on a 
confidential basis. Whilst there was some 
interest received, the subsequent 
developments in the external conditions led 
the Board to conclude that an acceptable 
proposal would not be received. The formal 
sale process was accordingly concluded in 
January 2015. The Board continues to seek to 
maximise the value of the Company for 
shareholders.

REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
05 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 As the Chairman has noted, 2014 was the first 
full year in which Volga Gas produced its gas 
and condensate wells at capacity with the gas 
plant operating fully to expectations and 
enabling the Group to record a 43% increase 
in production compared to 2013. This 
increased production combined with steady 
oil and gas prices – at least for the first ten 
months of 2014 – enabled the Group to enjoy 
strong cash flow and strengthen its financial 
position, while providing the flexibility to 
manage the effects of the subsequent 
downturn in international oil prices.
As detailed in the Operational Review on 
pages 8 and 9, the majority of the work on 
our producing assets base remained focused 
on our main field, Vostochny Makarovskoye 
(“VM”). On VM, the Group commenced the 
drilling of a new producing well, VM#3. 
Although, as detailed below, the well was not 
completed during 2014, we now expect it to 
be producing in mid-2015.
Crude oil production, on the other hand, 
continued to decline. Production from the 
Uzenskoye field was further reduced to 
prevent a rising water cut. In addition, 
production from the single well Sobolevskoye 
field ceased. While it is now a minor part of 
the Group’s business, Volga Gas had made 
very good returns from these assets and 
continues to benefit from the cash 
generation they provide.
In 2014 as in 2013, exploration activity was 
limited, although a number of significant 
exploration prospects in the Group’s 
Karpenskiy licence area have been identified 
for future exploration drilling.
2015 Objectives – VM Development and 
LPG Project
The Group’s key operational objectives in 
2015 are to complete the drilling of the VM#3 
and VM#4 wells on the VM field and to 
complete the Front End Engineering and 
Design work for an LPG extraction project. 
The aim is to increase production from the 
VM field so as to maximise the utilisation of 
the 1 million m
3
 per day (35 mmcf/d) 
processing capacity of the gas plant.
Based on initial studies, the LPG project could 
enable the Group to achieve a significant 
enhancement of the value of the gas plant 
output and the investment required for this 
could be recovered within three years from 
the increased income and improved 
profitability.
Finance
The Group maintained a strong level of cash 
generation from operating activities 
throughout 2014, enabling it to fund its 
capital expenditure for the year from 
operating cash flow and to make its maiden 
interim dividend payment of $0.0375 per 
ordinary share in October 2014, while 
increasing its cash balance from US$8.1 
million to US$15.8 million during the year.
Capital expenditure in 2014 was less than 
originally planned mainly because the 
operational difficulties experienced on 
drilling the VM#3 well led to a delay in the 
completion of that well and deferral of 
further drilling into 2015.
Although the planned field development 
expenditures in 2015 and beyond are 
expected to be funded from operating cash 
flow, the Group may consider a moderate 
level of borrowing to be appropriate to fund 
significant value accretive investments like 
the LPG project.
Current trading
As announced on 19 February 2015, during 
January and February 2015 disruption to the 
domestic oil market in Russia following the 
recently implemented tax changes had an 
impact on the ability of purchasers of 
condensate from Volga Gas to take delivery 
and subsequently led to the temporary 
suspension of production at the Company’s 
VM and Dobrinskoye gas fields. Consequently 
for this period actual production was 
significantly below the capacity of the fields. 
Since 16 February 2015, Group production 
has resumed at close to full production 
capacity of approximately 4,500 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day (“boepd”).
The major tax changes implemented at the 
start of 2015 included a significant reduction 
in the rate of export tax coupled with a rise in 
Mineral Extraction Taxes on oil and 
condensate. However the domestic market 
prices in Russia, which hitherto reflected full 
netback pricing, have not risen to match the 
drop in export taxes. Meanwhile MET charges 
are calculated with reference to export prices 
and this has led to the Group experiencing 
higher than anticipated MET charges relative 
to income since the start of 2015.

Outlook
It is our current expectation that the VM#3 
well will be completed during H1 2015. In 
addition, we have mobilised a second rig to 
drill a sidetrack to the VM#4 well, which was 
originally drilled in 2008 but was not 
productive. The sidetrack will be deviated 
towards the centre of the field where it is 
expected to intersect productive reservoir. 
Further drilling, notably the VM#5 well, is 
also anticipated for later in 2015. Assuming 
successful drilling of the new wells, 
management expects to increase production 
to above 5,000 boepd by the end of 2015.
Clearly with significantly lower oil prices and a 
sharply devalued Ruble, the revenues as 
reported in US Dollars would not reflect this 
progress. However, with its costs almost 
entirely in Rubles, the Group is expected to 
remain profitable and cash generative even 
without a significant recovery in oil prices and 
in spite of the increased rate of production 
taxes that have come into effect.
The total capital expenditure budgeted for 
2015 is approximately US$14 million. All of 
this expenditure is discretionary and can be 
deferred or cancelled if necessary. 
Management expects the 2015 capital 
expenditure to be funded entirely from 
existing cash resources and cash generated 
from operations.
We look forward to delivering a rising stream 
of production and further financial growth.

07 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 VM#1 well workover in operation
Operations overview
After the Group received formal approval of 
the upgrade works at the Dobrinskoye gas 
processing plant in November 2013, 
production of gas and condensate from the 
Group’s VM and Dobrinskoye fields increased 
to reflect their existing productive capacity, 
more than doubling the production rates 
achieved hitherto.
The overall level of production in 2014, at 
4,244 boepd, was 43% above the 2,958 
boepd achieved in 2013. This was driven by 
increased gas and condensate production 
from the VM and Dobrinskoye fields partly 
offset by declines in total oil production.
Average oil production was lower in 2014 than 
in 2013, averaging 689 bopd in 2014 compared 
to 826 bopd in 2013. The reasons for the 
decline in oil production are detailed below.
As a consequence of the significant increase 
in production in 2014, revenues and EBITDA 
levels in 2014 were well ahead of 2013, 
although with the rapidly increasing 
proportion of gas in the mix, the revenue 
growth was not quite as impressive as 
production growth. Full details are discussed 
in the Financial Review on page 10.
Gas processing plant
Since November 2013, the Dobrinskoye gas 
processing plant has been consistently 
operating at rates of over 500,000 cubic 
metres per day (17.7 million cubic feet per day 
(“mmcf/d”)) with the exception of periods of 
planned shut-down for maintenance. During 
2014 a number of minor additional modules, 
as required by the state construction agency, 
Gosstroi, were installed on the plant. During 
2014 the Group incurred approximately 
US$2.7 million (2013: US$ 3.6 million) of 
capital expenditure on the gas plant.
During 2014, the Group has also been 
investigating means of enhancing the gas 
processing by the use of alternative 
chemicals. Following successful trials 
conducted during the year modifications to 
the process are beginning to deliver savings 
on the cost of chemicals used in the process.
The Group has conducted a preliminary 
evaluation of the feasibility of additional 
processing to extract an LPG stream from the 
gas, primarily propane and butane. The initial 
studies suggest that there are significant 
benefits from this project, from the 
extraction of additional higher-value product, 
that are otherwise either flared or sent down 
the gas pipeline with the sales gas. In 
addition, consideration is being given to a 
modification of the sulphur extraction 
process that would significantly reduce the 
cost of chemicals. The initial economic 
modelling suggests that the capital 
investment on this project can be recovered 
within three years from the incremental 
revenue and cost savings.
In November 2014, the Group commissioned a 
front end engineering and design study which 
will form the basis of a final investment decision 
on this project by the Board during 201 5.
Gas/condensate production
The Dobrinskoye and VM fields are managed 
as a single business unit. Production from the 
fields is processed at the gas plant located next 
to the Dobrinskoye field, extracting the 
condensate and processing the gas to pipeline 
standards before input into Gazprom’s regional 
pipeline system via an inlet located at the 
plant. Prior to November 2013 the plant was 
permitted to operate at a capacity of 250,000 
cubic metres per day (8.8 mmcf/d), so the fields 
were not producing at their full capacity. Since 
November 2013, production increased to levels 
that more closely reflect the estimated current 
production capacity of the wells which is over 
500,000 cubic metres per day (17 .8 mmcf/d) of 
gas and 120 tonnes per day (1,050 barrels per 
day(“bpd”) of condensate.
During 2014, production derived from both 
fields averaged 15.5 mmcf/d of gas and 966 
bpd of condensate (2013: 8.7 mmcf/d of gas 
and 682 bpd of condensate). In total, there 
are three producing wells on VM and two 
producing wells on Dobrinskoye.
Gas continues to be sold to Trans Nafta under 
contract at a fixed Ruble contract gas sales 
price. With the devaluation of the Ruble 
during 2014, the US Dollar equivalent of the 
price declined during 2014. The average gas 
sales price for 2014 was the equivalent of 
US$2.15 per thousand cubic feet, net of VAT 
(2013: US$2.73). During 2014 the average 
condensate sales price was US$45.07 per 
barrel (2013: US$47.00 per barrel).

08 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Condensate storage tanks.
Average unit production costs on the 
gas-condensate fields declined to US$6.49 
per boe in 2014 (2013: US$8.27) primarily as 
the significant element of fixed plant costs 
were spread over higher production rates. 
Management anticipates further reductions 
in unit costs as capacity utilisation rises 
towards 100%.
During 2014, the main development activity 
was the drilling of the VM#3 production well. 
Following slow progress with the drilling, it 
eventually became clear that the drilling 
contractor had encountered mechanical 
difficulties, with the drill pipe being stuck at a 
depth of 2,556 metres. Subsequent attempts 
by the drilling contractor to release the stuck 
drill pipe were not successful and operations 
were temporarily suspended in September 
2014. The Group subsequently agreed with the 
drilling contractor a cost-effective means of 
completing the VM#3 production well. 
Operations recommenced in January 2015 
with the aim of completing the well in time to 
commence production during the first half of 
2015. As the well is being drilled on a turnkey 
contract basis the cost has not been materially 
affected.
In January 2015, a second rig was mobilised 
to drill a sidetrack to the VM#4 well, which is 
currently not producing. There are, in 
addition, contingent plans to drill a further 
well, VM#5 later in 2015.
Oil production
Having completed its sixth year of full time 
production, the Yuzhny Uzenskoye oil field is 
the Group’s longest established field. It 
continues to produce under natural reservoir 
pressure drive and with minimal water cut. As 
the oil has been produced, the oil-water 
contact in the reservoir has risen and since the 
start of 2013, wells at the edge of the field 
have exhibited some water cut and were shut 
in. As a consequence, oil production from the 
field has been managed at declining 
production rates. There remains a shallower 
undeveloped reservoir which may be brought 
into production by re-using existing wells on 
the field.
In June 2013, following a successful flow test 
and workover, the Sobolevskaya #1 1 well in the 
Urozhainoye-2 licence was put on production. 
However, in August 2014 production from the 
well ceased. An undeveloped oil pool has been 
identified within the Sobolevskaya field. The 
2015 capital budget includes a sidetrack from 
the #1 1 well to develop this resource.
The Group’s oil production, whilst of modest 
scale, remains very profitable for the Group 
and a useful contributor of cash flow.
Exploration
The Group has identified a number of 
exploration targets in the Karpenskiy Licence 
Area at shallow horizons of between 1,000 
and 2,000 metres depth. These provide low 
cost opportunities to add potentially material 
oil reserves. The Group’s current priority is 
the development of its gas and condensate 
fields and a return to active exploration is to 
be considered for later in 2015 and beyond. 
The Group has fulfilled all its licence 
commitments on the Karpenskiy Licence 
Area and further drilling in the area is 
discretionary.

09 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Results for the year
In 2014, the Group generated US$39.4 million 
in turnover (2013: US$34.6 million) from the 
sale of 603,950 barrels of crude oil and 
condensate (2013: 547 ,257 barrels) and 5,671 
million cubic feet of natural gas (2013: 3,128 
million cubic feet). Oil and condensate sales 
were made into the domestic market during 
the period. The average price realised for 
liquids was the equivalent of US$45.07 per 
barrel (2013: US$47.63 per barrel). The gas 
sales price during 2014 averaged US$2.15 per 
thousand cubic feet (2013: US$2.73 per 
thousand cubic feet), the fall being entirely 
attributable to the devaluation of the Ruble. 
With sales made exclusively into the market 
in the Volga region at the wellhead, our oil 
and condensate sales prices reflect 
international prices, adjusted for export 
taxes and transportation costs. Production 
activities generated a gross profit of 
US$16.9 million in 2014 (2013: gross profit of 
US$16.2 million).
In 2014, the total cost of production 
increased to US$7.8 million (2013: US$5.9 
million), with the incremental costs primarily 
incurred in volume related costs at the 
Group’s gas processing plant. Production 
based taxes were US$8.3 million (2013: 
US$8.1 million) reflecting the increase in the 
proportion of gas in the Group’s production 
and lower rates of Mineral Extraction Tax 
(“MET”) charged on gas compared to crude 
oil. MET in 2014 represented 21.2% of 
revenues (2013: 23.0% of revenues). The 
gross profit margin in 2014 was 42.9% 
(2013: 46.7%).
Operating and administrative expenses in 
2014 were US$4.2 million (2013: US$4.0 
million).
The Group experienced a significant increase 
in EBITDA (defined as operating profit before 
non-cash charges, including exploration 
expense, depletion and depreciation) to 
US$17.4 million (2013: US$14.8 million) as a 
result of the higher revenues partly offset by 
higher expenses. As a reflection of the 
increasing proportion of gas in the sales mix. 
EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold in 
2014 was US$11.24 (2013: US$13.81).
After recording no exploration and evaluation 
expense (2013: US$2.5 million), or other asset 
impairment expenses (2013: US$ 1.4 million) 
the Group recorded an operating profit for 
2014 of US$12.8 million (2013: US$8.2 million).
After including net interest income of US$0.2 
million (2013: net interest expense of US$0.2 
million) and other gains, predominantly from 
foreign exchange, of $3.3 million (2013: net 
other gains of US$1.6 million), the Group 
recognised a profit before tax of US$16.3 
million (2013: US$9.6 million) and reported 
net profit after tax of US$13.1 million (2013: 
US$8.6 million) after taking a deferred tax 
charge of US$3.3 million (2013: US$1.0 
million). Included in Other income in 2014 was 
a foreign exchange gain of US$3.2 million 
arising from US Dollar cash balances held by 
Russian subsidiaries which have the Ruble as 
functional currency (2013: US$0.3 million loss 
on foreign exchange).
Cash flow
Group cash inflow from operating activities 
was US$16.2 million (2013: US$15.4 million). 
Net working capital movements contributed 
to a cash inflow of US$0.5 million in 2014 
(2013: US$1.2 million outflow from working 
capital movements). With slightly lower 
capital expenditures in 2014, the net outflow 
from investing activities was US$5.5 million 
(2013: US$6.2 million). Net cash outflow from 
financing activities was US$3.0 million (2013: 
outflow of US$8.1 million).
Dividend
In July 2014, the Board announced the 
adoption of a policy to distribute 
approximately 50% of consolidated net profit 
after tax as a cash dividend. A maiden interim 
dividend of US$0.0375 per share was paid on 
24 October 2014. In light of the material 
reduction in the oil price in recent months, 
adverse financial conditions currently 
prevailing in Russia and the Group’s plans for 
significant new investment in the LPG project 
the Board has decided to restrain the level of 
dividend payments. Accordingly, the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of US$0.0125 
per ordinary share, bringing the total 
payment for the year to US$0.05 per ordinary 
share (2013: nil).
Capital expenditure
During 2014 capital expenditure of US$5.9 
million was incurred (2013: US$5.9 million). In 
both 2014 and 2013 all of the capital 
expenditure was on development and 
producing assets. The most significant 
individual components of the capital 
expenditure in 2014 relate to the 
Dobrinskoye gas plant and drilling on the 
VM field.
Balance sheet and financing
As at 31 December 2014, the Group held cash 
and bank deposits of US$15.8 million (2013: 
US$8.1 million) with no debt. All of the 
Group’s cash balances are held in bank 
accounts in the UK and Russia and the 
majority of the Group’s cash is held in 
US Dollars.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group’s 
intangible assets decreased to US$3.7 million 
(2013: US$6.4 million). Property, plant and 
equipment, decreased to US$57.8 million 
(2013: US$98.3 million), primarily reflecting 
the impact of foreign exchange adjustments.
On 9 July 2014 the capital reduction 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting on 6 June 2014 
became effective following confirmation by 
the High Court, the filing of the Court Order 
and a Statement of Capital with Companies 
House and the fulfilment of certain minor 
undertakings given to the Court. As a result, 
the Share Premium Account of the Company, 
amounting to US$165.9 million, was cancelled 
and the equivalent sum credited to the 
Company’s Profit and Loss Account, thereby 
creating distributable reserves.
The Group’s committed capital expenditures 
are less than expected cash flow from 
operations and cash-on-hand and such 
expenditures can be managed in light of the 
sharp reduction in international oil prices and 
the devaluation of the Ruble. The Group may 
consider additional debt facilities to fund the 
longer-term development of its existing 
licences and operational facilities as 
appropriate.
The Group’s financial statements are 
presented on a going concern basis.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
11 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 The Group is subject to various risks relating 
to political, economic, legal, social, industry, 
business and financial conditions.
The following risk factors, which are not 
exhaustive, are particularly relevant to the 
Group’s business activities:
Volatility of oil prices
The supply, demand and prices for oil are 
influenced by factors beyond the Group’s 
control. These factors include global and 
regional demand and supply, exchange rates, 
interest and inflation rates and political 
events. A significant prolonged decline in oil 
and gas prices could impact the profitability 
of the Group’s activities. Additionally, the 
Group’s production is predominantly sold in 
the domestic Russian markets which are 
influenced by domestic supply and demand 
factors, the level of Russian export taxes and 
regional transportation costs.
Substantially all of the Group’s revenues and 
cash flows come from the sale of oil, gas and 
condensate. If sales prices should fall below 
and remain below the Group’s cost of 
production for any sustained period, the 
Group may experience losses and may be 
forced to curtail or suspend some or all of the 
Group’s production, at the time such 
conditions exist. In addition, the Group would 
also have to assess the economic impact of 
low oil and gas prices on its ability to recover 
any losses the Group may incur during that 
period and on the Group’s ability to maintain 
adequate reserves.
The Group does not currently hedge its crude 
oil production to reduce its exposure to oil 
price volatility as the structure of taxes 
applied to oil production in Russia effectively 
reduce the exposure to international market 
prices for oil.
Oil and gas production taxes
The Group’s sales generated from oil and gas 
production are subject to Mineral Extraction 
Taxes, which form a material proportion of 
the total costs of sales. The rates of these 
taxes are subject to changes by the Russian 
government. Changes to rates which come 
into effect during 2015 will materially 
increase the rates on crude oil, condensate 
and natural gas.
Exploration and reserve risks
Whilst the Group will seek to apply the latest 
technology to assess exploration licences, 
the exploration for, and development of, 
hydrocarbons is speculative and involves a 
high degree of risk. These risks include the 
uncertainty that the Group will discover 
sufficient commercially exploitable oil or gas 
resources in unproven areas of its licences. 
Unsuccessful exploration efforts may result 
in impairment to the balance sheet value of 
exploration assets.
During 2012, the Group commissioned a 
reserve evaluation based on reporting 
standards set by the Society of Petroleum 
Engineers. If the actual results of producing 
the Group’s fields are significantly different 
to expectations, there may be changes in the 
future estimates of reserves. These may 
impact the balance sheet values of the 
Group’s Intangible Assets and the Group’s 
Property, Plant and Equipment.
Environmental risk
The oil and gas industry is subject to 
environmental hazards, such as oil spills, gas 
leaks, ruptures and discharges of petroleum 
products and hazardous substances. These 
environmental hazards could expose the Group 
to material liabilities for property damages, 
personal injuries, or other environmental harm, 
including costs of investigating and 
remediating contaminated properties.
The Group is subject to stringent 
environmental laws in Russia with regards to 
its oil and gas operations. Failure to comply 
with such laws and regulations could subject 
the Group to material administrative, civil, or 
criminal penalties or other liabilities. 
Additionally, compliance with these laws may, 
from time to time, result in increased costs to 
the Group’s operations, impact production, or 
increase the costs of potential acquisitions.
The Group liaises closely with the Federal 
Service of Environmental, Technological and 
Nuclear Resources of the Saratov and 
Volgograd Oblasts on potential 
environmental impact of its operations and 
conducts environmental studies both as 
required by, and in addition to, its licence 
obligations to mitigate any specific risk. The 
Group’s operations are regularly subject to 
independent environmental audit.
The Group did not incur any material costs 
relating to the compliance with 
environmental laws during the period.
Risk of operating oil and gas properties
The oil and gas business involves certain 
operating hazards, such as well blowouts, 
cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of 
oil, gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and 
releases of toxic substances. Any of these 
operating hazards could cause serious 
injuries, fatalities, or property damage, which 
could expose the Group to liabilities. The 
settlement of these liabilities could materially 
impact the funds available for the exploration 
and development of the Group’s oil and gas 
properties. The Group maintains insurance 
against many potential losses and liabilities 
arising from its operations in accordance with 
customary industry practices, but the Group’s 
insurance coverage cannot protect it against 
all operational risks.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s capital expenditures and 
operating costs are predominantly in Russian 
Rubles (“RUR”) while a minority of costs are 
also in US Dollars. Revenues are 
predominantly received in RUR so 
consequently the operating profitability is not 
materially exposed to moderate short-term 
exchange rate movements. The functional 
currency of the Group’s operating subsidiaries 
is the RUR and the Group’s assets and liabilities 
are predominantly RUR denominated. As the 
Group’s presentational currency is the US 
Dollar, the significant devaluation of the RUR 
against the US Dollar would negatively impact 
the Group’s financial statements.
Business in Russia
Amongst the risks that face the Group in 
conducting business and operations in 
Russia are:
 — Economic instability, including in other 
countries or the global economy that 
could lead to consequences such as 
hyperinflation, currency fluctuations and 
a decline in per capita income in the 
Russian economy.
 — Governmental and political instability that 
could disrupt, delay or curtail economic 
and regulatory reform, increase 
centralised authority or result in 
nationalisations.
 — Social instability from any ethnic, 
religious, historical or other divisions that 
could lead to a rise in nationalism, social 
and political disturbances or conflict.
 — Uncertainties in the developing legal and 
regulatory environment, including, but 
not limited to, conflicting laws, decrees 
and regulations applicable to the oil and 
gas industry and foreign investment.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
12 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014  — Unlawful or arbitrary action against the 
Group and its interests by the regulatory 
authorities, including the suspension or 
revocation of their oil or gas contracts, 
licences or permits or preferential 
treatment of their competitors.
 — Lack of independence and experience of 
the judiciary, difficulty in enforcing court 
or arbitration decisions and governmental 
discretion in enforcing claims.
 — Unexpected changes to the federal and 
local tax systems.
 — Laws restricting foreign investment in the 
oil and gas industry.
Legal systems
Russia, and other countries in which the 
Group may transact business in the future, 
have or may have legal systems that are less 
well developed than those in the United 
Kingdom. This could result in risks such as:
 — Potential difficulties in obtaining effective 
legal redress in the court of such 
jurisdictions, whether in respect of a 
breach of contract, law or regulation, 
including an ownership dispute.
 — A higher degree of discretion on the part 
of governmental authorities.
 — The lack of judicial or administrative 
guidance on interpreting applicable rules 
and regulations.
 — Inconsistencies or conflicts between and 
within various laws, regulations, decrees, 
orders and resolutions.
 — Relative inexperience of the judiciary and 
courts in such matters.
In certain jurisdictions, the commitment of 
local business people, government officials 
and agencies and the judicial system to abide 
by legal requirements and negotiated 
agreements may be more uncertain, creating 
particular concerns with respect to licences 
and agreements for business. These may be 
susceptible to revision or cancellation and 
legal redress may be uncertain or delayed. 
There can be no assurance that joint 
ventures, licences, licence applications or 
other legal arrangements will not be 
adversely affected by the jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates.
Liquidity risk
At 31 December 2014 the Group had US$15.8 
million of cash and cash equivalents of which 
US$8.6 million was held in bank accounts in 
Russia. The Group intends to fund its ongoing 
operations and development activities from 
its cash resources and cash generated by its 
established operations. At 31 December 2014 
the Group has budgeted capital expenditures 
of approximately US$14 million primarily for 
the continuing development of gas and 
condensate production. The Board considers 
that the Group will have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its obligations. All current and planned 
capital expenditures are discretionary and 
may be deferred or cancelled in the light of 
the Group’s cash generation and liquidity 
position.
Through its ordinary course activities, the 
Group is exposed to legal, operational and 
development risk that could delay growth in 
its cash generation from operations or may 
require additional capital investment that 
could place increased burden on the Group’s 
available financial resources.
Capital risk
The Group manages capital to ensure that it 
is able to continue as a going concern whilst 
maximising the return to shareholders. The 
Group is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements. The Board 
regularly monitors the future capital 
requirements of the Group, particularly in 
respect of its ongoing development 
programme. During 2012 management 
decided that having established a track 
record of reliable cash generation it was 
appropriate to introduce a modest 
proportion of debt into the capital structure 
and as such a loan of US$10 million was taken 
and which was fully repaid by 31 December 
2013. Management expects that the cash 
generated by the operating fields will be 
sufficient to sustain the Group’s operations 
and committed capital investment for the 
foreseeable future. Further short-term debt 
facilities may be arranged to provide financial 
headroom for future development activities.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
15 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Corporate Governance Statement
Introduction
The Board’s overriding objective is to ensure 
that the Group delivers long-term capital 
appreciation for its shareholders.
Compliance
As Volga Gas plc is quoted on the AIM market 
of the London Stock Exchange, it is neither 
required to comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that was published by the 
Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”) nor 
issue a statement of compliance with it. 
Nevertheless, the Board fully supports the 
principles set out in the Code and seeks to 
follow these as best practice wherever this is 
appropriate having regard to the size of the 
Company, the resources available to it and 
the interpretation of the Code in the Quoted 
Companies Alliance Corporate Governance 
Code for Small and Mid-sized Quoted 
Companies.
Details are provided below of how the 
Company applies the elements of the Code 
that are deemed appropriate.
Board of directors
Role of the Board
The Board’s role is to provide leadership to 
the Group within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls which enables risk to 
be assessed and managed. The Board sets 
the Group’s strategic aims and ensures that 
the necessary financial and human resources 
are in place for the Group to meet its 
objectives, and reviews management’s 
performance in meeting these objectives. 
The Board sets and monitors the Group’s 
values and standards and ensures that the 
Group’s obligations to shareholders and 
other stakeholders are understood and met.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval, including:
 — Strategic and policy considerations
 — Annual budget, including capital 
expenditure
 — Interim and final financial statements
 — Dividend policy, share buy-backs or other 
distributions
 — Management structure and appointments
 — Mergers, acquisitions, disposals
 — Capital raising
 — Significant changes in accounting policies
 — Appointment or removal of directors or 
the company secretary
Board composition
The Board currently comprises two executive 
directors and five non-executive directors, of 
whom three are deemed to be independent 
and two non-independent:
 — Aleksey Kalinin – Non-Executive Chairman
 — Mikhail Ivanov – Executive Director 
and CEO
 — Tony Alves – Executive Director,  
CFO and Company Secretary
 — Ronald Freeman – Independent 
Non-Executive
 — Stephen Ogden – Independent 
Non-Executive
 — Vladimir Koshcheev – Independent 
Non-Executive
 — Michael Calvey – Non-Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the executive and non-executive 
directors.
Board balance and independence
The Board recognises that Messrs Kalinin and 
Calvey are not independent by virtue of their 
direct management responsibilities for the 
limited partnerships comprising Baring 
Vostok Private Equity Funds III and IV, the 
Company’s controlling shareholder 
(“Controlling Shareholder”). However, in light 
of the value, experience and contacts which 
they afford to the Company at this stage of 
its development and by virtue of the 
Relationship Agreement, which, inter alia, 
ensures that the Controlling Shareholder 
does not exercise undue influence over the 
Company or prevent it from acting 
independently of the Controlling 
Shareholder, the Board believes that the 
continued presence of Messrs Kalinin and 
Calvey on the Board is beneficial for the 
Company. Mr Kalinin also serves as Chairman 
of the Board and was not considered to be 
independent on his appointment.
Notwithstanding under the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code as a Smaller 
Company the Company meets the 
requirements to have at least two 
independent non-executives on the Board.
All directors are permitted access to 
independent professional advice in the 
course of execution of their duties, at the 
Company’s expense.
The Board has established the following 
committees:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee was established in 
March 2007 and comprises three directors:
Mr Ogden – Chairman
Mr Freeman
Mr Calvey
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
selecting the Group’s independent auditors, 
pre-approving all audit and non-audit related 
services, reviewing with management and 
the independent auditors the Group’s 
financial statements, significant accounting 
and financial policies and practices, audit 
scope and adequacy of internal audit and 
control systems. The Audit Committee keeps 
the independence and objectivity of the 
auditor under review and a formal statement 
of independence is received from the 
external auditor each year. The audit 
committee meets at least twice each year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was also 
established in March 2007 and comprises 
three directors:
Mr Freeman – Chairman
Mr Ogden
Mr Kalinin
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for reviewing the performance of the 
directors and for determining compensation 
of the Company’s key employees, including 
the chief executive officer, chief financial 
officer, and other key personnel as may be

16 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee was established 
in March 2007 and comprises three directors:

of the Board, making recommendations to 
the Board concerning plans for succession for 
both executive and non-executive directors 
including the Chief Executive and other 
senior management, preparing a description 
of the role and capabilities required for a 
particular appointment and identifying and 
nominating candidates to fill Board positions 
as and when they arise.
Board meetings
The Board met four times during the year 
ended 31 December 2014 (2013: four times) 
with the following attendance:
2014 2013
Aleksey Kalinin 4 4
Mikhail Ivanov 4 4
Tony Alves 4 4
Ronald Freeman 3 3
Stephen Ogden 4 4
Vladimir Koshcheev 3 4
Michael Calvey 4 4
Indemnification of directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association and to the extent permitted by 
the law of England and Wales, directors are 
granted an indemnity from the Company in 
respect of liabilities incurred as a result of 
their office. In respect of those matters for 
which the directors may not be indemnified, 
the Company maintained a directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance policy throughout 
the financial year. This policy has been 
renewed for the next financial year.
Re-election of directors
The Company requires that all directors stand 
for re-election at intervals of no more than 
three years. Accordingly Messrs Calvey, 
Ivanov and Koshcheev will retire at the 
forthcoming AGM and will seek re-election by 
shareholders.
Internal controls
The directors acknowledge their 
responsibility for the system of internal 
controls for the Group and for reviewing its 
effectiveness.
Any system of internal control can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance that material financial irregularities 
will be detected or that the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives is eliminated.
The Group’s risk and controls framework 
covers all material risks and controls including 
those of an operational, financial, and 
compliance nature. Internal control 
procedures consist, inter alia, of formal 
delegations of expenditure authority by the 
Board to executive management, and 
controls relating to key stages of transactions 
including supplier approval, contract 
signature, and payment release.
The directors consider that the frequency of 
Board meetings and level of detail presented 
to the Board for its consideration in relation 
to the operations of the Group provide an 
appropriate process to identify, evaluate and 
manage significant risks relevant to its 
operations on a continuous basis, and this 
process is considered to be in accordance 
with the revised guidance on internal control 
published in October 2005 (“Turnbull 
Guidance”).
In addition to formal Board meetings, 
management prepare detailed financial and 
operational reports on a monthly basis which 
is disseminated and discussed within the 
Board.
Investor relations
The Company places considerable 
importance on communication with 
shareholders and engages them on a wide 
range of issues.
The Group has an ongoing programme of 
dialogue and meetings between the 
executive directors and institutional 
investors, fund managers and analysts. At 
these meetings a wide range of relevant 
issues including strategy, performance, 
management and governance are discussed 
within the constraints of the information 
already made public.
The Company is equally interested in the 
views and concerns of private shareholders 
and to this end ensures that the executive 
directors present the Company at forums 
where private investors are present.
Shareholders have the opportunity to meet 
and question the Board at the AGM which will 
be held on 5 June 2015, at which the 
Chairman, the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and all executive directors will be 
available. The notice of the AGM is posted to 
all shareholders at least 21 working days 
before the meeting. Financial and other 
information is available on the Company’s 
website (www.volgagas.com).

Principal activities, business review and 
future developments
Volga Gas is a public limited company 
registered in England and Wales with 
registered number 5886534, was 
incorporated in the United Kingdom on 25 
July 2006 and admitted to trading on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange on 25 
April 2007. Volga Gas operates primarily 
through subsidiary companies as set out in 
Note 2.2 to the accounts. The principal 
activity of the Group is the exploration, 
development and production of its gas, 
condensate and oil fields in the Volga Region 
of European Russia. During the year, the 
Group owned 100% interests in four licence 
areas in the Saratov and Volgograd regions: 
Karpenskiy, Vostochny-Makarovskoye, 
Dobrinskoye, and Urozhainoye-2. During the 
year, the Group relinquished the exploration 
areas of the Urozhainoye-2 Licence but 
retains a portion as production licence area 
including the Sobolevskoye oil field.
The Group’s business strategy is to further 
the development of the Vostochny 
Makarovskoye field and to manage 
production on the Dobrinskoye and 
Uzenskoye fields whilst at the same time 
exploring the potentially prospective 
structures on the Group’s licence areas. The 
Group also regularly evaluates acquisition 
opportunities as part of its overall growth 
strategy.
Highlights of the Group’s activities for the 
period ended 31 December 2014 are:
 — Significant increase in production from 
the Vostochny Makarovskoye field.
 — Initiation of engineering studies for 
further upgrades to the Dobrinskoye gas 
plant, including LPG extraction.
The Group’s activities are described in greater 
detail in the Chief Executive’s Report on 
page 6 and in the Operational Review on 
pages 8 and 9. The principal risks associated 
with the Group’s activities are set out in the 
Financial Review on pages 10 to 13.
Key performance indicators
Given the nature of the business and that the 
Group has only three operating fields, the 
directors are of the opinion that further 
analysis using KPI’s is not appropriate for an 
understanding of the development, 
performance or position of our business at 
this time. The directors are of the opinion 
that the Operational Review on pages 8 and 9 
provides the relevant information.
Going concern
Having made appropriate enquiries and 
having examined the major areas that could 
affect the Group’s financial position, the 
directors are satisfied that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operation 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they 
consider it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements as described in note 1.

no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 — they have taken all steps that they ought

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the Annual Report, Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report and the 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and Parent Company financial 
statements for each financial year. As 
required by the AIM Rules for Companies of 
the London Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and Parent Company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
STRATEGIC  
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
19 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014  — make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 — state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue in 
business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Electronic communications
The maintenance and integrity of the Volga 
Gas plc website (www.volgagas.com) is the 
responsibility of the directors; the work 
carried out by the auditor does not involve 
consideration of these matters and 
accordingly, the auditor accepts no 
responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since 
they were initially presented on the website.
The Company’s website is maintained in 
compliance with Rule 26 of the AIM Rules for 
Companies.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

compliance with the appropriate aspects of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the

Remuneration Committee
The Company established a Remuneration 
Committee in April 2007, as set out in the 
Corporate Governance statement on 
page 16.
The Remuneration Committee advises the 
Board on Group compensation policy as it 
relates to executive directors and other key 
members of management, and may obtain 
advice from independent remuneration 
consultants appointed by the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee comprises Ronald 
Freeman (Chairman), Stephen Ogden and 
Aleksey Kalinin, who are all non-executive 
directors. Executive directors may be invited 
to attend meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee but do not vote on their own 
remuneration or incentives. The 
Remuneration Committee meets as required.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy is to maintain levels of 
compensation for the Group that are 
comparable and competitive with peer group 
companies, so as to attract and retain 
individuals of the highest calibre, by 
rewarding them as appropriate for their 
contribution to the Group’s performance.
Executive directors’ employment 
agreement and terms of appointment
The terms of each executive director’s 
appointment are set out in their service 
agreements. Each executive director 
agreement is based on similar terms, with no 
fixed duration. Each service agreement sets 
out details of basic salary and share options 
as applicable.
All executive director employment 
agreements can be terminated either by the 
director concerned or by the Company on 
giving six months’ notice during the first 24 
months of service and thereafter by giving 
three months’ notice.
The executive directors do not participate in 
any Group pension scheme and their 
remuneration is not pensionable. However, 
one of the executive directors has elected to 
receive part of his remuneration by way of 
contributions to a personal pension plan. The 
executive directors are eligible for payment 
of cash bonuses and participation in any 
share-based incentive plan the Board 
implements.
Basic salaries
The basic salary of each executive director is 
established by reference to their 
responsibilities and individual performance.
Non-executive directors’ terms, 
conditions and fees
The non-executive directors have been 
engaged under the terms of their letters of 
appointment. These engagements are for 
two years and can be terminated upon one 
month’s notice by either party. 
Reappointment is subject to the Company’s 
Articles of Association which provide that 
one third of the directors shall be required to 
retire each year.

29 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2014
(presented in US$ 000)
1. General information
Volga Gas plc (the “Company” or “Volga”) is a public limited company registered in England and Wales with registered number 5886534. 
The Company was incorporated on 25 July 2006. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are the acquisition, 
exploration and development of hydrocarbon assets and production of hydrocarbons in the Volga Region of the Russian Federation. Its 
registered office is at Ground floor, 17-19 Rochester Row, London, SW1P 1QT. The Company’s shares are admitted to trading on the AIM market 
of the London Stock Exchange.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 March 2015.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), as adopted by the European Union (“EU”), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRIC”) interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed 
in note 4.
No income statement is presented for Volga Gas plc as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position set out in the 
Strategic Report in pages 4 to 13; the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Financial Review on pages 10 to 11. In addition, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring capital, financial risk 
management objectives, details of financial instruments and exposure to credit and liquidity risks are described in note 3. Having reviewed the 
future cash flow forecasts of the Group, the directors have concluded that the Group will continue to have access to sufficient funds in order to 
meet its obligations as they fall due for at least the foreseeable future and thus continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the annual financial statements.
Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards
(a) New and amended standards and interpretations:
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2014 that have a 
material impact on the Group.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 10, the Group reassessed the control conclusion for its investees at 1 January 2014. No 
modifications of previous conclusions about control regarding the Group’s investees were required.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group. 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial year 
beginning 1 January 2014 and have not been early adopted:
 — IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
 — Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2010-2012 Cycle (effective 1 July 2014)
 — Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2011-2013 Cycle (effective 1 July 2014)
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of these new standards and amendments but does not expect them to have an material impact on the 
financial statements, with the main effect being the requirement for additional disclosures.
2.2 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled 
by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the 
non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from 
contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.
30 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the cost cannot be recovered.
The Company and its subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation maintain their financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU. The Russian subsidiaries of the Group maintain their statutory accounting records in accordance with the Regulations on Accounting 
and Reporting of the Russian Federation. The consolidated financial statements are based on these statutory accounting records, appropriately 
adjusted and reclassified for fair presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.
A list of the Company’s subsidiaries is provided in note 20.
2.3 Segment reporting
Segmental reporting follows the Group’s internal reporting structure.
Operating segments are defined as components of the Group where separate financial information is available and reported regularly to the 
chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is determined to be the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors decides 
how to allocate resources and assesses operational and financial performance using the information provided.
The CODM receives monthly IFRS based financial information for the Group and its development and production entities. There were three 
development and production entities during both 2013 and 2014. Management has determined that the operations of these production and 
development entities are sufficiently homogenous (all are concerned with upstream oil and gas development and production activities) for 
these to be aggregated for the purpose of IFRS 8, “Operating Segments”. The Group has other entities that engage as either head office or in a 
corporate capacity or as holding companies. Management has concluded that due to application of the aggregation criteria that separate 
financial information for segments is not required.
No geographic segmental information is presented as all of the companies operating activities are based in the Russian Federation.
Management has determined therefore that the operations of the Group comprise one class of business, being oil and gas exploration, 
development and production and the Group operates in only one geographic area – the Russian Federation.
The Group’s gas sales, representing a substantial proportion of revenues are made to a single customer. Details are provided in note 3.1 (b).
2.4 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which 
is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
The functional currency of the Group’s subsidiaries that are incorporated in the Russian Federation is the Russian Ruble (“RUR”). It is the 
Management’s view that the RUR best reflects the financial results of its Cyprus subsidiaries because they are dependent on entities based in 
Russia that operate in an RUR environment in order to recover their investments. As a result, the functional currency of the subsidiaries 
continues to be the RUR.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and other foreign exchange gains and losses are 
presented in the income statement within “Other gains and losses”.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet item presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The major exchange rates used for the revaluation of the closing balance sheet at 31 December 2014 were:
 — GBP 1.5532: US$ (2013: GBP 1: US$ 1. 6488)
 — EUR 1.2148: US$ (2013: 1.374)
 — US$ 1:56.2584 RUR. (2013: US$ 1: RUR. 32.729)

STATEMENTS

2.5 Oil and gas assets
The Company and its subsidiaries apply the successful efforts method of accounting for Exploration and Evaluation (“E&E”) costs, in accordance 
with IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources”. Costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis.
Capital expenditure is recognised as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets in the financial statements according to the nature of 
the expenditure and the stage of development of the associated field, i.e. exploration, development, production.
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets
Costs directly associated with an exploration well, including certain geological and geophysical costs, and exploration and property leasehold 
acquisition costs, are capitalised as intangible assets until the determination of reserves is evaluated. If it is determined that a commercial 
discovery has not been achieved, these costs are charged to expense after the conclusion of appraisal activities. Exploration costs such as 
geological and geophysical that are not directly related to an exploration well are expensed as incurred.
Once commercial reserves are found, exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment and transferred to development assets. No 
depreciation or amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
(b) Development assets
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of 
development wells into commercially proven reserves, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment. When development is completed on 
a specific field, it is transferred to producing assets as part of property, plant and equipment. No depreciation or amortisation is charged during 
the development phase.
(c) Oil and gas production assets
Production assets are accumulated generally on a field by field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered 
and bringing them into production together with E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves and transferred from the 
intangible E&E assets as described above.
The cost of production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs 
capitalised and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Where major and identifiable parts of the production assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment. Costs of minor repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
(d) Depreciation/amortisation
Oil and gas properties are depreciated or amortised using the unit-of-production method. Unit-of-production rates are based on proved and 
probable reserves, which are oil, gas and other mineral reserves estimated to be recovered from existing facilities using current operating 
methods. Oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction 
points at the outlet valve on the field storage tank.
(e) Impairment – exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment prior to reclassification to development tangible assets, or whenever facts and 
circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the exploration and 
evaluation assets’ carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the exploration and evaluation 
assets’ fair value less costs to sell and their value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, the exploration and evaluation assets 
subject to testing are grouped with existing cash-generating units of production fields that are located in the same geographical region.
(f) Impairment – proved oil and gas production properties
Proven oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The cash generating unit applied for impairment test 
purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped together where the cash flows of each field are 
interdependent, for instance where surface infrastructure is used by one or more field in order to process production for sale.
(g) Decommissioning
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the time when the obligation to decommission arises. Such provision represents 
the estimated discounted liability (the discount rate used currently being at 10% per annum) for costs which are expected to be incurred in 
removing production facilities and site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field. A corresponding item of property, plant and 
equipment is also created at an amount equal to the provision. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production 
facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates of the cash flow or the current 
estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the property, plant and equipment. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
32 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 2.6 Other business and corporate assets
Property, plant and equipment not associated with exploration and production activities are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
These assets are also evaluated for impairment when circumstances dictate.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated on a straight line basis as follows:
Machinery and equipment 6–10 years
Office equipment in excess of US$5,000 3–4 years
Vehicles and other 2–7 years
2.7 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. This category comprises derivatives unless they are 
effective hedging instruments. The Group had no financial assets in this class as at 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. This 
category comprises trade and other receivables, term bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents in balance sheet.
2.8 Inventories
Crude oil inventories are stated at the lower of cost of production and net realisable value. Materials and supplies inventories are recorded at 
average cost and are carried at amounts which do not exceed the expected recoverable amount from use in the normal course of business. 
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and other 
costs associated in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
2.9 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
2.10 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, and deposits held at call with banks.
2.11 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2.12 Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.13 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in 
the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.14 Employee benefits
(a) Share-based compensation
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the 
number of options that are expected to vest. The option plan currently in place for certain of the directors is an equity settled share option plan.
The Company measures the equity instruments granted to employees at the fair value at grant date. The fair value of fully-vested shares is 
expensed immediately. The fair value of shares with vesting requirements is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This value 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. The estimate is revised, as necessary, if subsequent information 
indicates that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
(b) Social obligations
Wages, salaries, contributions to the Russian Federation state pension and social insurance funds, paid annual leave, sick leave and bonuses are 
accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
2.15 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of oil and gas in the ordinary course of the Group’s 
activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue from 
the sale of oil or gas is recognised when the oil/gas is delivered to customers and title has transferred. In 2014 and 2013 , the Group’s revenue 
related to sales of crude oil and condensate collected directly by customers and gas sales made at the entry to the gas distribution system.
2.16 Prepayments
Prepayments are carried at cost less provision for impairment. A prepayment is classified as non-current when the goods or services relating to 
the prepayment are expected to be obtained after one year, or when the prepayment relates to an asset which will itself be classified as 
non-current upon initial recognition. Prepayments to acquire assets are transferred to the carrying amount of the asset once the Group has 
obtained control of the asset and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group. Other 
prepayments are written off to profit or loss when the goods or services relating to the prepayments are received. If there is an indication that 
the assets, goods or services relating to a prepayment will not be received, the carrying value of the prepayment is written down accordingly 
and a corresponding impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the year.
2.17 Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the 
amount has been reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the 
class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same 
class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to 
passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
3. Financial risk management
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk, and cash flow interest rate 
risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and 
seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
(a) Market Risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Russian Ruble. Foreign exchange 
risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities.
At 31 December 2014, if the US Dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the RUR with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit 
for the year would have been US$289,000 (2013: US$50,250) higher/lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of 
RUR denominated trade payables and financial assets. At 31 December 2014, if the US Dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the 
Euro (“EUR”) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been US$1,000 (2013: US$1,200) higher/lower, mainly 
as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of EUR denominated interest charges and financial liabilities. At 31 December 2014, if 
the US Dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the Pound Sterling (“GBP”) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for 
the year would have been US$15,000 (2013: US$1,500) higher/lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of GBP 
denominated trade payables and financial assets.

Group companies utilised short-term foreign exchange forward contracts in 2014 to effect sales of RUR against USD. There were no open 
contracts as at 31 December 2014. No forward foreign exchange contracts were used in 2013.
(ii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to price risk as it does not hold financial instruments of which the fair values or future cash flows will be affected by 
changes in market prices.
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
As the Group currently has no significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially 
independent of changes in market interest rates.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s maximum credit risk exposure is the fair value of each class of assets, presented in note 3.1(a)(i) of US$15,767,000 and US$8,081,000 
at 31 December 2014 and 2013 respectively.
The Group’s principal financial asset is cash and credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions. It is the Group’s policy to monitor the financial standing of these assets on an ongoing basis. Bank balances are held with reputable 
and established financial institutions.
The Group’s oil and condensate sales are undertaken on a prepaid basis and accordingly the Group has no trade receivables and consequently 
no credit risk associated with the related trade receivables. Gas sales accounting for 31.0% of Group revenues in 2014 (2013: 24.7%) are made to 
OOO Trans Nafta. As at 31 December 2014 there were trade receivables of US$0.6 million (31 December 2013: US$1.8 million) primarily relating 
to gas sales.

Total bank balance 15,767 8,081
(c) Liquidity risk
Cash flow forecasting is performed by Group finance. Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure 
it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Group believes it has at least sufficient liquidity headroom to fund its currently planned 
exploration and development activities.
The Group expects to fund its capital investments, as well as its administrative and operating expenses, through 2015 using a combination of 
cash generated from its oil and gas production activities, existing working capital and, when appropriate, medium-term bank borrowings. If the 
Group is unsuccessful in generating enough liquidity to fund its expenditures, the Group’s ability to execute its long-term growth strategy could 
be significantly affected. The Group may need to raise additional equity or debt finance as appropriate to fund investments beyond its current 
commitments.

(d) Capital risk
The Group manages capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to shareholders. The Group is 
not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Board regularly monitors the future capital requirements of the Group, 
particularly in respect of its ongoing development programme. Management expects that the cash generated by the operating fields will be 
sufficient to sustain the Group’s operations and future capital investment for the foreseeable future. Further short-term debt facilities may be 
arranged to provide financial headroom for future development activities.
3.2 Fair value estimation
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair 
value. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
 — Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The Group has no financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Carrying value of fixed assets, intangible assets and impairment
Fixed assets are assessed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist. The carrying value 
of fixed assets is evaluated by reference to their value in use and primarily looks to the present value of management’s best estimate of the 
cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. In identifying cash flows management firstly determine the cash generating unit or group 
of assets that give rise to the cash flows. The cash generating unit is the lowest level of asset at which independent cash flows can be 
generated.
The estimation of forecast cash flows involves the application of a number of significant judgements and estimates to a number of variables 
including production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, capital investment, hydrocarbon reserves estimates, inflation and discount 
rates. For the purposes of impairment testing, the discount rate used is 15% per annum. In addition, judgement is applied in determining the 
cash generating unit to be assessed for impairment.
(b) Estimation of oil and gas reserves
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently subjective and subject to periodic revision. In addition, the results of drilling and other 
exploration or development activity will often provide additional information regarding the Group’s reserve base that may result in increases or 
decreases to reserve volumes. Such revisions to reserves can be significant and are not predictable with any degree of certainty. Management 
considers the estimation of reserves to represent a significant judgement in the context of the financial statements as reserve volumes are 
used as the basis for assessing the useful life of oil and gas assets, applying depreciation to oil and gas assets and in assessing the carrying value 
of oil and gas assets. Decreases in reserve estimates can lead to significant impairment of oil and gas assets where revisions (positive or 
negative) can have a significant effect on depreciation rates from period to period. Management have considered the sensitivity of this key 
assumption and in order for an impairment issue to present itself to the Group, reserve estimates would need to reduce by more than 25%.
(c) Income taxes
Significant judgement is frequently required in estimating provisions for deferred taxes. This process involves an assessment of temporary 
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and 
liabilities, which are included within the balance sheet.

2008 Executive Share Option Plan
On 15 July 2008 the Group announced a new Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”). During 2008, the Company granted options to acquire 
1,137,464 ordinary shares to Mikhail Ivanov under the terms of the ESOP. The options may be exercised at a price of 405p per share and vested 
in equal portions on May 2010, 2011 and 2012 and will remain outstanding until May 2017. In January 2009, the Company granted 568,732 share 
options to Tony Alves under the ESOP. A total of 195,503 share options vested in eight semi-annual tranches over a period of four years under 
conditions related to the Company’s share price. The options have an exercise price of £1.00. As of 17 December 2012 no further options were 
eligible for vesting. There were no share grant expenses in 2014 (2013: nil).
The fair value of share options granted and of restricted shares issued is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following

23. Contingencies and Commitments
23.1 Capital commitments
As of the balance sheet date all material licence commitments have been met.
23.2 Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes which can occur frequently. Management’s 
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant regional and 
federal authorities. Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in 
their interpretation of the legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the 
past may be challenged. As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review by 
the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review, but under certain circumstances, reviews may cover 
longer periods.
At 31 December 2014, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Group’s tax, currency and 
customs positions will be sustained.
23.3 Restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental costs
The Group operates in the upstream oil industry in the Russian Federation and its activities may have an impact on the environment. The 
enforcement of environmental regulations in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture of government authorities is 
continually being reconsidered. The Group periodically evaluates its obligation related thereto. The outcome of environmental liabilities under 
proposed or future legislation, or as a result of stricter interpretation and enforcement of existing legislation, cannot reasonably be estimated 
at present, but could be material.
Under the current levels of enforcement of existing legislation, management believes there are no significant liabilities in addition to amounts 
which are already accrued and which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
23.4 Oilfield licences
The Group is subject to periodic reviews of its activities by governmental authorities with respect to the requirements of its oilfield licences. 
Management of the Group correspond with governmental authorities to agree on remedial actions, if necessary, to resolve any findings 
resulting from these reviews. Failure to comply with the terms of a licence could result in fines, penalties, licence limitation, suspension or 
revocation. The Group’s management believes any issues of non-compliance would be resolved through negotiations or corrective actions 
without any materially adverse effect on the financial position or the operating results of the Group.

forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.
6. A form of proxy is enclosed. To be effective, it must be deposited at the office of the Company’s registrars (Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 
4TU) so as to be received not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the AGM. Completion of the proxy does not preclude a member from subsequently 
attending and voting at the meeting in person if he or she so wishes.

is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of 
attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or duly a certificated copy of such power of authority) must be included with the revocation notice; 
or
(b) by sending an email to info@volgagas.com.
 In either case, the revocation notice must be received by the Company’s registrars no later than the cut-off time set out in note 3 above.
9. The register of interests of the directors and their families in the share capital of the Company and copies of contracts of service of directors with the Company or with any of its 
subsidiary undertakings will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours (Saturdays and public holidays excepted) from the 
date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM.
10. To appoint a proxy or to give or amend an instruction to a previously appointed proxy via the CREST system, the CREST message must be received by the issuer’s agent RA10 no later 
than forty eight hours before the meeting date. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the 
CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message. After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the proxy by other means. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST Members who have appointed voting service 
provider(s) should contact their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST. For further information on CREST procedures, 
limitations and system timings please refer to the CREST Manual. We may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of 
the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. In any case your proxy form must be received by the Company’s registrars no later than forty eight hours before the meeting date.

relation to the same shares.
12. Under section 319A of the 2006 Act, the Company must cause to be answered any question relating to the business being dealt with at the Annual General Meeting put by a 
member attending the meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, or 
the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the 
question be answered.
 Members who have any queries about the Annual General Meeting should contact the Company Secretary by email on info@volgagas.com. Members may not use any electronic

BUSINESS PROFILE CONTINUED 4
I am pleased to report that 2007 
saw a further improvement in 
the performance of the Group. 
During the course of the year, 
the Group has restructured its 
core operations; strengthened 
its management team with 
experienced senior staff to 
run each of the key operating 
divisions; delivered further 
improvements to efﬁ ciency 
of its support operations; and 
accelerated the growth strategy 
both organically by increasing 
the number of sales consultants; 
and by acquisition through the 
purchase of the Glotel business.
The culture of the Company has 
changed. We have focussed our 
people on delivering excellent 
service to our candidates and 
clients. We have endeavoured 
to recruit the best people by 
providing an environment of 
high reward, recognition and 
motivation. We believe we will 
retain and develop these staff to 
put us in a position where we can 
outshine the competition. This 
policy has created a workplace 
that whilst challenging and 
competitive is also a fun and 
rewarding place to work. We 
believe our company provides 
opportunities for our staff to fulﬁ l 
their ambitions by providing a 
structured career in which they 
can grow and develop their 
talents.
Our management team are 
highly motivated and ambitious 
to further grow our organisation 
both organically and through 
selective acquisitions. The last 
twelve months have laid down 
an extremely strong platform to 
enable these goals to be realised.
Our results for 2007 reﬂ ect the 
successful execution of our plans 
and the consequent continued 
improvement in the ﬁ nancial 
health of the Group. Revenues 
increased 6.3% to £432.8 million, 
but the more relevant measure of 
volume in our business, net fee 
income, improved by 22.7% to 
£56.1 million. Pre-tax proﬁ ts were 
£7.1 million, an improvement of 
31.2% compared to the prior 
year, with basic earnings per share 
of 3.76p, up 22.1% on 2006. 
The Group’s balance sheet 
remains healthy with total assets 
of £158.3 million, compared with 
£139.5 million at 31 December 
2006. Closing net cash at the year 
end was £35.0 million compared 
with £46.9 million last year, 
reﬂ ecting the £30.8 million cash 
outﬂ ow for the Glotel business 
and continued strong cash 
generation from the underlying 
business.
...and expanded geographically.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“We have endeavoured to 
recruit the best people by 
providing an environment 
of high reward, recognition 
and motivation.”

completion of the acquisition 
of Glotel plc in July and the 
integration of the Glotel business 
was completed during the second 
half of the year. Since acquisition, 
the Glotel business has been 
trading ahead of our expectations 
and the Board expects this 
acquisition to be earnings 
enhancing in 2008. 
 
Whilst market commentators have 
mixed views on the prospects 
for the recruitment sector in 
2008, our business is, so far this 
year, trading in-line with our 
expectations. We will continue 
to review opportunities to grow 
our Company by looking at new 
markets and possible acquisitions, 
but we remain determined to 
invest wisely in and continue to 
build the business for the beneﬁ t 
of our shareholders. The Group 
is well placed to make further 
progress in 2008.
SPRING STAFF
The continued progress shown by 
the Group in 2007 is a function 
of the efforts from all of the staff 
throughout the Group. I would 
like to extend the appreciation 
of the Board and shareholders to 
the staff at Spring and to thank 
them for their dedication to the 
Group and to all of our clients and 
candidates. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
 
Our AGM will be held on 
8 May 2008 and I look forward to

INTRODUCTION
2007 saw the continuing 
successful implementation of 
the strategy that has returned 
the Group to sustainable growth 
and proﬁ tability. We have seen 
increases in revenue, net fee 
income and proﬁ tability driven by 
greater productivity, higher margin 
business and signiﬁ cantly greater 
efﬁ ciencies and automation in 
running our back ofﬁ ce.
In July we successfully completed 
the acquisition of Glotel plc. 
This accelerated our strategy 
and has signiﬁ cantly enhanced 
our geographic spread, with 
businesses in Europe, eleven 
locations in North America 
and two in Australia. During 
the second half of 2007 we 
completed the integration of the 
businesses with the integration 
of the UK back ofﬁ ce functions 
completed ahead of schedule in 
early October. 
Since the acquisition of Glotel 
all parts of the acquired 
business have made a positive 
contribution to our results in the 
year and we anticipate further 
progress in 2008 together with 
a full year’s beneﬁ t from the 
integration synergies arising 
from the combination of the two 
businesses.
STRATEGIC UPDATE
In-line with our strategy the 
Group is now split into 3 clear 
business divisions; Managed 
Solutions, Professional Stafﬁ ng 
and General Stafﬁ ng, which also 
incorporates our engineering 
stafﬁ ng business. These business 
units now all have strong 
leadership teams in place on a 
global basis. 
Our plans to increase our 
permanent business have 
proved relatively successful with 
net fee income growing by 
£2 million to £12.3 million (2006: 
£10.3 million) representing 
approximately 22% of the Group’s 
total net fee income. However, we 
are still predominantly a contract/
temporary-based organisation 
and this less volatile revenue 
stream puts us in good stead to 
withstand market turbulence 
throughout the economic cycle. 
Geographically our business has 
also expanded rapidly and this 
overseas expansion into new 
markets, though requiring initial 
investment in 2007, is now 
generating a positive return for 
the Group. Our new US and Asia 
Paciﬁ c businesses which, with 
mainland Europe, now account 
for over 20% of our net fee 
income on a run rate basis. We 
have 4 ofﬁ ces in mainland Europe, 
Germany, Belgium and two in 
Italy with further overseas ofﬁ ce 
openings planned in Singapore, 
Hong Kong and Delhi during 
2008. We will of course continue

to consider new ofﬁ ce openings 
in existing territories where 
appropriate to continue to drive 
growth and gain market share.
During the course of 2007 we 
also grew our sales capacity, 
increasing the revenue generating 
headcount by more than 250 
net staff. This was accomplished 
through the acquisition of Glotel 
and organically through our 
central recruiting and training 
functions. This central team will 
enable us to continue to invest 
in and expand our sales capacity 
further through 2008. 
OPERATING REVIEW
The results for 2007 show a 
strong improvement in each of 
the primary ﬁ nancial performance 
measures compared with 2006. 
The Group reversed the volume 
decline experienced in earlier 
years and recorded sequential 
quarter on quarter growth in 
revenue, net fee income and 
proﬁ t, throughout 2007. In the 
fourth quarter of 2007 revenues 
increased by 34% to £126.9 
million, net fee income increased 
by 45% to £17.1 million and 
proﬁ t before tax improved by 
49% to £2.7 million over the 
comparative fourth quarter of 
2006.
PROFESSIONAL STAFFING
This division comprises the IT 
Contracting and Permanent 
Recruitment Services businesses 
within the Group as well as the 
Glotel business acquired in the 
second half of 2007.
The division reported a small 
increase in revenue from £226.5 
million in 2006 to £227.4 million 
in 2007 with the corresponding 
operating proﬁ t improving from 
£5.6 million in 2006 to £6.0 
million in 2007. The revenue 
movement is the net effect of 
the Glotel acquisition, the switch 
to lower revenue, higher margin 
accounts and investment in new 
brands, offset by the reduction 
in volumes as a consequence of 
the Group’s decision to exit a 
small number of high volume but 
unproﬁ table accounts.
As with our other divisions, we 
have built a strong management 
team. A key focus has been the 
drive to increase sales headcount, 
with this division absorbing the 
majority of new sales hires as well 
as the business acquired from the 
Glotel acquisition. In 2007 we 
established new sales teams in 
both the contract and permanent 
recruitment divisions with each 
team specialising in a range 
of technical disciplines, which 
should facilitate a greater focus 
on improving further our gross 
margins. 
During the year we have seen a 
signiﬁ cant increase in percentage

margin and net fee income due 
to improvements in the quality of 
business being secured. As new 
sales staff recruited through 2007 
become fully productive, coupled 
with increases in productivity in 
our existing businesses we expect 
to see this trend continue in 2008.
MANAGED SOLUTIONS
Our Managed Solutions division 
which consists of our hy-phen, 
RPO and Spring IT Solutions 
businesses has proven to be 
robust through 2007. As a 
result of focusing on maximising 
revenues from those clients with 
whom we have some of our 
strongest relationships we grew 
revenues by 9.2% from £140.2 
million in 2006 to £153.1 million 
in 2007. As the quality and terms 
of this business has improved so 
has operating proﬁ t improving by 
22.2% from £2.7 million in 2006 
to £3.3 million in 2007.
Investment has been made 
throughout 2007 in new 
corporate sales staff and 
account Directors with the 
aim of improving service levels 
and winning new clients. Our 
resourcing capabilities have 
also become more effective and 
efﬁ cient with the creation of the 
central resourcing pool.
The long-term customer contracts, 
and the predominance of contract 
staff should result in robust 
performance from this division 
throughout the economic cycle 
and we anticipate that growth 
levels should continue.
 
GENERAL STAFFING
During 2007 we grew revenues 
in this business by 10.0% 
from £49.6 million in 2006 to 
£54.6 million in 2007 and turned 
a £0.1 million loss in 2006 into 
a £0.6 million proﬁ t in 2007, 
whilst making investments in new 
ofﬁ ces, people and brands.
This division has seen the opening 
of several new ofﬁ ces in 2007 to 
give greater market coverage in 
both the Spring Personnel and 
Elizabeth Hunt brands. Aligned 
to this has been a corresponding 
increase in headcount. Spring 
Direct has moved into the 
Engineering market with 
marked success and we will be 
investing further in this business 
throughout 2008.
I am conﬁ dent that as ofﬁ ces 
and staff become fully productive 
that we will see further increases 
in revenue, net fee income and 
proﬁ t from this business in 2008.
IMPROVED BUSINESS 
EFFICIENCY
During the year we established 
centralised corporate sales and 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
“In the fourth quarter of 2007 revenues 
increased by 34%.”
... with net fee income up by 22% and... 9
bid teams together with central 
resourcing units. These support 
the growth of our businesses and 
will allow us to maximise on sales 
opportunities and give customers 
both a high level of support as 
well as provide a central basis for 
efﬁ cient candidate supply.
In order to implement best 
practice and to get maximum 
economies of scale we have 
now completed the creation 
of our centralised Finance, 
Administration and IT functions. 
As well as the obvious symbiotic 
beneﬁ ts this offers we have the 
capacity to absorb further volume 
in these functions with minimal 
increase in our operating costs. 
We have also centralised our HR 
and Marketing functions, which 
allows us to quickly support 
new brands in a co-ordinated 
corporate manner and also to 
integrate any acquired companies 
efﬁ ciently.
Through the course of 2007 
we have used these efﬁ ciency 
savings in the support functions 
to help fund the investment in 
our front ofﬁ ce sales capacity. By 
a combination of both organic 
growth and acquisition we will 
exit 2007 with a net increase of 
in excess of 250 additional sales 
staff worldwide compared to 
December 2006.
OUTLOOK 2008
During 2007 we achieved a 
robust ﬁ nancial performance 
whilst putting in place both the 
strategy and management team 
required to deliver a sustainable 
improvement in performance.
With the Group increasingly 
diversiﬁ ed by both geography 
and market segment and a strong 
business in temporary/contract 
stafﬁ ng, we believe that Spring 
is well placed with its healthy 
balance sheet and solid trading 
to enjoy further growth both 
organically and by acquisition.
2008 has started as 2007 ﬁ nished 
with continuing improvement in 
key performance indicators for 
all of our businesses. With many 
of our new staff still to reach 
full productivity and with our 
ambitious growth plans, we are 
conﬁ dent that we can continue 
to deliver sustainable, proﬁ table 
growth.

INCOME STATEMENT
Revenue
In 2007 the Group generated 
revenues from continuing 
operations of £432.8 million 
(2006: £407.3 million), of which 
£48.1 million were generated 
from the acquisition of Glotel. 
Gross Proﬁ t (Net Fee Income)
The gross margin of the business 
continued to improve to 13.0% 
(2006: 11.2%), with net fee 
income from operations up by 
£10.3 million to £56.1 million 
(2006: £45.8 million). The net fee 
income of Glotel for the 5 months 
since acquisition amounted to 
£8.3 million with a gross margin 
of 17.3% for the period. The 
underlying gross margin for the 
business has improved from 
11.2% in 2006 to 12.4% in 2007.
Operating Proﬁ t
Overall, the Group generated an 
operating proﬁ t of £5.9 million 
from continuing operations, a 
£1.3 million improvement against 
the prior year (2006: £4.6 million). 
The 2007 result includes £0.5 
million of non-recurring costs 
associated with the integration of 
Glotel, and hence excluding these 
costs the operating proﬁ t would 
have increased by £1.8 million to 
£6.4 million.
The acquisition of Glotel has 
contributed £1.2 million to 
operating proﬁ t for the 5 months 
since acquisition. However, 
the overall contribution to the 
Group proﬁ t before tax is less 
marked when interest that would 
have been earned on the cash 
deposits utilised to acquire Glotel 
is considered. The lost interest 
would amount to approximately 
£0.6 million.
Net Interest
The Group continues to focus 
on the management and 
improvement of working capital. 
Over the course of the last 
three years the Group has made 
efforts to improve its intra-
month net cash position with 
the consequence of moving from 
incurring interest expense of £0.6 
million in 2004 to generating net 
interest income of £1.2 million in 
2007 (2006: £0.8 million). Such 
has been the Group’s success 
in improving working capital 
management that sufﬁ cient free 
cash was generated to enable the 
Group to fund the acquisition of 
Glotel without recourse to debt 
ﬁ nance. On 24 July 2007 there 
was a £30.8 million cash outﬂ ow 
associated with the acquisition 
of Glotel, and as a consequence, 
interest income in the second half 
of 2007 was reduced. Interest 
income will also be down during 
2008 whilst this cash outﬂ ow 
associated with the acquisition is 
replenished. 
Non-recurring Items
As mentioned above, the 
Group’s operating proﬁ t includes 
£0.5 million of non recurring costs 
associated with the integration 
of the support functions of 
Glotel into Spring. There are 
no exceptional charges or 
discontinued businesses in the 
income statement in 2007. 
Taxation
The taxation charge for the year is 
£1.1 million and the effective rate

is 15.8%, (2006: £0.6 million, 
effective rate 10.4%) reﬂ ecting 
the continuing availability of UK 
trading losses. Going forward the 
effective rate will continue to rise 
as UK trading losses are utilised 
and an increasing proportion of 
the Group’s proﬁ ts will arise in 
overseas territories with higher 
marginal rates of tax.
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND 
DIVIDEND
Basic and diluted earnings per 
share were 3.76p and 3.74p per 
share respectively, (2006: basic 
and diluted 3.08p). The weighted 
average number of shares in issue 
in the year was 162,250,076 
(2006: 160,890,853).
A ﬁ nal dividend of 0.2p (2006: 
0.2p) has been proposed, which 
together with the interim dividend 
of 0.1p (2006: 0.1p) makes the 
total dividend for the year 0.3p 
(2006: 0.3p). The ﬁ nal dividend, 
which is subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 30 May 
2008 to those shareholders on the 
register at 9 May 2008.
BALANCE SHEET
The Group had net assets of 
£83.1 million at 31 December 
2007 (2006: £74.7 million) of 
which £39.7 million (2006: 
£51.2 million) is represented 
by cash. The acquisition of 
Glotel has had a signiﬁ cant 
impact on our net assets and 
cash balances during the year. 
Despite the net cash outﬂ ow 
of £30.8 million associated 
with the acquisition of Glotel 
our year on year cash balance 
only decreased by £11.5m, 
highlighting the continuing 
positive cash generation in the 
business. The increase in net 
assets relates principally to the 
Glotel acquisition and the proﬁ t 
generated in the year. Capital 
expenditure, totalled £1.8 
million (2006: £2.2 million). 
The main driver for our capital 
expenditure relates to investments 
in IT systems and in particular 
the renewal of front and back-
ofﬁ ce systems with other capital 
expenditure relating to the 
continued refurbishment of the 
ofﬁ ce portfolio.
During the course of 2007, 
further revisions to the Group’s 
front ofﬁ ce and ﬁ nancial systems 
were completed. These changes, 
coupled with the re-organisation 
of the Group’s support functions 
into one single location in 
Birmingham, provide the UK 
business with a scaleable business 
support model.
CASH FLOW
During the year the Group 
generated a cash ﬂ ow from 
operating activities of £19.9 
million (2006: £14.0 million). 
After the £30.8 million cash 
outﬂ ow associated with the 
acquisition of Glotel net cash 
balances were £35.0 million 
at 31 December 2007 
(2006: £46.9 million).

STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTORS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW COMBINED CODE OF BEST PRACTICE
The Board supports the provisions within the new Combined Code (the “Code”) published in July 2003 and updated in 
June 2006 and remains committed towards achieving compliance.
There were no changes in the year in respect of the Board’s membership. Amir Eilon, who was independent upon 
appointment as Director in 2005, continues as Chairman of the Board. Andrew Pinder continues as senior independent 
Non-Executive Director, the other independent Non-Executive Director being Jonathan Wright. As per the requirements 
of the Group’s subscription agreement, the Group’s largest shareholder ET Training LLC is represented at Board level by 
two Directors, Steven Fink and Adam Cohn. The two Executive Directors, Peter Searle (Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer) and Peter 
Darraugh (Group Finance Director) complete the Board. 
The membership of the Board Committees has also remained stable and unchanged. The Nomination Committee 
comprises of three members: Amir Eilon (Chair), Andrew Pinder and Jonathan Wright. The Audit Committee comprises 
of three members: Steven Fink (Chair), Andrew Pinder and Jonathan Wright. The Remuneration Committee comprises of 
three members: Andrew Pinder (Chair), Amir Eilon and Jonathan Wright.
The Board has continued to hold regular monthly Board meetings. At the end of each monthly Board meeting, the 
Chairman holds a subsequent meeting with the Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present (thus 
ensuring compliance under provision A1.3). During 2007, the Chairman has continued to drive greater focus on internal 
control, shareholder communication and Director performance appraisal; there is now a formal annual appraisal of the 
Board and its committees and as such the Group is now in full compliance with provision A6.1 of the Code.
THE BOARD
The key objective of the Board is to represent shareholders’ interests on maintaining and growing a successful business 
and optimising long-term returns. To achieve this, the Board comprises individuals who can bring relevant skills and 
knowledge to the beneﬁ t of the Group.
The Company considers both Steven Fink and Adam Cohn to be non-independent under the provisions of the Code. 
Both represent a signiﬁ cant shareholder (ET Training LLC) and Steven Fink has been on the Board for over nine years 
since ﬁ rst election. The Company considers both Andrew Pinder and Jonathan Wright to be independent under the 
provisions of the Code. The Board has noted that Andrew Pinder is a participant in the 2006 all-employee savings-related 
share option scheme and has a small interest in the ordinary shares of the Company, details given on page 23, however, 
they do not consider this impedes his independence. The Group has taken steps to ensure that it will not allow Non-
Executive Directors to participate in all-employee savings-related share option schemes in the future without ﬁ rst taking 
independent legal advice in respect to the impact that this has under the Code currently in force. There were no related 
grants of share options in 2007.
Due to Steven Fink’s continued Chairmanship of the Audit Committee, the Company did not comply with provision C3.1 
of the Code throughout the year under review. However the Company continues to believe that Mr Fink’s considerable 
knowledge and experience in audit matters, and also his representative position for the major shareholder of the 
Company, fully justiﬁ es his continued participation in the Audit Committee.
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out on page 28. Overleaf is a brief 
description of the role of the Board and its committees followed by a statement regarding the Group’s system of internal 
control and a statement on going concern.

THE WORKINGS OF THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES 
THE BOARD 
At 31 December 2007 the Board comprised the Chairman, four Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors. The 
Board has two Non-Executive Directors representing the Group’s largest shareholder, ET Training LLC, Steven Fink and 
Adam Cohn, two independent Non-Executive Directors, Andrew Pinder and Jonathan Wright, Amir Eilon as Chairman 
and two Executive Directors, Peter Searle as Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Peter Darraugh as Group Finance Director. The 
Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. It meets regularly, reviewing trading 
performance, setting and monitoring strategy and examining major capital expenditure and acquisition opportunities. 
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board, which includes determining the strategy and 
control of the Group, approval of ﬁ nancial reporting controls, oversight of the Group’s internal controls, approval of 
capital and revenue expenditure of a signiﬁ cant size, acquisitions, disposals and share dealings, Board membership and 
appointments, corporate governance matters and approval of Group policies and risk management strategies.
The Board operates subject to and in accordance with an Executive Instructions document, containing provisions set 
down in accordance with good corporate governance. The Executive Instructions are available upon request and cover the 
following:
 Schedule of matters reserved to the Board and delegated ﬁ nancial authority limits
 Summary of the Group structure, including summaries of the role of the Board, its Committees, the Chairman, the 
CEO and the Non-Executive Directors
 T erms of Reference for the Nomination Committee, Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee
 Delegation of Routine Business to the Group Finance Director
 Role and purpose of subsidiary Board and management committees
All new Directors of the company are provided with an induction conducted by the Chairman of the Board, Amir Eilon, 
assisted by the Executive Directors. Such induction includes information on the Group’s history and current structure, the 
industry in which the Group operates, and invariably includes introductions and meetings with members of the Group’s 
senior management team. 
The Chairman ensures that all Directors are properly briefed on issues considered at Board meetings and, to enable 
them properly to discharge their duties, all Directors receive accurate and clear information in a timely manner. This 
includes detailed brieﬁ ngs on all matters where the Board is required to make a decision or give its approval, together 
with regular reports on such matters as the trading performance and outlook. Further to suggestions and comments 
made by Non-Executive Directors and Chairman, the Executive Directors changed the format of Board presentations to 
ensure that the documentation submitted at meetings provided greater visibility of the performance of the Group looking 
forward, as opposed to a retrospective view of the previous month’s results. Speciﬁ c business presentations from senior 
management and others are given where appropriate, thereby ensuring the Directors continually update their knowledge 
of, and familiarity with, the Group. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the roles of the Chairman, 
who is responsible for the effective operation of the Board, and the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, who is responsible for the 
management of the Group’s day-to-day activities. No individual has unfettered powers of decision and no one individual 
or small group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision-making processes.
Each Director is subject to an annual review and appraisal and the Chairman conducts a formal performance 
measurement of the Board as a whole and its Committees. The ﬁ rst such performance appraisal, which was conducted 
on a self-assessment basis, took place in October 2007 and was approved in December 2007.

The following committees deal with speciﬁ c aspects of the Group’s affairs: 
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
As at 31 December 2007, the Audit Committee comprised three Non-Executive Directors: Andrew Pinder, Jonathan 
Wright and Steven Fink as Chairman. The Board considers that Steven Fink has the recent and relevant ﬁ nancial 
experience as required by provision C3.1 of the Code. The Audit Committee meets not less than twice annually. 
The committee provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s auditors. By invitation, the meetings are also attended by 
other Directors. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of ﬁ nancial matters including the half-year and annual 
accounts before their submission to the Board and for monitoring the controls that are in force to ensure the integrity of 
the ﬁ nancial information reported to the shareholders. 
Its remit includes a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal ﬁ nancial control, based on information 
received from both internal and external sources including the quarterly internal control and risk assessment report. In 
addition, the Audit Committee receives assurance annually from the heads of all operating units as to the adequacy of 
controls in their respective operations through internal control questionnaires. The Audit Committee has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal ﬁ nancial control as it operated during the period and reported its conclusions to the 
Board. The committee is also responsible for actioning the recommendations of the Board arising from its review of the 
internal control and risk assessment report. 
The committee remit also includes a review of the scope, results, cost effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors, in respect of both audit and non-audit services. During the year the committee completed an evaluation 
of the external auditors and concluded that they were sufﬁ ciently independent, objective and effective in undertaking the 
audit process. Spring Group plc adopts a policy specifying the criteria for the independence of and services to be provided 
by the external auditor. The policy provides a description of the services to be provided by the external auditor and it 
deﬁ nes criteria for approval when non-audit fees will exceed predeﬁ ned amounts. The committee also advises the Board 
on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration. 
In addition, the committee reviews arrangements for answering staff concerns over improprieties, should these arise, 
ensuring that procedures are in place for appropriate investigation and follow up.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
As at 31 December 2007, the Remuneration Committee comprised the Chairman of the Board and two Non-Executive 
Directors: Amir Eilon, Jonathan Wright and Andrew Pinder as Chairman. The committee is responsible for recommending 
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE – at 31 December 2007 CONTINUED 17
the contract terms, remuneration and other beneﬁ ts for executive and Non-Executive Directors, and performance-related 
bonus schemes for Executive Directors and other members of the senior management team. 
The report of the Board on Directors’ remuneration, which includes details of the Directors’ remuneration and Directors’ 
interests in options, together with information on service contracts, is set out on pages 19 to 23.
It should be noted that remuneration for Non-Executive Directors does not include share options; Non-Executive Directors 
are now not allowed to participate in the Company’s all-employee savings-related (Sharesave) option scheme without the 
Group ﬁ rst taking independent legal advice as to the impact this has in respect of compliance with the Code currently in 
force. Andrew Pinder is a participant in the 2006 Sharesave scheme, before the decision to prevent potential participation 
by Non-Executive Directors was made. To this extent the Company is not in full compliance with provision B1.3 of the 
Code, however steps have been taken to mitigate against this in future.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
As at 31 December 2007, the Nomination Committee comprised three Non-Executive Directors: Andrew Pinder, Jonathan 
Wright and Amir Eilon as Chairman. The committee is responsible for recommending to the full Board candidates for 
appointment to both executive and Non-Executive Board Director positions. This process includes reviewing the Board 
composition, skills, knowledge and experience, and nominating candidates on the basis of merit and objective criteria. 
It also ensures that the procedures for the appointment of new Directors are formal, rigorous and transparent and that 
there is an orderly succession for appointments to the Board. External professional advice is taken regarding each new 
Board appointment. 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The purpose of the Executive Committee is to consider and decide upon any matter in respect of acquisitions/disposals, 
unbudgeted capital expenditure, property transactions, litigation with potential settlement costs, and ﬁ nancial facilities 
requiring the grant of security, which involves sums in excess of the authority limits set down for the Executive Directors, 
but less than the sums required for full Board consideration and approval. The Executive Committee members, which 
must include at least one Executive Director and one Non-Executive Director, are as nominated by the full Board from time 
to time to deal with speciﬁ c matters.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. The Chairman’ s statement, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’ s and Group 
Finance Director’ s reviews on pages 4 to 11 include a review of the business and future developments. There is regular dialogue 
with institutional investors including presentations after the Company’ s preliminary announcement of the year end results 
and at the half year. The Chairman arranges for the Directors to receive regular reports on shareholders’ views to ensure the 
Board develops an understanding of the matters of concern to the major shareholders. The Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director is available to answer any shareholder concerns that are unable to be resolved through regular channels.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their 
participation. Details of resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2008 can be found in the 
Notice of Meeting on pages 82 and 83. 
INTERNAL CONTROL 
Following the publication of the recommendations of The Turnbull Committee on 27 September 1999, as updated in 
2005, the Board adopted processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group. 
These processes include the review by the Board on a semi-annual basis of an internal control and risk assessment report, 
to allow it to report on internal. Management and the Executive Directors are responsible for ensuring the completeness 
and accuracy of this report on a continuous basis. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst 
the role of management is to implement Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal controls is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives. In pursuing these objectives internal 
controls can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. This process, 
which includes a whistle-blowing policy, is in accordance with the Turnbull guidance, and has been in place for the 
ﬁ nancial period and up to the date the accounts were approved. 
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE – at 31 December 2007 CONTINUED 18
The key procedures that the Directors have established with a view to providing effective internal ﬁ nancial control are 
as follows: 
Management structure 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is a formal schedule of matters speciﬁ cally reserved for its 
decision, thus ensuring that it maintains control over appropriate strategic, ﬁ nancial, operational, risk management and 
compliance issues. The size of the Group and its management style ensure the involvement in and knowledge of the 
activities of each operating division by at least one member of the Board. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Andrew Pinder. The Board has access to the services of Gavin Tagg, the 
Group Legal Counsel and Company Secretary, and independent professional advice, if required.
Quarterly authorisation review
On a quarterly basis, a committee comprising the Group Finance Director, the Company Secretary, the Assistant Company 
Secretary, the Group Financial Controller and Group Internal Audit Manager, meet to discuss and agree the current 
authorisations within the Group. At this meeting, there is a formal sign off process in respect of all employees in respect 
of authority to sign off expenses and purchase orders to ﬁ xed limits, authority to sign contracts on behalf of the Group’s 
trading companies, Group signatories for company bank accounts, and all employees who are considered to be subject to 
the Model Code by virtue of their position and access to information in the Group. 
Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget, the components of which form the ﬁ nancial objectives for individual 
operating divisions. Key risk areas are identiﬁ ed. Performance against these objectives is monitored and relevant action 
taken throughout the year through the regular reporting to the Board of variances from the budget, updated forecasts for 
the year and information on the key risk areas. 
Group procedures manual 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of the Group procedures manual, which sets out 
delegation of authority and authorisation levels and other control procedures, together with accounting and reporting 
procedures. The manual is updated regularly.
Following the acquisition of Glotel in 2007, the Group procedures manual has been rolled out to all areas of the Glotel 
business, with an emphasis upon enshrining the principles of prudent control procedures throughout the global business. 
This process was commenced shortly after acquisition and the Board will continue to establish this process in consultation 
with the management teams in the USA and Asia Paciﬁ c. 
Internal audit 
The Group internal audit function reports to the Group Finance Director and monitors the effectiveness of key internal 
controls and compliance with the Group procedures manual. The Board utilises the internal audit function to assist the 
Board in the preparation of a risk and internal control memorandum, embedded within existing control systems and 
updated on a regular basis, to monitor and formally report to the Board the Group’s compliance with the Code.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts.

INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AND ADVISERS 
As at 31 December 2007, the Remuneration Committee comprised the Chairman of the Board and two Non-Executive 
Directors; Amir Eilon, Jonathan Wright and Andrew Pinder as Chairman. The Remuneration Committee appointed by 
the Board, recommends, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors, 
Non-Executive Directors, Senior Executives and the Company Chairman. The Remuneration Committee has retained New 
Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC) who are Independent Executive Remuneration Consultants, as its principal advisers 
and takes advice from them from time to time in relation to executive remuneration matters and, in particular, in relation 
to the Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration is that the overall remuneration package should be sufﬁ ciently 
competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving the Group’s objectives and thereby 
enhancing shareholder value. 
The package consists of basic salary, beneﬁ ts, performance related bonuses, share options, Long-Term Incentive Plan and 
pension contributions, with a signiﬁ cant proportion based on performance and dependent upon the achievement of 
demanding targets. 
A summary of each element of the remuneration package is set out below: 
BASIC SALARY AND BENEFITS 
Basic salary and fees are determined after taking account of each Director’s responsibilities and seniority, and of 
market salary levels for similar jobs in comparable companies based on independent surveys. The committee also takes 
independent specialist advice in relation to salaries, bonuses and longer-term incentives. Basic salaries are reviewed 
annually taking account of both Group and individual performance. Any future salary increases will reﬂ ect changes in the 
market, average increases for Group Executives and general pay and conditions within the Group. 
Beneﬁ ts (normally car, pension and life, disability and health insurance) are set at a level comparable with those granted 
to executives at a similar level in peer companies. 
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board, reﬂ ect time commitment and responsibilities for each 
role (including Committee responsibilities) and are reviewed periodically. Only one of the two Non-Executive nominees of 
ET Training LLC receives fees in respect of his services.
Part of Amir Eilon’s fee is speciﬁ cally allocated for the purchase of shares in the Company, under the terms of his letter 
of appointment. Under the terms of this agreement, a ﬁ xed monthly sum is allocated for the purchase of new ordinary 
shares of 10p each in the Company, on the ﬁ nal working day of each month, at the prevailing mid-market price. This 
arrangement is permitted in accordance with Section 17 of the Model Code of the FSA Listing Rules.
BONUSES 
Directors’ bonuses are discretionary and based on Group and individual performance. They are structured to enable the 
Executives to increase their basic earnings on the achievement of predetermined performance related targets set for the 
development of the Group. The maximum potential bonus payable for the Executive Directors in any one year is 200% of 
basic salary. The committee believes that exceptional performance deserves appropriate reward.
SHARE OPTIONS 
The Company has a number of approved and unapproved executive share option schemes, the details of which are 
provided in note 11 to the accounts. Grants are now only made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the all-employee 
savings-related share option scheme.
Directors are eligible to join the savings-related share option scheme on the same terms as other employees. Options 
under the savings related share option scheme are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of shares at the date 
of invitation.

REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION  20
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
Awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), which was approved by the shareholders at the 2006 AGM, 
were made in March, May, June and October 2007. Individuals may receive an award of conditional nil-cost shares with 
a face value of up to 200% of salary in any ﬁ nancial year, vesting after three years from grant, subject to achievement of 
performance conditions and continued employment (“Awards”). In addition, the LTIP has the ﬂ exibility to allow Awards 
above the normal maximum in one-off exceptional circumstances, such as a senior recruitment, up to 300% of basic salary.
The committee determined performance conditions prior to each Award, with performance measured over a single period 
of at least three-years with no provision to re-test.
For the 2007 Awards, there were two separate performance conditions, each applying to a proportion of an Award. 
1. The performance condition attached to 50% of the Award was based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
performance measured against a bespoke group of comparator companies as detailed below. 30% of this part of 
the Award will vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile 
performance (i.e. between 15% (for median) and 50% (for upper quartile performance) of the total Award).
2. The performance condition attached to the other 50% of the Award was based on a range of cumulative pre-tax EPS 
targets to be achieved over the three ﬁ nancial years from grant. 30% of this part of the Award will vest for cumulative 
pre-tax EPS in 2007, 2008 and 2009 of 14.8 pence, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting for cumulative 
pre-tax EPS of 27.6 pence in 2007, 2008 and 2009 (i.e. between 15% (for cumulative three-year pre-tax EPS of 14.8 
pence) and 50% (for cumulative three-year pre-tax EPS of 27.6 pence) of the total Award). Pre-tax EPS targets will be 
reviewed at the time of the initial grant for appropriateness but will be no less demanding.
The TSR comparator group for the 2007 awards consists of the following: Corporate Services Group plc, Glotel Plc, Harvey 
Nash Group plc, Hays plc, Imprint plc, Michael Page International Plc, Nestor Healthcare Group Plc, Northern Recruitment 
Group plc, OPD Group Plc, Parity Group plc, Penna Consulting Plc, Quantica plc, Robert Walters Plc, SThree plc, and 
Whitehead Mann Group Plc.
The committee considered that the EPS and TSR were the most appropriate measures of performance for the 2007 
awards for the following reasons:
 The TSR performance condition will provide a balance to the ﬁ nancial performance condition by rewarding relative 
stock market/peer group performance and ensure that a share price-based discipline in the package (in the absence of 
options) is retained.
 The EPS targets will provide a familiar and clear line of sight for Senior Executives to improve what is a key measure for 
the Company’s future long-term success. Targets will also be straightforward to communicate and evaluate.
 The combined use of TSR and EPS produces a balance of performance conditions by rewarding relative peer group 
performance and absolute earnings.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINE
Following the introduction of the LTIP , shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors and Senior Executives have been 
adopted, linked to the out-turn of the Plan. At the time that Awards vest under the LTIP (or any other executive plan 
established in the future), individuals will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares until such time as a 
shareholding equivalent to 100% of basic salary has been achieved.
PENSIONS
The Company makes contributions to personal pension arrangements.
TERMS OF APPOINTMENT AND SERVICE CONTRACTS

Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
DIRECTORS’ REPORT – as at 31 December 2007 25
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT 
The Group recognises that its competitive advantage depends upon the quality and motivation of the people it employs. 
Its employment policies, including the commitment to equal opportunity, are designed to attract, retain and motivate high 
calibre employees regardless of sex, age, race, religion, sexual orientation or disability. 
The Group considers that effective employee communications are particularly important and it is committed to promoting 
the involvement of all its employees in the Group’s business aims and performance. During the year the Group continued 
to operate its employee forum “Spring Round Table” which has employee representatives from all parts of the Group. 
The Spring Round Table met twice during the year and discussed Group performance, with the aim of achieving a 
common awareness on the part of all employees of the ﬁ nancial and economic factors affecting the performance of the 
Group, new developments and many other issues of importance to all employees. Through both the Spring Round Table 
and other forums Spring has actively consulted employees on a regular basis, so that the views of employees can be 
taken into account in making decisions which are likely to affect their interests. Spring has encouraged the involvement of 
employees in the Group’s performance through regular participatory all-employee savings-related share option schemes, 
the most recent being offered in October 2007.
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the requirements of the 
job can be adequately fulﬁ lled by a handicapped or disabled person. 
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy wherever practicable to provide continuing 
employment under normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career development and promotion to 
disabled employees wherever appropriate. 
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY 
By nature of its business as a stafﬁ ng service company, Spring believes that its business activities have a minimal impact on 
the environment. Nonetheless, Spring recognises its responsibility to achieve good environmental practice and to continue 
to strive for improvement in its environmental impact. In the execution of this policy Spring will ensure that, wherever 
possible, it will actively pursue measures to promote energy conservation and minimise waste within its business, and 
that any waste consumable materials are recycled or disposed of in a manner most suitable to reduce any impact on the 
natural environment. Spring complies with, and shall continue to endeavour to exceed, all laws and regulations relating 
to the environment. Spring actively encourages all staff to participate in the implementation of this policy and encourages 
all suppliers of consumable products and materials to be environmentally friendly, where practicable. Furthermore, in 
order to ensure our environmental policies are in-line with best practice, the Group will be working toward ISO 14001 
accreditation in 2008. 
TREASURY
The Group’s policies in respect of treasury management are as follows: 
Financing 
Working capital ﬁ nance for day-to-day requirements is provided through operating cash generation supported by short-
term overdraft and loan facilities totalling £40.0 million at 31 December 2007 with high quality UK banks. Funding for 
the Group’s smaller overseas operations is provided by equity paid for from UK cash resources. The overseas operations 
use a combination of local currency cash converted from equity consideration and sterling intercompany balances for 
working capital purposes. For the Group’s larger overseas operations the working capital is funded through existing cash 
balances from trading and where necessary bank overdraft facilities. 
The Board monitors the Group’s ﬁ nancing through its regular review of trading performance and authorises all 
signiﬁ cant transactions. 
Acquisitions, where relevant, are ﬁ nanced using a mixture of equity, available cash resources and ﬂ oating rate loan notes.
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
DIRECTORS’ REPORT – as at 31 December 2007 CONTINUED 26
Interest rates 
The Group’s policy is to minimise interest charges. This is largely achieved by effective working capital management to 
ensure the debt levels are minimal and through the pooling arrangements and balance offsets within the UK.
Additional information for shareholders
The following provides the additional information required for shareholders as a result of the implementation of the 
Takeovers Directive into UK Law. At 31 December 2007, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 164,176,342 
ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities and for voting rights. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every holder of ordinary shares present in person and entitled 
to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every member present in person, or by proxy and entitled to vote, shall have 
one vote for every ordinary share held. The notice of the general meeting on page 82 speciﬁ es deadlines for exercising 
voting rights either by proxy notice, present in person or by proxy in relation to resolutions to be passed at the Annual 
General Meeting. All proxy votes are counted and the numbers for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution are 
announced at the Annual General Meeting and published on the company’s website after the meeting.
Foreign currency and hedging 
The Group has working capital and funding balances denominated in foreign currency. 
A proportion of trading activity is denominated in non-local currency, predominantly US Dollars or Euros; the Group 
looks to match the currency of the costs to that of the contracted revenue. Non-local currency assets are matched 
with equivalent currency liabilities with similar maturities. Where contracts involve signiﬁ cant net revenue or costs in 
non-local currency, the Group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk arising through the use of forward currency

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors’ Report on page 24. The Group’s ﬁ nancial 
statements of Spring Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 27 February 2008 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Amir Eilon and Peter 
Darraugh. Spring Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales. The 
Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The Group’s ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the ﬁ nancial statements of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2007 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The accounting policies which follow 
set out those policies which apply in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The Group ﬁ nancial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 
(£000) except when otherwise indicated.
The Group ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on a historic cost basis, except for derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies are set out below:
Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the Company and of each of its subsidiaries in which the 
Company directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights or otherwise controls. The ﬁ nancial statements 
of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidation have been prepared in accordance with 
uniform accounting policies pursuant to IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and separate ﬁ nancial statements’. During the 
consolidation, receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies are fully eliminated, as are intragroup 
income and expenses. Income and expenses of the Company relate primarily to the provision of shared services such 
as IT, Finance, Legal, HR and Marketing on behalf of subsidiary companies. Also certain Group companies provide 
contractors or temporary staff to other members of the Group either for internal use or for generating sales revenue. 
Signiﬁ cant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of 
contingent liabilities at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future.
In the process of applying the Group’ s accounting policies, management has made the following judgment, apart from 
those involving estimations, which has the most signiﬁ cant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements.
Property provisions
The Group has a number of leasehold properties with varying lease periods. Where a leasehold property becomes 
vacant, management make judgements, estimates and assumptions regarding the expected vacant period and 
potential for sublet and, where appropriate, include a provision for the vacant period. Management review the 
property provisions periodically with respect to the likely future cost of leasehold premises.
Share options
The Group operates a number of share incentive schemes as detailed in note 11. In order to calculate the annual 
charge in accordance with IFRS 2 management are required to make a number of assumptions particularly regarding 
the expected employee attrition rate and the likelihood of performance conditions being met. The accounting policy 
in relation to share options is set out below.
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 35
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Deferred tax
In applying the Group’s accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, management are required to 
make assumptions regarding the Group’s ability to utilise historical trading losses. A deferred tax asset is recognised 
to the extent that management expect the Group’s future proﬁ ts to utilise historical trading losses.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash generating units to which the goodwill and other intangible have been allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires the Group to estimate the future cash ﬂ ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Acquisitions and disposals
The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date of 
acquisition and accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The results of disposed subsidiaries are 
included in the Consolidated Income Statement up to the date of disposal. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. These 
intangible assets consist of purchased brands, customer and candidate lists, goodwill arising on acquisition and 
purchased or internally generated software that is capable of being transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. 
Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this cost will be the fair value allocated in 
the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than through a business combination, the initial 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis as disclosed in note 13. The estimated 
useful life of the assets is reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for 
prospectively. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with ﬁ nite lives is recognised in the income statement in 
the administrative expenses category consistent with the function of the asset.
These intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value 
of the consideration given over the net fair value of identiﬁ able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised 
in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not amortised in 
accordance with IFRS 3, however, it is reviewed for impairment annually and in other periods if changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 30 April 1998 and earlier periods was written off to reserves in 
accordance with the accounting standard then in force. As required by IFRS 1 the goodwill previously written off to 
reserves has not been reinstated on the Balance Sheet. On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the 
attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves shall not be included in determining the proﬁ t or 
loss on disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on these assets, other than freehold land, 
on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its 
expected useful life as follows: 
Freehold property – 50 years  Leasehold improvements – over the lease term
Furniture and IT equipment – 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles – 4 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 36
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the ﬁ nancial statements, with the following exceptions:
1. Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable proﬁ t or loss;
2. In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future; and
3. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ t will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. 
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.  
Leased assets 
Group as a lessee
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and beneﬁ ts incidental to ownership of the 
leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the ﬁ nance charges and 
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and beneﬁ ts of ownership of the asset are classiﬁ ed as 
operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.  
Group as a lessor
Leases where the Group retains substantially all the risks and beneﬁ ts of ownership of the asset are classiﬁ ed as 
operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of 
the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources embodying economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision 
to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Income 
Statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁ c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in 
the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest cost.
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 37
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents proceeds from services performed, less discounts and sales tax. Revenue from temporary and 
contract assignments is recognised when services are performed, based on hours worked by the temporary or 
contract candidates placed by the Group. Revenue from permanent placements is recognised:
1. In-line with contractual terms, for contingent assignments this will be either the date on which the applicant 
accepts an offer in writing or when they commence the employment;
2. In-line with completion of speciﬁ c milestones, for retained assignments; or
3. In-line with performance, for revenue arising from the provision of other services. 
If the individual fails to continue in employment for a period of time speciﬁ ed in the placement agreement, generally 
an 8 to 10 week period, the Group may not be entitled to collect the entire placement fee. Revenue from permanent 
placements is shown in the Income Statement net of estimated refunds. Estimated refunds are based on historic 
experience of placed candidates not remaining in employment for a minimum required period.  
Revenue relating to the provision of project solutions to clients, whereby the contracted revenue is ﬁ xed at the outset of 
the contract, is recognised in the accounting period in which services are rendered, by reference to the stage of completion 
of the speciﬁ c transaction. Contracts are continually reviewed for proﬁ tability and if it is probable that contract costs 
will exceed contract revenue on any speciﬁ c contract, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Employee beneﬁ ts 
The Group operates a deﬁ ned contribution pension scheme for certain Spring Group employees. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds administered by independent trustees. Contributions to 
the scheme are charged to the Income Statement as incurred. All other short-term employee beneﬁ ts are charged to 
the Income Statement in the period in which the employee renders the service.
Foreign currencies 
Items included in the ﬁ nancial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All differences arising are taken to the Income Statement. 
Pursuant to IAS 21 ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’ the results of overseas subsidiary undertakings 
are treated as “foreign operations”. Assets and liabilities outstanding at the period end are translated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, whilst expenses and income are translated at the average rate of 
exchange for the year. The resulting currency translation differences are taken directly to a separate component of 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular 
foreign operation is transferred to the Income Statement. Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign 
operations are deemed to be zero as at 1 January 2004.
Employee share option schemes 
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’).
Equity-settled transactions
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments. In accordance with transitional provisions, IFRS 2 
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which 
they are granted. The fair value of all equity-settled transactions is determined using the Black-Scholes model with 
the exception of the LTIP , which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the 
shares of Spring Group plc (‘market conditions’).

Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 38
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Employee share option schemes (continued)
Equity-settled transactions (continued)
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period 
in which the performance conditions are fulﬁ lled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully 
entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reﬂ ects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of 
equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Group and based on the best available estimate at that 
date, will ultimately vest. The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon 
a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁ ed, 
provided that all other vesting conditions are satisﬁ ed.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁ ed, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modiﬁ ed. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of 
the modiﬁ cation, as measured at the date of modiﬁ cation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any 
expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for 
the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new 
awards are treated as if they were a modiﬁ cation of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reﬂ ected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable 
options to Executives and senior employees. Shares in the Company held by the employee share trust are treated as 
own shares and presented in the Balance Sheet as a deduction from equity.
Finance income and charges
Interest income and expense are recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
Cash 
Cash in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and overnight deposits.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash as deﬁ ned 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities carried on the Balance Sheet include cash and trade and other receivables and 
liabilities and loans. The accounting policies on recognition and measurement for these items are disclosed in the 
relevant accounting policies found in these notes. Financial instruments are classiﬁ ed as assets, liabilities or equity 
in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Interest, dividends, gains and losses relating to 
ﬁ nancial instruments classiﬁ ed as assets or liabilities are reported as expense or income, unless they qualify for hedge 
accounting. Financial instruments are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to 
settle either on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liabilities simultaneously. All loans and borrowings are 
initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a ﬁ nancial asset or group of ﬁ nancial assets is impaired. If 
there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount 
of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash ﬂ ows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the ﬁ nancial 
asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognised in 
proﬁ t or loss.
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 39
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed, 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. Any 
subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in proﬁ t or loss.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the 
probability of insolvency or signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all 
of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through 
use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments such as foreign currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with 
foreign currency ﬂ uctuations. Such derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are stated at fair value. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for 
contracts with similar maturity proﬁ les. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁ ed as cash ﬂ ow hedges where they hedge exposure to 
variability in cash ﬂ ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a 
highly probable forecast transaction.
In relation to cash ﬂ ow hedges (forward foreign currency contracts) which meet the conditions for special hedge 
accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net proﬁ t or loss.
When the hedged highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non ﬁ nancial asset or a liability, 
then, at the time the non ﬁ nancial asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously 
been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount 
of the non ﬁ nancial asset or liability. For all other cash ﬂ ow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity 
are transferred to the Income Statement in the same year in which the hedged highly probable forecast transaction 
affects the net proﬁ t or loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are 
taken directly to net proﬁ t or loss for the year.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no 
longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net proﬁ t or loss for the year.
New standards and interpretations 
Applied
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year. Adoption of 
these revised standards and interpretations did not have any effect on the ﬁ nancial performance or position of the 
Group. They did however give rise to additional disclosures, including in some cases, revisions to accounting policies:

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
New standards and interpretations (continued)
Applied (continued)
The principal effects of these changes were as follows:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
This standard requires disclosures that enable users of the ﬁ nancial statements to evaluate the signiﬁ cance of the 
Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments and the nature and extent of risks arising from those ﬁ nancial instruments. The new 
disclosures are included throughout the ﬁ nancial statements. While there has been no effect on the ﬁ nancial position 
or results, comparative information has been revised where needed. These new disclosures are shown in Note 15.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
This amendment requires the Group to make new disclosures to enable users of the ﬁ nancial statements to evaluate 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital. These new disclosures are shown in Note 25.
Not applied
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁ nancial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have 
not been applied in these ﬁ nancial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
International Accounting Standards (IAS / IFRSs) Effective date

IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 –  The Limit on a Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Asset, Minimum Funding
 Requirements and their Interaction
The principal effects of these changes are as follows:
IFRS 2 Amendment to IFRS 2 – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
The amendment to IFRS 2 restricts the deﬁ nition of vesting conditions to include only service conditions (requiring 
a speciﬁ ed period of service to be completed) and performance conditions (requiring the other party to achieve 
a personal goal or contribute to achieving a corporate target). All other features are not vesting conditions, and 
whereas a failure to achieve such a condition was previously regarded as a forfeiture (giving rise to a reversal of 
amounts previously charged to proﬁ t) it must be reﬂ ected in the grant date fair value of the award and treated as 
a cancellation, which results in either an acceleration of the expected charge, or a continuation over the remaining 
vesting period, depending on whether the condition is under the control of the entity or counterparty. The 
amendment is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and the Group is currently assessing its 
impact on the ﬁ nancial statements, although it is not expected to be material.
IFRS 8 – Operating Segments
This standard requires disclosure of information about the Group’s operating segments and replaces the requirement 
to determine primary (business) and secondary (geographical) reporting segments of the Group. 
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 41
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
New standards and interpretations (continued)
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions
This interpretation requires arrangements whereby an employee is granted rights to an entity’s equity instruments 
to be accounted for as an equity-settled scheme, even if the entity buys the instruments from another party, or the 
shareholders provide the equity instruments needed.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a 
material impact on the ﬁ nancial statements of the Group.
 
3.  SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
a) Business segments
The Group considers there to be two business segments – Professional Stafﬁ ng and General Stafﬁ ng. Professional 
Stafﬁ ng is split into two divisions - Professional Stafﬁ ng and Managed Solutions. On the basis that management 
also monitor additional sub-operations additional information has been provided for the Professional Stafﬁ ng sector 
in respect of revenue and proﬁ t. The principal segment reporting is based on industry sectors and secondarily on 
geography by destination of supply. An analysis by industry sector and by geography is the best reﬂ ection of the 
Group’s management structure and reporting lines. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same 
as those described in the summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies. The Group evaluates performance based on 
sector contributions, which is deﬁ ned as the amount of proﬁ t or loss after allocation of certain corporate expenses, 
before ﬁ nance income and charges, any amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and income tax expense.
Professional Stafﬁ ng includes the provision of IT and Telecoms specialists to large national and international 
organisations as well as to smaller regional organisations; it also includes permanent placements and provision of 
teams to undertake IT and Telecoms testing services. General Stafﬁ ng largely consists of clerical, industrial and light 
manual activities.

 Intercompany revenue is predominantly priced at cost plus a small administrative fee. During the year ended 
31 December 2007 the Professional Stafﬁ ng segment received income of £25,000 from the General Stafﬁ ng 
segment (2006: £17,000) and £281,000 (2006: £nil) from Spring Group plc. The General Stafﬁ ng segment 
received income of £1,740,000 (2006: £2,541,000) from the Professional Stafﬁ ng segment and £35,000 
(2006: £nil) from Spring Group plc. In addition there was £78,000 (2006: £6,454,000) of intercompany revenue 
between Professional Stafﬁ ng and Managed Solutions.  Consequently, external revenue is £380,047,000 
(2006: £360,266,000) for the Professional Stafﬁ ng segment and £52,779,000 (2006: £47,035,000) for the 
General Stafﬁ ng segment.

4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
Acquisition of Glotel plc
On 24 July 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of Glotel plc, a UK listed company specialising in 
recruitment in the Telecoms sector.

Cash 27,415
Costs associated with the acquisition 1,305
Total 28,720
Cash outﬂ ow on acquisition:
Net overdraft acquired with the subsidiary 2,064
Cash paid 28,720
Net cash outﬂ ow 30,784
From the date of acquisition, Glotel plc has contributed £1,072,000 to the net proﬁ t of the Group. If the combination 
had taken place at the beginning of the year, the proﬁ t after tax for the Group would have been reduced to 
£5,109,000 and revenue from continuing operations would have been £495,322,000.
The goodwill of £9,348,000 comprises the fair value of the assembled workforce and expected synergies arising from 
the acquisition.

c) Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses which arose in the UK of £8,312,000 (2006: £10,839,000) that are available indeﬁ nitely 
for offset against future taxable proﬁ ts of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not 
been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable proﬁ ts elsewhere in the Group 
and they have arisen in subsidiaries that have either been loss-making for some time or have insufﬁ cient foreseeable 
taxable proﬁ ts to warrant the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
d)  Temporary differences associated with Group investments
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £3,028,000 (2006 - £nil). 
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to 
its shareholders.

Warrants
In addition to the options above, as part of the acquisition of Magenta.com Limited in May 2000, certain employees 
and consultants to that company were granted in total 1,400,000 warrants in respect of Spring Group plc shares, 
replacing warrants held in the share capital of Magenta.com Limited. These warrants are ﬁ rst exercisable at annual 
intervals for up to 3 years from the date of acquisition, expire at latest 10 years from the date of grant, and are priced 
between 250p and 300p per share. A total of 1,096,667 (2006: 1,096,667) warrants are currently outstanding.
The options granted under the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme are performance related and are only exercisable 
if the Company’s share price at the date of exercise is not less than 175% of the subscription price. 
The options granted under the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme are performance related. 50% of the options 
granted at 68.5p, 65.0p, and 46.0p are exercisable if the price of the shares exceeds 90.0p at any time in the period 
between the third and fourth anniversary of the date of grant. A further 25% of these options are exercisable if the 
price of the shares exceeds 106.0p at any time in that period and a further 25% are exercisable if the price of the 
shares exceeds 124.0p at any time in that period. As the latter threshold for the options granted at 68.5p and 65.0p 
was not reached, the ﬁ nal tranches lapsed on 28 October 2005 and 10 February 2006 respectively. The options 
granted at 93.5p have equivalent percentages at 108.0p, 123.0p and 147.0p with these prices having to be achieved 
at any time between the grant date and the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. In addition the options granted 
at 137.5p are 50% exercisable at a share price at or above £1.375 increased by 10% plus the percentage increase in 
the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) published by the Ofﬁ ce for National Statistics between the RPI ﬁ gure in March 2004 and 
the latest RPI published at the time of exercise of the option (“the RPI percentage increase”); to be achieved at any 
time between the grant date and the fourth anniversary of the date of grant (“the vesting period”); 75% are 
exercisable at a share price at or above £1.375 increased by 25% plus the RPI percentage increase, at any time in the 
vesting period; and 100% are exercisable at a share price at or above £1.375 increased by 50% plus the RPI percentage 
increase, at any time in the vesting period.
Details of the vesting requirements of the LTIP and the Restricted Share Award are given on page 20.  
The Colleague Share Options are performance related, and are only exercisable if the price of the shares is greater 
than 82.5p increased by the annual rate of inﬂ ation plus 5% per annum and if, in the opinion of the remuneration 
committee, there has been an improvement in the overall ﬁ nancial performance of the Group between the date of 
grant and the date of vesting. 
The options under the Company Share Option Plan 2000 are performance related and exercisable if the holder has 
been continuously employed by the Group for a three-year period commencing on 4 February 2000.
During 2007, options were granted over 665,126 ordinary shares of 60.5p each under the 2001 Savings Related 
Share Option Scheme, exercisable between 2010 and 2011. Options were exercised over 72,825 ordinary shares of 
10p each, with total consideration received by the Group of £30,224 in cash. 
During 2007, awards were granted under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) over 4,187,032 ordinary shares at 
nil cost, exercisable between 2010 and 2011. By the end of 2007 options over 540,860 shares had lapsed.
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 
31 December 2007 is £360,000 (2006: £245,000). All of the expense arising in both the current and prior years is 
from equity settled share-based payment transactions. The following table illustrates the number (No.) and weighted 
average exercise prices (WAEP) of share options currently extant.

 Included within the balance at 31 December 2007 are options over 733,081 shares (2006: options over 
1,149,083 shares) that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted on or 
before 7 November 2002. These options have not been subsequently modiﬁ ed and therefore do not need to be 
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2007 is 2.9 years 
(2006: 4.5 years). All share options are settled in equity. The table above does not include the total of 1,096,667 
(2006: 1,096,667) warrants are currently outstanding.
The fair value of the Share Option plans are estimated as at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo model for the 
LTIP and the Black-Scholes model for the other schemes, modiﬁ ed for the terms and conditions of the schemes. The 
following table gives the assumptions made for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006.
2007 2006
Expected volatility (%) 33–34% 36%
Historical volatility (%) 34% 36%

Dividend yield (%) 0.00% 0.00%
Expected life of options (years) 
(not including sharesave options where a 2-year life is assumed) 3 3
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur. The expected volatility reﬂ ects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, 
which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
The weighted average share price of options exercised during the year was £0.507 (2006: £0.436) and the weighted 
average fair value of options granted during the year was £0.447 (2006: £0.273).

13. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
Brands, customer databases and candidate databases were assessed as having a ﬁ nite life as at their respective date 
of acquisition of 10 years, 6 years and 1 year respectively and are being amortised under the straight-line method 
over the relevant period. These assets are tested for impairment where an indicator of impairment arises.
In 2006 the impairment related to the write down of certain intangible assets to their recoverable amount. 
At 31 December 2007, software includes £4,773,000 internally generated intangible assets (2006: £3,778,000), 
of which £2,765,000 (2006: £2,110,000) are own costs. These assets are classiﬁ ed as assets under construction 
until the project stage is successfully completed and the business begins to receive economic gain. While assets are 
classiﬁ ed as under construction amortisation is not charged. These assets came into use during 2007.
Software is amortised over a 3 to 7 year useful economic life.
Goodwill on acquisitions is subject to an annual impairment review, no impairment was found to exist at the balance 
sheet date.
Included in the goodwill above, which has primarily arisen from historic acquisitions, there are certain intangible 
assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the vendor due to their nature. These items 
primarily include assembled workforce and synergies.
14. IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has all been allocated to the Professional Stafﬁ ng cash-generating 
unit, which is a separate reportable segment.
Professional Stafﬁ ng cash-generating unit
The recoverable amount of the Professional Stafﬁ ng unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation, 
using cash ﬂ ow projections based on ﬁ nancial plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period. 
The discount rate applied to cash ﬂ ow projections is 10 per cent (2006: 10 per cent).

Key assumptions used in value in use calculation for 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006
The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash ﬂ ow projections to undertake 
impairment testing of goodwill, brands and customer and candidate databases.
Cash generating units – the goodwill acquired through business combinations arose through the prior acquisitions 
of several Professional Stafﬁ ng businesses and the addition of Glotel plc during the year. These acquisitions have 
added volume to create critical mass in existing businesses, by extending services to a broader market. Management 
monitor goodwill at the Professional Stafﬁ ng business level.
Period of calculation – the recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash 
ﬂ ow projections based on ﬁ nancial plans covering a three-year period. Cash ﬂ ows beyond the three-year period are 
extrapolated assuming nil growth.
Budgeted gross margins – the basis used to determine the value assigned to the budgeted gross margins is 
the average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, increased for expected 
efﬁ ciency improvements. 
Discount rates – A 10% the discount rate has been applied reﬂ ecting the current estimate of the groups pre-tax 
weighted average cost of capital at the beginning of the budgeted year is utilised and the value assigned to the key 
assumption is consistent with external information sources.  NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED

14. IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL (CONTINUED)
Key assumptions used in value in use calculation for 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 (continued)
Retail price inﬂ ation – the basis used to determine the value assigned to the price inﬂ ation of contractors and 
temporary staff is the forecast price indices during the budget year for UK where most staff are sourced. Values 
assigned to key assumptions are consistent with external information sources at approximately 3%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
 Gross margin; and
 Growth rate used to extrapolate cash ﬂ ows beyond the budget period.
Whilst the calculation of value in use is sensitive to these factors, management performed sensitivity analysis to the 
calculation using nil growth rates. Neither result indicated a need to amend the carrying value of the goodwill.

Other receivables 192 73
Prepayments and accrued income 38,191 31,563
 83,685 67,491
Trade receivables are generally non-interest bearing, however, interest may be charged on overdue balances. 
Normal terms of trade are 7 – 30 days. A provision for credit notes and bad and doubtful debts is calculated using 
a formulaic provision based on aging, together with an allowance for speciﬁ c items of which management are 
aware. Any increase/decrease in the doubtful debt provision is charged/credited to administrative expenses in the 
Income Statement. Other receivables reﬂ ect various deposits, staff travel loans and other short-term receivables, all 
with a term of less than 12 months. All “regular way” purchases and sales of ﬁ nancial assets are accounted for at 
settlement date values.
Where all actions to recover a debt have proved unsuccessful the provision is utilised against the debtor balance. 
Where there are still actions that may be taken to recover the debt the provision remains in the provision account. 
As at 31 December 2007, trade receivables at nominal value of £1,919,000 (2006: £2,831,000) were impaired and

the respective short-term deposit rates. The fair value of cash and cash deposits is £39,726,000 (2006: £51,195,000).
At 31 December 2007, the Group had available £40,000,000 (2006: £42,996,000) of undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. All of the Group’s bankers operate a 
cross-guarantee and netting structure. This means that all Group companies, party to the facility, guarantee and the 
bank has the right of offset in the event of any default under the banking facility of any of the other companies. The 
netting arrangement means that the bank charges interest on the net credit or debit balance for each currency of all 
companies in aggregate, which are party to the arrangement.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement, cash and cash deposits at 31 December is consistent with 
the analysis above.

25. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, ﬁ nance leases, cash and 
short-term deposits and loan notes. The main purpose of these is to hedge foreign currency receivables, and to provide 
ﬁ nancing for assets used in the Group’s operations. The Group has various other ﬁ nancial instruments such as trade 
debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
When the Group considers it appropriate the Group also enters into derivative transactions, principally forward currency 
contracts. The purpose is to manage the currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁ nancial instruments shall 
be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised 
below. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all ﬁ nancial instruments. The Group’s accounting 
policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 2.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is considered minimal. 
The Group has one short-term loan note arising from the acquisition of Best International, this amounts to 0.8% 
(2006: 1.9%) of total liabilities. The Group has no other long-term debt or long-term deposits that are directly 
affected by interest rate changes. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 64
25. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Foreign currency risk
As a result of the acquisition of Glotel which has operations in the United States, the Group’s balance sheet can 
be affected signiﬁ cantly by movements in the US$/£ exchange rates. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its 
structural currency exposure by borrowing in US$. Between 20% and 50% of the Group’s investment in non-euro 
operations will be hedged in this manner.
The Group also has minimal transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an 
operating unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of any 
foreign currency trading exposure by borrowing in US$ and euro. It is the Group’s aim to hedge a substantial amount 
of their foreign currency balance sheet exposure in this manner. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with 
all other variables held constant, of the Group’s proﬁ t before tax (due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets 
and liabilities) and the Group’s equity:
Increase/decrease

£000
Effect on proﬁ t
 before tax 
£000
Effect on equity
2007 +5% 61 662
-5% (58) (631)
   
Credit risk 
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish 
to trade on credit terms are subject to credit veriﬁ cation procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored 
on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not signiﬁ cant. For transactions that 
are not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant operating unit, the Group does not offer credit terms 
without the speciﬁ c approval of the Head of Credit Control.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other ﬁ nancial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash 
equivalents and available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets and certain derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit 
risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these 
instruments.
There are no signiﬁ cant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂ exibility through the use of bank 
overdrafts and ﬁ nance leases.
Fair values
There are no differences between the fair values and the carrying amounts of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED

Hedging activities 
Cash ﬂ ow hedge
At 31 December 2007 the Group did not hold any cash ﬂ ow hedges. 
At 31 December 2006, the Group held a foreign exchange contract designated as a hedge of expected future 
purchases from a supplier in the United States for which the Group has a ﬁ rm commitment. The exchange contract 
was being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk. The terms of this contract were as follows:
Maturity Exchange rate
Commitment to purchase US$3,902,000 between September 2004 
and August 2007 in-line with supplier contractual commitment. August 2007
US$2,436,000 in aggregate, in broadly smooth monthly amounts US$/£ 1.73
The cash ﬂ ow hedge was concluded during the year. A net unrealised loss of £nil (2006: loss of £80,000) was 
included in equity in respect of this contract. The amount outstanding at the 31 December 2006 was recycled 
through the income statement in the year.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and 
healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. Capital represents share 
capital, share premium and other reserves. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, 
in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 
dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the 
objectives, policies or processes during the years end 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006. Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 67

in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
The Company’s ﬁ nancial statements of Spring Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 were authorised 
for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2008 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by 
Peter Darraugh. Spring Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales. The 
Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The principal activities of the Company are 
that of an investment company.
 
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation 
The accounts have been prepared on a historic cost basis, except for derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that have been 
measured at fair value.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in the Company balance sheet are stated at cost less any impairment. The carrying values of investments 
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows: 
Leasehold improvements – over the lease term Furniture, IT equipment and software – 3 to 7 years
Tangible ﬁ xed assets are carried at cost and the carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.   
  
Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or 
a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, save that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the 
Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which the future 
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Leased assets 
Company as a lessee
Assets held under leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Company are capitalised. The capital element of the related rental obligations is included in creditors. The interest 
element of the rental obligations is charged to the proﬁ t and loss account so as to produce a constant periodic rate 
of charge. Rentals in respect of all other leases are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. 
Company as a lessor
Leases where the Company retains substantially all the risks and beneﬁ ts of ownership of the asset are classiﬁ ed as 
operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the 
leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.
Pension costs 
The Company operates a deﬁ ned contribution pension scheme for certain Spring Group employees. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the Company in funds administered by independent trustees. Contributions 
to the scheme are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account as incurred.
 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 71
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Vacant leasehold property 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources embodying economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects some 
or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised 
as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is 
presented in the proﬁ t and loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁ c to the liability. Where discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest cost.
Provisions for vacant leasehold property costs are made up to the expected date of assignment or surrender of the 
lease and are discounted at 4.77% back to present value. 
Employee share option schemes 
Employees (including Directors) of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled 
transactions’).
Equity-settled transactions
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments. In accordance with transitional 
provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 
1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which 
they are granted. The fair value of all equity-settled transactions is determined using the Black-Scholes model with 
the exception of the LTIP which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the 
shares of Spring Group plc (‘market conditions’).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period 
in which the performance conditions are fulﬁ lled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully 
entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reﬂ ects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of 
equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Company and based on the best available estimate 
at that date, will ultimately vest. The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon 
a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁ ed, 
provided that all other vesting conditions are satisﬁ ed.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁ ed, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modiﬁ ed. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of 
the modiﬁ cation, as measured at the date of modiﬁ cation.
Own shares held by ESOP Trust
Own shares held by the ESOP Trust are carried at cost and disclosed within shareholders’ funds.  NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED
Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 72
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities carried on the Balance Sheet include cash and trade and other receivables 
and liabilities and loans. The accounting policies on recognition and measurement for these items are disclosed 
in the relevant accounting policies found in these notes. Financial instruments are classiﬁ ed as liabilities or equity 
in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Interest, dividends, gains and losses relating to 
ﬁ nancial instruments classiﬁ ed as liabilities are reported as expense or income. Financial instruments are offset when 
the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to settle either on a net basis or to realise the asset 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Company uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments such as foreign currency contracts to hedge the Group’s risks 
associated with foreign currency ﬂ uctuations. Such derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are stated at fair value. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for 
contracts with similar maturity proﬁ les. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁ ed as cash ﬂ ow hedges where they hedge exposure to 
variability in cash ﬂ ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a 
highly probable forecast transaction.
In relation to cash ﬂ ow hedges (forward foreign currency contracts) which meet the conditions for special hedge 
accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net proﬁ t or loss.
When the hedged highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non ﬁ nancial asset or a liability, 
then, at the time the non ﬁ nancial asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously 
been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of 
the non ﬁ nancial asset or liability. For all other cash ﬂ ow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are 
transferred to the proﬁ t and loss account in the same year in which the hedged highly probable forecast transaction 
affects the net proﬁ t or loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are 
taken directly to net proﬁ t or loss for the year.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no 
longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net proﬁ t or loss for the year.
3. PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
In accordance with the exemption permitted by Section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not 
presented its own proﬁ t and loss account. The proﬁ t for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders and dealt with 
in the accounts of the Company was £256,000 (31 December 2006: £634,000). The Company regards £18,606,000 
(31 December 2006: £18,606,000) of proﬁ t and loss account reserves as non-distributable.

losses as they may not be used to offset taxable proﬁ ts elsewhere in the Group and the Company has insufﬁ cient 
foreseeable taxation proﬁ ts to warrant the recognition of a deferred tax asset. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS – for the year ended 31 December 2007 CONTINUED

The cash ﬂ ow hedge was assessed to be ineffective at the Company level as the supplier contract is held by a fellow 
group subsidiary. As at 31 December 2006, a net unrealised loss of £80,000 was included in the proﬁ t and loss 
account in respect of this contract. However, the cash ﬂ ow hedge has been assessed to be highly effective on a 
Group basis, and therefore the net unrealised loss of £80,000) was included in equity in the Group accounts.

The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2007 is 2.9 years 
(2006: 4.5 years). All share options are settled in equity.
The fair value of the Share Option plans are estimated as at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo model for the 
LTIP and the Black-Scholes model for the other schemes, modiﬁ ed for the terms and conditions of the schemes. The 
following table gives the assumptions made for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006.
2007 2006
Expected volatility (%) 33-34% 36%
Historical volatility (%) 34% 36%
Risk-free interest rate (%) 5.33%- 5.77% 4.80%
Dividend yield (%) 0.00% 0.00%
Expected life of options (years) (not including 
sharesave options where a 2 year life is assumed) 3 3
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur. The expected volatility reﬂ ects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, 
which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
The weighted average share price during the year was £0.507 (2006: £0.436) and the weighted average fair value 
of options granted during the year was £0.447 (2006: £0.273). Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 82

NOTICE OF MEETING CONTINUED
NOTES
A member is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or 1. 
any of the member’s rights to attend, speak and vote at the Meeting. 
A proxy need not be a member of the Company. If a member 
appoints more than one proxy to attend the Meeting, each proxy 
must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share 
or shares held by the member. If a member wishes to appoint more 
than one proxy and so requires additional proxy forms, the member 
should contact Equiniti Limied, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, 
West Sussex, BN99 6ZL.
Any person receiving a copy of this Notice as a person nominated 
by a member to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (a “Nominated Person”) should note that the 
provisions in this Notice concerning the appointment of a proxy or 
proxies to attend the Meeting in place of a member, do not apply to 
a Nominated Person as only shareholders have the right to appoint 
a proxy. However, a Nominated Person may have a right under 
an agreement between the Nominated Person and the member 
by whom he or she was nominated to be appointed, or to have 
someone else appointed, as a proxy for the Meeting. If a Nominated 
Person has no such right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may 
have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the 
member as to the exercise of voting rights at the Meeting.
A Form of Proxy is provided with this Notice for members. To be 2. 
effective, the Form of Proxy and any power of attorney or other 
authority under which it is signed (or a notarially certiﬁ ed copy of 
such authority) must be deposited with the Company’s registrars, 
Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex, 
BN99 6ZL not less than 48 hours before the time of the holding of 
the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Completion and posting 
of the Form of Proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending 
and voting at the Meeting should they wish to do so.
The statements of the rights of the shareholders in relation to the 3. 
appointment of proxies in Notes 1 and 2 above do not apply to 
nominated persons. These rights can only be exercise by members of 
the Company.
Pursuant to Regulation 41(1) of the Uncertiﬁ cated Securities 4. 
Regulations 2001 (2001 No. 3755), the Company has speciﬁ ed that 
only those members registered on the register of members of the 
Company at 6 p.m. on 6 May 2008 or, if the Meeting is adjourned, 
at 6 p.m. on the day two days prior to the adjourned Meeting shall 
be entitled to attend (either in person or by proxy) and vote at the 
Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name 
at that time. Changes to the register of members after the relevant 
time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend and vote at the Meeting.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the 5. 
CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting 
and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described 
in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a 
voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, 
the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must 
be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’ s speciﬁ cations and must contain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must 
be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’ s agent by the latest 
time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments speciﬁ ed in Note 2 above. 
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as 
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’ s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST .
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting 
service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does 
not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular 
messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility 
of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is 
a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed 
a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to 
ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system 
by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the 
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁ cated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
If the Chairman, as a result of any proxy appointments, is given 6. 
discretion as to how the votes the subject of those proxies are cast 
and the voting rights in respect of those discretionary proxies, when 
added to the interests in the Company’s securities already held 
by the Chairman, result in the Chairman holding such number of 
voting rights that he has a notiﬁ able obligation under the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, the Chairman will make the necessary 
notiﬁ cations to the Company and the Financial Services Authority. 
As a result, any member holding 3% or more of the voting rights 
in the Company who grants the Chairman a discretionary proxy in 
respect of some or all of those voting rights and so would otherwise 
have a notiﬁ cation obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, need not make a separate notiﬁ cation to the Company and 
the Financial Services Authority.
As at 26th February 2008, being the last business day prior 7. 
to the printing of this Notice, the Company’s issued capital 
consisted of 164,187,801 Ordinary Shares carrying one vote each. 
Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 
26th February  2008 is 164,187,801.
Copies of the Directors’ service agreements and letters of 8. 
appointment with the Company and a copy of the proposed New 
Articles of Association of the Company, with a copy of the existing 
Memorandum and Current Articles of Association marked to show 
the changes being proposed in Resolution 10 will be available for 
inspection at the registered ofﬁ ce of the Company during usual 
business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and Bank 
Holidays excluded) until the date of the Meeting and also on the date 
and at the place of the meeting from 10.45 a.m. until the conclusion 
of the meeting. 
In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the 9. 
meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the Meeting so that 
(i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman of the 
meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance 
with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for 
the shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate 
representatives will give voting directions to the chairman and the 
chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative 
in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one 
corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends 
the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the 
chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated 
corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate 
representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other 
corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated 
corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to 
the draft guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries 
and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.
icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The draft guidance 
includes a sample form of appointment letter if the chairman is being 
appointed as described in (i) above. Spring Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 84

Overview
Inchcape plc¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009 6
Inchcape has responded swiftly
and decisively to an unprecedented
global downturn.The Group’ s focus
continues to be on customer service
and we have gained share in most
of our markets,while cutting costs
and reducing inventory.We are well
positioned for the future.
Ken Hanna
Chairman
conﬁdence and lack of credit availability.
However,with the gradual thawing of global
credit markets and falling interest rates,
assisted by government incentive schemes
in several markets,2009 global car sales
outperformed most expectations.Globally,
the industry sold just over 63m vehicles in
2009,a 3.9% decline from 2008 and a 5.1%
decline from 2007*.
Of particular note,China became the
world’s largest car market in 2009,
surpassing the USA.Car sales in China
surged some 50% to 12.9m* vehicles in
2009,driven by government incentives on
fuel efﬁcient vehicles and increasing
demand for car ownership.
Strategy
We have remained true to our differentiating
Customer 1st strategy which has enabled
us to both strengthen our market position
and to further cement our relationships with
our manufacturer brand partners.At the
same time,management has remained
focused on ﬁve self-help measures: growing
market share; growing aftersales; reducing
costs; managing working capital; and
selective capital expenditure investment.
These measures have generated a strong
cash performance with a cost base and
levels of working capital that are well below
those at the end of 2008.
Performance
As a result of the unprecedented decline in
the global car markets,Group sales have
decreased by 10.8% to £5.6bn for the full
year to 31 December 2009.On a like for like,
constant currency basis,sales fell by 14.6%.
We began our swift response to changing
market conditions in the fourth quarter of
2008 when we implemented a number of
restructuring measures to reduce our cost
base.During the last quarter of 2008 and
early 2009 we closed 31 less proﬁtable sites
and reduced our workforce by 2,350 people.
These actions generated annualised cost
savings of approximately £70m.
Proﬁt before tax and exceptional items of
£155.1m was 18.7% lower than 2008 and
adjusted earnings per share fell 46% to 2.7p
(adjusted for the bonus element of the
Rights Issue).On a statutory basis,proﬁt
before tax was £136.7m,26.3% above 2008.
Cash generated from operations during
the year was £336.7m which is the highest
* Source: Global Insight
This is my ﬁrst year as Chairman of
Inchcape plc and despite challenging
trading conditions in most of our markets
around the world I am pleased to report
results for 2009 above our expectations
with particularly impressive cash generation.
This has demonstrated the resilience of
Inchcape’s business model,the success of
our self-help measures and an outstanding
level of leadership and commitment from
our employees.
Automotive industry
At the start of 2009,the global automotive
industry faced a rapid and unprecedented
downturn driven by falling consumer www.inchcape.com 7
level generated by the Group since 2000
and represents a 215% conversion of
operating proﬁt.
Debt reduction
The Group has historically maintained an
appropriate level of borrowings based on
a prudent balance sheet strategy. Given
the precipitous decline in economic
conditions seen at the end of 2008 and
the challenging trading environment
forecast for 2009, the Board announced
an equity raise via a Rights Issue in March
2009 which was completed in April 2009.
This enabled us to reduce our debt and
strengthen the capital structure of the
Group.I would like to thank our shareholders
for their support.
The net proceeds of £234.3m raised by this
Rights Issue together with the actions we
took to restructure our cost base and
reduce working capital,together with the
beneﬁts of our geographic spread and
diversiﬁed revenue streams,enabled us to
be in a net cash position at year end.
Acquisition and disposals
During 2009 we made an earn out payment
of US$35m and a further US$5m will be paid
in 2010 in relation to the acquisition of the
75.1% interest in the Musa Motors group,one
of Russia’s largest car retailers.Whilst the
Russian car market has been challenging
in 2009 and we expect this environment to
continue in 2010,we are conﬁdent that due
to our scale position and the low levels of
car ownership,our investment in Russia has
placed us in a strong position to beneﬁt
when the market rebounds.
Capital expenditure
Whilst in 2009 we reduced our discretionary
capital expenditure in agreement with
our brand partners,we have continued to
make strategic investments,opening nine
greenﬁeld sites across the world.
Board
After 15 years with the Group,Peter Johnson
retired as Non-Executive Chairman and I
was delighted to be appointed to the role
with effect from 14 May 2009.I would like
to thank Peter for his years of service and I
feel privileged to be working with so many
talented colleagues both on the Board
and throughout the business.
There have been a number of other
changes to the Board.On 14 May 2009
Graham Pimlott was appointed as
Chairman of the Audit Committee,with
Raymond Ch’ien and Karen Guerra both
retiring as Non-Executive Directors.
Following three years with the Group and
the successful completion of the Rights
Issue,Barbara Richmond,Group Finance
Director,left the Group at the end of June.
John McConnell was appointed to the
position with effect from 1 October 2009
and joined the Board as an Executive
Director.John was formerly CEO Inchcape
Australasia,before that CFO and has 10
years’experience with the Group.
Also,we were pleased to announce the
appointment of two new Non-Executive
Directors with effect from 1 July 2009:Alison
Cooper,who is currently Chief Operating
Ofﬁcer,Chief Executive Designate and
board member of Imperial Tobacco Group
plc,joined the Board and has also become
a member of the Audit Committee; Nigel
Northridge,currently Chairman of Paddy
Power plc,Senior Independent Director
of Aggreko plc and Chairman of
Debenhams plc,joined the Board and
has also become a member of the
Remuneration and Audit Committees.
Dividend
In line with our disclosure in last year’s Annual
Report and Accounts and in the Prospectus
published at the time of the Rights Issue,the
Board is not recommending the payment of
an ordinary dividend for the year in light of
the challenging trading conditions.
Whilst no decision has been made as yet
concerning a dividend in 2010,we intend
to return to our stated aim of maintaining
a progressive dividend policy as soon as
trading conditions allow.
Share consolidation
The Board intends to propose a 1 for 10
consolidation of Inchcape plc ordinary
shares.The purpose of the share
consolidation is to reduce the total number
of shares now in issue following the Rights
Issue undertaken in 2009 and to increase
the likely price of the Company’s shares to a
ﬁgure more appropriate for a listed company
of its size and nature in the UK market.The
share consolidation is subject to approval
by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 13 May 2010.
Following the share consolidation there is
expected to be approximately 460m
Inchcape ordinary shares in issue,reduced
from approximately 4.6bn at present.
Approach to governance
and corporate responsibility
We continue to focus on the importance of
good governance and apply the Combined
Code and other relevant guidance for
listed companies in our global operations.
Integrating socially responsible behaviour
into every aspect of how we operate and
deﬁne ourselves remains high on our
agenda.In 2009 we have built on the
foundations of a global approach to
corporate responsibility that is making
responsible economic,environmental and
social behaviour intrinsic to the way we work.
People
On behalf of the Board,I wish to express my
sincere thanks to all our colleagues across
the Group for their commitment and
support throughout the extremely
challenging trading conditions in 2009.
Outlook
Inchcape is uniquely positioned in the global
car industry and in 2009 the Group has
continued to outperform its competitors.
Whilst we expect market conditions in 2010 to
remain challenging,the Group is well placed
to beneﬁt from the market recovery and to
take advantage of industry consolidation
opportunities in the medium term.

Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10
Inchcape is uniquely positioned
worldwide.We are a leading
independent international automotive
distributor and retailer who has
delivered a record cash performance
in the downturn by creating great value
from great brands.We are strongly
positioned for the global recovery.
Inchcape is a leading independent,
international automotive distributor and
retailer,with scale operations in Australia,
Belgium,Greece,Hong Kong,Russia,
Singapore and the UK as well as operations
in 19 other markets.We represent some of
the world’s leading automotive brands with
whom we have long-standing relationships.
The Inchcape management team has
reacted decisively to the unprecedented
global slowdown in car sales witnessed in
the latter part of 2008 and in early 2009 by
focusing on ﬁve key operational priorities:
to build market share; to grow our aftersales
business; to reduce our costs; to manage
our working capital by controlling inventory;
and to limit capital expenditure to
committed strategic investments.
These actions,together with our decision
to strengthen our capital structure and
reduce debt through a Rights Issue
completed in April 2009 with the support of
our shareholders,has meant the Group has
ended 2009 in a signiﬁcantly stronger
position than we entered it.
Inchcape is in a net cash position,has
gained share in many of its key markets,has
enjoyed a resilient aftersales performance
(approximately 50% of Group gross margin)
and has signiﬁcantly reduced the cost of
doing business.Our operating cash ﬂow
was the highest achieved since 2000 and
was almost twice our operating proﬁt
(before exceptional items) as we reduced
our stock.Further,we have strengthened our
balance sheet which will enable the Group
to trade effectively,invest in working capital
and to take advantage of the upturn.
During the Company’s 160 plus year history,
Inchcape has invariably emerged from a
time of crisis stronger and more resilient.
Although we expect a continuation of
difﬁcult trading conditions in many of our
markets until well into the second half of
2010,I am conﬁdent that we are uniquely
positioned as the global industry leader to
grasp the opportunities of recovery when
they emerge.
In that context,I would like to emphasise
why we believe that the medium to long
term outlook for Inchcape is very exciting.

Resilient business model
We operate scale retail and distribution
businesses in 26 markets across the world
and are a leader in 14 of these.Our core
brand partners,with whom we have long-
standing relationships,have a history of
outperforming the market.Inchcape’s global
scale of operation is unique in our industry.
Our business model is further strengthened
by the Group’s broad geographic spread,
which embraces developed markets (like
Australia,the UK and other western European
countries together with powerful Asian
centres like Hong Kong and Singapore),
and emerging markets (such as Russia,
China and other central and eastern
European states) and is unequalled.Our
diversity has spread risk,as decline in some
markets has been balanced by strength
in others.It also gives us a vital presence
in those emerging markets where sales
potential is highest and which,in the fullness
of time,we believe will deliver the best
returns thanks to our efﬁcient retail footprint.
We also match the demands and
opportunities in each territory with the
appropriate channel strategy.
In small to medium sized markets,we
predominantly operate as country
distributors,where we become the
custodian of brands like Toyota,Lexus and
Subaru to manage every step of the journey
between the factory and the end customer.
This demands our deep involvement with
our brand partners,as well as developing
local brand,marketing and sales strategies,
ﬁnance products,aftersales servicing,parts
and accessories,plus managing sales via
a mix of Inchcape-owned retail centres
and third-party independent dealerships.
In larger markets like the UK and Russia,
manufacturers use their own national sales
companies to distribute and appoint
independent dealers.In these markets,we
operate a retail service that is increasingly
focused on bigger,better sites that deliver
an enhanced customer experience and
provide scale volume for our sales and

growth drivers are new and used vehicle
sales together with associated ﬁnance

particularly important to facilitate the sales
process.Defensive drivers are our resilient
parts and aftersales servicing businesses,
which in 2009 represented approximately
50% of our Group gross margin.

Unique approach:
Inchcape Advantage is our
competitive advantage
To extract the greatest value from this unique
global infrastructure,we have a clear and
simple vision,to be‘the world’s most
customer-centric automotive retail group’.
Our industry is generally not known for the
quality of its customer service and our
approach is based on a simple insight: if we
look after people and their cars better than
the competition,customers are more likely to
choose us; and if we perform demonstrably
better for our brand partners than our
competitors,manufacturers are more likely
to expand their global business with us.
By successfully continuing to implement
our strategy for improved customer service,
based on our unique Inchcape Advantage
programme,we increased market share in
many of our markets in 2009,despite tough
decision-making that led to the closure of
underperforming sites and a reduction
in headcount.
Through Inchcape Advantage,customer
service is truly at the heart of the business,
from the top of the company to the sales
ﬂoor and service workshop.It is intrinsic to
the way that every Inchcape person works,
ensuring that providing superior service is
present and evident at every stage of the
customer journey.
As a result,we believe we are the most
advanced company in our industry in
implementing cutting edge retail techniques
and technologies.Among other initiatives
we manage a continuous mystery shopper
programme to maintain the highest
standards of in-centre service; we interview
around 12,000 customers every month to
identify precisely what we do well and what
we should do better; and we constantly
track a wide range of customer metrics –
from footfall and test drives to leads and
conversion rates.
Our global online portal (winner of a
Microsoft Innovation Award) is used to
interrogate this data,enabling local
performance management and the
sharing of information across the Group to
learn on a daily basis from the experience
of our businesses across the world.These
leading indicators and a real time view
of our customers provide us with valuable
insights into changing consumer
preferences and behaviours,effectively
accelerating our response and enabling us
to grasp new opportunities as they emerge.
These proprietary retail processes are
truly unique in the automotive sector.They
are a vital point of differentiation across
our business and the foundation stone of
the operational excellence that gives us
a key advantage as we expand into
emerging markets.

approach
Through our superior
customer processes,
we deliver the
ultimate customer
experience and
create maximum
value for our brand
partners across the

Decentralised and empowered
organisation
I believe that this unique position also
extends to the quality of our global and
regional management teams,on whose
personal judgement and freedom to make
decisions so much depends.
It is our people across the world who
have enabled us to deliver a performance
in 2009 that was ahead of our own
expectations and which improved as the
year progressed.Revenues declined year
on year but due to our committed
operational focus,we ended 2009 with
a robust gross margin performance,strong
cash ﬂows,improved customer service
globally and increased market share
in many territories across the world.
This performance was due,in no small part,
to the tight management of our ﬁve key
priorities – growing market share,growing
aftersales,reducing costs,managing
working capital,and selective capital
expenditure investment – augmented by
the in depth personal knowledge that our
local management teams have of their
markets.Our decentralised structure
enables management to act swiftly with
relevant,local,innovative propositions to
meet the particular needs and preferences
of their customer base,ensuring that a
localised customer focus builds on our
global strategy.
High quality people are vital to ensure that
the business model works,and I would like
to thank all our employees for playing a
fundamental role in delivering a record
operating cash ﬂow in 2009.

Growing
market
share
We have
succeeded in
improving customer
service in all of our
operations and
gaining share
in most of our
key markets.
Growing
aftersales
Despite the
downturn,our
aftersales business
has remained
resilient thanks to
the quality of our
customer service,
effective marketing
campaigns and our
approach to
customer retention.
Reducing
costs
We reduced like for

at constant
currency during
2009,having taken
the difﬁcult decision
to close 31 less
proﬁtable sites
and reduce our
workforce by
2,350 people.
Managing
working
capital
In reducing our
inventory by 28.7%
in comparison with
the end of 2008,
we were able to
destock faster than
we expected and
release cash from
working capital.
Controlling
capital
expenditure
Our investment
activities have been
selective and have
focused on the
opening of nine
new strategic
greenﬁeld sites in key
markets to reach
large and valuable

Outperforming the downturn – our Five Key Priorities
The decline in new car sales that we saw
begin in late 2008 was unprecedented.We
immediately narrowed our management
focus across the world to five key priorities.
The speed and decisiveness with which
we responded was the result of the many
years collective industry experience and
a deep personal understanding shared by
our local managers of what really matters
in their markets.
As a result of actions taken at the end of
2008 and during 2009,we ended the year
in a far stronger competitive and financial
position than we entered it.

Uniquely positioned for the future
I believe that the future for Inchcape,its
employees,brand partners and
shareholders is very exciting.
While we remain cautious about the timing
of the market recovery,we certainly believe
that no competitor is better placed than
Inchcape,both to weather any continuing
impact of the downturn and to grasp
the opportunities that recovery will bring.
We consider Inchcape to be uniquely
positioned worldwide to take advantage of
the global upturn for a number of reasons.
We are one of the most international of FTSE
350 listed retailers,having delivered 83% of
trading proﬁt outside of the UK in the last six
years.Our diversiﬁed geographic portfolio
has scale businesses in 26 developed and
emerging markets and we are a leader in
14 of these.
Our resilient business model,with distribution
and retail channels,differentiating Customer
1st strategy and empowered management
has a proven track record.
Our portfolio of the world’s strongest
automotive brands consistently outperforms
the industry.
Our balance of revenue streams provides us
with both growth opportunities and recurring
aftermarket income.
Our leading,customer-centric operational
processes introduced with our Inchcape
Advantage programme,have improved our
competitive position globally.
Our competitive position has grown
stronger over the last year,both in terms
of customer service and market share,
providing us with an excellent growth
platform for the future.
We expect customer demand for greener
technology to drive vehicle replacement in
developed markets and we are partnered
with manufacturers committed to investing
in the newest technology and greener
vehicles.In the emerging markets,where
we have scale operations and the car
ownership levels are relatively low,the
increase in wealth will grow demand.
We believe consolidation of a fragmented
market to be inevitable.Inchcape will
beneﬁt from increased market share and
the desire of manufacturers to seek new
retail or distribution partners with the
strongest companies.We have the ﬁnancial
ﬁrepower to invest in the best strategic
opportunities to give us and our brand
partners access to markets with strong
future wealth and growth potential.
We outperformed the market in 2009.
I believe that we will continue to outperform
our competitors in 2010 and that Inchcape
is uniquely positioned worldwide to beneﬁt
from the global market recovery in 2011
and beyond.

Our resilient global business model
and proven strategy has delivered
a solid financial performance in the
face of an unprecedented downturn.
John McConnell
Group Finance Director
Across Europe,we delivered resilient margin
in distribution despite the continued
downturn.In Greece,where the market
declined by 18.8%,our Toyota and Lexus
business retained its market leadership
position.Although the Belgian market fell by
12.6% we maintained our market share
under very competitive circumstances.
Although the market in Hong Kong
improved in the fourth quarter of 2009,it
was down 28.3% for the full year and we
remained market leader despite strong
pricing activity from our competitors.In
Singapore the market slowed down further
in the second half as new car quota sizes
were reduced by the government.However,
our strong marketing campaigns and lower
parallel imports led to a 3.7ppts gain in
market share to 21.4%.
In a year that saw the car market in
Australia decline by 7.4% we improved
our market share by 0.1ppts.
While our Russia and Emerging Markets
segment has been signiﬁcantly affected
by the continued downturn,it remains
proﬁtable and the Group gained market
share in the Baltics and the Balkans.
Retail business
Although sales declined by 14.1% versus
2008,trading margins improved by 0.2ppts
delivering a trading margin of 1.8% as a
result of our self help measures put in place
at the start of the year to deliver a trading
proﬁt of £56.4m.
In the UK we delivered solid results,
outperforming the market which fell by 6.4%,
to deliver a like for like sales decline of 3.9%.
With the beneﬁcial impact of the
scrappage scheme and a signiﬁcantly
reduced cost base,we generated a growth
in trading proﬁt of 48.6% and 34.6% on a like
for like basis.
Our Australasian retail business delivered
a strong trading proﬁt 15.2% higher than the
prior year and a trading margin of 3.9%,
an improvement of 0.6ppts.
Across Europe we have continued to focus
on delivering excellent customer service in
very challenging trading environments.
In our Russia and Emerging Markets
businesses,sales decreased by 1.6%.
Trading conditions remained extremely
challenging,however we ﬁnished the
year with a trading proﬁt of £4.0m.
The unprecedented downturn which
began in the second half of 2008 and
continued throughout 2009 has signiﬁcantly
impacted the global demand for new
and used vehicles.We faced extremely
challenging trading conditions in all of our
markets across the world and although we
saw improvements in a few markets in the
second half of 2009,particularly the UK and
Australia,overall,total registrations in all of
our markets were considerably down
compared with 2008 for the full year.
Despite these signiﬁcant market declines,
the Group has delivered resilient results
with sales of £5.6bn,a decline of 16.6% at
constant currency for the year.Our swift
response to market challenges,with a focus
on our ﬁve key operational priorities of
growing market share,growing aftersales,
reducing costs,managing working capital
and selective capital expenditure has been
reﬂected in a Group operating proﬁt of
£175.2m before exceptional items,down
from £240.5m in 2008.
The restructuring carried out at the end of
2008 and in the second quarter of 2009 has
resulted in annualised like for like cost savings
of c.£70m.This has resulted in a trading
margin of 3.5%,down from 4.0% in 2008.
The Group has reduced working capital
by £176m in 2009 and our stock target
of 1.5 months was achieved earlier than
expected.This,together with our other self
help measures has enabled the Group to
deliver cash generated from operations
signiﬁcantly ahead of expectations,
generating £336.7m,83.3% better than
2008 (at actual rate).
The strong cash generation from operations
combined with the proceeds from the
Rights Issue enabled the Group to repay
a signiﬁcant portion of its borrowings.The
Group ended the year with £0.8m of net
cash compared to a net debt of £407.8m
in 2008.
Distribution business
Our distribution businesses have been
resilient despite the global decline in car
markets resulting in sales of £2.4bn,a
decline of 19.7% and a robust 5.7% trading
margin,resulting in a trading proﬁt of
£137.6m,a decline of 37.7% on 2008. www.inchcape.com 23
Regional analysis
For the year ended 31 December 2009,the
Group adopted IFRS 8‘Operating Segments ’.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14‘Segment Reporting’
and is effective for reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2009.IFRS 8
requires operating segments to be identiﬁed
on the basis of internal reports about
components of the Group that are regularly
reviewed by the chief operating decision
maker in order to assess their performance
and to allocate resources to the segments.
These operating segments are then
aggregated into reporting segments to
combine those with similar characteristics.
In contrast,the predecessor standard
required the Group to identify two sets of
segments (business and geographical),
using a risks and rewards approach.
Under IFRS 8,Group businesses previously
reported within the Rest of World segment
under IAS 14 are reported within the
other segments that best match the
characteristics of each individual business.
As a result,the Group’s reportable segments
for 2009 are as below.

The market
The Australian market declined by 7.4%
compared to 2008, despite government
stimulus packages aimed at the business
consumer that ended in December 2009.
These stimulus packages supported the
light commercial vehicles market in
particular, which was down 1.5%
compared to a decline of 7.9% in the
passenger car segment.
However the market rebounded in the
second half in line with the improving
Australian economy.
In New Zealand,the total market declined
28.0% with commercial vehicles most
affected and the passenger car market
down 25.9%.
Business model and strategy
We are the distributor for Subaru in both
Australia and New Zealand.We have
represented Subaru in Australia since1973.
In addition,we have multi-franchise retail
operations based in Sydney,Melbourne
and Brisbane.These operations hold
franchises for Subaru,Volkswagen,Hyundai,
Mitsubishi and Kia.
To support these operations,we have a
logistics business called AutoNexus,which
is responsible for managing vehicle and
parts inventory,distribution and vehicle
refurbishment on behalf of Subaru Australia,
and our retail business as well as other
independent dealers.
Our strategy for our distribution operations is
to continue to grow market share through
our superior Customer 1st business
processes.
Revenue is principally generated from
vehicle sales,with aftersales a signiﬁcant
source of both revenue and gross margin.
This strategy is supported by the
development of market speciﬁc special
editions and new product speciﬁcation in
conjunction with Subaru.
Our retail operations are focused on
delivering an outstanding customer
experience for our brand partners and
driving revenue from sales of new cars and
vehicle parts.In addition,we generate
revenue from used cars and through the
sales of ﬁnance and insurance products.
Our operating performance
In both of our Australasian distribution
businesses,we have continued to outperform
the market and have grown share.Sales
were down 4.4% in a market which was
down by 7.9% and trading proﬁt was 27.2%
below 2008 at £26.7m,due primarily to a
stronger JapaneseYen (JPY),with a solid
trading margin of 5.6%.
In retail,the business beneﬁted signiﬁcantly
in 2009 from improved used car margins
as a result of strong demand and lower
inventory levels.In addition,a strong
contribution from aftersales resulted in
a trading proﬁt 15.2% better than 2008
and a record trading margin of 3.9%.
This strong trading proﬁt performance and
our continued focus on working capital
across the segment resulted in cash
generated from operations of £17.8m in
retail and £29.6m in distribution.
Outlook for 2010
The market in Australia was one of the more
resilient in 2009 and we expect that the
positive momentum in the fourth quarter
together with improving economic
conditions and market sentiment will lead to
a small growth overall in the market in 2010.
We expect Subaru to achieve market share
improvements in both Australia and New
Zealand as the beneﬁt of a full year of new
Outback,Liberty,Exiga and Outback diesel
models is realised.
We expect to see ﬂuctuations in currency
rates.However we have already put in place
currency hedging to manage our JPY/AUD
exposure on vehicle and parts purchases
through to the end of the third quarter of
2010 and will implement coverage for the
fourth quarter at the appropriate time.

and a focus on operational excellence,
all supported by tight overhead cost control.
In retail,our plan continues to focus on
customer-centric operational excellence
and improvements in footfall conversion.
Our operating performance
Trading conditions across our European
markets remained extremely difﬁcult
throughout the year resulting in trading
proﬁts in our distribution business declining
by 33.1% to £30.2m and a trading loss in
our retail business of £1.6m.
In Belgium the overall market decline led
to strong price competition which resulted
in a broadly ﬂat Toyota market share.
However the new hybrid Prius was launched
in quarter three and we gained share in the
second half of the year.
In the retail business lower new vehicle
sales have been partly mitigated by
sales growth in used vehicles and strong
aftersales performance.
In Greece we maintained clear market
leadership achieving 10.1% share through
effective marketing campaigns and
successfully leveraging new products and
technologies on car models.
In Finland we successfully restructured our
retail operations.
Our focus on working capital and in
particular inventory management has
resulted in strong cash generated from
operations of £7.6m for the retail business,
and £76.6m for distribution,well ahead of
last year.
Outlook for 2010
As a whole we expect the markets in
Europe to continue to face challenging
trading conditions throughout 2010.
In Greece the signiﬁcant economic
challenges faced by the new government
are expected to lead to a contraction in the
economy and further declines in the market.
We will focus on effective marketing,model
differentiation and price competitiveness in
vehicle sales and aftersales.
In Belgium with the biannual Motor Show
in January and an improving economic
climate we expect the market to remain
broadly stable.A continued focus on driving
customer trafﬁc,superior customer service
and a growth in aftersales will be our aim.
In both Greece and Belgium we will
capitalise on the launch of the upgraded
Toyota Rav4,the Auris and the Yaris.We
will continue to grow aftersales through
service reminder programmes and vehicle
health checks.
In Finland we expect an improving economy
and therefore the industry to stabilise.We
intend to leverage the new Mazda model
launches and current model extensions to
improve our competitive position.
The market
In Belgium,in the absence of the biannual
Motor Show last held in 2008 and with no
stimulus package for the motor industry,the
market declined by 12.6%.In Greece the
overall market declined by 18.8% despite a
small recovery mid year as a result of several
government stimuli including a tax incentive
and a short lived scrappage scheme.In
Finland the market declined by 35.2%.
Business model and strategy
In Belgium,we are the distributor for Toyota
and Lexus.We own and operate eight Toyota
and Lexus retail centres,with the remaining
network of 85 retail centres operated by
independent third party retailers.
In Luxembourg,we are the distributor and
retailer of Jaguar,Toyota and Lexus,with one
retail centre for each brand.
In Greece,we are the distributor for Toyota
and Lexus.We operate six retail centres with
the remaining network of 35 Toyota and
Lexus retail centres and 40 authorised
repairers independently owned.
In Finland,we are the distributor for Jaguar,
Land Rover and Mazda with four retail
centres in Helsinki.
We aim to drive growth in market share in
our distribution business and to continue
our turnaround plan for retail.In distribution,
growth will be driven by strong marketing
programmes increasing trafﬁc into the
dealer network,with new model launches

The market
While the market in Hong Kong declined
by 28.3% versus 2008,an improvement was
seen with the fourth quarter being 40%
higher than the same period in 2008,as
general sentiment improved in line with
economic conditions.
In Guam and Saipan the markets followed
a similar pattern to Hong Kong with
improving conditions leading to growth
in the fourth quarter.However overall the
markets were 9.9% and 20.4% down
respectively on 2008.
Business model and strategy
In Hong Kong and Macau,we are the
distributor for Toyota,Lexus,Hino Trucks,
Daihatsu,Jaguar and Mazda.We operate
VIR for these brand partners in this market.
Inchcape has been market leader in Hong
Kong for over 20 years and has won the
Triple Crown award (in recognition of
outstanding customer service,retail
excellence and innovation) from Toyota
Motor Corporation for 17 consecutive years,
the only company in the world to have
done so over such an extended period.
In Guam we are the market leading
distributor and retailer for Toyota,Lexus,
Chevrolet and Scion and in Saipan we are
distributor and retailer for Toyota and Lexus.
Our operating performance
Inchcape’s market share in Hong Kong of
28.9% was lower than the previous year as
a result of aggressive pricing promotions by
European competitors who were destocking
earlier in the year,a weak performance
of the commercial vehicle segment and
supply issues in the fourth quarter.
These extremely challenging trading
conditions particularly in Hong Kong led
to a sales decline of 31.3% with trading
proﬁt falling by 57.2% and a trading margin
of 6.4%.
However,our North Asia segment delivered
strong cash ﬂow which at £50.1m was 40.7%
better than 2008,driven by a reduction in
working capital.
Outlook for 2010
We expect the markets in this segment to
continue their gradual recovery in 2010.
In Hong Kong and Macau we will leverage
another strong year of new product
launches from Toyota,Lexus,Mazda and
Jaguar to strengthen our competitive
position.Further we will continue our growth
momentum in aftersales performance
through innovative marketing programmes
and added value packages whilst
maintaining a tight control on costs.

The market
In Singapore,the market declined against
the previous year by 27.9%,due in part to
the continued slowdown in de-registrations,
reduced quota levels from the Singapore
government and consistently higher
Certiﬁcate of Entitlement prices throughout
the year.Parallel importers share of the
market declined by 10.8ppts against 2008.
The Brunei vehicle market fell by 5% in 2009.
Business model and strategy
In Singapore,Inchcape is the distributor for
Toyota,Lexus,Hino Trucks and Suzuki.We
have represented Toyota in Singapore since
1967 and been Singapore’s market leading
retailer by sales for seven consecutive years
since 2002.We have held the Suzuki
distribution franchise since 1977.
In Brunei we are the distributor and retailer
for both Toyota and Lexus.
Our operating performance
Inchcape strengthened its market
leading position and grew market share
by 3.7ppts,to achieve a market share of
21.4%.This was largely driven by new
products,the effectiveness of our value for
money marketing programmes and the
weakening of parallel importers due to
the strengthening of the Yen versus the
Singapore Dollar.
Aftersales outperformed the market
through targeted marketing programmes
for vehicles out of warranty.
Our business in Brunei performed well
retaining its market leading position.
Sales fell 11.7%,but in actual terms sales
grew by 2.3% resulting in a trading proﬁt
of £55.9m.
Cash generated from operations for the
region was 5.4% above 2008 at £71.6m,
driven by working capital reductions.
Outlook for 2010
2010 will be another challenging year in
Singapore.We expect the market to continue
its decline as a result of the lower quota
sizes announced in October 2009 by the
Singapore government and the expected
continued slowdown in de-registrations.
Our priority will be to strengthen our market
leadership position by capitalising on new
product launches and special editions and
continue to outperform the aftersales market
through enhanced customer management.

The market
The government scrappage incentive,
announced in early 2009 (and extended
into early 2010) has had a signiﬁcant
impact on the 2009 market resulting in a full
year decline of 6.4%,signiﬁcantly better than
early expectations.Since its introduction, the
scrappage scheme has accounted for over
a ﬁfth of all new car registrations; excluding
the scrappage registrations the market
declined 19.6%.The demand for private
vehicles was better than expected,up
13.7% buoyed by scrappage and
consumers taking advantage of reduced
VAT rates before 31 December 2009.
Business model and strategy
We have scale operations in the core
regions of the South East,Midlands,North
and North East of England with a
streamlined portfolio which focuses on
premium and premium-volume brands.
We aim to create signiﬁcant differentiation
by delivering an outstanding level of
customer service through our Inchcape
Advantage programme and to drive growth
in aftersales and car ﬁnance penetration.
Our ﬂeet leasing business,Inchcape Fleet
Solutions (IFS),offers ﬂeet management
and leasing services to corporate and
government customers.With over 50 years’
experience in the automotive industry,IFS
has a combined ﬂeet size of approximately
41,000 vehicles.This makes up the
distribution element of our UK results.
Our operating performance
We continue to outperform our competitors.
In a market which declined by 6.4%,our
retail business delivered a decline in like for
like sales of 3.9%.Margins in the used car
market were strong on the back of a general
shortage of quality part exchange vehicles.
The solid performance in our used and new
car business together with cost savings
generated by our restructuring have resulted
in a strong trading proﬁt of £42.8m which
was 48.6% higher than 2008,and trading
margin of 2.1%,0.9ppts better than 2008.
IFS delivered a solid trading proﬁt of £3.9m
following a loss of £5.7m in 2008 in part due
to recovery in used car prices.
Cash generated from operations was £55.1m.
Outlook for 2010
2010 will be another challenging year for
the UK car market and our expectation is
for an overall decline versus 2009.
The market has had a signiﬁcant boost
in 2009 from the scrappage scheme which
is expected to end in March 2010 and
from‘pull forward’of orders into the last
quarter of 2009 ahead of the VAT rise on
1 January 2010.
Our priority for 2010 is to continue to grow
market share through superior Customer 1st
processes and capitalising on strong new
product launches from our brand partners.
We will further develop our achievements in
aftersales through prospecting,conversion
and retention programmes.
We will maintain our signiﬁcant
achievements in working capital reduction
through stock control.

The market
With the exception of Poland and China,
2009 saw signiﬁcant declines in most of the
emerging markets.In Russia the market
declined by 49.5% on 2008.The Balkan
markets of Romania and Bulgaria declined
by 53%.The Baltics saw considerable
declines in the market for the full year,down
to 67%.Inchcape’s South American markets
fell by 10% in the premium sector and the
Ethiopian market also declined.The new car
market in China is one of the few globally
to have grown in 2009,and became the
largest car market in the world.Despite
these challenging market conditions
Inchcape retained or gained market share
in these markets.
Business model and strategy
We operate 20 retail businesses in
St Petersburg and Moscow.
In St Petersburg,we own and operate one
of the largest car retailing businesses in the
city with Toyota,Lexus,Audi and Peugeot.
In 2008,we acquired a 75.1% shareholding
in Musa Motors in Moscow,one of the
largest car retail groups in Russia,providing
the Group with scale presence in the
Moscow region representing eight brands.
We are the distributor for Toyota and Lexus in
Bulgaria and Romania.In Bulgaria we have
increased our presence in Soﬁa with the
opening of a new retail centre for Toyota in
2009.In addition,we are the distributor for
Toyota and Lexus in Macedonia and Albania.
In Poland,we retail BMW and MINI in
Warsaw and Wroclaw.
In the Baltics,we operate VIR for Mazda,
Jaguar and Land Rover.We are also the
retailer for BMW,Mitsubishi and Hyundai
in these markets.We have market leading
positions in Latvia and in Lithuania.
In China,we have scale Toyota and Lexus
retail centres in Shaoxing.A third scale retail
centre,for Lexus,opened in 2009 in Shanghai.
In Ethiopia we operate VIR for Toyota
through four sites.
In Chile we operate VIR for BMW and retail
for Honda.In Peru we operate VIR for BMW.
Our operating performance
The extremely challenging market
conditions led to a retail sales decline of
1.6% and a distribution sales decline of
45.9%.This resulted in a trading proﬁt of
£4.0m in retail and a trading proﬁt of £1.0m
in distribution.Included in the distribution
trading proﬁt was a one off impairment
charge for land value in Romania of £4.2m.
In Russia we improved our competitive
position as we gained share and remained
proﬁtable with a trading proﬁt of £9.1m.
Our business in Poland continues to perform
ahead of our expectations.We capitalised
on our successful BMW business by opening
a new retail centre in the second half.
In the Balkans we experienced a signiﬁcant
market decline and pressure on margin,as
all brand partners focused on liquidating
stock throughout the year.
In the Baltics,the extremely low level of
demand through the year and the need
to liquidate stock has also resulted in
margin pressure.
In the combined regions of the Baltics
and Balkans we enjoyed a stronger margin
performance in the second half as we
beneﬁted from our cost restructuring and
the end of our destocking campaigns.
Our performance in China has been
encouraging following the recent opening
of our third showroom for Lexus in Shanghai.
In our business in Ethiopia a focus on
strengthening our core business through the
implementation of customer management,
growing aftersales and prudent cost control
has delivered another good performance.
The market driven declines in new vehicle
sales in our South American markets
were partially compensated for by an
improved sales performance on used
vehicles and aftersales.
Outlook for 2010
With the exception of China we expect
all of these markets to continue to face very
challenging trading conditions in 2010.
We will continue to improve our competitive
position through superior operating and
customer facing processes.
We will beneﬁt from strong new product
launches from our brand partners and will
leverage these with effective marketing
campaigns.
We will continue to grow aftersales through
programmes to drive trafﬁc,improved sales
skills and vehicle health checks.
We will continue our rigorous focus on
product margin,overhead management
and control of working capital.

Delivering solid results above our
expectations despite the unprecedented
global decline in the car industry .
Camden Motors. Camden went into
administration during the ﬁrst half of the
year. The Group remains responsible for the
head lease on this property.
Net financing costs
Net ﬁnancing costs of £20.8m are £31.2m
lower than last year, as we beneﬁted from
lower interest rates in the majority of our
markets, reduced debt following the use 
of the net proceeds from the Rights Issue
and the cash generated from operations 
as a result of signiﬁcantly lower working
capital. The proceeds from the Rights Issue
were used to pay down US$114m higher
rate US$ loan notes at par, resulting in a 
one off beneﬁt of £4.0m from the hedging
arrangements in place for the US$ Private
Placement. The balance was used to pay
down revolving debt. Overall, the hedging
arrangements in place for the US$ Private
Placement resulted in a net gain of £0.9m,
including the £4.0m realised beneﬁt 
referred to above.
Tax
The effective tax rate before exceptional
items for the year is 28% compared to 26%
in 2008. This increase arises due to the mix 
of proﬁts across the territories in which we
operate. The rate is expected to be similar 
in 2010 based on our current assumptions
of proﬁt mix.
Minority interests
Proﬁts attributable to minority interests
reduced to £3.0m from £3.9m in 2008. This
was largely a result of lower proﬁts in our
Lithuanian business and the annualised
impact of the acquisition in the ﬁrst quarter
of 2008 of the remaining 24.9% interest in
our St Petersburg businesses. At the year
end the Group’s minority interests principally
comprise a 33% minority holding in UAB
Vitvela in Lithuania, a 30% share in NBT
Brunei and a 10% share of Subaru Australia.
Foreign currency
During 2009, the Group beneﬁted by £16.7m
from translation of its overseas proﬁts before
tax into Sterling at the 2009 average
exchange rate.
The Group has produced results above
expectations. In addition to the segmental
results, detailed below are the ﬁnancial
implications of our operational activities.
Central costs
Unallocated central costs for the full year
are £18.8m before exceptional items (2008-
£9.6m). The year on year increase is due to
our extremely low cost base in 2008 as we
did not pay any management bonuses
and beneﬁted from a credit from long-term
share based awards. 
Included in central costs is a net gain of
£0.1m from the currency call options taken
out in February 2009 to hedge the currency
impact from a potential strengthening of 
Sterling. All options have now been exercised
or lapsed at the end of December 2009.
Joint ventures and associates
The share of proﬁt after tax from joint
ventures decreased by £1.5m to £0.7m in
2009. This is mainly due to the start up costs
of our joint venture in Moscow and lower
proﬁt from our joint venture leasing business
in Belgium.
Exceptional items
The exceptional costs of £18.4m remain the
same as those reported at the half year. We
have taken a prudent view on prospects in
Latvia based on the continued challenging
trading conditions and have taken an
impairment of £10.3m on the carrying value
of the land and buildings. All of the goodwill
relating to Latvia was written off in 2008. 
Further restructuring costs of £5.1m were
incurred relating to restructuring in Finland,
the Baltics and Russia and the streamlining
of our European management. 
We have also made a provision of £3.0m
related to an onerous lease commitment
on land which was part of the Inchcape
Automotive business which was sold to

Cash flow and net debt
The Group’s operations have proven to be
signiﬁcantly cash generative in 2009, in spite
of the downturn, with cash generated from
operations of £336.7m. The continued tight
management of working capital, one of the
Group’s ﬁve key operating priorities, with
particular focus on inventory and supply
chain management, has been a factor in
the delivery of this result. The Group invested
a total of £50.1m in capital expenditure
across the Group and in addition raised
£234.3m in a successful Rights Issue in April
2009. This has enabled the Group to report
£0.8m of net cash at the end of 2009 versus
£407.8m of net debt at the end of 2008.
In line with the Group’s objectives
announced as part of the Rights Issue
process no interim dividend was paid and
the Board is not recommending a ﬁnal
dividend for 2009. 
Pensions
Following the successful Rights Issue in April
2009 the Group has reviewed and agreed 
a revised funding programme with the
Trustees and as a result the Group made
contributions to the UK deﬁned beneﬁt
schemes amounting to £34.7m in 2009, an
increase on 2008. A revision of market and
actuarial assumptions for the UK deﬁned
beneﬁt schemes has resulted in a closing
deﬁcit on Group schemes of £74.8m
compared to a surplus of £6.0m in 2008. 
Acquisitions and disposals
The Group agreed on the earn out
payment for the 75.1% acquisition of Musa
Motors business in Moscow and made 
a payment of US$35m in October 2009. 
A further US$5m is to be made in 2010. The
remaining 24.9% is due to be acquired in
early 2011 for a payment dependent on
2010 EBITA. The Group accounts for Musa
Motors as if it is a wholly owned subsidiary. 
Capital expenditure
The Group has worked closely with its 
brand partners to minimise the level of
capital expenditure, while maintaining the
required operational standards, and as a
result capital additions reduced from
£117.8m in 2008 to £49.9m in 2009. However
we have continued to make strategic
investments by opening nine greenﬁeld 
sites across the Group. 
The Group also continued with its
implementation plan for a global SAP
system for its operating business with the 
ﬁrst live site in the UK. The next phase of
implementations planned in 2010 are 
in the UK and Russia.

Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009 40
Introduction
At Inchcape,we recognise that corporate
responsibility (CR) is a long term programme,
constantly building on the foundations of
a global approach to CR that is making
responsible,economic,environmental and
social behaviour intrinsic to the way we work.
Inchcape’s CR programme is recognised
by our continued inclusion in the FTSE 4
Good index.We also take part in the
Carbon Disclosure Project’s review.
Our responsibilities
This section of the Annual Report sets out the
Group’s key principles of its CR programme
and how we have taken further steps in our
CR journey.
CR responsibility is delegated by the Board
to the CR Committee,which has primary
oversight for the programme and for setting
and managing the CR agenda.
At Inchcape,we take responsibility for the
impact of our activities on four core areas
and key developments during 2009 have
focused on these:
In particular,building on our 2008 pilot,
throughout 2009 we have been collecting
data to enable us to measure the Group’s
CO
2
footprint and we discuss these steps on
page 48.We have been developing our CR
initiatives for our customers and our people.
Finally,we have provided highlights of some
of our achievements in respect of the
Group’s impact on the communities within
which the many businesses operate.
• our people
• our customers
• our environment
• our communities
Governance and management
Good governance is a fundamental
element of CR.We have clear goals,which
are effectively communicated and have
demonstrated strong leadership,strong
performance management and transparent
reporting.As a UK listed company,we are
required to comply with a variety of
legislation including the Combined Code.
Details on our approach and how we have
complied are set out on pages 56-67.We
have standards that are set for members
of the Group globally within the Subsidiary
Governance Manual deﬁning our policies
and procedures establishing the Inchcape
‘way of doing business’.
Subsidiary governance
The Group has in place minimum
compliance standards across all of its
subsidiaries.These standards are set out in
the Group’s Subsidiary Governance Manual
and compliance is veriﬁed annually
through the year end reporting processes
and through the Internal Audit reviews.
These policies,recognising that there may
be variances in local laws,require that each
subsidiary complies to at least the standard
set out in the Group policy and to a more
stringent standard where required by local
law.In this way,the Group can ensure that
despite variances there is a consistent
approach to business taken across all core
functional activities,including legal,
governance,tax,treasury,ﬁnance and HR.
Financial
Financial stability and viability are essential
to the operation of the Company and
therefore the sustainability of the Group and
all its initiatives.As set out on pages 16-17,
we are focusing on our ﬁve key priorities.This
will allow us to be efﬁcient with our resources
and to beneﬁt from the growth opportunities
in emerging markets.
Ethical behaviour
The Group’s business ethics policy deﬁnes
the core ethical behaviours expected of
employees.In particular,the Group:
• has zero tolerance of bribes or
facilitation payments;
• has zero tolerance of fraud or theft;
• has a strict limit on the value of
corporate hospitality given or received,
including the provision or receipt of gifts;
• does not make political donations
or incur political expenditure;
• seeks to avoid actual or perceived
conﬂicts of interest;
• prohibits the misuse of information;
• conducts appropriate due diligence
in the selection of our joint venture
and other partners.
Verification and assurance
The Board is responsible for the strategic
direction of all CR and all its initiatives as
part of the risk management programme.
The Board is ultimately accountable to
our shareholders for our CR Programme.
Management of the CR Programme has
been delegated to the CR Committee.
Above all,the CR Committee’s role is to
ensure that our day to day business
operations respond to the opportunities,
and avoid the risks,posed by CR issues.
Through a network of locally based CR
Champions,employees with global and
local responsibilities support the work of the
CR Committee.Our activities are focused
through our CR Aware campaign.
Health and safety is reviewed by Group
health and safety ofﬁcers and as part of
the Internal Audit Programme.
Human resources data is reviewed
and veriﬁed ultimately by the Group HR
Director.Community engagement data
is reviewed by the CR Committee and
the Executive Committee.
Other information presented is reviewed
by the relevant functional experts.
Corporate responsibility (CR) is very
important to the Inchcape Group
and we continue to be committed
to integrating socially responsible
behaviour into every aspect of how
we operate and define ourselves. www.inchcape.com 41

Our customers
We place emphasis on the quality of our customer service and in 2007 we launched the Customer 1st initiative as part of the
Inchcape Advantage programme to deliver outstanding customer service‘every time,every day,everywhere’.
Following extensive consumer research,we
developed and implemented Customer 1st
processes,training and systems throughout
our retail centres.In particular,this has
allowed local management to set targets
for each centre based on customer
satisfaction measured through Net Promoter
Score (NPS) and sales and service funnel
management analysis.In 2008 the
programme was expanded to include our
aftersales operations.This is described in
more detail on pages 14-15 of this Report.
We have introduced a system for tracking
daily customer information for both sales
and aftersales operations including retail
centre trafﬁc,sales leads,test drives and
vehicle and service orders.Results are
collected and monitored daily through
a dedicated award winning portal on
the Group’s intranet.This information is
aggregated overnight,providing reports
and comparisons against brand,country,
region and across time periods.This allows
us to measure,for example,the number
of orders taken as a percentage of leads
and to set targets accordingly and gives
management a strong knowledge of the
automotive industry and detailed insight
into particular markets.
Our customer understanding is facilitated
both by our mystery shop in each of our
retail centres’sales and aftersales
operations and by quantitative analysis
of our NPS results.On a monthly basis,
each retail centre submits feedback
from 20 buyers and a further 20 visitors
about their experience at the centre
together with feedback for at least 20
aftersales customers.
Guidance on best practice and detailed
recommendations on opportunities to
improve customer service are accessible
to all retail centre employees via our portal.
We use the Customer 1st programme to
monitor both our own performance as the
retailer for our brand partners and the
performance of our third party retailers
where we manage the retail networks as
the distributor.
We believe that this focus on customer
service and sales technology will help
us deliver a superior retail service to our
customers.Further,an improved customer
experience sets us apart from our
competitors and builds loyalty,resulting
in stronger relationships with our brand
partners and leaving the Group better
positioned to grow market share.
Customer 1st in 2009
• We carried out approximately 2,800
mystery shop exercises in 240 retail
centre showrooms across the Group.
• We carried out approximately 2,200
mystery shop exercises in 225 service
centres across the Group.
• We talked to 44,500 vehicle buyers and
45,500 showroom visitors for our vehicle
sales NPS.
• We talked to over 54,400 service
customers for our aftersales NPS.
Our NPS position has improved across the
Group in 2009.
Supporting our customers
We are committed to providing clear
information to our customers to help
support them in their vehicle purchase
choices.This is provided in our showrooms
and on our websites.
As part of providing a customer focused
aftersales service,we offer our customers
an environmental vehicle health check
which includes:
• tyre pressure check
• CO
2
test and emissions test
• air condition check
• engine lubricant test
• emissions test
In some of our retail centres,customers are
offered a free‘Green Test Drive’when they
visit us for a vehicle service.The Green Test
Drive shares tips with the customer on how
to drive more efﬁciently,how to improve their
environmental impact and ultimately how
to reduce their vehicle running costs.
We also have accessories available that
help our customers manage their
environmental footprint including low rolling
resistance tyres,which can reduce CO
2
emission by around 2% and lower engine
friction lubricants which can reduce CO
2
emissions by around 1%.
Our brand partners
We carefully select the brand partners
that we represent in each market.The
automotive industry has made signiﬁcant
progress in reducing vehicle emissions
and we fully support the investment that is
being made by our brand partners in this
area.In the UK,average new car emissions
have fallen by over 13% in the last 10 years.
The biggest impact that motorists could
have on the environment is replacing
older high emission vehicles and having
their cars regularly serviced.Improvements
in CO
2
emissions have been achieved
in all product segments.As an industry
leader,Inchcape stays close to CO

Our people
At Inchcape we believe that to really achieve success it is our people who will make the difference.
During 2009,as a consequence of our
need to reduce costs in response to the
economic downturn,we reduced the
number of roles across our Group by
around 14%.Despite this,we were able to
maintain employee engagement and
customer satisfaction at high levels.We
believe that this is a direct result of our
conviction that it is our people who make
the difference and the actions arising
from this.
Our people strategy has the ultimate goal
of having‘Engaged People in Winning
Teams’.We believe this goal will be achieved
through four areas of priority:
• the right people – by becoming a magnet
for talented people who live our values
and enjoy working in winning teams
delivering outstanding results;
• the right learning – by equipping our
people to excel today and provide
exciting development opportunities for the
future,aligned to our business ambition;
• the right reward – by recognising,
celebrating and rewarding the contribution
our people and teams make to delivering
our challenging business ambition;
• the right culture – by creating a great
place to work where people choose to
make a real difference and deliver the
ultimate customer experience.
Our employee base is diverse and reﬂects
the different cultures and markets within
which we operate.This diversity creates
a range of perspectives that allow us to
constantly challenge and improve the
way we do things as we work towards our
goal of putting the customer at the centre
of our business.
Talent and performance
management
Talent planning and performance
management sit at the heart of our people
strategy as we look to ensure we have the
right people in every role.Whilst our processes
are continuous there is a more detailed
review and planning session conducted
within each of our markets and at the centre,
at least once a year.2009 was the third year
of this process.The process is designed to
ensure that we constantly upgrade our talent
and look to create the right development
opportunities for all our people.
Arising out of the talent planning process
we have made several key people
decisions,including secondments,
promotions,lateral development moves,
mentoring,and in many cases enhanced
the development plans of the individual on
the job.As a global business we are also
able to provide international opportunities
to our people and this allows us to
create even more stimulating career
paths and personal growth for many
of our talented people.In 2009 we have
made several changes within the Group
Executive Committee and each of these
changes was a consequence of this
talent planning process.
Our analysis continues to validate our belief
that talented people who are aligned with
our Company’s leadership skills and values
yield higher levels of customer satisfaction
and proﬁt.
Going forward we will continue to focus
our efforts on ensuring that each of our
employees has a meaningful development
plan that takes into account their strengths,
development areas and aspirations as well
as the needs of the business.We recognise
that development is personal to each
individual and is core to the growth of the
individual and through that,the growth
of the Group.
Inchcape operates in a constantly
changing,evolving environment where
employees meet new challenges regularly.
We know we can only achieve success if
each of us is growing,learning,developing
and succeeding in our roles.
Our employee survey results have told us
that we need to do more to support
employee personal development.We have
therefore launched‘Grow with Inchcape’
our guide to helping individuals better
understand what development planning is,
how it applies to everyone and what we
can do to really prepare for our future and
reach our potential.‘Grow with Inchcape’
demonstrates Inchcape’s commitment to
people development.
Employee communications
During 2009,more than ever before,we
have communicated with our employees
regularly to ensure they were always well
informed of the forces acting on us as a
company,the state of the automotive
industry in general,and to be transparent Business

in accordance with our values with the
actions we were taking.Through the various
forums and channels of communication we
were able to create much higher levels of
involvement with our people on the
business priorities.This was done in several
ways including CEO roadshows,monthly
employee meetings in several markets,a
monthly Group wide newsletter,weekly
sharing of customer letters,and by cascading
messages through the line management.
Employee survey
Our annual Heartbeat survey is an
important part of our overall employee
engagement programme.We encourage
our line managers to use the results of the
survey to create action plans that will help
their teams increase the levels of their
engagement.We were delighted that over
90% of our entire Group wide employee
population participated in the second
wave of Heartbeat in 2009.We have seen
an increase in the levels of engagement
in our people and going forward we intend
to continue this process.
Employee reward
We recognise that it is our culture,our
values,and the opportunities we provide
our people that attract talented individuals
to us.However we also recognise the need
to have well benchmarked,stretching yet
stimulating reward opportunities for
everyone.All of our reward programmes are
aligned directly to the strategic requirements
and expectations of our business and are
designed to reward for high levels of
performance.Our management incentive
programmes have elements relating to
customer satisfaction in addition to ﬁnancial
measures.Share awards and option plans
are detailed on pages 69-70.In addition we
have several local and Group wide
schemes aimed at recognising people
for high levels of performance and for
demonstrating our values.
Employee safety
The safety of our people is of paramount
importance to us.Many of our people
handle hazardous substances and work
with heavy machinery.We monitor and
report accidents and lost time incidents to
ensure that the safety of our staff and
customers remains at the top of our
agenda.We regularly review our policies
and procedures for our people and have
appropriate training programmes in place.
The 2009 position is to the right.There is no
speciﬁc trend or consistency of accident
that has occurred either in a given location
or across the Group.
To support Inchcape’s vision of becoming
the world’s most customer centric automotive
retail group,many of our businesses are
working towards creating an HSE culture
of best practice and zero harm to people,
property and our environment.There are
many examples of excellent HSE initiatives
around the Group.For example,Inchcape
Australia,improved its HSE performance
signiﬁcantly over the last year through a
strategic focus on cultural change.
Their 2009 HSE strategy was so successful
it resulted in several excellent outcomes,
including a 30% year on year reduction in
number of‘Lost Time Injuries’in December
2009,and a 20% year on year reduction in
number of injuries and days lost.Inchcape
Australia was also able to reduce workers’
compensation premiums by AU$ 600,000 by
improving injury management systems and
processes.The rollout of online systems,such
as the‘contractor induction system’and
the‘incident reporting system’and the
development of safe work procedures,have
also contributed to these fantastic results.
Overall,there has been an improved level
of compliance at all our Inchcape Australia
sites,with HSE measures now incorporated
into core business KPIs.Monthly meetings are
held with senior management to provide
updates regarding HSE performance for
their business units.
The hardworking HSE team are passionate
about safety and,following a year of great
achievement in 2009,are now focused
on further plans for the next two years.
In consultation with the business,they
have developed an HSE strategy aimed
at moving beyond compliance to best
practice and zero harm in the workplace
and look forward to continuing to drive
HSE leadership and culture change.

Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009 48
Our environment
In 2008,the Group commenced collecting data on its CO
2
footprint,measured
against three core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
In January 2009,following an internal
review of the data collected and the
collection process,it was agreed that the
processes should be reﬁned to maximise
their robustness and enable independent
veriﬁcation,as appropriate.
Since that review,we have continued
to collect data from our markets against
all three core KPIs.This data has begun
to provide us with insights into our CO
2
footprint.However,we consider that
additional data collection is required in
order to provide meaningful guidance.
Namely:
• additional CO
2
data is required in order
to understand if seasonality has an
impact on our data usage;
• whilst there are early indications of trend
patterns in the data,there is insufﬁcient
data to establish if these are actual or
perceived trends;
• veriﬁcation of the robustness of our data.
We are ensuring that from the start of the
process we are building in sufﬁcient
control points so that our data is
capable of independent veriﬁcation as
part of our overall planning process for
this element of our CR programme.
Early conclusions that can be
drawn are:
Analysing our CO
2
footprint is providing us
with data from which we can evaluate how
we can manage emissions and reduce
costs in the supply chain.For example,
in some markets we rely on air freight to
support our business,particularly around
the import of critical supplies which can be
dependent on aftersales requirements.We
will use the data to analyse if changes are
appropriate to support our business
requirements,reduce our CO
2
footprint
and reduce costs,thereby beneﬁting our
customers and our stakeholders alike.
Additionally,measuring our direct
costs using a CO
2
metric will present
opportunities to work closely with our
brand partners as we can support their
CR values and vice versa,ensuring that
there is a consistent approach throughout
all elements of the supply chain.
Energy This KPI measures our global electricity and gas usage.
For the last six months of 2008,and during 2009 data has been
collated on the basis of megawatt hours for electricity and
cubic metres for gas.
Transport This KPI measures the movement of cars and parts from
the point of ownership (which means legal or contractual
ownership) to the point we cease to have legal ownership.
This includes test drives.We calculate our CO
2
footprint by
car or parts kilometres depending on the mode of transport
with a CO
2
multiplier.
Flights This KPI measures the impact of the movement of our people.
We have recorded the number of ﬂights (each ﬂight leg counts
as one unit) and calculated our ﬂight CO
2
emissions with a
multiplier by ﬂight kilometre.
By recycling rainwater,using ground source heating pumps and solar power to heat
water,Inchcape Honda in Romford,UK uses around 30% less energy than a standard
car showroom. Business

Objective How we will do this
Raising employee
engagement through the
various initiatives from our
people strategy including
signiﬁcant reward and
development plans
• All employees to be part of the appraisal process
• All senior employees to be part of the talent review process
• All senior employees to have individual development plans
Extending our employee
survey to the rest of our global
employee base
• Continuing to implement Heartbeat across the Group
• Ensuring that follow up action plans are in place and implemented
Extending best practice in
health and safety to our
operations worldwide
• Reviewing time lost through accidents and continuing to monitor
impact on business
Supporting our communities
in which we operate through
focused initiatives
• Continued focus on local initiatives
Continued collection of CO
2
data in order to establish
trends and seasonal variations
and eliminate practices which
do not support both our CO
2
and business strategies
• Promote best practices throughout the business
• Perform analysis for trends etc as sufﬁcient robust and veriﬁable
data is collated
Identiﬁcation of CO
2
reduction
and/or offset opportunities for
our core markets
• Based on above,review the opportunities that positively impact our
CO
2
footprint to support our objectives,our shareholders,our brand
partners,our customers and employees
Our 2010
goals
Having established
solid foundations for our
CR programme,in 2010
we will look to embed
these practices within
our global operations,
particularly focusing on
people and our CO
2
footprint management.
We have reviewed our travel policy and
have used alternative communications
where practicable,such as conference
calls,video conferencing and virtual offsites.
We will continue to implement these
measures in 2010 as part of our CR
programme.Moreover,the cultural changes
in our ways of working have been
implemented positively.
We have already introduced a number of
measures to protect our environment within
our ofﬁces such as recycling bins,use of
recycled paper and stationery and water
puriﬁcation systems.
As Inchcape operates three business
models – Distribution,Retail and VIR
(please see page 13 for more detail)
there are variances in our CO
2
footprint.
Direct comparisons between markets
operating different business models are
unlikely to produce meaningful results.
However,we are looking for opportunities
to exploit synergies between the business
models by having a consistent approach
to reduction and offsetting goals and by
sharing best practices. Aftersales again proved
resilient in 2009 and
represents c.50% of our
Group gross margin
Our BMW Cooper Croydon retail
centre in the UK has a 19 bay
workshop, including two dedicated
diagnostic bays and a ‘smart
repair’ bay . The Integrated Service
Information Server provides an
online technical link direct to the
BMW factory to aid our highly
trained technicians through all
diagnostic activities, re-coding 
and programming of vehicles.

Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009 56
Letter from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I succeeded Peter Johnson as Chairman of Inchcape after the
AGM on 14 May 2009.During his tenure as Chairman,Peter
championed good governance practices and a continued focus
on the highest governance standards remains high on my agenda.
We,as a Board,ﬁrmly believe these are vital to the effective
operation and growth of our Company.
High standards of governance help strengthen management
and underpin the decisions made by the Board and the Executive
Committee to help us to lead the Group forward to deliver on our
objectives and performance goals whilst having regard to the
interests of our stakeholders.Making governance integral to our
business enables the Board to be focused on strategy and enables
the Executive Committee to manage the operations effectively.
During 2009 we remained committed to ensuring the highest
standards of Board performance and delivery and to this end have
again performed an evaluation of the Board.Our particular focus
has been on ensuring that the reﬁnements we have made to our
Board processes are working effectively and that the members of
the Board that joined us in 2009,as well as the existing members,
have full access to our business along with all relevant information
and training to allow them to discharge their duties.Our evaluation
has reviewed how the changes made have facilitated discussion
of the key issues as well as considering the alignment to best
corporate governance practices following recommendations
made by various reports including the Walker Report and the
Financial Reporting Council.
Our corporate governance report explains how the Board and its
Committees operate within a framework of effective controls and
how the Directors have discharged their duties to our Company.
Yours sincerely
Ken Hanna

Board meetings and attendance
The Board held seven scheduled meetings during 2009.In addition
the Board attended a Strategy Review day where the Board and
members of the Executive Committee agreed the strategic agenda
for the coming years.The Strategy Review day gives the Non-
Executive Directors and the Executive Committee members an
opportunity to engage in detailed discussions regarding the
operations of the business and establish the framework for the
future strategic direction of the Group.The Board also met for ad
hoc meetings to deal with speciﬁc issues.
Board meetings were held at retail centres and operations within
the Group which provides valuable additional insight into the
business for Non-Executive Directors and gives the Board an
opportunity to meet colleagues around the world.During 2009,
in contrast with previous years and in recognition of the difﬁcult
economic climate,the Board did not hold an overseas Board
meeting but instead attended a meeting at BMW Croydon,a UK
retail centre.It is intended that the Board will meet at our operations
in Belgium in 2010.
Where a Director is unable to attend a meeting,he/she is advised in
advance of the matters to be discussed and given an opportunity to
make his/her views known to the Chairman,Committee Chairman
or Group Company Secretary before the meeting.Nigel Northridge
was unable to attend one meeting due to commitments that
existed before he became a Non-Executive Director.
If any Director were to have any concerns regarding the running
of the Company or a proposed action,such concerns would be
recorded in the Board minutes.If a Director were to resign over an
unresolved issue,the Chairman would bring the issue to the attention
of the Board.No such issues or concerns arose during the year.
The Non-Executive Directors also met during the year without the
Executive Directors.

Board balance and independence
All the Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent
under the criteria set out in rule A.3.1 of the Combined Code.
Ken Hanna became Chairman after the AGM on 14 May 2009.
Ken was considered independent upon appointment under rule
A.3.1 of the Combined Code.
Will Samuel and Michael Wemms are both Non-Executive Directors
of Galiform PLC.Ken Hanna and Graham Pimlott are both Non-
Executive Directors of Tesco PLC or its subsidiaries.Having regard
to all the circumstances,including the independence they have
demonstrated as Non-Executive Directors of the Company and the
fact that there are no cross-shareholdings or business relationships
between either Galiform PLC or Tesco PLC and the Company,the
Board is satisﬁed and has determined that they are independent
in respect of these roles additionally.
It is important to the Company to maintain a strong skills base
across the Board in order to bring a depth of knowledge and
experience to the matters under discussion.Alison Cooper and
Nigel Northridge were both appointed during the year.They bring
considerable retail,operational and international experience adding
to and enhancing the balance of the Board.John McConnell
joined as Group Finance Director transferring from our business
in Australia.John’s in depth knowledge of our business as well as
technical knowledge gives him a particular insight into strategic
issues.All the Directors bring an individual judgement to bear on
issues of strategy,performance,resources and standards of conduct.
Further details on new appointments to the Board can be found
in the Nominations Committee report on page 65-66.
Information,training and development
Induction programme for new Non-Executive Directors
In order to understand the Group’s operations both new Non-
Executive Directors participated in a detailed induction programme.
Information supplied
Each Director receives information on the Group’s operating
businesses; regulatory and legislative environment; and
corporate governance.
Additional support
The Directors have access to external advisors for additional
information and/or training as appropriate.This ensures that the
Directors’skills,knowledge and familiarity are kept up to date.
Board meetings
Using the information supplied the Directors are able to
participate in informed and valuable discussions during the
Board meetings.
Responsibility
The Group Company Secretary is responsible for the ﬂow of
information to Non-Executive Directors.The receipt of quality,
timely and relevant information is important to the effective
decision making of the Board.
They met with the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration
Committees to acquire an understanding of the Board’s processes
and they visited UK retail centres with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
of the UK retail business to provide an insight into the Group’s
operational business.They also spent time with members of the
Executive Committee,the Director of Corporate Affairs,Group Head
of Tax and the Group Financial Controller to gain further knowledge
of how the Company operates.Externally they met with the
Company’s brokers to enable them to gain an understanding
of the Group’s position within the market place.
The broad scope of the induction plan is designed to give the new
Non-Executive Directors an understanding of the business and the
arena in which it operates.
Performance evaluation
Governance
Section
Two
Process
Led by the Chairman and supported by the Group Company
Secretary,a performance evaluation questionnaire was used,
covering the effectiveness of the Board,each Committee’s
performance against objectives,preparation for and
performance at meetings and corporate governance matters.
An internal review was considered most appropriate in 2009 to
allow changes in composition and operation to bed down.
Focus
The change in Chairman and composition of the Board in
2009 provided an opportunity to review how the Board
processes supported the effective discharge by the Board
of its duties.In conjunction with this review,we have:
• re-issued the schedule of Board meetings,with six to eight
meetings per year held over two successive days;
• increased the number of scheduled Audit Committee
meetings.
Identification of actions
Following the evaluation,the Board members concluded
that appropriate actions have been identiﬁed to address
areas that could be improved and that,overall the Board
and Committees continued to perform effectively.
Performance evaluation
The Chairman evaluates the performance of the Non-Executive
Directors and met each of them individually to discuss
performance.The Non-Executive Directors met without the
presence of the Chairman to evaluate his performance.
Conclusion
Following the performance evaluation process,the Chairman
has conﬁrmed that the Non-Executive Directors standing for
election at this year’s AGM continue to perform effectively and
demonstrate commitment to their roles.The Board will continue
to review performance annually.In addition to the annual
review process the Board receives regular updates on best
practice and will,as appropriate,adopt changes in practice
during the course of the year. Corporate governance report continued
Governance
Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009 60
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for the establishment and review of the
Company’s internal operational and compliance control systems.
The internal control systems are designed to ensure:
• effective and efﬁcient operations;
• quality of internal and external reporting; and
• internal control and compliance with appropriate laws
and regulations.
The implementation of internal control systems is the responsibility
of the Executive Committee.
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code and the Turnbull
guidance the Board annually reviews the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control systems and reports to shareholders.
The Board has ensured that a process for managing signiﬁcant
risk has been in place during the year.The process is designed to
manage rather than eliminate risk in general,not just risk of not
meeting objectives.In establishing and reviewing the system of
internal control the Directors have regard to the nature and extent
of relevant risks; the likelihood of loss being incurred and the costs
of control.
The system can only provide a reasonable but not absolute
assurance against any material mis-statement or loss and cannot
eliminate business risk.
The Board has delegated the responsibility of monitoring the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control systems to the
Audit Committee.The Committee reports its ﬁndings to the Board
as a whole so that a view can be taken.
Risk identiﬁcation,assessment and management
To assist the Board and the Audit Committee in managing internal
controls the Group operates a Risk Management Strategy Group
(RMSG) which is chaired by the Group Chief Executive.Membership
throughout the year comprised the Group Finance Director,the
General Counsel and Group Company Secretary,the Group
Corporate Affairs Director and the Director of Audit and Risk.
The RMSG meets six times per year,aligned with the Audit Committee
schedule to review risk management and control processes.Its
review covers matters such as responses to signiﬁcant risks that
have been identiﬁed,output from monitoring processes (including
internal audit reports) and changes to be made to the internal
control systems.It also follows up on areas that require improvement
and reports back to the Audit Committee.
Risk management programme
The Company has relaunched its risk management programme
known as Inchcape Peace of Mind (iPOM).This is a programme
bringing together the various risk management projects and
initiatives under one systematic and collective approach.
iPOM aims to maximise opportunities to improve performance
and meet strategic goals with an integrated,simple approach
to risk management.Through iPOM we will constantly seek to instill
the right behaviours across the organisation and to ensure that
compliance continues to be embedded within the Group’s way
of operating.

Examples of key projects for 2009,including key initiatives that were
either introduced or reinforced were:
• compliance certiﬁcates signed by all Managing Directors and
Finance Directors as part of the year end process conﬁrming
that all key controls had been complied with and there were no
outstanding issues to be resolved.
• the Group Risk Register process continued,with a bottom up top
down approach used to identify the key Group and market risks
and to look at the impact of mitigating actions that had been
implemented.The Business Risk Assessment forms part of the
scheduled Annual Operating Plan process and monthly market
review meetings as well as being a key agenda item for review
at the RMSG and Audit Committee meetings;
• a Group Subsidiary Governance Manual was rolled out to all
markets in 2009.This sets out the policies that all operations
within the Group are required to comply with,covering a number
of areas including tax,treasury,ﬁnance,legal,company
secretariat and HR.
The RMSG is supported by market risk committees that share
the common risk agenda,and which report to the RMSG on
a regular basis.
Control procedures and monitoring systems
A Group Risk Register,which identiﬁes the key risks,the impact should
they occur and actions being taken to manage these risks at the
desired level,is produced for each business unit.In addition,actions
to be taken in the event that such risks crystallise and proposed
improvements to the way they are managed are also included.
The Group Risk Register is approved by the RMSG and the Executive
Committee and discussed by the Audit Committee at its meetings.
The Group also monitors its control procedures in the following
key areas:
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive system with an annual budget approved
by Directors.Monthly actual results are reviewed and reported
against budget and,where appropriate,revised forecasts are
presented at Board meetings.
Investment appraisal
The Group has clearly deﬁned policies for capital expenditure.
These include annual budgets and detailed appraisal and
review procedures.
Internal Audit
The adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
systems are monitored by the Internal Audit team who report to the
Audit Committee on a regular basis.Internal Audit also works closely
with management and the external auditors.
Business Unit Controls
Each business in the Group is required to identify its key risks and the
control procedures in place to mitigate those risks.This evaluation
takes place twice a year as part of the preparation and update of
the business plans.
During 2009,the Managing Director and Finance Director of each
business unit in the Group signed a compliance certiﬁcate to
conﬁrm:
• the accuracy and completeness of the accounts submitted
for consolidation;
• compliance with local laws and regulations;
• the absence of fraud;
• the absence of conﬂicted directorships; and
• compliance with Inchcape policies.

Share consolidation
On 10 March 2010,we proposed a 1 for 10 share consolidation to
lessen the volitility the current level of share price generates and to
decrease the cost of dealing in shares.This will reduce the shares in
issue from approximately 4.6bn with a nominal value of 1.0p to
approximately 460m shares with a nominal value of 10.0p.The
share consolidation is subject to approval by shareholders at the

member of the Auditing Practices Board until March 2010.Graham
took over the role as Chairman from Ken Hanna on 14 May 2009.All
the members are Non-Executive Directors.Will Samuel is a chartered
accountant and the Board has determined that Will has recent and
relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The Audit Committee met three times during 2009,to coincide with
the key dates in the Company’s ﬁnancial calendar.Attendance is
shown on page 58.In addition to the scheduled meetings the Audit
Committee meets with the external auditors twice a year.The Audit
Committee reviewed its way of working and the balance of focus on
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial risks and agreed that from 2010,the Audit
Committee will meet four times per year in order to give the
Committee more time to consider the key activities delegated to it.
No one other than the Audit Committee Chairman and its members
are entitled to attend the meetings however,the Chairman,Group
Chief Executive,Group Finance Director,Group Audit and Risk
Director and the external auditors attend by invitation.
The Audit Committee may take external legal,accounting or other
advice at the Company’s expense when it believes it necessary to
do so.Other than discussions with the Company’s external auditors,
none was taken during 2009.
The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee are ﬁnancial
reporting; internal control and risk management systems; internal
audit and external audit.The Audit Committee discharged all its
responsibilities,as set out in its Terms of Reference,during the year.
The full Terms of Reference can be found at
www.inchcape.com/aboutus/corporategovernance.
Activities
During 2009,the principal activities of the Audit Committee
included the following:
• review and approval of interim and full year results and any other
formal announcement relating to ﬁnancial performance;
• review of the internal audit plan and the results of the internal
auditors’work,including monitoring management’s
responsiveness to ﬁndings and recommendations;
• review of the Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls and the
internal control and risk management system;
• approval of the terms of engagement with the external auditor at
the start of each audit and the scope of the audit to be provided;
• review of the audit plan with the external auditor at the planning
and reporting stages;
• effectiveness of the internal and external audit function;
• whistleblowing provisions;
• relevant disclosures in this Report; and
• review of its Terms of Reference.
As part of the approval process for the appointment of the external
auditor,the Committee is responsible for monitoring the objectivity,
independence and performance of the external auditor.The
Committee is satisﬁed that the external auditor continues to be
effective.The Committee recommends the Board propose a
resolution to re-appoint the auditors at the AGM.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Company’s auditors for
over ten years.The Audit Committee considers that the relationship
with the auditors is working well and remains satisﬁed with their
effectiveness.Accordingly,it has not considered it necessary to
require the ﬁrm to tender for the audit work.The external auditors are
required to rotate the audit partners responsible for the Group audit
every ﬁve years.In accordance with best practice guidelines the
current audit partner will step down during 2010 and his
responsibilities will be transferred to another partner.There are no
contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of
external auditor.

In addition to the above activities,the Audit Committee reviewed its
policy regarding the scope and extent of any non audit services
provided to it by its auditors.The purpose of the policy is to ensure
that the external auditors remain objective and independent.
A procedure is in place which must be complied with prior to the
external auditors being engaged in non audit work which is
approved by the Audit Committee.There is a clear division of
responsibility between audit and non audit staff and restrictions are
imposed on permitted areas of non audit work.The Company has
acted in compliance with this policy during 2009.
The Company has a guideline that the auditors should not
normally earn more for non audit services than for audit services.
In 2009,the audit fees were just less than the aggregate of the fees
earned by the auditors for other work.During the year the auditors
were heavily engaged in work relating to the Rights Issue which
closely related to their function as auditors.Also,the auditors
advised on a number of tax matters which are expressly permitted
under the policy.A full statement of the fees paid for audit and non
audit services is provided in note 3d on page 104.The Company
does not consider that this work,or the fees earned,have
compromised the independence of the auditors.
The Company’s whistleblowing policy is communicated to
employees on a global basis.The policy enables employees to raise
concerns with the Disclosure Response Team in cases where
conduct may be deemed to be contrary to the Company’s values.

Regulations 2002 and other relevant requirements of the FSA Listing
Rules. The Remuneration Committee believes that the Company
has complied with the provisions regarding the remuneration
matters contained within the Code.

during the year and information on Towers Watson, who acted

Remuneration policy 
The current remuneration policy was introduced in October 2007. 
In establishing the policy the Remuneration Committee had regard
to the need to:
• continue to align with and support the Company’s 
business strategy;
• allow the Company to motivate and retain its executive
management whilst having regard to pay and conditions
throughout the Group; 
• recruit executives of high quality; and
• safeguard interests of shareholders by aligning the remuneration
package of executives with shareholder interests.
The key elements of the remuneration policy are: 
At the beginning of 2009 the Company was faced with an
unprecendented global downturn in the car industry that started in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and quickly spread throughout the world.
The Remuneration Committee has monitored the remuneration
policy carefully to ensure that it has remained appropriate for the
challenging environment.
The Remuneration Committee felt that whilst the overall
remuneration policy was sound, actions were necessary to help

drive the Company’s recovery and support the business in 2009. 
In summary it was agreed that:
• there were no increases to Executive Directors’ and Executive
Committee members’ salaries;
• the co-investment plan was suspended; and
• no bonus payments were made in 2009 against 2008 targets 
for Executive Directors.
In addition, due to the market conditions and the critiera that had
been set, executive share options and restricted share awards that
had been due to vest for Executive Directors lapsed as the
performance conditions were not met.
Shareholder consultation 
The Remuneration Committee consulted with shareholders and
shareholder representative bodies in April 2009 to explain the
Company’s position and the need to support the underlying
strategy as well as to understand shareholders’ respective views. 
In particular, it was considered necessary to amend the
performance criteria for short and long term incentives to ensure
alignment with the needs of recovery. The three year plan (2009 –
2011) which was the base for the executive share option grant of
2009 was developed at the beginning of 2009 whilst the Group 
was implementing its recovery strategy.
The Group successfully completed its Rights Issue in April 2009
thanks to the strong support of its shareholders. To mitigate the
effects of the downturn from an operational perspective,
management focused on the execution of ﬁve priorities: growing
market share, growing aftersales, reducing costs, managing working
capital and selective capital expenditure investments. The
execution of these self help initiatives has delivered excellent results
as the Group was able to extract more costs than planned and
managed to reduce working capital faster than expected.
Moreover the Group outperformed its competitors in the market
place by gaining market share in most markets and by improving
customer service. The trading performance also beneﬁted from a
stronger performance in the second half of the year in Hong Kong,
Australia and the UK.
In light of these challenging market conditions and mindful of 
the need to encourage the right behaviours to best position the
Company to manage the downturn and to take advantage of 
any upturn, the Remuneration Committee reﬁned elements of the
remuneration policy for this period. In particular the Remuneration
Committee reviewed its position on executive share option grants 
to senior management and the Group Chief Executive. 
2009 summary
It was decided that:
• the annual bonus would have an operating proﬁt qualiﬁer 
and would be based on an internal measure of cash ﬂow from
operating activities (CFOA);
• vesting of executive share options granted in 2009 would be
based on a cumulative three year CFOA growth measure; and
• there would be a one off executive share option award made to
the Group Chief Executive, with additional performance criteria.
Whilst there was a range of views amongst the shareholders
consulted, the consultation was successful overall. As part of this
IC027_p68_77_vAW3.qxp  24/3/10  21:25  Page 68 Governance
Two
www.inchcape.com 69
process, the Company committed to providing details of the ﬁrst
year’s CFOA.
The strong trading throughout the year, despite very difﬁcult market
conditions worldwide, enabled the Group to deliver a ﬁnancial
performance ahead of its plan on all ﬁnancial metrics (revenue,
margin, cash). The CFOA in 2009, for the purposes of the
remuneration schemes, was £344.2m, 53.2% ahead of last year and
57.8% ahead of ﬁrst year performance target despite a revenue
decline of 16.6% (all in constant currency) which demonstrates the
signiﬁcant impact of the management initiatives.
2010 summary
The Remuneration Committee recognises the valuable input
provided by shareholders and has taken into account comments
received in 2009 as part of its 2010 remuneration planning
processes. The Remuneration Committee has decided:
• salaries for Executive Committee members will be frozen during
2010 as in 2009; 
• the co-investment plan will be suspended for a second year; and
• changes to the annual bonus plan will be introduced to ensure
there is greater visibility of non-ﬁnancial measures.
2011 planning
As market conditions improve, the Remuneration Committee 
will review its longer term remuneration strategy and it intends to
further consult with shareholders as part of its 2011 remuneration
planning process.
Base salary 
As discussed, base salaries were frozen across the Group for 2009.
The Remuneration Committee, supporting the Company’s
commitment to increase cash ﬂow and reduce costs, felt that salary
increases would be inappropriate.
The Remuneration Committee has also decided that salaries 
would be frozen during 2010 for members of the Executive
Committee. The Remuneration Committee considered this decision
was in keeping with the need for the Company to continue its focus
on costs and margins.
Annual bonus 
The bonus plan for 2009 had an operating proﬁt qualiﬁer and was
based on 70% CFOA, 20% Net Promoter Score (NPS) and 10% on
personal objectives. 
For 2009, the Company met its performance targets for CFOA and
NPS. The personal objectives relate to the development and
implementation of the Company’s strategy. The goals are based on
relevant qualitative non-ﬁnancial metrics, the achievement of
strategic milestones and the demonstration of appropriate
leadership behaviours. André Lacroix fully achieved his personal
objectives in 2009. John McConnell also achieved his personal
objectives and will receive a pro-rated bonus for his time as Group
Finance Director. The resultant bonus payments are shown in the
emoluments table on page 71.
For 2010,the Remuneration Committee have made further
amendments to the bonus targets to take into account the evolving
strategic needs of the business and the interests of shareholders
and employees. Accordingly, the 2010 annual bonus plan will
consist of 70% ﬁnancial measures comprising operating proﬁt and
working capital, and following previous consultation with
shareholders, 30% non-ﬁnancial measures based on NPS. This
improves the visibility of the non-ﬁnancial elements of the bonus
scheme by removing the 10% personal objective element.
Executive share option plan
As previously discussed, the Remuneration Committee decided to
use cumulative CFOA for the performance period 2009 – 2011 as
the performance measure for executive share options granted in
2009 rather than the EPS measure used in previous years. The
Committee considered the CFOA performance measure was
appropriate to the Company’s business strategy during the period. 
The normal level of grant for Executive Directors of two times base
salary was made. The Group Chief Executive received a one off
grant of an additional two tranches, details of which are given on
page 72. The one off award will only vest if certain additional
performance criteria are met. The ﬁrst tranche will vest if the share
price achieves a maximum trading price of 25p or more for 20
consecutive days anytime within the period from 20 May 2012 to
20 April 2014. The second tranche will vest if the share price achieves
a minimum trading price of 35p or more for 20 consecutive days 
in the same period.
All other options granted in 2009 will vest according to the following
sliding scale: 
CFOA growth per annum Vesting Percentage 
Less than 70% of target 0%
70% to 99% of target 25%
100% of target 100%
Between 70% and 100% Straight line basis 
Details of options granted to Executive Directors are shown on
pages 72-74.
Options granted before 2009 will vest according to the following
sliding scale: 
EPS growth per annum Vesting Percentage 
Less than RPI+3% 0%
RPI+3% 25%
RPI+8% 100%
Between RPI+3% and RPI+8% Straight line basis 
There will be no retesting 
The Remuneration Committee felt that the CFOA performance
measure was essential for the unique circumstances prevailing at
the time for the 2009-2011 executive share option grant. Looking
forward the Remuneration Committee has decided to revert to the
EPS performance measure for options that may be granted in 2010.
Co-investment plan
The co-investment plan was introduced during 2008 after receiving
shareholder approval in 2007. The plan is a voluntary plan for
Executive Directors and certain other senior executives and
replaced the deferred bonus plan. The Group Chief Executive can
invest up to 50%, and the Group Finance Director can invest up to
40%, of post tax salary to obtain ordinary shares in the Company. In
exceptional circumstances the Remuneration Committee may
determine that circumstances justify that up to 100% of post tax
salary can be invested. No such exceptional circumstances have
arisen to date.

The plan has been extended to certain other senior executives
below Board level.
The shares acquired will be matched at the end of the three year
vesting period. The match will be determined by performance
against the cumulative Economic Proﬁt target. 
For 2008 awards will vest according to the following sliding scale: 
EP growth over three years Matching shares 
Less than RPI+3% 0
RPI+3% 1:1
RPI+12% 2:1
Between RPI+3% and RPI+12% Straight line basis
The Remuneration Committee decided to suspend the co-
investment plan during 2009. This decision was taken since the plan
is designed to stretch performance and due to the downturn in the
second half of 2008 and 2009, it was improbable that there would
be any matching element.
The Remuneration Committee has also decided to suspend the co-
investment plan for 2010. The Remuneration Committee noted the
concerns of shareholders in respect of lower share prices creating
the opportunity for windfall gains. Therefore this decision has been
taken since the existing performance conditions would not be
stretching enough when viewed in context of the recovery phase 
of the business.
Deferred bonus plan
The deferred bonus plan was a voluntary plan for Executive Directors
and certain other senior executives. Final awards under this plan
were made in 2007. Details of these awards are shown on page 73.
Participants in the plan were able to invest a minimum of 10% and
maximum of 75% post tax annual bonus to acquire ordinary shares
in the Company. The shares are then matched on a 1:1 basis at the
end of a three year vesting period. For Executive Directors there is a
performance condition attached to the vesting of the award shares
of EPS growth of RPI+3% per annum with no retesting. This
performance target was not achieved for the awards granted in
2007, therefore the award will lapse in full.
Save as you earn (SAYE)
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s SAYE
scheme on the same terms as other employees. Participants make
monthly savings, to a maximum of £250 per month, over a three
year period. At the end of the savings period the funds are used to
purchase shares under option. The acquisition of shares under this
scheme is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
Executive share ownership
To emphasise the importance the Remuneration Committee places
on executive share ownership, Executive Directors are required to
hold a ﬁxed number of shares equivalent to 200% of base salary.
Each Executive Director has ﬁve years from 2007, or date of
appointment (if later), to reach this shareholding target. As at
31 December 2009, André Lacroix and John McConnell held 181%
and 110% respectively of base salary in shares.
Retirement beneﬁts
The Inchcape Group (UK) Pension Scheme (UK Scheme) provides
beneﬁts for Executive Directors and certain senior executives at
normal retirement age of 65, equal to a maximum of two thirds 
of ﬁnal base salary, where salary has scheme speciﬁc ceiling of
£123,600 in the 2009/10 tax year, subject to completion of between
20 and 40 years’ service. Pensions in payments are guaranteed to
increase in line with the lesser of 5% and the increase in the RPI.
The UK Scheme requires members who join after March 2005 to
contribute 7% of base salary up to the scheme speciﬁc ceiling of
£123,600 in the 2009/10 tax year.
Executive Directors, whose base salary is higher than £123,600, 
are paid a monthly cash supplement to enable them to make
additional pension arrangements. Barbara Richmond and John
McConnell received such supplements in 2009. Details of the
amounts paid are shown on page 71. André Lacroix received 
a cash supplement of 40% of his base salary in lieu of a formal
pension provision. He is not a member of the UK Scheme except 
in respect of the life assurance beneﬁt for death in service.
A lump sum life assurance beneﬁt of four times full base salary 
is provided on death in service. For pension scheme members, 
a spouse’s pension of either half or two thirds of the prospective
member’s pension may also be payable. Children’s pensions 
may also be payable, up to half of the member’s pension.
Taxable and other beneﬁts
These include items such as Company cars, medical care and 
life assurance premiums. These beneﬁts are in line with the
remuneration policy framework outlined in this report. These beneﬁts
are non-pensionable. 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The TSR graph is shown in the investor relations section of the
Corporate Governance report on page 63.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors’ service contract
notice periods to be no longer than 12 months, except in
exceptional circumstances. All current contracts contain notice
periods of 12 months. In the event of termination the Company will
seek fair mitigation of contractual rights. Within legal constraints, the
Remuneration Committee tailors its approach, in the event of early
termination, to the circumstances of each individual case.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of 
three years, which may be extended by agreement with the Board.
No Non-Executive Director is engaged on a service contract with
the Company.

The transfer value has been calculated in accordance with the Retirement Beneﬁts Schemes Transfer Values (GN 11), 6 April 2002.
The transfer values of the accrued beneﬁts represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another
pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the Director’s pension beneﬁts. The transfer values do not represent sums
payable or due to the individual Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
No Directors made any contributions to their pension in respect of the above during the year.

For the purposes of this report ‘Company’ means Inchcape plc 
and ‘Group’ means the Company and its subsidiary and
associated undertakings.
Business review
The information that fulﬁls the requirements of the business review
can be found in the operating review on pages 22-39, which is
incorporated in this Report by reference. Information on the
environment, employees, community and social issues is given 
in the Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 40-49.
Directors
The names of the Directors, including those Directors offering
themselves for election, plus brief biographical details, are given on
pages 52-53. Each Director held ofﬁce throughout the year except
Alison Cooper and Nigel Northridge (both appointed 1 July 2009)

Principal activities
A description of the principal activities of the Group and likely future

year are given in the operating review on pages 22-39.
Results and dividends
The Group’s audited consolidated Financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2009 are shown on pages 78-136.
Given the signiﬁcant downturn in the markets in which the Group
operates, the Board does not consider it appropriate to

Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.

as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are
aware of that information.

A qualifying third party indemnity (QTPI), as permitted by the
Company’s Articles of Association and sections 309A to 309C of the
Companies Act 2006, has been granted by the Company to each
of the Directors of the Company. Under the provisions of the QTPI the
Company undertakes to indemnify each Director against liability 
to third parties (excluding criminal and regulatory penalties) and to
pay Directors’ costs as incurred, provided that they are reimbursed
to the Company if the Director is found guilty or, in an action
brought by the Company, judgement is given against the Director.
Events after the balance sheet date
There have been no events after the balance sheet date.

Creditor payment policy 
The Company has no trade creditors (2008 – nil). The Group is
responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions including terms
of payment under which business transactions with the Group’s
suppliers are conducted. Whilst the Group does not follow any
single external code or standard, in line with Inchcape Group
policy, payments to suppliers are made in accordance with agreed
terms and conditions.
Employees 
The Company is committed to a policy of treating all its colleagues
and job applicants equally and to increasing the involvement of
colleagues through engagement activities. Full details can be
found in the Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 40-49.
We are committed to the employment of people with disabilities
and will interview all those candidates who meet the minimum
selection criteria. We provide training and career development for
our employees, tailored where appropriate to their speciﬁc needs, 
to ensure they achieve their potential. If an indivdual becomes
disabled while in our employment, we will do our best to ensure
continued employment in their role, including consulting them
about their requirements, making appropriate adjustments and
providing alternative suitable positions. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable
future. As such, the Company and the Group continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial statements in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare consolidated
Financial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the
Directors have elected to prepare the Group Financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent
company Financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under
company law the Directors must not approve the Financial
statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of
the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these
Financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether IFRSs are adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject
to any matieral departures disclosed and explained in the
Group and parent company Financial statements respectively.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and enable
them to ensure that the Financial statements and the Directors’
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group Financial statements, Article 4 of the ISAS
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintainance and integrity of
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are given on
pages 52-53 conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
• the Group Financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and
proﬁt of the Group, and
• the operating review on pages 22-39 of the Annual Report
includes a fair review of the development and performance of
the business and the position of the Group, together with a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Share capital
As at 31 December 2009, the Company’s issued share capital was
£163,245,735.18 comprised of 4,630,714,974 ordinary shares of 1.0p
each and 487,244,106 deferred shares of 24.0p each.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s
Report and Accounts; to attend and speak at General Meetings
and to appoint proxies and exercise voting rights. The shares do not
carry any special rights with regard to control of the Company. The
rights are set out in the Articles of Association of the Company.
There are no restrictions or limitations on the holding of ordinary
shares and no requirements for prior approval of any transfers. There
are no known arrangements under which ﬁnancial rights are held
by a person other than the holder of the shares.
The rights attaching to the Company’s deferred shares are set out 
in the Articles of Association of the Company. Holders of deferred
shares have no voting, dividend or capital distribution rights, save
for very limited rights on a winding up; the shares are not
transferable and do not confer any rights of redemption. 
Shares acquired through the Company share schemes rank pari
passu with the shares in issue and have no special rights. 
Signiﬁcant shareholdings 
Disclosures received pursuant to DTR5 are shown on page 62 and
these disclosures are incorporated by reference in this Report.
Share consolidation 
As announced on 10 March 2010, the Board intends to propose a
1 for 10 share consolidation of ordinary shares. The purpose of the
share consolidation is to reduce the total number of ordinary shares

appropriate for a listed company of its size and nature in the 
UK market. The share consolidation is subject to approval by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
13 May 2010.
Articles of Association 
The appointment and replacement of Directors are governed 
by the Company’s Articles of Association. 
Any changes to the Articles of Association must be approved by 
the shareholders in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, 
by way of special resolution.
The Directors have authority to issue and allot ordinary shares
pursuant to Article 7 of the Articles of Association and shareholder
authority requested at each Annual General Meeting of the
Company. The Directors also have authority to make market
purchases of ordinary shares and this authority is also renewed
annually at the Annual General Meeting. 
Change of control 
Save as described in the following paragraphs, the Company is not
party to any signiﬁcant agreements that would take effect, alter or
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a
takeover bid.
Certain of the Group’s third party funding arrangements would
terminate upon a change of control of the Company.
The Group’s relationship with its brand partners are managed 
at Group level. However, the relevant contracts are entered into 
at a local level,with day to day management being led by each
operating business. Certain of the contracts may terminate on 
a change of control of the Company.
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or
employee providing compensation for loss of ofﬁce or employment
that occurs because of a takeover bid, except for provisions in the
rules of the Company’s shares schemes which may result in options
or awards granted to employees to vest on a takeover, except for
Dale Butcher. Dale is entitled to receive an enhanced payment if his
contract is terminated due to a change of control of 12 months’
salary, a bonus payment based on the average of the prior three
years’ bonus payments, a deferred 12 month pension annuity and
a payment in lieu of use of his company car.
Key contractual and other arrangements 
Other than arrangements with SAP and certain of its third party
providers of ﬁnance, the Company’s contracts are at an operating
level rather than at Group level. As a result no individual supplier or
customer contract is signiﬁcant to the business.
Transactions with Directors
No transaction, arrangement or agreement required to be
disclosed under the Companies Act 2006 or IAS 24 ‘Related Parties’
was outstanding at 31 December 2009, or was entered into during
the year for any Director and/or connected person (2008 – none).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 11.00 a.m. on Thursday
13 May 2010 at J.P Morgan Cazenove, 20 Moorgate, London, EC2R
6DA . The notice convening the meeting and the resolutions to be
put to the meeting, together with the explanatory notes, are set out
in the Circular to all shareholders.
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have indicated their
willingness to continue in ofﬁce. A resolution to reappoint them as
auditors will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Accounting policies 
83
The consolidated Financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union, and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
Accounting convention 
The consolidated Financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except 
for the retention of certain freehold properties and leasehold buildings at previously revalued amounts (which were treated as deemed 
cost on transition to IFRS) and the measurement of certain balances at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going 
concern for the foreseeable future. 
As such, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. 
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures 
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for the first time for 2009. The Group has adopted, with effect 
from 1 January 2009, the amendments and revisions to standards noted below: 
The Group has adopted IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’ which replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment reporting’. The new standard requires segmental 
reporting to be presented on the same basis as the internal management reporting. This has had no impact on the results or financial 
position of the Group. All comparatives have been restated according to the revised segmental disclosure. Further discussion on the 
changes can be seen in note 1, page 90.  
IAS 1 (Revised), ‘Presentation of financial statements’ has been adopted by the Group, which prohibits the presentation of non-owner 
items of income and expense in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. It has had no impact on the results or financial 
position of the Group.  
The Group has also adopted the amendment to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ on a prospective basis from 1 January 2009.
Group policy states that where an asset is held for rental to others, for a period of longer than 12 months, it is held as property, plant  
and equipment and depreciated to residual value over the course of the lease. Upon expiry of the lease, when the asset is held for sale, 
it is transferred to inventory at net book value and upon sale of the asset, the subsequent revenue and the net book value are recorded 
on a gross basis, through revenue and cost of sales. The adoption of the amendment has not had a material impact on the results or 
position of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2009. 
Amendment to IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ requires enhanced disclosures in respect of fair value measurements and 
liquidity risk. While adopting the amendment, the Group has elected not to provide comparative information for these expanded 
disclosures in the current year in accordance with the transitional reliefs offered in the amendment. 
The following standards and interpretations have also been adopted by the Group but have not had an impact on the results or 
financial position for the period ended 31 December 2009: 
–  IFRIC 9, ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’ 
–  IFRIC 13, ‘Customer loyalty programmes’ 
–  IFRIC 15, ‘Agreements for the construction of real estate’ 
–  IFRIC 16, ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’ 
–  IFRIC 17, ‘Distributions of non-cash assets to owners’ 
–  IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from customers’ 
–  IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment – Vesting conditions and cancellations’ 
–  IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows: Presentation of a statement of cash flows’ 
–  IAS 32 (Amendment), ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’  
–  IAS 39 (Amendment), ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’. 
At the end of the reporting period, the following revised standards were in issue but were not yet effective. These standards have not 
been early adopted by the Group, and will be applied for the Group’s financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2010:  
–  IAS 27, (Revised) ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’  
–  IFRS 3, (Revised) ‘Business combinations’ 
–  IAS 28, ‘Investments in associates’  
–  IAS 31, ‘Interest in joint ventures’ 
–  IAS 38, ‘Amendment to IAS 38 Intangible assets: Recognition and measurement’ 
–  IAS 17, ‘Amendment to IAS 17 Leases: Transitional provisions’ 
–  IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ 
–  Amendment to IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payments group cash-settled transactions’.  Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial statements
Accounting policies continued 
84
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated Financial statements comprise the Financial statements of the parent Company (Inchcape plc) and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings (defined as where the Group has control), together with the Group’s share of the results of its joint ventures (defined as 
where the Group has joint control) and associates (defined as where the Group has significant influence but not control). The results of 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are consolidated as of the same reporting date as the parent Company, using consistent 
accounting policies.  
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated using the purchase method of accounting from the date on which control of the net assets 
and operations of the acquired company are effectively transferred to the Group. Similarly, the results of subsidiaries disposed of cease 
to be consolidated from the date on which control of the net assets and operations are transferred out of the Group. 
Where the Group acquires the minority interest in a subsidiary, the excess of the purchase cost over the book value of the minority 
interest is recorded as an addition to goodwill. No fair value exercise is performed for the acquisition of the minority interest. 
Where the Group acquires a controlling interest in a subsidiary with a contractual obligation to purchase the remaining minority, the 
acquired company is accounted for as a 100% subsidiary, with the liability for the purchase of the remaining minority recorded as 
deferred consideration. Subsequent changes to estimates of the deferred consideration are recorded as additions / reductions to
the amount of goodwill arising on acquisition. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the Group’s share of post-acquisition 
profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in shareholders’ 
equity are recognised in shareholders’ equity. If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its 
investment in the joint venture or associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has contractual obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate. 
Foreign currency translation 
Transactions included in the results of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated Financial statements are presented in Sterling, 
which is Inchcape plc’s functional and presentational currency.  
In the individual entities, transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing 
at the dates of the individual transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently retranslated 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement, except 
those arising on long-term foreign currency borrowings used to finance or hedge foreign currency investments which on consolidation are 
taken directly to shareholders’ equity.  
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. 
The income statements of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average rates of exchange for the period. Exchange 
differences arising from 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. On disposal of a foreign 
operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement.  
Revenue, other income and cost of sales
Revenue from the sale of goods and services is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, net of rebates and any discounts 
and includes lease rentals and finance and insurance commission. It excludes sales related taxes and intra-Group transactions. 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. In practice this means that revenue is recognised when vehicles or parts are invoiced and physically dispatched or when  
the service has been undertaken. Revenue from commission is recognised when receipt of payment can be assured. 
Where a vehicle is sold to a leasing company and a Group company retains a residual value commitment to buy back the vehicle for  
a specified value at a specified date, the sale is not recognised on the basis that the value of the asset will be realised over the lease period 
and from the disposal of the vehicle at the end of the lease period. These vehicles are retained within ‘property, plant and equipment’ on 
the consolidated statement of financial position at cost, and are depreciated to their residual value over the life of the lease. Total revenue 
on a leased vehicle comprises the difference between consideration received and residual value. This sits as deferred revenue on the 
consolidated statement of financial position and is released to the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the 
lease. The residual value commitment, which reflects the price at which the vehicle will be bought back, is held within ‘trade and other 
payables’, according to the date of the commitment. 
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably. Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable. 
Cost of sales includes the expense relating to the estimated cost of self-insured warranties offered to customers. These warranties form 
part of the package of goods and services provided to the customer when purchasing a vehicle and are not a separable product.  Financial

Share-based payments 
The Group operates various share-based award schemes. The fair value at the date at which the share-based awards are granted is
recognised in the consolidated income statement (together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity) on a straight line 
basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. For equity-settled share-based 
awards, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the awards granted. With the exception  
of the Group ‘Save as you earn’ scheme, the vesting of all share-based awards under all schemes is solely reliant upon non-market 
conditions therefore no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. Where an employee cancels a ‘Save as you earn’ 
award, the charge for that award is recognised as an expense immediately, even though the award does not vest. 
Finance costs 
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part 
of the cost of that asset from the first date on which the expenditure is incurred for the asset and until such time as the asset is ready for 
its intended use. A Group capitalisation rate is used to determine the magnitude of borrowing costs capitalised on each qualifying 
asset. This rate is the weighted average of Group borrowing costs, excluding those borrowings made specifically for the purpose of 
obtaining a qualifying asset. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 
Income tax
The charge for current income tax is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items which are not taxed or disallowed. It is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between  
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated Financial statements.  
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference is due to goodwill arising on a business combination, or to an  
asset or liability, the initial recognition of which does not affect either taxable or accounting income. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
using rates enacted at the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated income statement, 
except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to shareholders’ equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in 
shareholders’ equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle 
balances net. 
Exceptional items  
Items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items within their relevant consolidated income 
statement category. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide additional useful information regarding the Group’s 
underlying business performance. Examples of events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include gains  
or losses on the disposal of businesses, restructuring of businesses, litigation, asset impairments and exceptional tax related matters.  
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business combination over the Group’s share of the fair value of identifiable 
net assets of the business acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is held in the currency of the 
acquired entity and revalued at the closing exchange rate at the end of each reporting period. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. At the date of acquisition, the goodwill is 
allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested at least annually for impairment.  
Gains and losses on disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold in determining the gain 
or loss on disposal, except for goodwill arising on business combinations on or before 31 December 1997 which has been deducted
from shareholders’ equity and remains indefinitely in shareholders’ equity.  Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets, when acquired separately from a business (including computer software), are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses. Costs comprise purchase price from third parties as well as internally generated development  
costs where relevant. Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated useful life, which 
in the case of computer software is three to seven years. Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated income statement within ‘net 
operating expenses’. 
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination (including back orders and customer contracts) are capitalised separately 
from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition. These intangible assets are amortised over their estimated 
useful life, which is generally less than a year.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the purchase 
price and directly attributable costs of the asset and includes, where relevant, capitalised borrowing costs. Depreciation is based on 
cost less estimated residual value and is provided, except for freehold land which is not depreciated, on a straight line basis over the 
estimated useful life of the asset. For the following categories, the annual rates used are:  
Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings  2.0% 
Short leasehold buildings  shorter of lease term or useful life 
Plant, machinery and equipment  5.0% – 33.3% 
Interest in leased vehicles  over the lease term 
The residual values and useful lives of all assets are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Impairment  
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
In addition, goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested at least annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, the latter being the higher of the asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. Value in use calculations are performed using cash flow projections, discounted at a pre-tax rate which 
reflects the asset specific risks and the time value of money.  
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an 
allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within ‘net operating expenses’. 
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against ‘net operating expenses’ in the consolidated income statement. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their 
present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Used vehicles are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell, 
generally based on external market data available for used vehicles. 
Vehicles held on consignment which are deemed in substance to be assets of the Group are included within ‘inventories’ with the
corresponding liability included within ‘trade and other payables’.  
Inventory can be held on deferred payment terms. All costs associated with this deferral are expensed in the period in which they  
are incurred. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes.  
The major schemes are defined benefit pension funds with assets held separately from the Group. The cost of providing benefits under 
the plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. 
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in ‘cost of sales’ or ‘net operating expenses’  
in the consolidated income statement. Past service costs are similarly included where the benefits have vested otherwise they are 
amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period. The expected return on assets of funded defined benefit pension plans and 
the imputed interest on pension plan liabilities comprise the post-retirement benefit element of finance costs and finance income in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets, changes in the retirement benefit obligation due to experience and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which 
they arise.  
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated income statement in the period to which the 
contributions relate.  Financial
statements
Section
Three
www.inchcape.com 87
The Group also has a liability in respect of past employees under post-retirement healthcare schemes which have been closed to new 
entrants. These schemes are accounted for on a similar basis to that for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the advice  
of independent qualified actuaries.  
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation in respect of a past event, when it is more likely than not that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are discounted 
when the time value of money is considered to be material, using an appropriate risk free rate on government bonds.  
Disposal group and assets held for sale
Where the Group is actively marketing a business and disposal is expected within one year of the end of the reporting period, the assets 
and liabilities of the associated businesses are separately disclosed on the consolidated statement of financial position as a disposal 
group. Assets are classified as assets held for sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. Both disposal groups and assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. 
Segmental reporting 
Segment information is reported in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’, which requires segmental reporting to be presented on 
the same basis as the internal management reporting. The Group has identified operating segments, corresponding to the six main regions 
in which it operates. These segments are then categorised into the Group’s two distinctive market channels, distribution and retail. 
Financial instruments  
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: loans and receivables; held at fair value; amortised cost; and 
available for sale. The classification is determined at initial recognition and depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments 
are required.  
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except where the maturity date is more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. They 
are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently recorded at net realisable value.  
Held at fair value includes derivative financial assets and liabilities, which are further explained below. They are classified according to 
maturity date, within current and non-current assets and liabilities respectively.  
Amortised cost includes non-derivative financial assets and liabilities which are held at original cost, less amortisation or provision raised.  
Available for sale financial assets are the residual category and include non-derivative financial assets, such as bonds and equity 
investments. They are classified as non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of them within 12 months of the end of  
the reporting period and are held at fair value.  
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term bank 
deposits and money market funds.  
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents, as defined above, net  
of bank overdrafts.  
Leases 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at  
the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the consolidated income statement. Capitalised leased
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. 
Leases where the Group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis 
over the lease term. 
Offsetting  
Netting in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle 
net. As such, bank overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.  Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Derivative financial instruments  
An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to its financial instruments is set out in the Principal 
risks section of the Financial review. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at 
their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as:  
• hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or 
• hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or  
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). 
Fair value hedge 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the consolidated income 
statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The Group 
only applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on borrowings and future fixed amount currency liabilities (on its 
cross currency interest rate swaps). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings 
and changes in the fair value of those borrowings are recognised in the consolidated income statement within ‘finance costs’. The gain 
or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the consolidated income statement within ‘finance costs’. 
Cash flow hedge 
For cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that  
are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders’ equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. When the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability then,  
at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in shareholders’ equity are 
included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, 
the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same period in 
which the hedged forecast transaction affects the consolidated income statement. 
Net investment hedge 
The Group uses borrowings denominated in foreign currency to hedge net investments in foreign operations. These are accounted  
for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised 
in equity; the gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement in ‘net 
operating expenses’. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the consolidated income statement when the foreign 
operation is disposed of. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that point in time any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument which have been recognised in shareholders’ 
equity are kept in shareholders’ equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gains or losses that have been recognised in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement for  
the period.  
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the 
consolidated income statement. 
Investments  
The Group’s investments are classified as available for sale or held to maturity (where management has a positive intention and ability 
to hold the asset to maturity).  
Gains and losses on available for sale financial assets are recognised in shareholders’ equity, until the investment is sold or is considered 
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in shareholders’ equity is included in the consolidated 
income statement as part of ‘net operating expenses’. 
Held to maturity financial assets are carried at amortised cost. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Where the Group purchases the Group’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration 
paid is deducted from shareholders’ equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders’ equity.  
Dividends 
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the consolidated Financial 
statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised  
when they are paid.  Financial

Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
Judgements 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements which have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated Financial statements. 
Revenue recognition on vehicles subject to residual value commitments 
Where the Group sells vehicles sourced from within the Group to a finance provider for the purpose of leasing the vehicles to a third 
party, and retains a residual value commitment, the sale is not recognised on the basis that the value of these assets will be realised 
over the lease period and from the disposal of the vehicles at the end of the lease period. 
Consignment stock 
Vehicles held on consignment have been included in ‘finished goods’ within ‘inventories’ on the basis that the Group has determined 
that it holds the significant risks and rewards attached to these vehicles.  
Estimates 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have  
a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below: 
Product warranty provision  
The product warranty provision requires an estimation of the number of expected warranty claims, and the expected cost of labour  
and parts necessary to satisfy these warranty claims.  
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The net retirement benefit asset or liability is calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions as detailed in note 5. A number of 
these assumptions involve a considerable degree of estimation, including the rate of inflation, discount rate and expected mortality rates.  
Tax 
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. Some degree of estimation is required in determining the worldwide 
provision for income taxes. There are a number of transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such 
differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.  
In addition, the recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon an estimation of future taxable profits that will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. In the event that actual taxable profits are different, such differences may 
impact the carrying value of such deferred tax assets in future periods.  
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out above. The recoverable amount of 
cash generating units is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates including projected 
future cash flows (see note 11). 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. When an impairment review is carried out, the recoverable value is determined based on value in use calculations which 
require estimates to be made of future cash flows. 
Residual value commitments 
The Group has residual value commitments on certain leased vehicles. These commitments are an estimate of future market value at  
a specified point in time. The actual market value of vehicles bought back may vary from the committed purchase value.  Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

1 Segmental analysis 
From 1 January 2009, the Group has adopted IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’. IFRS 8 replaced IAS 14 ‘Segment reporting’. 
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to assess their performance and to allocate resources to the segments. 
These operating segments are then aggregated into reporting segments to combine those with similar characteristics. In contrast,  
the predecessor standard required the Group to identify two sets of segments (business and geographical), using a risks and  
rewards approach. 
The Group has determined that the chief operating decision maker is the Executive Committee. 
Under IFRS 8, the only change for the Group is that the businesses previously reported within the Rest of World segment under IAS 14 are 
reported within the other segments that best match the characteristics of each individual business. Comparative information has been 
restated accordingly. 
Emerging markets are those countries in which the Group operates that have started to grow but have yet to reach a mature stage
of development and accordingly were in, and are expected to return to, the growth phase of the development cycle. These currently 
comprise China, the Balkans, the Baltics, Poland, South America and Africa. 
The Group’s reported segments are based on the location of the Group’s assets. Revenue earned from sales is disclosed by origin and  
is not materially different from revenue by destination.  
Transfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis. 
Distribution comprises Vertically Integrated Retail businesses as well as Financial Services and other businesses.

Exceptional tax credit / (charge) 1.8 (3.6)
Total exceptional items (16.6) (86.1)
The impairment charge for property, plant and equipment of £10.3m arises from an impairment review of the Group’s business in Latvia 
which was updated following a further deterioration in trading conditions. 
The restructuring costs of £5.1m represent the costs of headcount reduction and site closures in Finland, the Baltics and Russia, together 
with changes in the composition of the Executive Committee. 
The charge for restructuring costs in 2008 related to the cost of restructuring the Group’s businesses in response to the downturn in the 
automotive industry and primarily represents the costs of reducing employee headcount and closing less profitable sites. 
The vacant property cost of £3.0m represents an onerous lease provision relating to a site occupied by the Inchcape Automotive 
business that was sold in 2007 and which went into administration in early 2009. The Group remains responsible for the head lease on 
this property. 
The goodwill impairment charge in 2008 was in respect of the business in Latvia and certain sites in the United Kingdom which have been 
sold or closed. 
The 2009 exceptional tax credit represents a deferred tax credit of £0.9m in respect of the future deduction for overseas redundancy 
costs in the local territories and a current tax credit of £0.9m in respect of onerous lease costs on UK properties.   Financial

5 Pensions and other post-retirements benefits 
The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its subsidiaries.  
The principal schemes are held in the UK and are final salary defined benefit pension schemes. Most of the schemes have assets held  
in trust in separately administered funds although there are some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and 
medical plans in respect of past employees. There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK. 
The majority of the overseas defined benefit schemes are final salary schemes which provide a lump sum on retirement, some of which 
have assets held in trust in separately administered funds and others which are unfunded. The overseas defined contribution schemes 
are principally linked to local statutory arrangements. 
a. UK schemes 
The UK has four main defined benefit schemes, namely the Inchcape Group (UK) Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Motors Pension 
Scheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme. These schemes are considered below: 
Open schemes 
Inchcape Group (UK) Pension Scheme 
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 on a market related basis and determined in 
accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method. The majority of the 
scheme’s liabilities are for pensioners and deferred pensioners, and the investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of 
equities and gilts. 
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme 
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2009 on a market related basis and determined in 
accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method. Whilst a majority  
of the scheme’s members are pensioners and deferred pensioners, a sizeable portion of the membership is still accruing benefits and 
the investment strategy reflects this with the majority of the assets invested in equities and bonds.  
Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme 
This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported in the United Kingdom segment in this note. The latest triennial
actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent 
professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method. A significant majority of the scheme’s members are pensioners 
and deferred pensioners and therefore the majority of the assets are invested in bonds. 
Closed scheme 
TKM Group Pension Scheme  
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2007 on a market related basis and determined 
in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method. The scheme has 
a prudent investment strategy and the majority of the assets are invested in bonds, cash or gilts. Approximately half the members are 
pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises. 
b. Overseas schemes 
There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement 
Scheme in Hong Kong. In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee. These 
schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.  
c. Defined contribution plans
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is £5.4m (2008 – £5.5m). There are no outstanding contributions  
to defined contribution schemes at the year end (2008 – £nil). 
d. Defined benefit plans
As the Group’s principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes. For the 
purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Group’s material schemes and these updates are reflected in the 
amounts reported below.

5 Pensions and other post-retirements benefits continued 
The rate of increase in healthcare cost is 5.5% (2008 – 5.5%) per annum but with higher increases in the first 10 years. 
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience. For the UK schemes, the
average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 22.6 years (2008 – 20.9 years) for current pensioners and 25.0 years  
(2008 – 22.5 years) for current non pensioners. Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore 
mortality assumptions are not applicable. 
The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset (principally equities
and bonds). The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected real rates of return on equities and
expected yields on bonds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled. 
The asset / (liability) recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position is determined as follows:

11 Intangible assets continued 
a. Goodwill 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which 
the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes. This may be at country, regional or brand level. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segments: 
2009
£m 
2008
£m 
United Kingdom  264.6  264.8 
Russia and Emerging Markets  216.5  214.8 
South Asia  17.9  19.6 
Australasia  11.0  9.7 
 510.0  508.9 
Goodwill additions in 2009 arise mainly from adjustments to the purchase price of the Musa Motors group under certain earn out 
arrangements (see note 27).  
Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired. 
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 December 2009.  
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections 
based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management. The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue 
growth / decline, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past
experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets. They also reflect expectations about continuing 
relationships with key brand partners. 
Cash flows after the five year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market. These growth 
rates reflect the long-term growth prospects of the markets in which the CGUs operate. The growth rates used vary between 0% and 5% 
and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets. 
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. The discount rate assumptions are based on an 
estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant CGU. The pre-tax 
discount rates used vary between 10% and 12%, and reflect long-term country risk. 
The assumptions used with regards to pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates in those segments with material goodwill
balances were as follows: 
Discount rate Long-term growth rate 
United Kingdom 11% 2%
Russia and Emerging Markets 11% to 12% 5%
South Asia 10% 1%
Australasia 11% 2%
Impairment 
No impairment charge has been recognised during the year ended 31 December 2009. In the year ended 31 December 2008, the 
goodwill in relation to the Group’s businesses in Latvia (reported in the Russia and Emerging Markets segment) was impaired by 
£46.8m following a significant deterioration in the automotive sector in that market which adversely affected revenue and trading  
profit. In addition, goodwill of £7.4m related to sites in the UK which were sold or closed was impaired in 2008.  
Sensitivities 
The Group’s value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the 
long-term growth rates. With the exception of the Musa Motors group in Russia and the Group’s business in Lithuania, a reasonably 
possible change in a key assumption will not cause an impairment in any of the other CGUs.  Financial

The value in use calculations for the Musa Motors group currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 20%. A 0.5% increase in 
the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would reduce the headroom available to approximately 5% of the 
carrying value. The value in use calculations for the Group’s business in Lithuania currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 
10%. A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would eliminate the headroom available. 
b. Other intangible assets 
Computer software costs consist of purchase prices from third parties as well as internally generated software development costs. They 
include both assets in the course of development and assets in operation. The amortisation charge is largely included within 
‘administrative expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.  
Other intangible assets include customer contracts and back orders recognised on the acquisition of a business. These intangible 
assets are recognised at the fair value attributable to them on acquisition, and are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful  
life (usually up to one year).  Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

In certain jurisdictions management holds bonds to offset future vehicle warranty obligations. To meet this requirement, management 
purchases and sells bonds regularly and does not usually hold the bonds to maturity. Accordingly, the maturity profile of the bonds is 
not necessarily an indication of when management intends to realise the associated future cash flows. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the bonds classified as available for sale.   Financial

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on credit terms of 30 to 60 days. 
Management considers the carrying amount of trade and other receivables to approximate to their fair value. Long-term receivables 
have been discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.  
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base across a number of 
geographic regions.   Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £30m (2008 – £24m) relating to tax relief on trading losses. The asset represents 
£122m (2008 – £101m) of losses at the standard blended rate of 24.8%. The asset is not recognised as it relates to losses which exist 
within legal entities that are not forecast to generate taxable income with reasonable certainty in the foreseeable future. 
The deferred tax asset of £1.3m (2008 – £1.8m) relates to trading losses in Belgium where future profits are anticipated with  
reasonable certainty. 
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £37m (2008 – £38m restated at the UK rate) relating to capital losses. The asset 
represents £132m (2008 – £135m) of losses at the UK standard rate of 28.0%. The key territory holding the losses is the UK. 
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. Due to the enactment of the 2009  
Finance Act, the majority of overseas reserves can now be repatriated to the UK with no tax cost. If all overseas earnings were repatriated 
with immediate effect, no tax charge (2008 – £71m) would be payable. 
The £20.2m deferred tax liability for ‘Provisions and other timing differences’ consists of a £33.5m (2008 – £45.2m) liability in respect of the 
net book value of tangible fixed assets that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations, and a £13.3m (2008 – £15.3m) 
deferred tax asset in respect of provisions and other temporary differences between the accounts base and the tax base. The key
temporary differences are £3.9m for Greece, £5.8m for Australia and £3.6m in other territories.

becomes due when title passes to the Group, which is generally the earlier of six months from delivery or the date of sale.  
An amount of £31.4m (2008 – £48.7m) has been provided against the gross cost of inventory at the year end. The cost of inventories 
recognised as an expense in the year is £3,892.8m (2008 – £4,308.8m). The write down of inventory to net realisable value recognised as 
an expense during the year was £14.6m (2008 – £31.5m). All of these items have been included within ‘cost of sales’ in the consolidated

Product warranty 
Certain Group companies provide self-insured extended warranties beyond those provided by the manufacturer, as part of the sale
of the vehicle. These are not separable products. The warranty periods covered are up to six years and/or specific mileage limits. 
Provision is made for the expected cost of labour and parts based on historical claims experience and expected future trends.  
These assumptions are reviewed regularly.  
Vacant leasehold 
The Group is committed to certain leasehold premises for which it no longer has a commercial use. These are principally located in  
the UK. Provision has been made to the extent of the estimated future net cost. This includes taking into account existing subtenant 
arrangements. The expected utilisation period of these provisions is generally over the next 10 years.  
Litigation 
This includes a number of litigation provisions in respect of the exit of certain motors and non-motors businesses. The majority of these 
relate to the exit of our former South American bottling business and shipping business. The cases are largely historic claims and are 
generally expected to be concluded within the next three to five years. 
Other 
This category principally includes provisions relating to residual values on leased vehicles, which are expected to be settled within  
three years.  Financial

Interest payments on floating rate financial liabilities are determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable in the 
relevant currency or market (primarily LIBOR or the local equivalent). 
The fair values of the Group’s borrowings are not considered to be materially different from their book value with the exception of the 
Private Placement which includes a fair value basis adjustment of £24.6m (2008 – £62.5m). 
The Group’s borrowings are unsecured. 
At 31 December, £nil (2008 – £370m) of the £500m syndicated credit facility that expires in 2013 was drawn down.  
In addition, the Group has a £35m bilateral facility which expires in 2010. 
US$475m of the Group’s US$550m Private Placement has historically been swapped into Sterling. During the year, US$114m of the 
US$550m was repaid to the loan noteholders, of which US$39m related to the original US$475m swapped into Sterling. It was replaced 
with an opposing US$39m swap (see note 23 for further details). US$275m is repayable in eight years and US$161m in 10 years.   Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

and other payables. The main purpose of these instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group also has various 
financial assets such as trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits which arise from its trading operations. 
The Group’s primary derivative transactions are forward and swap currency contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps.  
The purpose is to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from the Group’s trading operations and its sources of finance. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

b. Market risk and sensitivity analysis 
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The Group is not exposed 
to commodity price risk. The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, 
being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate. 
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: 
• changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are 
assumed to be recorded fully in equity; 
• changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates 
have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying  
value of debt; 
• changes in the carrying value of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in the US Dollar to 
Sterling exchange rate are recorded directly in equity; 
• changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement; 
• all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact  
on the consolidated income statement. 
c. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis 
The Group’s interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse 
movements in interest rates. Throughout 2009, the Group has borrowed at floating rates only (after taking into account existing interest 
rate hedging activities), with the exception of US$75m of debt which was fully repaid during the year. This approach maximises the 
Group’s exposure to the current low interest rate environment. If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the 
Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings. Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, 
forward rate agreements and options. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the 
floating rate interest payable on the Group’s 10 and 12 year loan notes, bank borrowings and supplier related finance. 
Interest rate risk table 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, 
of the Group’s profit before tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings.

d. Foreign currency risk 
The Group publishes its consolidated Financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net 
assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling. 
Hedge of foreign currency operating profit 
During the year the Group sought to partially hedge the retranslation of the Group’s forecast foreign currency operating profit by putting 
in place 50 currency put options with a total nominal value of £136.3m, at a cost of £8.6m. The primary objective was to hedge against 
Sterling appreciating during the year and therefore adversely affecting the retranslation of foreign currency operating profit. The 50 
options were equally split across five currencies, Australian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Euro, Singapore Dollar and US Dollar, with each 
option hedging one month’s operating profit. At the end of the year all contracts had matured and a gain of £0.1m (2008 – nil) was 
recognised in the consolidated income statement, net of the option costs. The nominal principal amount of outstanding contracts
at the year end was £nil. 
Transaction exposure hedging 
The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than in that 
unit’s reporting currency. For a significant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the 
relevant local currency. In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.  
The principal exception is for our business in Australia which purchases vehicles in Japanese Yen. 
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction 
affects the consolidated income statement. Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for the hedge effectiveness on an 
ongoing basis.  
Hedge of foreign currency debt 
The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with US$475m of the US$550m 
Private Placement. The effective portion on the gain or loss of the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the 
same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement. In May 2009, US$114.2m of the US$550m
Private Placement was repaid, of which US$75m relates to the net investment hedge of US$ assets. The remaining US$39m of repaid
debt was replaced with a new US$39m cross currency interest rate swap and under IAS 39 the US$475m fair value hedge relationship 
was de-designated and re-designated as a US$436m fair value hedge. A gain of £3.9m was recognised on the de-designation of the 
hedge relationship. In accordance with IAS 39, these hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.  
The remaining US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swaps are fair valued through the consolidated income statement and therefore 
not tested for hedge effectiveness.  
Net investment hedging 
Consideration is given to the currency mix of debt with the primary objective that interest on such borrowings acts as a hedge on 
foreign currency earnings. In accordance with IAS 39 the Group designated US$75m of the Private Placement as a hedge against  
US Dollar related assets in Hong Kong, Saipan and Guam. This relationship was de-designated in May 2009 when the US$75m of  
debt designated as a net investment hedge was repaid. 
Foreign currency risk table 
The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen  
(2008 – Japanese Yen and US Dollar) financial instruments. In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign 
exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.

e. Credit risk 
The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk. The Group 
monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where applicable) and through its policy of limiting its exposure 
to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.  
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where 
available. The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the 
credit risk arising through the use of these instruments. The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair 
value of contracts with a positive value. The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented  
by their carrying amount. 
Credit limits are reviewed regularly. 
The table below shows the credit rating and balances held with major counterparties at the end of the reporting period:

Fidelity –25 Aaa –  – – 
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia –13 n/a –  15 n/a
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by 
these counterparties. 
At 31 December 2009, total derivative asset balances included £90m which was held with three counterparties and total cash balances 
included £157m which was held with four counterparties. Total cash balances of £381m include cash in the Group’s regional pooling 
arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes. Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated 
statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net. As such, overdrafts are 
presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance. 
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base. Trade receivables 
include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the 
Group. An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house. Limits for the maximum 
outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly. Title to the vehicles sold on finance resides with the Group until cleared funds 
are received from the finance house in respect of a given vehicle.  Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

f. Liquidity risk 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through  
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the 
underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. Refer to  
the Financial Review on page 39, for discussion of liquidity risks to the Group.

g. Hedging activities 
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated 
statement of financial position at fair value. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy: 
• quoted prices in active markets (level 1); 
• inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (level 2); or 
• inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (level 3). 
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:

 18.5   91.0  109.5 
Liabilities 
Derivatives used for hedging  –   21.8  21.8 
Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted markets prices at the 
end of the reporting period. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (level 2) is determined by using valuation techniques 
which include the present value of estimated future cash flows. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market  
data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. 
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign 
exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation 
calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2009. 
The Group’s derivative financial instruments comprise the following:

The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of £0.9m 
(2008 – a gain of £2.8m). The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash flow hedges 
amounts to a gain of £0.6m (2008 – £0.4m). There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedges of net investments.   Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Cash flow hedges 
The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements
in exchange rates. The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 12 months of the end of the 
reporting period. 
The nominal principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at  
31 December 2009 was £587.3m (2008 – £464.7m). 
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders’ equity (see note 25) on forward foreign exchange 
contracts as at 31 December 2009 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 12 months of the end  
of the reporting period. 
Fair value hedge 
At 31 December 2009, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps. Four of these total US$475m which hedge 
changes in the fair value of the Group’s 10 and 12 year loan notes. Under these swaps the Group receives fixed rate US dollar interest  
of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays LIBOR +85bps and LIBOR +90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.  
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place following the US$114.2m repayment of the Private Placement 
in order to offset the required portion of the original US$475m swaps. Under the new swap the Group pays US dollar interest of 6.04%  
on US$39.2m and receives LIBOR +214bps for the 12 year notes only. The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the 
same critical terms. 
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations 
Further to the US$114.2m repayment of the Private Placement during the year, US$75m was de-designated as a hedge of the net 
investments in Hong Kong, Saipan and Guam which was being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk on  
these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing were transferred to equity, up until the point when the debt  
was repaid, to offset any gains or losses on translation of net investments in the subsidiaries. 
h. Capital management 
The primary objective of the Group’s management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy 
capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 
During the year, the Group issued 4,143,316,500 new ordinary shares of 1p each by way of 9 for 1 Rights Issue (see note 24). 
The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted 
EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings. The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was 
compliant with this covenant throughout the year.  
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the 
ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.

c. Rights Issue 
On 23 April 2009, 4,143,316,500 new ordinary shares of 1p each were issued by way of a 9 for 1 Rights Issue. The issue raised £234.3m  
net of issue costs of £14.3m. The structure utilised to facilitate the Rights Issue attracted merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies 
Act 1985 and as a result the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued was initially recorded as a merger 
reserve. Subsequent internal transactions required to complete the Rights Issue resulted in the excess of £192.9m being transferred to 
retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders. 
Prior to the Rights Issue, the nominal value of 25p of each existing ordinary share exceeded the proposed issue price of 6p of each  
new ordinary share. As it was not possible for the Company to issue shares at less than their nominal value, the existing shares were 
subdivided into one new ordinary share of 1p and one deferred share of 24p. 
The rights attached to the deferred shares, which are not listed, are limited. Holders of deferred shares have no voting, dividend or 
capital distribution rights, save for very limited rights on a winding up. It is intended that they will be cancelled and an appropriate 
reserve created in due course. 
d. Share buy back programme 
At 31 December 2009, the Company held 26,875,606 treasury shares (2008 – 26,875,606) with a total book value of £99.4m (2008 – 
£99.4m). These shares may either be cancelled or used to satisfy share options at a later date. The Group did not repurchase any of its 
own shares during the period ended 31 December 2009 (2008 – 4,460,000 shares were purchased on the London Stock Exchange). In 
2008, the total consideration paid was £16.0m and this was deducted from the Retained earnings reserve. The shares repurchased in 
2008 equated to 0.9% of the issued share capital.  
e. Substantial shareholdings 
Details of substantial interests in the Company’s issued ordinary share capital received by the Company at 9 March 2010 under the

Gains and losses on available for sale financial assets are recognised in the ‘available for sale reserve’ until the asset is sold or is 
considered to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is included in the consolidated income statement. 
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve is used to record foreign exchange rate changes relating to the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries 
arising after 1 January 2004. It is also used to record foreign exchange differences arising on long-term foreign currency borrowings  
used to finance or hedge foreign currency investments.  
Hedging reserve 
For cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that 
are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders’ equity. When the hedged firm commitment results in 
the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that 
had previously been recognised in shareholders’ equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying 
amount of the asset or liability.   Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

27 Acquisitions and disposals 
a. Acquisitions 
In July 2008, the Group acquired 75.1% of the issued share capital of the Musa Motors group for a total cash consideration of US$240m:  
a US$200m initial downpayment was made in 2008; a further payment of US$35m was made in October 2009; and a final settlement  
of US$5m is due in 2010. The remaining 24.9% is to be acquired in early 2011, with payment dependent on 2010 EBITA, capped  
at US$250m. 
During the year, adjustments have been made to the net assets acquired of the Musa Motors group, as permitted by IFRS 3, ‘Business 
combinations’. These fair value adjustments were not material and therefore prior periods have not been restated. The changes  
to the net assets acquired were primarily due to a decrease in amounts due to suppliers and an increase in various taxes when  
compared to original estimates. These changes, together with revisions to amounts due in respect of the remaining contingent  
deferred consideration, have resulted in an increase in the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition of £22.3m. 
b. Disposals 
During the year, the Group disposed of a small number of dealerships and operations generating disposal proceeds of £3.0m  
(2008 – £27.3m) and a loss on disposal of £0.7m (2008 – £1.2m) which has not been disclosed as an exceptional item.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the statement of the Directors’ 
responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the Group Financial statements and for being satisfied that  
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the 
Group Financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the Financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the Financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting  
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial statements. 
Opinion on Financial statements  
In our opinion the Group Financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2009 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;  
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion: 
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the Group Financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the Group Financial statements; and 
• the information given in the corporate governance statement 
with respect to internal control and risk management systems 
and about share capital structures is consistent with the 
Financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:  
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
• a corporate governance statement has not been prepared  
by the parent Company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the Directors’ statement, in relation to going concern; and  
• the part of the corporate governance statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the  
June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the parent Company Financial 
statements of Inchcape plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 
and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that  
is described as having been audited.

Accordingly, the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial statements. 
Foreign currencies 
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at closing rates of exchange and are taken to the profit and loss 
account. 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less provisions for impairment. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full (without discounting) based on current tax rates and law, on timing differences that result in an obligation 
at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future except as otherwise required by FRS 19 – Deferred Tax. 
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding commitment to 
sell the asset. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation in respect of a past event, it is more likely than not that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are discounted 
when the time value of money is considered material. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders’ 
funds until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration 
received is included in shareholders’ funds. 
Dividends 
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the Financial statements until  
they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Share-based payments 
The Company operates various share-based award schemes. The fair value at the date at which the share-based awards are granted 
is recognised in the profit and loss account (together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity) on a straight line basis over 
the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. For equity settled share-based awards, the 
services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the awards granted. With the exception of the ‘Save  
as you earn’ scheme, the vesting of all share-based awards under all schemes is solely reliant upon non-market conditions therefore  
no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. Where an employee cancels a ‘Save as you earn’ award, the charge 
for that award is recognised as an expense immediately, even though the award does not vest. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions of FRS 20 – Share-based payment, no charge had been recognised for grants of equity instruments made before 7 November 
2002. The Company adopts Amendments to FRS 20 in line with the Group’s adoption of Amendments to IFRS 2. 
Financial instruments 
The adoption by the Company of FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ has had no impact as the Company has taken advantage
of the exemption not to apply FRS 29 in its own Financial statements. The Group’s policies on the recognition, measurement and 
presentation of financial instruments under IFRS 7 are set out in the Group’s accounting policies on pages 83 to 89.  Financial

On 23 April 2009, the Company raised £248.6m (before issue costs) by way of a Rights Issue (see note 11). The structure used to
facilitate this resulted in the Company acquiring redeemable preference shares in a subsidiary company in exchange for ordinary
shares in the Company with a value of £248.6m. The redeemable preference shares were subsequently redeemed by the subsidiary 
company for a cash consideration of £248.6m. 
On 31 December 2009 the Company disposed of its investment in European Motor Holdings Limited to a subsidiary company, Inchcape
International Holdings Limited, for book value.

c. Rights Issue 
On 23 April 2009, 4,143,316,500 new ordinary shares of 1p each were issued by way of a 9 for 1 Rights Issue. The issue raised £234.3m  
net of issue costs of £14.3m. The structure utilised to facilitate the Rights Issue attracted merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies 
Act 1985 and as a result the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued was initially recorded as a merger 
reserve. Subsequent internal transactions required to complete the Rights Issue resulted in the excess of £192.9m being transferred to 
retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders. 
Prior to the Rights Issue, the nominal value of 25p of each existing ordinary share exceeded the proposed issue price of 6p of each  
new ordinary share. As it was not possible for the Company to issue shares at less than their nominal value, the existing shares were 
subdivided into one new ordinary share of 1p and one deferred share of 24p. 
The rights attached to the deferred shares, which are not listed, are limited. Holders of deferred shares have no voting, dividend or 
capital distribution rights, save for very limited rights on a winding up. It is intended that they will be cancelled and an appropriate 
reserve created in due course. 
d. Share buy back programme 
At 31 December 2009, the Company held 26,875,606 treasury shares (2008 – 26,875,606) with a total book value of £99.4m  
(2008 – £99.4m). These shares may either be cancelled or used to satisfy share options at a later date. 
The Group did not repurchase any of its own shares during the period ended 31 December 2009 (2008 – 4,460,000 shares were 
purchased on the London Stock Exchange). In 2008, the total consideration paid was £16.0m and this was deducted from the  
Retained earnings reserve (note 13). The shares repurchased in 2008 equated to 0.9% of the issued share capital.  
e. Substantial shareholdings 
Details of substantial interests in the Company’s issued ordinary share capital received by the Company at 9 March 2010 under the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 have been disclosed in the significant shareholdings section of the Corporate governance report.   Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Report of the Auditors 
144
We have audited the parent Company Financial statements of 
Inchcape plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise 
the Company balance sheet, the accounting policies and the 
related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the parent Company Financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
the parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the Financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2009; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and  
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the parent Company Financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the parent Company financial 
statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:  
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or  
• the parent Company Financial statements and the part  
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the Group Financial statements 
of Inchcape plc for the year ended 31 December 2009.

2 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Chairmans and Chief Executives report
This has been a very strong year 
for Caledonia, with our portfolio  
delivering a healthy 14.2 return for 
shareholders, taking our total AV 
to another record high and further 
extending our ten year market 
outperformance. This performance 
was well ahead of our year on year 
obective and, together with our 
increasing income generation, has 
supported our proposed 3.1 rise 
in the total dividend for the year, 
the forty-eighth year of consecutive 
annual increases.
ur portfolio is built on high uality 
businesses with strong prospects for 
the medium to long term. Coupled 
with our conservative cash position, 
we are well placed to capitalise on 
future opportunities and to meet our 
average annual return obectives of 
RPI3 to RPI over a ten year 
period.
Results
We are pleased to report that Caledonia’s portfolio has delivered 
another year of strong growth. The net asset value per share total 
return (‘NAVTR’), which measures the growth of the balance sheet 
capital and the income that it produces, was 14.2% for the year. This 
creditable performance is well ahead of our year on year objective 
of delivering average annual returns of between RPI+3% and RPI+6% 
over ten year periods and contributed positively to the ten year 
annualised NAVTR at 31 March 2015 of 8.6%. Our year-end NAV per 
share recorded a new high of 2906p and we were pleased to see 
that this has been reflected in our share price, which increased by 
just under 19% in the 12 month period. The board is recommending 
a 3.1% increase in the final dividend, which would result in an overall 
increase of 3.1% for the year, the forty-eighth consecutive year of 
growth in our annual dividend.
Caledonia strategy
Caledonia offers shareholders the opportunity to invest in a 
portfolio, much of which is not available to investors generally. 
The portfolio consists of four pools, each with a differing profile, 
not reflecting any single market or tracking any benchmark. Rather, 
it is the result of finding businesses that demonstrate attributes that 
fit our strategy – low gearing, cash generation and a strong position 
in their market place – and, particularly in the unquoted space, 
companies that prefer our offering as a long term provider of 
capital. By consistently delivering average annual returns over rolling 
ten year periods of between RPI+3% and RPI+6%, we aim to provide 
to shareholders a return that also exceeds the FTSE All-Share Total 
Return index over the long run.
The company’s ownership structure and the fact that we invest from 
our own balance sheet, rather than raising external funds, allows 
us to take a much longer investment time horizon than many 
institutional investors, often over ten years. The long term 
commitment of the Cayzer family and our open-ended approach 
also helps to attract other family-owned businesses and 
management teams seeking capital to develop their businesses 
without the pressure of a change of ownership every few years. 
Our investments in Cobehold and more recently Choice Care Group 
and Park Holidays are good examples of these.
Our longer term, collaborative approach has several other 
differentiating advantages. It allows management teams to invest 
in opportunities for their businesses that take time to bear fruit. 
It avoids the distraction of frequent corporate action that is the 
inevitable result where the providers of capital have to return funds 
to their own investors within a fixed period of time. It also requires 
less reliance on gearing to achieve the required returns, thereby 
taking less risk with the balance sheets of the companies we invest 
in. However, when capital is plentiful and competition is strong, we 
often find ourselves out-bid by others more willing to use higher 
gearing and pay prices that we consider too high. We would rather 
maintain a disciplined approach and preserve our capital than 
overpay for an investment, however attractive.  3
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
We also seek to diversify our assets by allocating capital to different 
geographies and currencies. We invest in funds, both quoted market 
and private equity, to gain exposure to economies such as Asia and 
the US, where we consider it more effective to use local managers 
than to invest directly ourselves. In addition, we enable shareholders 
to gain exposure to a carefully picked selection of direct quoted 
investments. These also reflect our cautious nature with our 
preference for established companies which have demonstrated 
the ability to produce compound growth over the long term, such 
as AG Barr, Bristow Group and Close Brothers – all high quality 
businesses which we have held for many years.
Investment performance
Our long term investment strategy, together with the high 
proportion of less liquid unquoted investments in our portfolio, 
means that performance is most effectively measured over the 
longer term. The board’s aim is therefore for Caledonia’s NAVTR to 
outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return index over rolling ten 
year periods. Our ten year investment horizon provides the 
timeframe for our portfolio to accumulate value, whilst optimising 
risk/return characteristics. We believe that targeting a performance 
range of long term RPI+3% to long term RPI+6% will lead to an 
outperformance of the FTSE All-Share over ten years.

Income and ongoing charges
Investment income for the year rose 15% to £47.2m which, after 
other income and expenses, fully covers the proposed dividend for 
the year. Growth in income has been a particular focus for us over 
the past five years and over this period has increased by 43%, driving 
the yield from the portfolio from under 2% to 3.3%, despite our NAV 
increasing by 38%. We believe the prudent way to run the company 
for our shareholders is to maintain a fully covered dividend without 
charging any of our management expenses to capital.
Our ongoing charges for the year were 1.22% of NAV against 1.03% 
for the prior year. The difference resulted largely from an increase 
in the cost of our share incentive plans, which reflected the recent 
strong performance of our NAV. Our business model of investing 
in unquoted companies requires more management resources than 
a purely quoted portfolio and therefore higher employment costs. 
We estimate that, based on an analysis of the expenses of other 
funds with similar investment focus to each of our pools, an 
equivalent ‘sum of the parts’ benchmark cost of running a fund 
with our particular attributes would be approximately 1.7% of NAV. 
We therefore believe that Caledonia’s self-managed model offers 
shareholders good value for money on a like for like basis.
Balance sheet and cash
Net cash at the year-end amounted to £131.0m against a small net 
debt position of £7.1m at the beginning of the year. This movement 
was the result of the proceeds from the sale of Oval in April 2014, 
distributions of cash by funds and top-slicing activity within our 
Quoted pool. Overall, during the course of the year, we invested 
£199.4m and realised £320.1m, not including investments and 
divestments made within the Income & Growth pool. 
We consider it prudent at this stage of the stock market cycle to 
have a cushion of cash which, alongside committed bank facilities 
of £175m, will enable us to take advantage of opportunities as they 
present themselves. This is especially important in the unquoted 
arena, where the precise timing of investments is generally more 
unpredictable. The board’s policy is to use modest structural gearing 
selectively within the individual portfolio companies, rather than 
borrow within Caledonia. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Chairmans and Chief Executives report continued
Overview of portfolio
The portfolio, before management expenses and other net assets 
were taken into account, returned 16.8% for the year under review. 
This bulk of the return came from the Unquoted and Funds pools, 
the latter returning an exceptional 45.2%, driven by Capital Today 
China (‘CTC’) and its investment in JD.com, which during the year 
listed on NASDAQ. It is important to point out that the performance 
of just about all of the underlying funds within the Funds pool was 
strong, although CTC was by far the biggest contributor. The 
Unquoted pool returned 19.2% over the year, with pleasing 
performances from two of our newer investments, Park Holidays 
and Latshaw Group. The Quoted pool produced a more modest 
return of 3.5%, following two consecutive years of over 20%, and 
was particularly affected by reductions in value of two of its larger 
holdings, Bristow Group and Weir, whose share prices were 
impacted by the falling oil price. The Income & Growth pool made 
a significant contribution to Caledonia’s income account, yielding 
4.3% net, as well as being on target for its capital return.

Net assets 1,445.6 1,626.9  14.2 
The Quoted pool allocation at 28% has reduced to below its 
strategic range of 35-50% of the portfolio. This is a consequence 
of both top-slicing and exiting non-core investments to take 
advantage of high valuations and discipline in waiting for some 
of our identified new investment opportunities to come with our 
target price ranges. The Income & Growth pool at 13% also remains 
slightly below its strategic allocation of 15-20% of net assets. 
Again, we have resisted the temptation to rush into what has been 
a popular and hence expensive sector of the market of late. 
See page 7 for details of portfolio allocation.
Overview of pool performance
Quoted (£448m, 28% of net assets)
We invest in companies with established business models, strong 
balance sheets and good returns on capital over the long term.
The Quoted pool produced a total return of 3.5% for the year. 
This followed two years of strong growth (25% and 21% in 2013 
and 2014 respectively), during which time the portfolio has 
continued to evolve in line with the strategy laid out in 2010. The 
companies within the pool now reflect the characteristics outlined 
above with only a few exceptions. We have added companies such 
as Jardine Matheson, Rolls-Royce, Microsoft, Atlas Copco, Oracle 
and Spirax Sarco, to long established holdings such as Bristow 
Group, LondonMetric Property, Close Brothers and AG Barr. Post the 
year end, we halved the holding in Avanti Communications to reflect 
the additional risk taken onto its balance sheet by a high yield bond 
issue in 2014. The Quoted pool team has a deeply researched list of 
target companies that it monitors closely, although we are unwilling 
to invest at current pricing levels. 
Of particular note was the sale of our entire holding in Dewan 
Housing Finance in India, banking a healthy profit on total sale 
proceeds of £52m. We top-sliced our holdings in Close Brothers 
and Quintain Estates, following strong share price performance, 
and exited our holdings in both Petroceltic International and 
Urban&Civic following mergers, as these were no longer core to the 
Quoted pool strategy. We added substantially to our initial holding 
in Rolls-Royce and established new holdings in Microsoft and Oracle, 
all of which have strong business models that produce compound 
investment returns over time. Rolls-Royce, in particular, is a business 
best viewed over the long term and we took advantage of some 
short term adverse sentiment in the market to build a position 
of £23m.
Unquoted (£510m, 31% of net assets)
We invest in unlisted businesses requiring capital and where our 
balance sheet is able to provide a long term perspective. We invest 
in both majority and minority positions.
The Unquoted pool returned 19.2% for the year under review, 
including £23m of income. We are careful to structure deals 
which allow a good flow of dividends back to shareholders, which 
necessarily and prudently means that we utilise relatively low levels 
of bank debt. We have an annual total return target of 14% for the 
Unquoted pool, and given a yield target of 5%, the capital growth 
requirement is not overly demanding. This, in turn, means that 
we do not have to invest in more risky companies to achieve 
our returns.
We sold our holding in Oval, the insurance broker, on 1 April 2014 
to Arthur J Gallagher, receiving £70m, a 2x return on invested 
capital, although we had already taken the uplift in valuation in 
the previous year’s results. Brookshire sold a portfolio of property 
assets, profiting from the narrowing of yields in the sector. In 
addition, Latshaw Group, a group of five US engineering companies 
in which we invested in 2012, sold one of its businesses and 
distributed to us almost the entire cost of our original investment. 
Pleasingly, strong profits growth at Park Holidays, a UK based 
operator of caravan parks, and TGE Marine, a German LNG 
engineering business, have pushed their valuations significantly 
higher.
The Unquoted team pursued several potential transactions that 
evolved from our deal pipeline during the year, but we were unable 
to secure any of the businesses at prices with which we were 
comfortable. The private equity market has plentiful availability of 
debt at present and is prepared to pay multiples of profit that leave 
little headroom for the unexpected to happen. We will maintain our 
discipline and continue to find opportunities where the fit with 
Caledonia and our values outweighs pure pricing considerations. 5
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Funds (£328m, 20% of net assets)
We invest in both private equity and quoted market funds, with an 
emphasis on providing exposure to areas of the world where we are 
less willing to invest directly.
The Funds pool return of 45.2% was principally attributable to the 
successful flotation of JD.com, which is a key constituent of Capital 
Today China, a private equity fund launched in 2006 with Caledonia 
as a cornerstone investor. As a result, the fund is our largest single 
investment, being valued at the year end at £103.6m, even after 
distributing £15.2m of cash during the year. However, strong gains 
were also made from the rest of Funds pool, in particular from the 
Asian portfolio of quoted market funds. Excluding the exceptional 
performance within Capital Today China, the Funds pool return was 
15.6% over the year. New investments were made during the year 
in four funds specialising in Asian listed equities at a cost of £60.9m, 
taking our overall exposure to £81.6m. 
Income & Growth (£202m, 13% of net assets)
The pool holds interests in 36 international listed businesses, which 
provide a reliable and growing dividend. Cash flow returns to 
shareholders are a priority for the companies in which we invest.
The Income & Growth pool exceeded its 10% total return 
requirement, returning 11.4% for the year. The pool invests in global 
listed companies that have a higher than average dividend yield. This 
has been a popular area in which to invest over the past few years, 
as central banks have reduced interest rates. Whilst past returns 
have been healthy, these sorts of companies are now more highly 
rated, which makes the task of producing our required level of total 
return more challenging, although we can counter this by running a 
more concentrated portfolio without increasing our risk or volatility. 
We are pleased to welcome Jonathan Greig as the manager of the 
pool, who joined us in January to succeed Stephen Mitchell who had 
managed the pool since its inception in 2011. Holdings within the 
pool include companies such as Pfizer, Novartis, General Electric, 
Zurich Insurance and Daimler, which fit well with our approach.
Share buy-backs and discount
The discount of Caledonia’s shares to its underlying net asset value 
has ranged between 12% and 26% during the year. This provided 
opportunities to buy back shares for cancellation, thereby producing 
a permanent benefit for all shareholders. During the year, the 
discount has mostly been toward the lower end of the range and 
we bought back £0.6m of shares. We will ask for the necessary 
shareholder approvals at the annual general meeting to be able 
to continue with these buy-backs for a further year, albeit within 
the constraints of the annual waiver that we seek under the 
requirements of the Takeover Code.
Dividend
The board is recommending to shareholders a final dividend of 
36.8p, giving a total dividend for the year of 50.6p, an increase of 
3.1% on the previous year. This would represent the forty-eighth 
consecutive year of increases in our annual dividend. Only a handful 
of listed companies have achieved such a long and consistent record 
and it demonstrates our long term attitude to investing. Subject to 
approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting to be held 
at Cayzer House on 16 July 2015, the final dividend will be paid on 
6 August 2015. 
Board
As heralded in last year’s annual report, Richard Goblet d’Alviella 
retired from the board in June 2014, with our thanks for the support 
he provided over his nine years as a non-executive director. 
He was replaced by Harold Boël, whose commercial and investment 
expertise gained at Corus and Sofina is already proving insightful.
Charles Allen-Jones also stepped down from the board just before 
year end after 13 years. His immense experience, common sense 
and wisdom will be missed by the company, as he has guided the 
executive management and the board through various challenges 
during his tenure. We are truly grateful for his immense contribution. 
At the same time, we were pleased to welcome David Stewart to the 
board, whose experience, both in the fund management world and 
working for family businesses, is particularly relevant to Caledonia. 
Shonaid Jemmett-Page will also join the board on 1 July 2015 and 
her experience at KPMG, Unilever Asia and CDC Group, as well as 
from her current non-executive portfolio, will be of great benefit 
to us.
Outlook
The European Central Bank has taken over the baton of quantitative 
easing from The Federal Reserve and Bank of England. Interest 
rates in developed economies are being held at artificially low 
rates, in some cases the quite extraordinary situation exists where 
customers are charged for leaving money on deposit, and it looks as 
though they will stay low for quite some time yet. The combination 
of these two policies drove asset prices up, bond yields to new lows 
and stock markets to new highs. Strong currency movements are 
also a side effect of such policies. Corporate profits, and in particular 
margins, remain healthy and the economies of both the US and UK 
seem to be on a steady, if unspectacular, growth trajectory. Asia is 
more difficult to assess, which is reflected in markets which are 
more reasonably priced.
Although the UK General Election is now behind us, we still face 
uncertain times with a US presidential election due next year. We 
believe that our portfolio and conservative cash position leave us 
well placed however challenging market conditions may be. We are 
invested in high quality businesses which have good prospects for 
the medium to long term. Our strategy is delivering performance 
for shareholders at an appropriate level and we are confident that 
the portfolio is well positioned for the future.

usiness model and strategy
Caledonia is a self-managed investment 
trust company with net assets of 
1.bn. ur heritage can be traced 
back to the shipping empire established 
by Sir Charles Cayer in 188. e have 
the backing of the Cayer family, which 
owns some 48.5 of the share capital 
and provides both support for our 
long term value investment horion 
and a foundation to our culture of 
conservative generational wealth 
management.
Business model
We aim to deliver long term growth to both shareholder capital 
and income by investing in a balanced, risk managed range of 
asset classes, across diversified sectors and regions. We focus 
on established businesses, where return on capital employed is 
a differentiator of longer term performance and where underlying 
real assets provide risk mitigation to the balance sheet. We use 
gearing cautiously and focus it within appropriate asset classes, 
principally to mitigate risk rather than to drive returns. This typically 
arises within the Unquoted pool, where the existence of preference 
share capital and structured loans provides both a level of additional 
security over assets and a mechanism for preferential annual 
income flows.
We have funding flexibility, through a £125m revolving credit facility 
in the company, which is used to mitigate any short term illiquidity 
within the portfolio, facilitating the bridging of short term 
investment flows. We also have a £50m revolving credit facility in 
a subsidiary treasury company, used to provide long term funding 
to subsidiaries and for liquidity management.
Our business model has been developed over many years to 
deliver long term growth in capital and an increasing annual 
dividend to shareholders.
Pools of capital
We manage our portfolio through distinct pools of capital, each 
headed by an experienced, specialist investment executive. Each 
pool invests to achieve target capital and income returns, combining 
to provide a managed total return for Caledonia.
	 The Quoted pool focuses on identifying opportunities to build 
meaningful positions in long term value businesses.
	 The Unquoted pool takes direct minority and majority stakes 
in private companies, where an opportunity exists to partner 
a strong management team with capital, without the traditional 
restrictions of short term private equity financing. We take board 
seats in all significant private company investments. 
	 The Funds pool contains investments in both private equity 
and quoted market funds, providing Caledonia with diversified 
overseas reach in areas where our investment model would 
make direct investing more difficult to manage. The Funds pool 
is primarily focused on investment in North America and Asia.
	 The Income & Growth pool provides an exposure to global 
companies offering higher dividend yield and dividend growth 
expectations. This pool provides both a reliable platform for 
our overall income requirements and a source of readily accessible 
liquidity. 7

Principles
We allocate our capital predominantly amongst quoted equities, 
private companies and funds. We identify a strategic allocation 
range to each of these classes commensurate with our overall risk 
and return objectives. These allocation ranges are reviewed 
regularly to ensure they remain consistent with our strategy and 
market conditions.

We look to achieve a diverse investment portfolio, managed

Despite a significantly sterling based asset portfolio, we achieve 
geographic exposure outside the UK through, in particular, 
our Funds and Income & Growth pool investments.
Overall exposures to geography, currency and asset classes are 
actively monitored and managed by our executive management,

We look to mitigate concentration risk by managing the value of an 
investment in any one company to less than 10% of our net asset 
value and will look for appropriate market opportunities to recycle 
value throughout the portfolio to achieve this in an appropriate 
timeframe. In recent years, our investment concentration has 
reduced.

usiness model and strategy continued
Manage and support investees
We manage our investments as pools  
of capital, focusing ownership and 
responsibility on our executive team. 
Where we take a board seat, we can 
both actively monitor the development 
of our investment and contribute long 
term support and governance.
Make significant investments
We invest directly in both listed and 
unlisted opportunities around the 
world. Our minimum investment size 
is £10m and we aim to invest between 
£25m and £100m for significant equity 
interests in companies.
Develop business network
Maintaining our reputation as a 
supportive and constructively involved 
long term investor enables us to develop 
our network of contacts, who will give us 
priority consideration when new deal 
opportunities arise.
Identify best opportunities
We adopt a disciplined process of research 
and due diligence to identify value 
opportunities in well-managed, long term 
businesses with established business 
models and strong cash flows. Such 
opportunities are typically not reliant on 
leverage for returns and offer long term 
growth potential.
Monitor and control risk
Individual investments and the investment 
portfolio as a whole are monitored for 
risk against our strategic objectives. 
Consideration is given to concentration 
exposure, volatility levels, liquidity and 
geographical and industry sector diversity.
Attract preferential deal flow
Our reputation, network of deal originators 
and family tradition enable us to access 
premium investment opportunities not 
always available to others. This derives 
from both tracking quality management 
teams in proven businesses and through 
the contacts we make through our 
extensive board representation network.
Investment process
Our investment process is built from a disciplined series of steps, 
leveraging Caledonia’s reputation and the experience of our 
investment team. We look to identify long term value through each 
stage, including sourcing opportunities and initial reviews, through 
due diligence, approval and deal execution. The performance of 
our investments is subject to a formal review process and both 
individual investments and the portfolio as a whole are periodically 
measured against a number of risk control metrics, including 
concentration, liquidity, volatility and sector and geographical 
diversity. In addition, we ensure that we have formal representation 
on the board of all our core private company investments and, 
where we have a significant holding, some listed investments.

Target returns
Our investment approach is aimed at delivering high single digit 
total annual returns, over rolling ten year periods. This investment 
horizon provides the time frame for businesses to grow and 
accumulate value in a controlled manner, within both the public 
and private markets, whilst mitigating some of the volatility inherent 
in short term trading investment strategies.
Over rolling ten year periods, we believe such an investment 
approach both optimises risk/return characteristics and 
outperforms most markets. Over a ten year investment horizon, 
we target a sustainable annual yield from portfolio assets, providing 
a balance to total return between income and capital appreciation.
We target real return and the chart below shows Caledonia’s 
annualised ten year rolling RPI adjusted net asset value total return 
(‘NAVTR’) growth, compared with the RPI adjusted FTSE All-Share 
Total Return index (‘FTSE All-Share TR’).

Investment review
Performance and analysis
ver the year, our investment 
performance delivered an AV total 
return of 14.2.
ver the last five years, we have 
rebalanced our portfolio substantially, 
increasing diversification, yield and 
portfolio liuidity whilst reducing 
investment concentration and the 
number of subscale investments.
Our investment process is at the heart of our current performance 
and future prospects. We have an unconstrained approach, which 
allows us to look across regions, sectors, size and time horizons. 
Fundamental to our choice of investments is our research and 
disciplined investment process.
Performance
Our NAV total return over the year was 14.2%, which built on a 
total return of 14.9% in the previous year. Over the year, we have 
developed our portfolio through significant new investment, funded 
by opportunistic disposals and managed top-slicing. The portfolio 
has benefited from significant revaluation and realisation gains, 
as well as higher levels of income. Our investment portfolio 
produced a 16.8% return, which, after management and other 
expenses, delivered an overall NAV total return of 14.2%.
The 16.8% portfolio return comprised increases in the valuation 
of our investments and the income that they yielded.

During the year, we realised £371.7m, around one-third resulting 
from the sale of Oval and other Unquoted pool realisations, another 
third from the sale and reduction of holdings in the Quoted pool 
and the remainder from fund distributions and recycling within 
the Income & Growth pool.
Net portfolio gains over the year totalled £179.5m, comprising 
£261.0m of gains, offset by £81.5m of losses. Over 50% (£96.5m) 
of net gains were generated by the Funds pool, principally due 
to the JD.com IPO and subsequent share price rise, reflected in 
the valuation of the Capital Today China fund. The Quoted pool 
generated £5.5m of net gains, the Unquoted pool £64.6m and 
the Income & Growth pool £12.8m.

region, with investments of £19.1m in the Macquarie Asia New 
Stars Fund, £15.0m in the Newton Asian fund, £14.9m in the Asia 
Landmark Fund, managed by New Silk Road, and £11.9m in the 
NTAsian Discovery fund, managed by NTAsset Management. We 
also increased our exposure to Asian private equity with a £6.3m 
investment in the Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia fund. This 
£67 .2m of investment in new Asian funds increased our exposure 
to this fast-growing region, through a range of established fund 
managers with a proven track record.
We also invested £6.7m in the Longleaf Global UCITS fund, managed 
by Southeastern in the US and investing in a concentrated portfolio 
of public companies in developed countries around the world.
Through the Quoted pool, we made new investments of £17.8m 
and £15.0m respectively in Microsoft and Oracle, the technology 
infrastructure companies. We also invested a further £19.9m in 
Rolls-Royce, the UK manufacturer of aircraft engines and other 
power systems. 
The £51.3m invested through the Income & Growth pool 
represented both an increased allocation of cash to this pool 
of £10.0m and changing holdings within the pool. This portfolio 
contained 36 companies at 31 March 2015 (40 at the previous year 
end), in a range of sectors across the globe, with stakes ranging in 
value from £2.3m to £8.1m.

Investment review continued
Performance and analysis
The overall return benefited significantly from the Capital Today 
China fund, resulting from the IPO and subsequent share 
performance of JD.com, one of its investments. We also saw 
significant uplifts in the valuation of some unquoted companies 
– principally TGE Marine, Park Holidays, Latshaw Group and 
The Sloane Club – resulting from substantial increases in earnings 
and property valuations.
Partially offsetting these gains, we recorded valuation losses 
in Bristow Group, as a result of the oil price decline, Avanti 
Communications, on the back of downgraded profit forecasts 
and rising debt, and in Polar Capital.
As a result of actively managing risk, Caledonia’s one year risk/return 
index (measured using the Sharpe methodology) has improved over 
the last three years.

Quoted pool
The uoted pool is a concentrated 
portfolio of listed euities.
ur focus is on mature, long term 
businesses with significant presence 
in their market space and where assets 
produce strong returns on capital, 
giving strength to their balance sheets.
The Quoted pool contains significant holdings in well managed 
companies, held for the long term. These investments typically offer 
substance, brand, intellectual property and strong market position. 
We target opportunities that have a long term record of return on 
capital employed and a strong asset base. In common with the 
wider Caledonia philosophy, we look to invest in companies whose 
business model emphasises a steady long term accumulation of 
value, consistent with our target returns and risk.
The pool started the year with investments valued at £497.8m and 
ended with a value of £447.7m, as the opportunity was taken to 
realise a number of non-core investments and top-slice others 
into a strong market. In total, £136.1m was realised. Non-core 
realisations included £52.4m from Dewan Housing Finance, and 
£13.3m from Petroceltic International. We top-sliced our holdings 
in Close Brothers and Quintain Estates, realising £15.1m and £14.6m 
respectively. New investments included £17.8m in Microsoft and 
£15.0m in Oracle and we added a further £19.9m to our investment 
in Rolls-Royce.
Including £11.4m of income, the Quoted pool achieved a return 
over the year of 3.5%, following last year’s return of 20.5%.
A number of strong performances contributed to the Quoted pool 
gains, notably from Dewan Housing Finance and Close Brothers, but 
these were substantially offset by reductions in the value of Bristow 
Group, Avanti Communications, Polar Capital and Weir. Overall, the 
Quoted pool achieved revaluation gains in the year of £5.5m.

Bristow Group is a leading provider of helicopter services to the 
offshore energy industry, quoted on the NYSE. We initially invested 
in Bristow in the UK in 1991 and saw it merged with the US-based 
Offshore Logistics in 1996. Bristow continues to make progress 
in both its Oil and Gas and Search and Rescue business lines. Its 
share price has been impacted by the fall in the oil price and also 
strengthening of the US dollar. The pool had top-sliced the holding 
in Bristow during 2014.
AG Barr, the UK soft drinks manufacturer, particularly notable for 
its Scottish soft drinks, Irn-Bru and Rubicon, had another good year, 
with earnings increased by some 5% and dividends by some 10%.
Close Brothers, the UK listed specialist financial services group, had 
a strong first half result to 31 January 2015, with increases across 
the banking and asset management divisions, dampened by 
a decline in the Winterflood brokerage business. Although we 
continued to top-slice our holding into a buoyant market, our 
investment returned 14.3% over the year.
Polar Capital, the AIM listed investment manager, saw increased 
profitability in its half year to 30 September 2014. However, a recent 
decline in its assets under management over the year from $13.2bn 
to $12.3bn at 31 March 2015 has had an impact on its share price, 
resulting in a reduction in the value of our holding. We provided 
initial capital for this business in 2001, which has now grown to 
support 11 investment teams, 23 funds and six managed accounts 
across a range of long-only and alternative products.
Avanti Communications, the AIM listed company supplying satellite 
broadband services to telecoms companies across Europe, Africa 
and the Middle East, posted increased revenues for the six months 
to 31 December 2014. However, downgraded growth forecasts 
and rising debt costs have reflected in its share price, resulting in 
a negative return to us over the year of 28.2%.
Quintain Estates, the UK listed property company, returned a 
negative 8.9%, compared with a positive 62.0% last year. Its buoyant 
half year results to September 2014, with increased profits and 
NAV and reducing debt burden, appear not to have been reflected 
in its share price.
We increased our investment in Rolls-Royce, the UK listed 
manufacturer of aircraft engines and other power systems, 
by £19.9m over the year. Despite static results for its year ended 
31 December 2014, the company had a record order book of £72bn 
(excluding a recent Emirates order for $9.2bn). The declining share 
price over the year resulted in a negative return of 6.8%.
Spirax Sarco, a supplier of engineered solutions for the design, 
maintenance and operation of industrial and commercial steam 
systems, posted strong underlying revenue and profit growth for 
the year ended 31 December 2014, however the international 
nature of its operations and the relative strengthening of sterling 
eroded most of this progress in its reported numbers. Spirax Sarco’s 
share price has advanced over the year, contributing to our 
21.3% return.
Jardine Matheson, the diversified business group focused on Asia, 
reported static results over the year. However, a recent increase 
in its share price has helped contribute to our 17.4% return from 
this investment.
LondonMetric Property, a UK REIT investing in commercial and 
residential property, principally in the UK, reported strong results 
across all key metrics in its September 2014 interim report, as it 
benefited from a structural shift in shopping patterns. This resulted 
in a 20.3% return to Caledonia whilst, at the same time, we reduced 
our holding.
During the year, we invested £17.8m and £15.0m in Microsoft and 
Oracle respectively, to gain exposure to these well-established, 
durable and cash generative information technology companies. 
Both performed well over the year, with Microsoft returning 8.6% 
and Oracle 27 .6%. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Unquoted pool
The nuoted pool contains both 
maority and significant minority 
holdings in private companies. ur 
focus is on established businesses, 
led by sound management teams, 
where our target investment sie 
of 25m to 100m provides a 
meaningful presence and growth 
capital supporting double-digit 
operating margins.
Principally as a result of the sale of Oval for £70.2m, the Unquoted 
pool has reduced in size over the year, from £568.3m at the start 
of the year to £510.3m at the end, after £104.1m of net realisations. 
Including £23.1m of income, the Unquoted pool achieved a return 
over the year of 19.2%, building on a return of 17 .7% last year.
After an active year of acquisition in 2014, the Unquoted pool 
focused on building value within its portfolio during this year. 
The pool as a whole has seen significant revaluation gains in the 
year, principally reflecting strong underlying earnings growth.
On 1 April 2014, we sold our 23.2% holding in Oval, a leading 
provider of insurance broking and financial services in the UK, to 
Arthur J Gallagher of the US for £70.2m, as part of its acquisition 
of the entire Oval group.
In May 2014, we syndicated 7 .7% of our holding in Park Holidays, 
the UK caravan parks operator acquired in November 2013, 
for £7 .0m.
In November 2014, we received a distribution from Latshaw Group 
on the sale of one of its companies, Coast Wire & Plastic Tech Inc, 
a manufacturer of custom electronic wire and cable products for  
the medical, instrumentation and commercial electronics industries.

Park Holidays is based in the south of England and owns and 
operates a portfolio of 24 caravan parks. We acquired a controlling 
stake in the company in November 2013 for £88.1m, with a strategy 
of building value through continuing to grow the parks’ profits, 
selective capital expenditure, operational improvement and new 
park acquisition. Park Holidays has had a strong year, with revenue 
and profits well ahead of the prior year and continuing prospects for 
growth. We have revalued our holding upwards to £101.1m at the 
year end, giving a 27 .4% return over the year.
Cobehold is a Belgium-based investment company with holdings 
in companies with long term growth prospects throughout Europe. 
Its portfolio of unquoted investments made steady progress 
throughout the year, maintaining capital values and increasing the 
dividend paid to shareholders. The NAV of Cobehold increased by 
5.2% over the year, but the 14.3% depreciation in the value of the 
euro has caused our sterling value to decline, resulting in a negative 
return of 6.7% over the year.
TGE Marine, the Germany-based designer and supplier of cargo 
handling systems for liquid gas carrying ships and offshore units, had 
an excellent year, with significantly increased revenue and earnings. 
TGE Marine paid a dividend of £5.8m in the year. As a result of the 
excellent trading and improved prospects, the euro valuation has 
increased by some 90%. Our sterling return from TGE Marine has 
been impacted by the weakened euro and was 84.8%.
The Sloane Club is a premium residential club situated in central 
London near Sloane Square. The Club traded well in 2015, increasing 
both its revenue and earnings. As a result, we have marked up the 
value of the Club by nearly 25%. With a dividend of £1.4m, this has 
resulted in a return of 28.7% over the year.
Choice Care Group, based in the south of England, operates 
a portfolio of 52 residential learning disability homes, as well 
as providing supported living services in the same area. The estate  
is well invested and represents a solid platform for future 
developments. Following our acquisition of a controlling stake in 
2013, the business has pursued a strategy of developing new 
homes, as well as extending its supported living business. Significant 
investment has been made in new capacity over the year, adding 
19 new beds with agreement to add an additional 65 during 2016. 
We have maintained our valuation at the year end.
Sterling Industries, the international engineering business, 
specialising in the global supply of combustion and heat transfer 
technology and services, posted good trading results and paid a 
dividend of £3.5m. Although the valuation was little changed from 
last year, the substantial dividend enabled Sterling to return 7.3% 
over the year.
Latshaw Group comprises a number of US engineering businesses in 
sectors including mechanical wiring looms for oncology equipment 
and controls for domestic tools. The group has traded well over 
the year. In September 2014, Coast Wire & Plastic Tech Inc, a 
manufacturer of custom electronic wire and cable products for the 
medical, instrumentation and commercial electronics industries, 
was sold and Latshaw made a substantial capital distribution to us 
of £15.1m. In addition, Latshaw paid an income distribution to us of 
£4.7m, after receiving dividends from the underlying companies.
Bowers & Wilkins is a premium audio manufacturer headquartered 
in the UK. The business continued its development in the 
automotive and streaming spaces, whilst Bowers’ core product 
range sold well throughout the world. Caledonia received a dividend 
during the year and gearing levels reduced in line with 
management’s focus on reducing inventory. We have maintained 
our valuation at the year end.
Satellite Information Services, the UK media group, continued 
to build its media and betting rights inventory over the year. 
We have maintained our valuation of this business at the year end. 
The company paid a dividend to shareholders, resulting in a return

Funds pool
The Funds pool comprises investments 
in private euity and uoted market 
collective investment vehicles, 
structured through companies, limited 
partnerships and open-ended funds.
ur fund investments provide broad 
exposure to areas of the world where 
it would prove more difficult for us 
to invest directly.
The Funds pool had an excellent year, with a total return of 45.2%. 
The principal component of this return was the increased valuation 
of the Capital Today China fund, following the IPO of JD.com, the 
Chinese e-commerce business, in May 2014. However, even 
excluding this exceptional performance from Capital Today China, 
the Funds pool return was 15.6% for the year. The pool started 
the year at £204.4m and ended at £327.7m, after net investment 
of £29.0m.
The Funds pool contains investments in private equity and quoted 
market funds principally in North America and Asia. Investment 
through funds enables us to broaden our geographic and sector 
spread, by taking advantage of managers’ specialist knowledge 
and ensures exposure to areas of the world where we are less willing 
to invest directly.
The nature of the longer term investment process within the Funds 
pool requires the continuous origination and investment in new 
funds, to ensure both effective vintage management and a balance 
between maturing funds and those at the initial stages, where 
returns are naturally phased to later years.
During the year, we committed to three new private equity funds –  
$50m (£33.7m) to FLAG Private Equity VI, $20m (£13.4m) to Asia 
Alternatives IV and $25m (£16.8m) to Morgan Stanley Private Equity 
Asia. In addition, we invested in five new quoted market funds –  
£19.1m in Macquarie Asia New Stars, £14.9m in Asia Landmark, 
£15.0m in Newton Asian Income, £119m in NTAsian Discovery Fund 
and £6.7m in Longleaf US UCITS, whilst making an additional £6.7m 
investment in Arlington.
FLAG Private Equity VI is a fund of private equity funds, investing 
in buy-out managers operating in the US lower-mid market. Asia 
Alternatives IV is another fund of private equity funds, but focused 
on the Asian markets. In both cases we are invested in their previous 
funds. Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia has an excellent record 
over two decades of investing in leading businesses in Asia with 
strong value propositions.
Macquarie Asia New Stars, Asia Landmark (managed by New Silk 
Road) and Newton Asian Income invest in quoted companies  
in Asia. Longleaf US UCITS, managed by Southeastern Asset 
Management in the US, invests in US securities that it believes 
to be significantly undervalued.

Realisations in the year comprised £40.0m from the sale of securities 
and fund interests and £35.0m from fund distributions. Included in 
the sale of securities were £11.1m from the sale of TCL and 
Omniport from our Nova Capital managed portfolio, the realisation 
of our Polar Capital Global Financials Trust holding for £9.6m and the 
sale of our India Capital Growth Fund shares for £6.9m. During the 
year, we also sold our interests in the Pragma Capital private equity 
funds for £11.0m and in Crescendo IV for £0.8m. Fund distributions 
included £15.2m from Capital Today China, resulting from the sale 
of part of its holding in JD.com.
The Capital Today China Growth Fund is managed by Capital Today 
and provides growth capital to Chinese companies, focusing on the 
consumer, retail and internet sectors. The investment in JD.com, 
the Chinese e-commerce company, has been particularly successful.  
JD.com completed its IPO on NASDAQ in May 2014, raising $1.8bn. 
Capital Today has subsequently sold part of its holding in JD.com, 
resulting in a £15.2m distribution to us. The particular success of  
JD.com has led to a significant increase in the valuation of this fund, 
resulting in a return to Caledonia of 177 .0% over the year. We 
continue to adjust the manager’s quarterly valuation of the Capital 
Today China fund with the share price of JD.com at the reporting 
date.
Perlus Microcap is a long-only quoted market fund investing in small

record, being 54.7% ahead of the Russell Value Index, since its 
August 2008 inception. Our investment in this fund returned 22.7% 
over the year. Subsequent to the year end, we have commenced a 
process of realising a portion of our investment in this fund in order 
to rebalance our North American quoted market fund portfolio. 
Macquarie Asia New Stars is a quoted market fund managed by 
Macquarie Investment Management in Hong Kong, which aims to 
capture the potential growth of small and mid-sized companies in 
Asia (ex-Japan). We invested £19.1m in November 2014 and, over 
the four months of ownership, the fund has increased in value 
by 13.5%, delivering a return of 38.8%. 
The Asia Landmark fund was established in 2009 and is managed 
by New Silk Road Investment in Singapore. It invests in Asian 
companies with the aim of achieving superior long term absolute 
returns through an independent, fundamentals-based, value-driven 
investment process. We invested £14.9m in this fund in May 2014, 
which has generated a return of 13.8% over the year.
At the year end, our fund commitments, including commitments to 
funds held in a subsidiary investment entity, amounted to £120.1m

Income & Growth pool
The Income  Growth pool comprises  
a geographical and sector balanced 
portfolio of investments in up to 
45 international blue chip businesses, 
targeting yields for the pool as a whole 
of 4.5 net.
The Income & Growth pool comprises a geographical and sector 
balanced portfolio of currently 36 investments in mainly global blue 
chip companies with strong balance sheets, above average returns 
and demonstrable histories of creating shareholder value. All 
investments have strong organic growth potential in tandem with 
a high dividend yield.
Over the year, the Income & Growth pool invested £51.3m, of which 
£10.0m was new funding, and realised £51.6m, as we rebalanced 
the portfolio. Net dividend income during the year was £8.7m, 
representing a net yield of 4.3% on the average invested capital. 
Overall, the value of the pool grew over the year from £189.6m to 
£202.1m, representing 13% of Caledonia’s net assets.
The Income & Growth pool was created in March 2011, and has 
had £166.0m of investment to date, and, over the four years of its 
existence, produced a return of 43.9%, giving an annualised rate 
of 9.5%.

Following a relatively subdued market in the first half of the year, 
but fuelled by the Federal Reserve Bank completing its quantitative 
easing tapering programme, the pool had a strong second half year 
and produced a total return for the year of 11.4%, including a net 
yield of 4.3%.
Solid performance came from developed markets, with US, UK and 
European equities all contributing to returns. Europe in particular 
came back strongly in the second half of the year and the pool 
added a number of European holdings, including Daimler, the 
German maker of Mercedes cars and trucks, Roche, the Swiss 
pharmaceuticals company, British American Tobacco, the 
international tobacco company, and Telenor, the Norwegian mobile 
telecommunications provider. Good returns came from Novartis,

The strength of the companys 
balance sheet has continued to reflect 
our longer term approach to capital 
accumulation, whilst benefiting from 
a managed growth in revenue income 
to support a record of 48 consecutive 
years of dividend growth.
Caledonia’s net asset value increased over the year to £1,626.9m 
at 31 March 2015, from £1,445.6m at the start of the year. The

Total return
The company seeks to generate total return from both investment 
income, net of expenses, and capital growth. For the year ended  
31 March 2015, the total return was £205.9m (2014 – £184.2m), of 
which £29.6m (2014 – £28.7m) derived from income and £176.3m 
(2014 – £155.5m) from capital.
Revenue performance
Investment income in the year of £47.2, including £0.4m from 
unallocated investments, was significantly higher than last year’s 
£41.1m. The Income & Growth pool contributed £1.7m more than 
in 2014, reflecting first time dividends from investments initiated 
late last year and a progressive shift to higher-yielding investments. 
The Funds pool received £1.9m more income than last year, due 
principally to income distributions by the CBPE private equity funds 
on realisation of several of their investments. The Unquoted pool 
yielded £23.1m, similar to last year, but with last year’s substantial 
income from The Sloane Club, Amber Chemicals (sold on 31 March 
2014) and Oval (sold on 1 April 2014) replaced with receipts from 
TGE Marine, Park Holidays, Choice Care Group and Latshaw Group.
Investment income represented a net yield on the monthly average 
portfolio of 3.3%, compared with 3.2% last year.
Capital performance
Net gains on investments totalled £179.9m (2014 – £151.4m), 
including £0.4m of gains on unallocated investments (2014 – £0.6m 
of gains). The principal individual gain was £74.0m from the Capital 
Today China fund, arising from the successful IPO of JD.com, the 
Chinese e-commerce company, in which the fund held a substantial 
stake. Significant gains also arose from TGE Marine, Dewan Housing 
Finance, Park Holidays and Latshaw Group. These gains more than 
offset our investment losses, the most significant of which were 
Bristow Group, Avanti Communications and Polar Capital.
Overall, across the entire portfolio, looking through subsidiary 
investment entities, listed investments contributed £17 .5m to the 
valuation gains, and unlisted investments contributed £162.0m. 23

The company maintains a prudent valuation approach to all 
investments. Internal valuations of investments are conducted in 
accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital 
Valuation Guidelines. Adjustments are normally made to earnings 
multiples – generally of around 30% – to account for points of 
difference between the comparators and the company being 
valued, most significantly reflecting relative marketability and scale. 
Unlisted property and fund investments are based on external 
valuations.
The following chart summarises the source of valuations across the

Expenses
Caledonia allocates all expenses, other than transaction costs, to 
revenue. Our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.22% (2014 – 
1.03%). We calculate our ongoing charges ratio on an industry 
standard basis, comprising published management expenses over 
the monthly average NAV.
Overall, the company’s revenue column management expenses 
were higher than last year at £18.3m (2014 – £13.6m). This primarily 
reflected a credit last year to expenses in respect of the 2011 
performance share awards having failed to meet their performance 
targets, together with an increase in share-based payment expenses 
and reorganisation costs.
Dividend
We recognise that a reliable source of growing dividends is an 
important part of shareholder total return over both the short and 
longer terms and have extended our record of growing annual 
dividends to 48 consecutive years.
We paid an interim dividend of 13.8p per share on 8 January 2015 
and have proposed a final dividend of 36.8p per share. The total 
dividend for the year of 50.6p is an increase of 3.1% on last year.
Including the proposed final dividend, the dividends to be paid out 
of revenue earnings for the year ended 31 March 2015 totalled 
£27.9m, which was more than covered by the profit for the year 
of £29.6m.
If approved, the final dividend will be payable on 6 August 2015 to 
holders of shares on the register on 10 July 2015. The ex-dividend 
date will be 9 July 2015.
Cash flows, liquidity and facilities
Over the year, we moved from opening net debt of £7.1m to net 
cash of £131.0m, principally due to net portfolio realisations.

Treasury management
The Treasury department provides a central service to group 
companies and conducts its operations in accordance with clearly 
defined guidelines and policies, which have been reviewed and

as a consequence of underlying commercial transactions or 
exposures and do not seek to take active risk positions. It is 
Treasury’s role to ensure that the group has sufficient available 
funds to meet its needs in the foreseeable future.

Valuation methodology
Investments are measured at the directors’ estimate of fair value 
at the reporting date, in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could 
be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s 
length transaction.
Publicly traded securities
Investments listed in an active market are valued at their bid price 
on the reporting date. When a bid price is unavailable, the price 
of the most recent transaction will normally be used.
Unlisted companies
Unlisted company investments are valued by applying an 
appropriate valuation technique, which makes maximum use of 
market-based information, is consistent with models generally used 
by market participants and is applied consistently from period to 
period, except where a change would result in a better estimation  
of fair value.
The value of an unlisted company investment is generally 
crystallised through the sale or flotation of the entire business, 
rather than the sale of an individual instrument. Therefore, the 
estimation of fair value is based on the assumed realisation of 
the underlying business at the reporting date, based on the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines (December 2012). Recognition is given to the 
uncertainties inherent in estimating the fair value of unlisted 
companies and appropriate caution is applied in exercising 
judgments and making the necessary estimates.
Enterprise value is normally determined using one of the 
following valuation methodologies:
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was recently acquired or 
a recent transaction has taken place, its cost or transaction price 
will generally provide a good indication of fair value. This 
methodology is likely to be appropriate only for a limited period 
after the date of the relevant transaction.
Multiples
This methodology involves the application of an earnings multiple 
to the maintainable earnings of the business and is likely to be 
appropriate for an investment in an established business with 
an identifiable stream of continuing earnings.
The earnings multiple used is determined by reference to market-
based multiples appropriate for the business and correlating to the 
period and calculation of earnings of the company being valued. 
The aim is to identify comparator companies that are similar in 
terms of risk and growth prospects to the company being valued. 
Earnings multiples are adjusted for points of difference between 
the comparator and the company being valued where appropriate, 
including the ability of Caledonia to effect change in the company 
and risks associated with holding an unlisted share.
Maintainable earnings balance reliability and relevance. Generally, 
the latest historical accounts are used unless reliable forecast results 
for the current year are available. Earnings are adjusted where 
appropriate for exceptional or non-recurring items and an average 
of more than one year’s earnings may be used to estimate 
maintainable earnings for cyclical or volatile businesses.
Net assets
The net assets methodology is likely to be appropriate for a business 
whose value derives mainly from the underlying value of its assets 
rather than its earnings, such as a property holding company or an 
investment business. It may also be appropriate for a business that  
is not making an adequate return on assets and for which a greater 
value can be realised by liquidating the business and selling its 
assets. A third party valuation may be used to give the fair value 
of a certain asset or group of assets.
Fund interests
Fund interests refer to participations in arrangements to create 
a designated pool of capital to invest in a wider range of assets than 
is feasible for an individual investor and to share the costs and 
benefits.
Open-ended funds, including investment companies with variable 
capital, typically report regular net asset values, which usually 
provide a reliable basis to estimate fair value. If the price reported 
by the fund is not available at the reporting date, the latest available 
price is used and may be adjusted to take account of changes or 
events to the reporting date.
Closed-ended funds include unlisted investment companies and 
limited partnerships. For these investments, the fair value estimate 
is based on a summation of the estimated fair value of the 
underlying investments. Fund manager valuation reports may be 
used where there is evidence that the valuation is derived using fair 
value principles and may be adjusted to take account of changes or 
events to the reporting date. Adjustment may also be necessary for 
features of the fund agreement not captured in the valuation report, 
such as performance fees or carried interest.
Other investments
Other investments include preference shares, loan notes or facilities, 
options, warrants and treasury instruments that are not publicly 
traded and do not form part of an investment in an unlisted 
company. For such investments, appropriate valuation techniques 
are adopted and used consistently.  25

Risk management
Effective risk management is a key 
component of the companys business 
model and assists in ensuring that the 
different parts of the group operate 
within strategic risk parameters. The 
board has overall responsibility for 
setting and monitoring the companys 
risk appetite.
Caledonia risk governance and structure
Risk management and its governance is the responsibility of the 
board, with the executive given the task of ensuring an effective 
and transparent process to ensure risks are identified, documented, 
assessed and, where appropriate, mitigated. The board sets the 
risk appetite within the business model and this is communicated 
through the executive to all those with managerial responsibilities. 
Risks emanate from all parts of the business and are considered by 
all executives as part of their work, from origination of investments 
to ongoing monitoring and portfolio management. 
The Audit Committee assesses and monitors the risk management 
processes and structure and specifically reviews the controls 
assurance programme. This programme identifies key mitigating 
controls, tests their operation and reports on compliance and 
effective operation. This, together with reports arising from the 
external audit, provides input to the board as a whole on the status 
of the risk management process.

Risk management reporting
Caledonia manages and reports risk through two primary areas 
of focus – an overall business risk report and a portfolio investment 
risk report.
The business risk report considers the wider business environment 
of the group, including business continuity planning, IT and cyber 
security risks, regulatory risks and financial control risks. Caledonia 
manages business risk through a number of integrated processes 
and procedures operating throughout the year to provide risk 
visibility to both the executive team and the wider board. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Risk management continued
Principal risks Mitigation ey developments
Strategic
Risks in relation to the appropriateness of the business model to 
deliver long term growth in capital and income and the effective 
communication and delivery of the business model.
Strategic risks include the appropriate allocation of capital in relation 
to geographic, sector and currency exposures.
The company’s business model and strategy are reviewed 
periodically, against market conditions and target returns.
The performance of the company and its key risks are 
monitored regularly by management and the board.
	 Caledonia has developed its risk monitoring procedures 
to ensure that there is a clear and monitored strategic 
alignment of the portfolio to the agreed strategy.
Investment
Risks in respect of specific investment and realisation decisions.
Investment risks include the appropriate research and due diligence 
of new investments and the timely execution of both new 
investments and realisations for optimising shareholder value.
Pool managers have well-developed networks through  
which they attract proprietary deal flow.
Investment opportunities are subject to rigorous and 
disciplined investment appraisals and multi-stage approval 
processes. Target entry and exit events and prices are 
monitored and updated regularly, in relation to market 
conditions and strategic aims.
	 The continued development of investment management 
skills and expertise over the last three years has facilitated 
increased deal flow and quality of research across the 
portfolio.
Market
Risk of losses in value of investments arising from movements 
in market prices, particularly in highly volatile markets.
Caledonia invests primarily in listed equities, private companies 
and equity funds. Its principal market risks are therefore equity  
price volatility, foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate 
volatility. An explanation of these risks, along with sensitivities, 
is included in note 22 to these accounts.
Market risks and sensitivities are reviewed on a weekly basis 
and actions taken to balance appropriately risk and return.
A regular review of market and investment volatility and value 
at risk is conducted by the board and the portfolio is realigned 
with strategic aims where appropriate. Reviews also consider 
investment concentration, currency and liquidity exposures.
	 Risk weighted performance reporting and portfolio risk 
analysis has been enhanced to look at the movement in 
the risk factors and why these have occurred, giving more 
complete insight into the characteristics and performance  
of Caledonia’s portfolio.
Liquidity
Risk that liabilities cannot be met or new investments made due to  
a lack of liquidity. Such risk can arise from not being able to sell an 
investment due to lack of a market or from not holding cash or being 
able to raise debt.
Detailed cash forecasting for six months ahead is updated 
and reviewed weekly, including the expected drawdown of 
capital commitments.
Loan facilities are maintained to provide appropriate liquidity 
headroom.
The liquidity of the portfolio is reviewed regularly.
	 Average liquidity levels of our quoted portfolio have 
increased over the last year, as we have continued to 
realise less liquid non-core investments.
	 Committed borrowing facilities to £175m are in place up 
to April 2018.
Operational
Risks arising from inadequate or failed processes, people and 
systems or from external factors.
Operational risks arise from the recruitment, development and 
retention of staff, systems and procedures and business disruption.
Systems and control procedures are developed and reviewed 
regularly. They are tested, as part of the annual programme  
of controls assurance, to ensure effective operation.
Appropriate remuneration and other policies are in place to 
encourage the retention of key staff. Business continuity plans 
are maintained, using an offsite facility.
	 An IT risk dashboard is maintained and is an important 
document, noting current IT risks facing Caledonia.
	 Increasing use of the cloud for systems processing, 
including email and for backing up data.
Regulatory and legal
Risk arising from exposure to litigation or fraud and adherence to 
the tax and regulatory environment, as Caledonia operates across  
a number of jurisdictions and in an industry that has been subject 
to increasing regulatory oversight.
Caledonia has internal resources to consider all regulatory 
and tax matters as they arise. Use is made of advisers and the 
Association of Investment Companies, of which Caledonia is  
a member and on whose self-managed investment company 
committee it is represented. Regular training is undertaken.

Risks are identified and assessed through a risk dashboard, 
capturing the most significant business risks facing Caledonia and 
documenting the actions required to achieve an acceptable level of 
risk. The business risk dashboard is reported to the board half yearly.
The portfolio investment risk report specifically focuses on the  
more technical areas of investment portfolio risk in relation to 
Caledonia’s investment strategy. This includes such risks as 
investment volatility, value at risk, diversification, liquidity and 
concentration risks. 27

Sustainability
e are committed to building our 
business for the long term. To this end, 
we consider the impact of our business 
on the marketplace, workplace and 
environment.
Marketplace
As an investment company, we are committed to a long term 
investment strategy and to maintaining effective relationships with 
those companies in which we invest. We often hold a board seat 
in our significant investments and use this to maintain a close 
relationship with managements of those companies. Additionally, 
we hold frequent meetings with managements and review internal 
documents, such as management accounts and reports.
We also make considered use of our voting rights. As a consequence 
of our involved investment style, we would expect to vote in line 
with management recommendations, but are prepared to abstain 
or vote against recommendations where we consider they are not  
in the interests of our shareholders.
We continue to meet with our shareholders and listen to any 
concerns they may have.
Workplace
Caledonia has in place a set of polices intended to protect 
employees from unlawful discrimination, offer them a working 
environment where they have a right to be treated fairly, with 
consideration and respect, and support high standards of conduct 
and performance. These policies assist in ensuring that the company 
meets applicable health and safety standards and treats disabled 
employees in accordance with its statutory obligations. These 
policies are communicated to employees by way of a staff handbook 
provided at the time of joining, with periodic updates thereafter.
In addition to a grievance procedure, which allows employees to 
raise concerns either formally or informally, there are formal 
whistleblowing arrangements in place, which enable members of 
staff to raise any issue of concern regarding possible impropriety in 
the conduct of the company’s business, confidentially and 
independently of line management.
A formal performance appraisal process, through which employees 
may be set objectives on an annual basis and their achievement 
against those objectives assessed at the end of the year, is intended 
to ensure that employees have a clear view of their performance 
and the ability to develop their potential within the company 
through additional training where necessary. Together with team 
meetings and company-wide briefings, this provides staff with the 
opportunity to be closely involved in the success of the business. 29

Environment
Caledonia’s environmental impact is limited. However, any measures 
taken to reduce this impact demonstrate the company’s 
commitment to improve the environment and can have direct 
benefits through reductions in costs for energy and consumables. 
A number of measures have been and will be taken in this area:
	 encouragement of the use of electronic communications to save 
paper, printing consumables and energy
	 usage of video-conferencing and telephone conference calls 
rather than travelling to meetings
	 recycling of office waste, used paper and other consumables.

Corporate governance report
Caledonia recognises the importance  
of good corporate governance, which 
reuires the board to consider the 
processes, controls and limits within 
which the company should operate 
and define a working framework 
that is clear and understandable to 
everyone involved in the management 
of the company.
Statement of compliance
The board recognises the importance of good corporate governance 
and this report describes how the company has complied with The UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued in September 2012 for the duration 
of the reporting period.
A copy of The UK Corporate Governance Code is available on the 
website of the Financial Reporting Council at www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/
Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-
Code.aspx.
The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is collectively responsible for the success of the 
company and for supervising its affairs. It sets the company’s strategy, 
ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place 
to enable the company to meet its objectives and reviews management 
performance. It also sets the company’s values and standards and ensures 
that its obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and 
met. It aims to provide leadership of the company within a framework 
of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and 
appropriately managed.
To assist its operation, the board has adopted a Schedule of Authorities 
which sets out those matters which it specifically reserves for its own 
decision and those which are delegated to board committees and to 
executive management. Matters reserved for the board’s own decision 
include the following:
	 the appointment and removal of directors of the company, as 
prescribed by the company’s articles of association, and of certain 
senior executive positions
	 the terms of reference of board committees and the membership 
thereof
	 the company’s strategy
	 annual budgets
	 the company’s systems of risk management and internal control
	 treasury policies, banking counterparties and counterparty 
exposure limits
	 directors’ remuneration and terms of appointment 
	 significant capital transactions
	 charitable donations and political donations.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separated and 
clearly defined in the Schedule of Authorities. The Chairman is primarily 
responsible for the leadership of the board to ensure that it carries out 
its role effectively and for succession planning. The Chief Executive is 
responsible for the implementation of the board’s strategy and policies 
and the management of the company’s activities, other than those 
matters specifically reserved to the board. The Schedule of Authorities 
is reviewed annually by the board.
All directors receive detailed papers in advance of board meetings to 
enable them to discharge their duties and also have unlimited access 
to senior management should further information be required. 
Presentations by pool managers and other senior executives are 
regularly given to the board, as well as occasionally by senior executives 
of investee companies.

Governance Code that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be 
subject to annual election by shareholders.
Following changes in the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules 
introduced in May 2014, the election of those directors determined  
by the board to be independent under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code must be subject to the approval of both all shareholders of the 
company and separately those shareholders who are not controlling 
shareholders, being the Cayzer Concert Party.
On appointment, new directors are offered induction and training 
considered appropriate by the board, and subsequently as necessary, 
and the annual performance evaluation of the board encompasses the 
identification of any individual training needs of board members so that, 
if necessary, these can be reviewed by the Chairman with the directors 
concerned. The directors receive briefings at board meetings on 
regulatory and other issues relevant to the company and its business 
sector and, in addition, may attend external courses to assist in their 
professional development.
Board composition
The biographies of the directors appear on pages 30 and 31.
The board currently comprises ten directors. Excluding the Chairman, 
three of the directors are executive and six are non-executive. The board 
considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent, other than 
The Hon C W Cayzer, who was an executive director prior to becoming 
non-executive. In assessing Mr Boël’s independence, the board took 
account of his position as Chief Executive Officer of Sofina SA, whose 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Rebelco SA, has a 5.1% shareholding in 
Caledonia. Mr Boël’s position at Sofina has not given rise to any conflicts 
of interest and his circumstances very much accord with the importance 
that Caledonia attaches to its own executives having board positions at, 
or close contact with, investee companies. On 13 April 2015, ICAP plc, 
where Mr Gregson is non-executive Chairman, announced that, subject to 
approval by the Financial Conduct Authority, Mr Bridges would be joining 
that company as Group Finance Director. The board does not consider 
that Mr Bridges’ new role, which will not take effect until after 31 August 
2015, will have any influence on either his, or Mr Gregson’s, ability to 
exercise independent judgement in relation to the affairs of Caledonia, 
which has no other connection with ICAP . Mr Woods has also had past 
connections with the company and in particular its former Chairman, 
the late Peter Buckley, through business dealings between P&O Steam 
Navigation Company and British & Commonwealth Shipping Company, 
in which Caledonia was a substantial shareholder, during the 1970s and 
early 1980s and remained a friend of Mr Buckley’s until his death in 2008. 
The board does not consider that these past relationships affect his 
independence given the time that has passed since Mr Woods last had 
business dealings with British & Commonwealth and the fact that 
Mr Woods did not join Caledonia’s board until some three years after 
Mr Buckley’s death.
Caledonia has also announced that Shonaid Jemmett-Page will be joining 
the board from 1 July 2015. The board has determined that she will also 
be an independent director. Mrs Jemmett-Page was Caledonia’s audit 
partner at KPMG Audit Plc from November 1995 to March 2001. The 
board does not consider that this affects her independence given the 
length of time that has elapsed since this role ended and also the fact that 
none of the current board members, other than The Hon Charles Cayzer, 
were in post whilst she was audit partner.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility to the 
following standing committees – the Nomination Committee, the 
Audit Committee, the Governance Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee. Further details of the work of each of these committees and 
their membership during the year are set out on pages 35, 36, 38 and 39 
respectively.
The terms of reference of each committee are reviewed annually and 
are available on the company’s website.
Other committees
Various other committees have been established with responsibility 
for specific areas of the company’s activities, other than matters reserved 
to the board as a whole, as follows:
	 The Administrative Committee of the board has been established to 
deal with administrative matters of a routine nature requiring board 
approval or matters which are reserved to the board, but for which 
board approval has already been given in principle. The Administrative 
Committee meets when required and comprises any two directors.
	 The Executive Committee meets when required and is responsible 
for matters relating to the day to day management of the company’s 
business, other than where delegated to other committees. It is chaired 
by the Chief Executive and other members comprise the Chairman, 
the executive directors, the heads of the pools of capital and the 
Company Secretary.
	 The Investment Management Committee meets weekly and considers 
matters relating to the company’s investment portfolio and monitors 
the company’s cash requirements and its net asset value per share 
total return performance. The Investment Management Committee 
is chaired by the Chief Executive and other members comprise the 
entire investment team, the Company Secretary and the Deputy 
Company Secretary.
	 The Investment Approvals Committee considers and formally approves 
new investments and proposed realisations. This committee meets 
when required, is chaired by the Chief Executive and other members 
comprise the Chairman, the executive directors, the heads of the pools 
of capital and the Company Secretary.
	 The Compliance Committee meets weekly to monitor the company’s 
ongoing compliance with the requirements for investment trust status 
and to approve all investment activity from an investment trust 
compliance perspective. It also monitors the potential impact of legal, 
tax and regulatory developments. The Compliance Committee is 
chaired by the Company Secretary and other members comprise the 
Finance Director, the Heads of Tax, Treasury and Finance, the Group 
Financial Controller and the Deputy Company Secretary.
	 The Challenge Committee formally reviews valuations of all of the 
company’s investments at each half-year and full-year. It is chaired by 
the Chief Executive and other members comprise the Finance Director, 
the Head of Finance and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The 
meetings are observed by representatives from KPMG LLP .
Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance and that 
of its committees and, in accordance with best practice, engages an 
independent third party facilitator to assist in this process every three 
years. For the year ended 31 March 2015, the evaluation of the board 
as a whole and of its committees was undertaken internally, led by the 
Chairman, and was conducted by inviting individual board members to 
complete questionnaires regarding the operation and effectiveness of 
the board and its committees, the responses from which were collated 
by the Company Secretary and discussed at a special session of the board.
The evaluation of the performance of the Chairman was led by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director and involved individual discussions 
with other members of the board. The Chairman considered the 
performance of the non-executive directors and that of the executive 
directors was reviewed by the Chairman and the non-executive directors, 
with the Chief Executive also present for the discussion on the other 
executive directors. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
34 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Corporate governance report continued
The results of the 2015 evaluation process were presented in a report 
to the board. The conclusion was that the board operated in a unified 
manner, but with a preparedness to provide an appropriate level of 
challenge to, and when necessary veto of, management proposals. 
Actions agreed for improvement included the provision of more general 
background information on macro-economic issues for board members 
and periodic reviews of the process involved in reaching key decisions 
taken to evaluate its effectiveness and whether any lessons could 
be learned.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a 
situation where he has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest which 
conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the company’s interests. The 
Companies Act 2006 however allows directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where the articles of association 
contain a provision to this effect. The Companies Act 2006 also allows 
the articles to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts 
of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
There are safeguards in the company’s articles which apply when the 
directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict 
of interest. First, only independent directors, being those who have no 
interest in the matter being considered, are able to take the relevant 
decision and, second, in taking the decision, the directors must act in 
a way which they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote 
the success of the company. The directors are able to impose time limits 
or conditions when giving authorisations if they think this is appropriate.
The board has adopted procedures to address the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 in relation to directors’ conflicts of interest. Each 
new director on appointment is required to declare any potential conflict 
situations, which may relate to him or her, or his or her connected 
persons. These are reviewed by the board and, if necessary, also by the 
Governance Committee, which then considers whether these situations 
should be authorised and, if so, whether any conditions to such authority 
should be attached.
Each board meeting includes a standing agenda item on conflicts of 
interest to ensure that all directors disclose any new potential conflict 
situations. These are then reviewed, again if necessary also by the 
Governance Committee, and authorised by the board as appropriate. 
A register of directors’ conflicts of interest is maintained by the Company 
Secretary and is reviewed annually by the Governance Committee.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with investors in order to achieve a 
mutual understanding of objectives. The Chief Executive and the Finance 
Director regularly hold meetings with institutional investors, private client 
stockbrokers and fund managers. The Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director is also available to attend some of these meetings. Any views 
put forward by shareholders are reported back to the board, which 
periodically also receives presentations from the brokers on shareholder 
feedback and the general market perception of the company. In addition, 
the annual general meeting provides a forum for shareholders to meet 
the directors, both formally and informally.
The Chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available to answer 
questions at the annual general meeting.
Relations with controlling shareholders
Following recent changes to the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing 
Rules, where a premium listed company has a controlling shareholder 
or shareholders (being a person or persons acting in concert who exercise 
or control 30% of more of the company’s voting rights), the company is 
required to enter into a written and legally binding agreement which is 
intended to ensure that the controlling shareholder undertakes to comply 
with certain independence provisions, namely that:
1.  transactions and arrangements with the controlling shareholder (and/
or any of its associates) will be conducted at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms;
2.  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will take 
any action that would have the effect of preventing the listed company 
from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and
3.  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will 
propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which 
is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules.
The board confirms that agreements specified under the Listing Rules 
as described above (which were required to be in place by 17 November 
2014) were entered into by the company on 30 October 2014 with The 
Cayzer Trust Company Limited (‘Cayzer Trust’) and separately with the 
Trustee of the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust 
(‘Employee Share Trust’), which is deemed by the Panel on Takeovers 
and Mergers to form part of the Cayzer Concert Party. As at 26 May 2015, 
being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this annual 
report, the Cayzer Concert Party held 48.49% of Caledonia’s voting rights. 
Under the terms of its agreement, Cayzer Trust undertook to procure the 
compliance with the independence provisions of all of the other members 
of the Cayzer Concert Party, other than the Employee Share Trust.
The board confirms that, between 30 October 2014 and 26 May 2015, 
being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this annual 
report:
1.  the company has complied with the independence provisions included 
in the agreements with Cayzer Trust and the Employee Share Trust
2.  so far as the company is aware, the independence provisions included 
in the agreements have been complied with by Cayzer Trust and the 
Employee Share Trust
3.  so far as the company is aware, the procurement obligation included 
in the agreement with Cayzer Trust has been complied with by 
that company.

omination Committee report
The omination Committee is focused 
on evaluating the directors and 
examining the skills and attributes 
needed of board members. It is also 
responsible for identifying suitable 
candidates for new director positions.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for the regular review of 
the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity) of the board and for giving consideration to 
succession planning for directors and, if requested by the board, for other 
senior executives. It is responsible for identifying, using external search 
consultants where necessary, candidates to fill board vacancies as and 
when they arise, for making recommendations to the board in relation 
thereto and for keeping under review the leadership needs of the 
company, both executive and non-executive.
The Nomination Committee also reviews the time required of the 
non-executive directors and ensures that they receive formal letters 
of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of them in terms 
of time commitment, committee service and involvement outside 
board meetings.
Diversity
The board’s policy on diversity is, as it has been in the past, to seek to 
appoint the best qualified person to a particular role regardless of gender 
or other diversity criteria and therefore it has not adopted any 
measureable objectives in relation thereto.
Work of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee met four times during the year and the work 
undertaken included:
	 an evaluation of the structure, size and composition of the board as 
a whole in the light of the 2014 board performance evaluation
	 consideration of the contributions and effectiveness of the non-
executive directors seeking election or re-election at the 2014 annual 
general meeting, prior to giving recommendations for their elections 
or re-elections
	 a recommendation to the board that Mr Boël be appointed a director 
of the company
	 the conduct of a search for additional independent non-executive 
directors, concluding with recommendations to the board that 
Mr Stewart and Mrs Jemmett-Page be appointed.
The Nomination Committee engaged an external search consultancy, 
Odgers Berndtson, to assist in the search that culminated in the 
appointments of Mr Stewart and Mrs Jemmett-Page. Odgers Berndtson 
has no other connection with the company. An external search 
consultancy was not used in relation to the appointment of Mr Boël, 
who was known to the company by virtue of his role at Sofina.

Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee plays a 
significant role in ensuring that the 
companys financial statements are 
properly prepared and that the system 
of controls that is in place is effective 
and appropriate.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements of the company and any announcements relating 
thereto and for reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements 
contained therein. In addition, it oversees the relationship with the 
external auditor, KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’). It also reviews the company’s 
systems of internal control and risk management procedures and 
considers annually whether an internal audit function is required.
The Audit Committee, comprised exclusively of independent non-
executives directors, met three times in the year ended 31 March 2015, 
in May and November 2014 and in March 2015. Subsequent to the year 
end, it met in May 2015 to consider the significant issues in relation to the 
2015 annual report.
The external auditor, KPMG, the Finance Director, the Company Secretary 
and various members of the finance team attend the meetings of the 
Audit Committee. Other board members and/or senior executives may 
also attend meetings at the invitation of the Chairman. At the end of each 
meeting, the Audit Committee has a separate discussion with the external 
auditor without executive management present.
Work of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee undertook the following activities in the discharge 
of its responsibilities.
Financial statements
The main focus of the meetings in May and November 2014 was the 2014 
annual report and financial statements and the 2014 half-year results 
respectively, including evaluation of the going concern statements 
therein.
The March 2015 meeting considered principally the audit planning for the 
2015 annual report, including in particular the requirements of the 2012 
revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code and other disclosure 
requirements. 
In its May 2015 meeting, the Audit Committee reviewed the form and 
content of the 2015 annual report and financial statements. In conducting 
its review, the Audit Committee considered reports prepared by 
management and the external auditor. These reports provided an 
analytical review of the financial statements, comparing the current to 
prior year financial position and results, and detailed the judgements and 
sources of estimation uncertainty involved in applying the accounting 
policies to the financial statements. The Audit Committee also considered 
the going concern statement. The Audit Committee recommended the 
2015 annual report to the board.
The significant issues the Audit Committee considered in relation to 
the 2015 financial statements were the valuation of unlisted and listed 
investments. In relation to these financial statements, the Audit 
Committee also considered the going concern statement (and related 
liquidity issues) and compliance with the annual report ‘fair, balanced 
and understandable’ provisions of the 2012 revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Unlisted valuations
The Audit Committee recognises that unlisted investments are a 
significant component of the financial statements and that their valuation 
is subject to considerable judgement and uncertainty. The Chairman of 
the Audit Committee attended the Challenge Committee meeting (along 
with the external auditor) and reported to the Audit Committee on the 
quality of the review, adherence to the company’s valuation policy and 
consistency of valuation methodologies over time.

37 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Listed valuations
Listed investments are a significant component of the financial 
statements. The Challenge Committee meeting referred to above 
also considered the listed securities, to ensure that the exchange bid 
prices used in the valuation were from an actively traded market. The 
Audit Committee concurred that it was appropriate to use the exchange 
bid price in all cases.
Going concern
The Audit Committee considered the trading needs of the company 
and its financial capacity, including available bank credit and liquid funds, 
to be wholly sufficient to confirm the going concern of the business.
Fair, balanced and understandable statement
The Audit Committee reviewed the draft annual report and, taken 
as a whole, considered it to be fair, balanced and understandable. 
The Audit Committee recommended to the board that the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the 
financial statements, set out on page 57, should be signed accordingly.
Internal control
In the May and November meetings, a report on the internal control 
reviews performed during the previous six months was presented, 
together with an update on the controls assurance programme given 
at the March 2015 meeting. The Audit Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal control environment and the structure in 
place to resolve identified weaknesses. The control reviews included 
corporate tax and VAT compliance and reporting, purchase invoice 
processing and payment and general ledger accounting and reporting. 
No significant areas of weakness were identified. The Audit Committee 
agreed the control review work plan for 2015.
The board of directors is responsible for the company’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Internal audit
As the company does not have an internal audit function, the Audit 
Committee considers annually whether there is a need for one. The 
company is an investment trust and manages its non-consolidated 
subsidiaries as other private company investments, expecting them to 
operate their own risk management processes. The company closely 
monitors the control environment of its private company investments. 
The Audit Committee recommended to the board that an internal audit 
function was not required. 
Auditor
The Audit Committee last conducted an audit tender process in mid-2011. 
The main outcomes of the process were the replacement of Deloitte (who 
had been the company’s auditor since 2006) with KPMG Audit Plc and a 
plan for the development of the external audit approach. The principal 
planned changes were to increase the depth of the audit by reducing the 
materiality level. At its request and for internal reasons, KPMG Audit Plc 
resigned as the company’s auditor with effect from the conclusion of 
the annual general meeting on 24 July 2013 and was replaced by its 
immediate parent entity, KPMG LLP .
Audit effectiveness
Audit quality is reviewed continuously throughout the year by both 
the Finance Director and Audit Committee. The focus is centred on 
the following:
	 the quality and seniority of the auditor’s staff
	 the appropriateness of the planned audit methodology as applied 
to Caledonia’s business activity
	 the level and challenge and quality of reporting to the Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of the audit is also monitored throughout the year 
using a number of measures, including but not limited to:
	 a review and approval of the scope of the planned audit
	 the planned implementation of improvements following appropriate 
post audit reviews
	 the monitoring of the independence of the external auditor
	 a review of any Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality Review 
Report for KPMG’s audit of the company
	 discussion with the firm’s independent senior partner.
Non-audit work
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence and objectivity, the 
Audit Committee maintains a schedule of specific non-audit activities 
which may not be undertaken by the external auditor, within the broad 
principles that the external auditor should not audit its own work, 
should not make management decisions on behalf of the company, 
should not be put into the role of advocate for the company and that 
no mutuality of interest should be created between the company and 
the external auditor.
Pre-approval of non-audit fees is required for non-audit fees exceeding 
pre-determined thresholds.
Re-appointment of KPMG as auditor
KPMG Audit Plc was appointed auditor in 2011 and was replaced by 
KPMG LLP in 2013. The lead audit partner is required to rotate every 
five years and other key audit partners every seven years. No contractual 
obligations restrict the Audit Committee’s choice of external auditor. The 
Audit Committee concluded that KPMG provides an effective audit and 
the Audit Committee recommended to the board the re-appointment 
of KPMG LLP .
Resolutions to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditor and to authorise the 
directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration, will be proposed 
at the annual general meeting on 16 July 2015.
Private meetings
During the year, the Chairman of the Audit Committee met separately 
and privately with the Finance Director and KPMG.

Governance Committee report
The Governance Committee monitors 
and reviews the ability of each director 
to act in the interests of shareholders 
as a whole and to exercise 
independence of udgement.
The Governance Committee keeps under review corporate governance 
issues relating to the company and is responsible for the monitoring and 
review of the ability of each director to act in the interests of shareholders 
as a whole and to exercise independence of judgement free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to, or could appear to, 
affect his or her judgement. The Governance Committee also reviews 
conflict or potential conflict situations relating to directors, which may 
require the prior authorisation of the board under the Companies Act 
2006, and makes recommendations to the board as to whether such 
conflict or potential conflict situations should be authorised and, if so, 
whether any conditions, such as duration or scope of the authority, 
should be attached. The Governance Committee reviews annually all 
authorisations previously granted by the board to ensure that they remain 
appropriate. If the Governance Committee believes that a director may be 
subject to a conflict of interest which may prejudice his or her ability to 
exercise independence of judgement, it may make such recommendations 
to the board as it may think fit, including that the director abstains from 
participating in any decision of the board or any of its committees on the 
matter concerned.
Work of the Governance Committee
The Governance Committee met three times during the year and the 
principal matters it considered were: 
	 the review and approval of the Corporate governance report for the 
year ended 31 March 2014
	 the review of potential conflict situations notified by directors in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the making of 
recommendations to the board in relation thereto
	 consideration of the influence of the Cayzer Concert Party on 
Caledonia’s board and whether it was in the general interest of the 
non-Cayzer Concert Party shareholders, with the conclusion that it was
	 the review and approval of agreements entered into by the company 
with The Cayzer Trust Company Limited and the Trustee of the 
Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust incorporating 
independence provisions to comply with the new Listing Rule 
requirements for premium listed companies with controlling 
shareholders.

Directors remuneration report
Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee ensures 
that remuneration arrangements 
support the strategic aims of the 
business and enable the recruitment, 
motivation and retention of senior 
executives, of the calibre needed 
to manage and grow the company 
successfully.
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to introduce Caledonia’s directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2015.
Last year, the Remuneration Committee completed a strategic review 
of Caledonia’s executive remuneration framework and engaged with its 
larger shareholders and investor representative bodies on the key 
changes. The revised framework was set out in the remuneration policy 
which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting. 
No changes to this policy are proposed at this year’s annual general 
meeting and the key elements of the policy have been included in this 
year’s directors’ remuneration report for ease of reference.
In this introductory statement, I have set out a summary of the 
implementation of the remuneration policy in respect of the year ended 
31 March 2015 and how we intend to approach remuneration for the 
2016 financial year. Detailed disclosure and explanations of the 
remuneration paid to directors in the year ended 31 March 2015 are 
included in the annual report on directors’ remuneration, which will be 
put to an advisory vote of shareholders at the annual general meeting 
on 16 July 2015.
Remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2015
Turning to the year under review, as described in the Chairman’s and 
Chief Executive’s report, Caledonia has delivered a net asset value per 
share total return (‘NAVTR’) of 14.2%, continuing the strong returns 
achieved over the previous two years and extending Caledonia’s record 
of outperformance against the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’) over one, three 
and five years and the FTSE All-Share Total Return index (‘FTSE index’) 
over ten years. The Funds pool, led by Jamie Cayzer-Colvin, was a 
significant contributor to this year’s performance, delivering a total return 
of 45.2% compared with its target of 12.5%. Taking these results into 
account and after assessing the performance of the individual directors 
against the personal objectives set for them at the start of the year and, 
where relevant, pool performance and objectives, the Remuneration 
Committee decided that it was appropriate to award the maximum 
potential bonus of 100% of basic salary to each of the executive directors.
The year to 31 March 2015 also represented the end of the three year 
performance measurement period for awards granted in 2012 under 
the company’s performance share scheme. For these awards, the 
performance targets were that, for two-thirds of the shares comprised in 
an award, Caledonia’s NAVTR had to outperform the FTSE index and, for 
the other third, the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts (all-stocks) Total 
Return index (‘Gilts index’) over the three year measurement period, in 
each case with shares vesting on a graduated basis between 0.5% and 
3.5% outperformance. Both of these targets were comfortably met, with 
Caledonia’s NAVTR outperforming the FTSE index by 17.2% and the Gilts 
index by 29.9% over the three year period. Accordingly, these awards 
have vested in full.
No deferred bonus plan awards were granted in 2012.

Performance measures for long term incentive awards
Following a further consultation with shareholders and investor 
representative bodies, in November 2014 the Remuneration Committee 
adopted new performance measures for the performance share scheme 
and deferred bonus plan matching shares which are based on the 
annualised absolute returns achieved by Caledonia over three and five 
year periods, in order to align the measures more closely with the 
company’s long term objective of achieving absolute returns over rolling 
ten year periods of between RPI+3% and RPI+6%. For investment 
executives, including Mr Cayzer-Colvin, a substantial proportion of the 
awards will be geared towards the total returns achieved by the pools 
of capital for which they are responsible. Further details of these new 
performance measures and how they will operate for executive directors 
are set out in the summary of performance measures and targets in the 
notes to the remuneration policy table on pages 43 and 44.
Remuneration for the year ending 31 March 2016
Looking ahead to the 2016 financial year, basic salaries of executive 
directors have been increased with effect from 1 April 2015 by 1.0%, 
broadly in line with inflation, which was the same as the standard increase 
given to the company’s senior executives, although other grades of staff 
received a higher increase of 3.0%. The Chairman’s and the non-executive 
directors’ fees are reviewed on a triennial basis and, since these were last 
increased in April 2014, they have not been changed. 
We plan to make performance share scheme and deferred bonus plan 
awards following the release of our 2015 full year results announcement 
in line with our normal grant cycle. These will be subject to the 
performance measures adopted in November 2014, as outlined above.
The company performance related element of the annual bonus scheme 
is determined by reference to the relative performance of the company’s 
NAVTR to RPI over the year, with a 10% pay-out if NAVTR matches RPI, 
rising to a 100% pay-out if outperformance of 7% or more is achieved. 
In view of the current low level of RPI, the Remuneration Committee has 
decided that, for bonus awards for the 2016 and subsequent financial 
years, the RPI comparator should be 3%, which is broadly in line with 
the historic long term average, or actual RPI if higher.
Malus and clawback
Last year, provisions were introduced into Caledonia’s performance 
share scheme and deferred bonus plan which give the Remuneration 
Committee the right to cancel or reduce unvested awards in the event 
of a material misstatement of the company’s financial results, a 
miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, misconduct on the part 
of the participant or an event resulting in material loss or reputational 
damage to the company or a member of the group. These are known 
as ‘malus’ provisions.
In September 2014, a revised UK Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’) 
was issued which included a provision that all performance related 
incentive schemes for executive directors operated by UK listed 
companies should include not only malus provisions, but also 
arrangements to recover amounts of variable remuneration after it has 
been paid (known as ‘clawback’). The Code is not specific as to the period 
of time over which clawback should operate or the circumstances in 
which it should be applied and the Remuneration Committee has been 
advised that, since only malus provisions were included in the current 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2014, it would be 
necessary to seek formal shareholder approval to amend the policy 
should clawback provisions be introduced. As a consequence, the 
Remuneration Committee has decided to see how market practice in 
relation to clawback develops before making a decision as to whether to 
introduce it to Caledonia’s performance related incentive schemes and, if 
it decides to do so, whether to seek an amendment of the remuneration 
policy before it would next ordinarily be proposed for shareholder 
approval at the annual general meeting in 2017 .

Remuneration policy
Remuneration structure
Executive directors
The table below sets out Caledonia’s policy in relation to each component of executive director remuneration, with further explanations in the notes 
that follow.
Salary (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To support the recruitment and retention of executive directors of the calibre required to manage  
and grow the company successfully.
Operation Reviewed annually.
The basic salaries of the executive directors on implementation of the policy were as follows:
W P Wyatt  £506,480 J M B Cayzer-Colvin  £303,890 
S A King  £359,380
The current salaries of the executive directors are set out in the annual report on directors’ remuneration.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
Salary increases are normally awarded by reference to any increase in the cost of living, but may take into 
account other factors such as external market positioning, change in the scope of the individual’s responsibilities 
or level of experience, development in the role and levels of pay elsewhere in the company.
Other than in exceptional circumstances or where there is a change in role or responsibilities, year on year 
increases in basic salaries will not exceed inflation by more than 5%.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance measurement framework Not applicable.
Benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To provide a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit and retain high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are provided with family private medical insurance cover, death-in-service insurance, and 
permanent health insurance and, in the case of Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin, a cash allowance in lieu of 
a company car. They are also entitled to receive minor benefits that are available to other Caledonia staff.
The executive directors are also covered by the company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy 
and have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s articles of association.
Where there is a valid business reason for doing so, the company may pay for the cost of spouses accompanying 
directors on business trips and reimburse directors for hotel accommodation and travel expenses (including 
payment of any tax thereon). Executive directors are also eligible to receive other minor benefits and expenses 
payments (again including payment of any tax thereon).
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
A taxable benefits package that is competitive with the marketplace. 
The value of taxable benefits provided, other than ad hoc items incurred in connection with Caledonia’s business 
that may be deemed taxable benefits such as travel and other expenses, will not in aggregate exceed 10% of 
basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance measurement framework Not applicable.
Introduction
Set out below are the material elements of the directors’ remuneration 
policy which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting 
of the company held on 17 July 2014. The policy came into effect on that 
date and is next due to be put for approval by shareholders in 2017, unless 
the Remuneration Committee wishes to implement any changes earlier.
There have been no changes to the policy since its implementation and 
the extracts shown below are for information only and to provide context 
for the 2015 annual report on directors’ remuneration which follows. The 
performance conditions for the deferred bonus plan and the performance 
share scheme described in the policy table and the notes thereto have 
been updated to incorporate the new performance measures adopted 
by the Remuneration Committee in November 2014. References to share 
awards held by executive directors at the date of approval of the policy 
which have since been exercised have been removed and it has also been 
noted where share awards have met their performance targets since 
implementation of the policy.
The full directors’ remuneration policy is contained on pages 42 to 48 of 
the company’s annual report 2014, which is available in the ‘Literature’ 
section of Caledonia’s website at www.caledonia.com. 
Objectives
The key objectives of the Remuneration Committee in setting the 
company’s remuneration policy are as follows:
	 remuneration of executive directors should be linked to the company’s 
long term performance and its business strategy
	 performance related remuneration should seek to align the interests 
of executive directors with those of the shareholders
	 a significant proportion of executive directors’ remuneration should be 
linked to the performance of the company and only receivable if 
demanding performance targets are achieved
	 remuneration packages for executive directors should be competitive, 
but not excessive, in terms of market practice in order to attract, retain 
and motivate executive directors of the quality needed to manage and 
grow the company successfully. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Directors remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy
Short term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To reward performance on an annual basis against key financial, operational and individual objectives. 
Operation Discretionary annual bonus scheme and deferred bonus plan under which a proportion of bonus may be 
compulsorily or voluntarily deferred into shares.
Bonus is not pensionable.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
The maximum potential bonus is 100% of basic salary. Any bonus over 50% of basic salary is compulsorily 
deferred into shares and up to half of any remaining cash bonus may be voluntarily deferred, each for a period of 
three years. Shares derived from compulsory or voluntary deferral of bonus are matched on a one for one basis, 
subject to performance conditions (as described under long term incentives below).
All bonus payments are subject to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which also retains 
discretion to amend the proportions of bonus subject to compulsory or voluntary deferral or not to require or 
offer any deferral.
In order to be entitled to an annual bonus, an executive director must normally be in the group’s employment 
and not under notice of termination (either given or received) at the time the bonus is paid.
The Remuneration Committee has the right to cancel or reduce any bonus compulsorily or voluntarily deferred 
into shares which have not yet vested in the circumstances described under long term incentives below.
Performance measurement framework By reference to a combination of company performance against external benchmarks and individual 
performance against personal objectives. Executive directors with responsibility for pools of capital will have 
a proportion of bonus determined by reference to pool performance and objectives.
Long term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To motivate executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value, thereby aligning the interests of 
management with those of shareholders.
To encourage long term retention of key executives.
Operation Caledonia operates a performance share scheme under which participants are awarded nil-cost options over 
the company’s shares.
The performance share scheme replaced an executive share option scheme under which market value options 
were awarded to senior executives. The last awards under the executive share option scheme were made in 
2010, although Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin retain options under this scheme which have yet to be exercised. 
Under the company’s deferred bonus plan, matching share awards are granted in respect of compulsory and 
voluntary deferral of pre-tax bonus. The current deferred bonus plan replaced an earlier plan introduced in 2005 
under which there are no matching share awards still outstanding.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
The maximum value of nil-cost options that may be granted in any year under the performance share scheme 
rules is 200% of basic salary, although the company’s policy is to grant annual awards of no more than 125% of 
basic salary.
Matching shares are granted on a one for one basis for shares derived from bonus deferral.
On exercise of nil-cost options or calling of matching share awards, participants will also receive an amount 
equivalent to the dividends and any associated tax credits that would have accrued on the shares during the 
relevant performance measurement period.
The Remuneration Committee has the right, in respect of awards granted after 1 April 2014, to cancel or reduce 
long term incentive awards which have not yet vested, in the event of a material misstatement of the company’s 
financial results, miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, individual misconduct or an event resulting in 
material loss or reputational damage to the company or any member of the group.
In the event of a change of control before the expiry of the performance measurement period of a long term 
incentive award, the vesting level of the award will be determined by the Remuneration Committee based on the 
extent to which the performance targets have been achieved and vested shares will then be scaled down to 
reflect the shortened measurement period. The Remuneration Committee may modify such vesting levels if it 
considers that the performance target would be met to a greater or lesser degree at the testing date and/or if the 
application of time pro rating would be inappropriate in the circumstances.
Performance measurement framework For Mr Wyatt and Mr King, nil-cost options awarded under the 2011 performance share scheme are subject to 
the performance, on an absolute basis, of the company’s diluted net asset value per share on a total return basis 
(‘NAVTR’) measured on an annualised basis over three or five years. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, the nil-cost options are 
subject to a combination of the performance of the company’s NAVTR as above and the total returns achieved  
by the Funds pool, for which he is responsible, again measured on an annualised basis over three or five years.
Matching share awards granted under the deferred bonus plan are subject to the performance, on an absolute 
basis, of the company’s NAVTR, measured on an annualised basis over three years.
The rules of each scheme provide discretion to the Remuneration Committee to amend the performance targets 
or impose different performance targets. 
The performance targets for all outstanding options granted under the company’s executive share option 
scheme have been met. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
43 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Pension related benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To provide a means of retirement saving as part of a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit and retain 
high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are offered defined contribution funding, based on a percentage of salary, to a personal 
pension scheme or a cash salary supplement (or a combination of both) at their choice.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
The percentage of basic salary for the Chief Executive is 22.5% and for other executive directors 17.5%. If a 
director chooses to take a cash supplement in lieu of some or all of his or her pension entitlement, the payment is 
reduced by such amount as is necessary to make the cash supplement cost neutral for the company after taking 
into account National Insurance contributions.
The Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to increase the percentage of salary relating to pension 
benefits from time to time in line with market conditions, up to a maximum of 30% of basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance measurement framework¹ Not applicable.
Performance measures and targets 
Annual bonus 
For the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, a maximum of 50% of 
bonus is determined by reference to company performance and 50% by 
reference to individual performance objectives. For executive directors 
responsible for a specific pool of capital, 25% of bonus is determined by 
reference to the company’s performance, 25% to pool performance, 35% 
to pool objectives and 15% to individual performance objectives. In all 
cases, the company performance element is determined by reference to 
the relative performance of the company’s NAVTR against RPI. For bonus 
awards for the 2016 and subsequent financial years, RPI will be taken as 
the higher of actual RPI over the bonus year or 3%, being broadly in line 
with its historic long term average. Bonus payments for this element 
commence with a 10% pay-out if NAVTR matches RPI, increasing 
incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance of 
7% or more is achieved. Pool performance is judged by the Remuneration 
Committee by reference to the return achieved by the pool against a set 
target return and by objectives such as deal flow and delivery of portfolio 
strategy. Individual performance is assessed by reference to personal 
objectives set at the start of the year, including non-financial measures 
such as risk management, marketing of the company, team leadership, 
management skills and promotion of Caledonia’s corporate culture and 
image both internally and externally.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to amend or adopt 
alternative annual bonus targets in order to achieve better alignment 
with the company’s strategic objectives.
Compulsory and voluntary deferral of bonus 
 Shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only vest if the 
director remains an employee of the Caledonia group for a three year 
period commencing on the first day of the financial year in which the 
award is made.
 Shares comprised in a voluntary deferral are not subject to any conditions 
and will normally vest at the earlier of three years from the first day of 
the financial year in which the award is made or the date that the director 
ceases to be an employee of the Caledonia group for any reason.
Long term incentive plans 
Performance share scheme 
 For nil-cost options granted prior to the 2014 financial year under the 
performance share scheme, one-third of the shares comprised in an 
award are subject to a performance condition which compares the 
performance of Caledonia’s NAVTR against the FTSE Actuaries UK 
Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’) over three 
years. For the other two-thirds, NAVTR is measured against the FTSE 
All-Share Total Return index (‘FTSE index’), also over three years. Awards 
vest on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% outperformance 
of the relevant benchmark, rising on a straight line basis to maximum 
vesting on 3.5% outperformance. There is no re-testing of either 
performance target and, to the extent a performance target is not met, 
the relevant award will lapse. For the purpose of calculating the 
performance measures, averages of the company’s NAVTR and the two 
benchmark indices over the three months prior to the start and end of the 
performance period are used to reduce volatility. To the extent that the 
performance targets are met, awards may be exercised between the date 
of vesting and the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, except that only 
two-thirds of the shares that have vested may normally be exercised after 
three years, with the remaining one-third normally becoming exercisable 
after five years.
 For nil-cost options granted in the 2014 financial year, the performance 
criteria are as above, except that one-half of the shares comprised in an 
award will be measured against the Gilts index over three years and the 
other half against the FTSE index over five years, with shares that vest in 
each case becoming exercisable immediately.
 For nil-cost options granted to Mr Wyatt and Mr King in the 2015 financial 
year and subsequently, awards will vest on a graduated basis, with vesting 
commencing at 10% on the achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 3%, 
rising incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised 
NAVTR of 10%, measured over three and five years. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, 
who is head of the Funds pool, 60% of his performance share scheme 
awards will be measured against the annualised total returns achieved by 
the Funds pool, measured over three and five years. Awards will similarly 
vest on a graduated basis, with vesting commencing at 10% on 
achievement of an annualised Funds pool total return of 6%, rising 
incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised total 
return of 13.5%. The remaining 40% of Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s performance 
share scheme awards will be measured against Caledonia’s NAVTR 
as above.
For nil-cost options granted in the 2015 financial year, one-half of the 
shares comprised in the awards will be measured over three years and 
one-half over five years. For subsequent financial years, one-third will be 
measured over three years and two-thirds over five years. In all cases, 
shares that vest will become immediately exercisable and will lapse if not 
exercised within ten years of grant.
Deferred bonus plan matching awards 
 The performance targets for matching shares awarded under the 
deferred bonus plan in the 2015 and prior financial years are the same as 
those described above for the nil-cost options granted under the 
performance share scheme prior to the 2014 financial year, except that 
shares that vest can be called immediately following the end of the 
measurement period and will lapse if not called within twelve months 
thereafter.
 Matching awards to be granted in the 2016 and subsequent financial 
years will be subject to performance measurement by reference to 
Caledonia’s NAVTR on an annualised basis over three years, with vesting 
commencing at 20% on achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 4%, rising 
incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 
10%. Again, shares that vest can be called immediately following the end 
of the performance measurement period and will lapse if not called within 
twelve months thereafter. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Directors remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy
Chairman and non-executive directors
The table below sets out each component of the Chairman’s and the non-executive directors’ remuneration and the approach taken by the company in 
relation thereto. 
Component Approach
Chairman’s and  
non-executive  
directors’ fees
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee and the non-executive directors’ fees are set by the board. 
These are reviewed periodically taking into account the responsibilities and time commitments required and non-executive 
director fee levels generally.
The Chairman receives an annual fee, which includes his basic non-executive director’s fee, but does not receive any other 
remuneration.
Non-executive directors receive basic fees, which are subject to an annual limit for non-executive directors’ ordinary 
remuneration contained in the articles of association, currently £350,000. In addition, special fees are paid for the chairmanship 
and membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and also for the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and chairman of the Governance Committee.
The fees of the Chairman and the non-executive directors on implementation of the policy were as follows:
Chairman     £184,500  Basic non-executive director’s fee  £39,900
Audit Committee chairman   £5,600  Audit Committee member  £2,300
Remuneration Committee chairman  £4,900  Remuneration Committee member £1,600
Senior Independent Director/ 
Governance Committee chairman  £5,100
The current fees paid to the chairman and non-executive directors are set out in the annual report on directors’ remuneration, 
but are unchanged from the above.
Additional fees payable for 
services to other group 
companies
Exceptionally, non-executive directors may receive fees from group companies for services provided to them.  
The Hon C W Cayzer receives such a fee, currently £60,000, for his chairmanship of The Sloane Club, a position which  
he held as an executive director of Caledonia prior to becoming non-executive.
Fees for services provided to subsidiary companies are set and reviewed by the boards of those companies, but will not  
exceed £100,000 per annum in aggregate for any non-executive director.
Other benefits The Chairman and the non-executive directors are all covered under the company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
policy and have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s articles of association. The Chairman is also provided with an 
office and some secretarial support.
The company may, where appropriate, pay for the cost of spouses accompanying non-executive directors on trips where there 
is a business reason for doing so and reimburse non-executive directors for hotel accommodation and travel expenses (in each 
case including payment of any tax thereon).
 Rationale for choice of performance measures for the short and long term 
incentive plans 
 The Remuneration Committee has chosen NAVTR as the basis of 
performance measurement for the company for both its short term and 
long term incentive arrangements as it regards this as the best indicator 
of the success or failure of management decisions in terms of creating 
value for the company.
 For the company performance element of the annual bonus scheme, the 
board has taken the view that benchmarking against a stock market index 
or indices over a short period is not relevant given Caledonia’s long term 
investment horizon and the nature of its portfolio. The Remuneration 
Committee has therefore instead chosen RPI as the comparator, as on 
this basis executives will only be rewarded to the extent that they are 
able to deliver positive real returns for shareholders. The Remuneration 
Committee will review the rate of increase in RPI at the start of 
each financial year and may adjust the level of outperformance required 
for the incremental and maximum bonus payments in order to ensure 
that they remain a fair measure of performance.
For awards under the performance share scheme and matching shares 
under the deferred bonus plan, the Remuneration Committee has 
chosen Caledonia’s NAVTR on an annualised basis as the performance 
measurement, as it believes that this is the most effective method of 
aligning directors’ rewards with the long term strategic objective of the 
company of delivering annualised returns over rolling ten year periods of 
between RPI+3% and RPI+6%. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, the Remuneration 
Committee believes that a significant proportion of his variable pay 
should be weighted towards the annualised total return performance 
of the Funds pool of capital for which he is responsible and has therefore 
determined that 60% of his performance share scheme awards should 
be tested by reference to this.
 The targets for each component of the long term incentive plans have 
been set by the Remuneration Committee with the aim of delivering 
increasing reward for greater outperformance. The Remuneration 
Committee keeps these measures and the levels at which incremental 
and maximum entitlements are earned under review in order to ensure 
that they remain sufficiently challenging and aligned with the company’s 
strategy and key performance indicators.
New components introduced into the new remuneration policy 
 There are no new components included in the above policy table which 
were not a part of the remuneration framework previously operated for 
executive directors by the company.
Changes to components included in the previous remuneration policy 
 The only changes to the remuneration policy operated for the year to  
31 March 2013 were the adoption of RPI as the measure of the company 
performance element of the annual bonus scheme, the phased adoption 
of a five year performance measurement period for a significant 
proportion of awards under the company’s performance share scheme 
and the introduction of malus provisions for long term incentive awards 
and bonus deferral.
 Since its approval by shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting, 
there have been no changes to the policy, although new performance 
measurement conditions for the performance share scheme and the 
deferred bonus plan matching shares have been adopted within the terms 
of the policy, as described above.
How the remuneration policy for executive directors relates to 
remuneration of Caledonia group employees generally 
Caledonia’s executive directors’ remuneration packages tend to be higher 
than those of other group employees, but also include a higher proportion 
of variable pay. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
45 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Remuneration policy for new appointments
Executive directors
In the case of the appointment of a new executive director, the 
Remuneration Committee would typically seek to align the remuneration 
package with the above remuneration policy. The Remuneration 
Committee however retains the discretion to make special remuneration 
commitments on the appointment of a new executive director, including 
the use of awards made under Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules, if such were 
absolutely necessary to ensure the recruitment of an exceptional 
candidate. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee would take into 
consideration all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, overall 
quantum, type of remuneration offered and comparability with the 
packages of other Caledonia senior executives and the total variable 
pay would not exceed the maxima stated in the policy table for executive 
director remuneration above.
The Remuneration Committee may in addition make bonus commitments 
or share awards on the appointment of an external candidate to 
compensate for remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a 
previous employer, taking into account factors such as any performance 
conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were 
granted, for example cash or shares, and the time over which they would 
have vested. The aim would be to ensure that replacement awards would 
be made on no greater than a comparable basis.
In order to attract and retain suitable executives, the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to offer 
service contracts with up to an initial 24 month notice period, which then 
reduces to 12 months at the end of this initial period. If it considers it 
appropriate, the Remuneration Committee may also offer a lower 
salary initially, but with a series of increases to achieve the desired salary 
positioning over a period of time, as the individual develops into the role.
If a new appointment is the result of an internal promotion, the 
Remuneration Committee would expect to honour any pre-existing 
contractual arrangements or benefits package agreed with the relevant 
individual. In the event that a new director resides overseas, the 
Remuneration Committee may agree a reasonable relocation package 
and tax equalisation arrangements.
In recruiting any new executive director, the Remuneration Committee 
would apply the overall policy objective that executive directors’ 
remuneration should be competitive, but not excessive. In the event that 
the Remuneration Committee agreed that it was necessary for special 
commitments or sign-on arrangements to be offered to secure the 
recruitment of a new executive director, an explanation of why these 
were required and details thereof would be announced at the time of 
appointment.
Chairman and non-executive directors
Terms for the appointment of any new Chairman or non-executive 
director would also be determined by the Remuneration Committee 
or the board within the above remuneration policy.
Legacy arrangements
The policy is essentially forward looking in nature. In view of the long term 
nature of the company’s remuneration structures – including obligations 
under service contracts, pension arrangements and incentive schemes – 
a substantial number of pre-existing obligations will remain outstanding 
at the time that the new policy is approved, including obligations that 
are ‘grandfathered’ by virtue of being in force at 27 June 2012. It is the 
company’s policy to honour in full any pre-existing obligations that have 
been entered into prior to the effective date of this policy.
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s and 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment 
Executive directors
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group 
Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details of which 
are summarised below:
Date of contract
Notice period  
for the company 
and the director
Unexpired
term
W P Wyatt 2 June 2005 12 months 12 months
S A King 19 November 2009 12 months 12 months
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 19 April 2005 12 months 12 months
If notice is served by either party, the director can continue to receive 
basic salary, benefits and pension payments for the duration of the notice 
period, during which time the company may require the individual to 
continue to fulfil his current duties or may assign a period of gardening 
leave. Alternatively, the company may, in its discretion, terminate the 
contract without notice and make a lump sum payment in lieu of notice. 
This lump sum would include an amount equivalent to the basic salary 
and benefits (based on a fixed percentage of salary specified in the 
service contract) for the unexpired period of notice to which the payment 
relates. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service contracts provide that 
an amount equivalent to 80% of the average of the annual bonuses paid 
for the previous three financial years would also be included in the 
payment in lieu of notice. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service 
contracts also include provisions whereby a liquidated sum is payable in 
the event of termination within one year following a change of control. 
The payment would be calculated on the same basis as a payment in lieu 
of notice, except that an amount equivalent to 100% of the average of the 
annual bonuses paid for the previous three financial years would be 
included.
Mr King’s service contract contains provisions whereby, as an alternative 
to the payment of a lump sum in lieu of notice, the company may elect 
to pay the equivalent amount in equal monthly instalments, such 
instalments to be reduced by 50% of one-twelfth of the basic salary in 
excess of £20,000 per annum that Mr King receives from any alternative 
employment that he takes up during the notice period.
Executive directors’ service contracts may be terminated without notice 
and without any further payment (other than in respect of amounts due 
at the date of termination) on the occurrence of certain events such as 
gross misconduct. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Directors remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not have service 
contracts, but are appointed under letters of appointment, which provide 
for termination without notice or compensation.
Inspection
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s and non-
executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the registered office of the company.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held by 
executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold non-
executive directorships unrelated to the company’s business to broaden 
their commercial experience, provided that the time required is not 
material. Normally the company will retain any fees arising from such 
non-executive directorships, but may permit the executive director to 
retain fees on a case by case basis.
Details of any fees from external non-executive directorships retained by 
executive directors are disclosed in the annual report on directors’ 
remuneration.
Policy on payments for loss of office
Executive directors
It is the policy of the company that, other than in exceptional 
circumstances on recruitment as stated above, no executive director 
should be offered a service contract that requires more than one year’s 
notice of termination or which contains provision for predetermined 
compensation in excess of one year’s total emoluments. In the event of 
a termination, the Remuneration Committee will consider a director’s 
past performance and the circumstances of the departure in exercising 
any discretions relating to the arrangements for loss of office, including 
contractual obligations, prevailing best practice, the reason for the 
departure and any transition or handover required.
The termination provisions in executive directors’ current service 
contracts are described above in the section on executive directors’ 
service contracts. It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention that all 
future executive directors’ service contracts should include provisions 
enabling the company to reduce compensation payments in the event 
that the director takes up alternative employment within the notice 
period. However, if a new director is appointed internally, the 
Remuneration Committee would expect to honour any existing 
contractual arrangements agreed with the relevant individual before 
he or she becomes a director.
In applying the company’s right to make a lump sum payment in lieu of 
notice, the Remuneration Committee would normally expect to pro rate 
the lump sum for the unexpired period of notice to which the payment 
relates. In appropriate circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may 
make a payment in respect of the full twelve months’ notice period, even 
if the director works under notice for part of it.
The company’s annual bonus scheme provides that an employee must 
be in the group’s employment and not under notice of termination (either 
given or received) in order to be entitled to receive a bonus for the 
relevant financial year. The Remuneration Committee would expect 
to apply this principle to executive director terminations, but retains 
discretion to make bonus payments on termination if it believes it 
appropriate to do so. 
Executive directors would also be entitled under their service contracts to 
be paid on termination for any accrued, but untaken, holiday entitlement. 
The Remuneration Committee may, where it considers it appropriate in 
the circumstances, make payments for loss of statutory rights or waiver 
thereof and a contribution towards legal and outplacement fees. The 
Remuneration Committee may also make a payment to ensure that any 
restrictive covenants remain enforceable.
Where the director holds unvested awards under the company’s long 
term incentive schemes, the Remuneration Committee would exercise its 
discretions as to vesting in accordance with the relevant scheme rules. In 
good leaver circumstances, for example where cessation of employment 
is by reason of death, retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, redundancy, 
or such other reason as the Remuneration Committee may decide, the 
Remuneration Committee will normally determine the level of vesting 
based on the attainment of the performance targets, either at the time of 
cessation or at the normal test date if permitted by the scheme rules, but 
in the case of the former may decrease or increase the level of vesting if 
the Remuneration Committee considers that the targets would have been 
met to a lesser or greater extent at the end of the performance period. 
The number of shares that vest will normally be reduced to reflect the 
proportion of the performance period that the director was in 
employment, although the Remuneration Committee has discretion not 
to scale down the number of shares if it believes it appropriate in the 
circumstances.
Following termination, the Remuneration Committee may agree to pay 
a director consultancy fees and continue insurance related benefits until 
the end of the policy period. The company’s directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance policy also provides for a six year period of run-off cover 
for former directors. In limited circumstances, the company may permit 
a director to remain in employment after ceasing to be a director for 
a limited period to allow time for an effective handover or for a successor 
to be appointed.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors have no entitlement to any 
compensation on termination of their appointments, although they would 
have the benefit of run-off cover under the directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance policy as described above. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

1. Taxable benefits
  Taxable benefits comprised private medical insurance cover and a small Christmas 
supplement paid to all Caledonia staff. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s taxable 
benefits also included a cash allowance of £15,024 in lieu of a company car.
  In addition to taxable benefits, other non-taxable benefits were provided to 
executive directors, including death-in-service insurance (4x basic salary), 
permanent health insurance, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and certain 
other benefits of minor value provided to all of Caledonia’s staff.
2. Short term incentives
  In accordance with the rules of the company’s deferred bonus plan, the following 
amounts included in the total of short term incentives were compulsorily deferred, 
satisfied by share awards made shortly after the announcement of the company’s 
final results for the relevant year:

S A King 179 180 359 175 176 351 
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 152 152 304 148 148 296 
 
  For Mr Wyatt and Mr King, a maximum of 50% of bonus was determined by 
reference to company performance and 50% by reference to individual 
performance objectives. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, who has specific responsibility for 
the Funds pool of capital, 25% of his bonus was determined by reference to the 
company’s performance, 25% to his pool’s performance, 35% to his pool’s 
objectives and 15% to individual performance objectives. For the 2015 financial 
year, the company performance element was determined by reference to the 
relative performance of the company’s NAV per share on a total return basis 
(‘NAVTR’) against the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’), with bonus payments for this 
element commencing with a 10% pay-out if the company’s NAVTR matched RPI, 
increasing incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance 
of 7% or more was achieved. Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s pool performance was assessed 
by reference to the return achieved by the Funds pool over the year against an 
annualised target return set for that pool of 12.5% and by pool objectives such 
as deal flow and delivery of portfolio strategy. Individual performance for each 
executive director was assessed by reference to personal objectives set at the start 
of the year, including non-financial measures such as risk management, marketing 
of the company, team leadership, management skills and promotion of Caledonia’s 
corporate culture and image both internally and externally.
  The company’s NAVTR was 14.2% over the year, compared with an increase 
of 0.9% in RPI, resulting in a maximum bonus entitlement for the company 
performance element. The Funds pool’s return over the year was 45.2%, 
significantly ahead of its target return and therefore triggering the maximum 
entitlement for pool performance. The Remuneration Committee judged that 
significant progress had been made over the year in identifying and promoting 
Caledonia to high quality private equity and quoted market fund managers in 
Asia and the US and in building the strategic portfolio for the Funds pool, which 
merited a maximum bonus for Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s pool objectives. Based on an 
assessment of their individual performance objectives over the year, the 
Remuneration Committee also awarded Mr Wyatt, Mr Cayzer-Colvin and  
Mr King maximum bonuses for that component.
  
  The total bonuses awarded to Mr Wyatt, Mr King and Mr Cayzer-Colvin for the year 
were therefore determined as follows:

3. Long term incentives
  The long term incentive awards whose performance measurement period ended 
during the year were awards granted in 2012 under the company’s performance 
share scheme. The vesting of the awards was dependent on the performance 
of the company’s NAVTR over the three financial years ended 31 March 2015 
measured against two separate performance benchmarks. For two-thirds of the 
shares comprised in an award, Caledonia’s NAVTR was measured against the FTSE 
All-Share Total Return index (‘FTSE index’) and for the remaining one-third against 
the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’). 
In each case, vesting was on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on achievement 
of 0.5% outperformance of the relevant benchmark index, rising on a straight line 
basis to 100% vesting on 3.5% outperformance of the relevant index. For the 
purpose of calculating the performance measures, averages of the figures for the 
company’s NAVTR and the two benchmark indices published over the three months 
prior to the start and end of the performance period were used to reduce volatility.
  The company’s NAVTR increased by 53.2% over the performance period, compared 
with increases of 35.9% for the FTSE index and 23.2% for the Gilts index. 
Accordingly, both of the performance targets were met and the performance share 
awards granted in 2012 therefore vested in full.
  The amounts shown in the table above under long term incentives therefore 
comprised the value of the vested performance share scheme awards granted in 
2012 based on the company’s share price at 31 March 2015 of 2281p, together with 
the value of dividends and associated tax credits that would have accrued on the 
vested shares during the performance measurement period as follows:

Defined benefit
The Hon C W Cayzer has deferred pension entitlements under the 
Caledonia Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme. He 
ceased to be an active member of the scheme in December 2012 and 
therefore has not accrued any further pensionable service since then, 
nor have any contributions been made on his behalf into the scheme. 
The Hon C W Cayzer’s normal retirement age is 60, however early 
retirement can be taken from age 55 with the company’s consent. 
In such circumstances, the accrued pension would be reduced to take 
account of its early payment.
Details of The Hon C W Cayzer’s accrued pension benefits were as follows:

Change in transfer value over the year f 403,206 
1.  The accrued pensions shown in rows (a) and (b) represented the deferred pension 
that would be paid at normal retirement age, ignoring any revaluation. The increase 
in accrued pension during the year shown in row (c) represented the increase in 
deferred pension in accordance with the revaluation of pension provisions of the 
Caledonia Pension Scheme applicable to all deferred members.
2.  The transfer values shown in rows (d) and (e) were the present values of the 
accrued pension revalued to normal retirement age and associated benefits at 
the relevant date. Transfer values were calculated using the transfer value basis 
as determined by the trustees of the Caledonia Pension Scheme, which reflected 
market conditions at the relevant date.
3.  The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (f) (calculated as row (d) 
less row (e)), also reflected the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the 
control of the company and the directors, such as movements in financial markets. 
These changes can cause transfer values at different points in time to fluctuate 
significantly. Disclosed changes in transfer values may therefore be subject to a 
large degree of volatility and may even be negative. In particular, the Caledonia 
Pension Scheme’s transfer value assumptions have been updated to allow for 
changes in market conditions.

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and scheme interests 
(audited)
Executive directors’ minimum shareholding guidelines
In order to align the interests of executive directors with those of 
shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted guidelines for 
minimum shareholdings, which executive directors will be expected to 
attain through the retention of all post-tax share awards vesting under 
the company’s long term incentive plans until the minimum shareholding 
is met. For these purposes, shareholdings include those of connected 
persons and also the value, net of any exercise costs, income tax and 
National Insurance contributions, of unexercised options granted under 
the company’s executive share option schemes and awards granted 
under its performance share scheme for which the performance targets 
have been met. Also included are bonuses deferred, compulsorily or 
voluntarily, under the company’s deferred bonus plan and any uncalled 
bonus matching shares for which the performance targets have been 
met, again net of income tax and National Insurance contributions.
For the Chief Executive, the minimum guideline shareholding has been 
set at 200% of basic salary and for other executive directors 150% of basic 
salary. Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin both significantly exceed their 
minimum guideline shareholdings, although Mr King has yet to achieve his 
as he has not received sufficient vested share awards since he joined the 
company in December 2009. The values of the relevant shareholdings of 
each executive director as at 31 March 2015, calculated by reference to 
Caledonia’s closing share price on that date of 2281p, were as follows:

1. Performance conditions
 Executive share option scheme
  Options outstanding under the executive share option scheme have all met their 
performance targets.
 Performance share scheme
  Nil-cost options awarded under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012 
and 12 June 2013 are subject to targets related to the company’s NAVTR 
performance against two benchmark indices, the FTSE index and the Gilts index. 
Awards vest on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% outperformance of the 
relevant benchmark, rising to maximum vesting on 3.5% outperformance. There is 
no re-testing of either performance target and, to the extent that a performance 
target is not met, the relevant award will lapse. For the purpose of calculating the 
performance measures, averages of the company’s NAVTR and the two benchmark 
indices over the three months prior to the start and end of the performance period 
is used to reduce volatility. To the extent that the performance targets are met, 
vested awards may be exercised between the date of vesting and the tenth 
anniversary of the date of grant.
  For nil-cost options granted on 28 May 2012, two-thirds of the shares comprised 
in an award are tested against the FTSE index and one-third against the Gilts index. 
In each case the performance period is a period of three years commencing with 
the financial year in which the awards are granted. For the nil-cost options awarded 
on 12 June 2013, one-half of the shares comprised in an award are measured 
against the Gilts index over three years and the other half against the FTSE index 
over five years.
  For nil-cost options granted to Mr Wyatt and Mr King on 27 November 2014, shares 
will vest on a graduated basis, with vesting commencing at 10% if the company 
achieves an annualised NAVTR of 3%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting on 
achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 10%. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, who is head 
of the Funds pool, 60% of his performance share scheme awards granted on 
27 November 2014 will be measured against the annualised total returns achieved 
by the Funds pool. Awards will similarly vest on a graduated basis, with vesting 
commencing at 10% on achievement of an annualised Funds pool total return of 
6%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised total 
return of 13.5%. The remaining 40% of Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s performance share 
scheme awards will be measured against Caledonia’s NAVTR as above. For all 
nil-cost options granted on 27 November 2014, the relevant performance 
conditions will be tested over three years for one-half of the shares comprised in 
an award and over five years for the other half of the shares comprised in an award.
  Deferred bonus plan matching awards
  The performance targets for the matching awards are the same as those for nil-cost 
options granted under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012. Shares that 
vest must be called within 12 months of vesting.
2. Other exercise conditions
  Executive share option scheme
  Once the performance conditions have been met, options granted under the 
executive share option scheme may normally be exercised between three and 
ten years from the date of grant, although only one-third of the shares comprised 
in an option may be exercised three years after grant, with the remaining 
two-thirds becoming exercisable six years after grant.
  Performance share scheme
  For nil-cost options granted under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012, 
to the extent that a performance target is met, two-thirds of the shares that vest 
may normally be exercised three years after grant, with the remaining one-third 
normally becoming exercisable five years after grant.
  For nil-cost options granted on 12 June 2013 and 27 November 2014, shares that 
vest following three or five year performance testing become immediately 
exercisable.
3. Vested but unexercised
  Shares vested but unexercised represent those awards that are immediately 
exercisable without any conditions.
Performance graph of total shareholder return and table of 
Chief Executive’s total remuneration
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index for the six financial 
years ending on 31 March 2015. TSR has been calculated assuming that 
all dividends are reinvested on their ex-dividend dates. The FTSE All-Share 
Total Return index has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the 
company measures its delivery of value over the longer term. For 
comparison, the table below the graph shows the total remuneration 
received by the Chief Executive in each of the six years to 31 March 2015, 
prepared on the same basis as in the single total figure in the table on 
page 47, and the percentage of the maximum potential short and long 
term incentives received in those years.

time Mr Wyatt was appointed as his successor. The remuneration shown for 2011 
represents the amounts paid to each in the period that they served as Chief 
Executive in that financial year. The long term incentives held by Mr Ingram which 
vested in 2011 were HMRC approved executive share options granted in 2008, 
which the Remuneration Committee determined should vest based on the 
measurement of the performance targets up to the date of his retirement. The 
percentage of short term incentives shown as vesting for Mr Wyatt in 2011 relates 
to his annual bonus for that year, the total amount of which has been included 
in the corresponding single figure for total remuneration.
   Subsequent to his retirement, Mr Ingram exercised further share options at a 
pre-tax gain of £119,413 in the 2014 financial year. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive
The following table shows the percentage change in the basic salary, value 
of taxable benefits and short term incentives paid to the Chief Executive 
in the year to 31 March 2015 against the previous financial year, 
compared with the average percentage changes in those components 
of pay of Caledonia’s other staff on a per capita basis. Caledonia’s staff 
received a standard increase in basic salary of 2.5% and the standard 
bonus was the maximum entitlement, the same as the Chief Executive. 
However, the average per capita percentage changes shown below were 
higher due to the effect of non-standard increases or bonus awards 
for a number of staff reflecting promotion, increased responsibilities 
or other such adjustments.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the 
2016 financial year
The company expects to operate the remuneration policy as described 
in the previous section without any changes in the financial year ending 
31 March 2016.
Basic salaries of executive directors
In respect of the 2016 financial year, the Remuneration Committee 
has already awarded the executive directors inflation-based increases 
in basic salary of 1.0%, as follows.

Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees
The Chairman’s and the non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed 
triennially. The last review was in April 2014 and therefore their fees 
are unchanged since that date, as follows:

Annual bonus scheme
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance target 
for the company performance element of the annual bonus scheme and 
decided that, for the financial year ending 31 March 2016 and subsequent 
years, the current target, whereby payments commence with a 10% 
pay-out if the performance of the company’s NAVTR matches RPI, 
increasing incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if 
outperformance of 7% or more is achieved, should be qualified such 
that the RPI comparator should be the higher of actual RPI or 3%, being 
broadly in line with the historic long term average.
Long term incentive schemes
No changes to the company’s long term incentive schemes are anticipated 
for the 2016 financial year.
Approach
The Remuneration Committee will keep the implementation of the 
remuneration policy under review in order to take account of any changes 
in the company’s business environment and remuneration practice 
generally, but with the overall aim of ensuring that Caledonia’s 
remuneration arrangements continue to attract and retain talent and 
reward executives appropriately in the light of the company’s 
performance. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
53 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Consideration by the directors of matters relating 
to directors’ remuneration
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are 
Charles Gregson (Chairman), David Stewart and Robert Woods. 
Mr Gregson and Mr Woods served throughout the year and 
Mr Stewart became a member of the Committee on 17 March 2015. 
Charles Allen-Jones also served as a member of the Committee until 
his retirement from the board on 17 March 2015.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP , the company’s main legal advisers, 
in relation to the preparation of the 2014 directors’ remuneration report, 
the adoption of new performance measures for the long term incentive 
plans and the implications of the introduction of clawback provisions into 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Remuneration Committee also 
consulted with the Chairman and the Chief Executive in relation to the 
remuneration of the executive directors and internal support was 
provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary.

Dividends
An interim dividend of 13.8p per share (2014 – 13.4p) was paid on 
8 January 2015 and the board has proposed that a final dividend of 
36.8p per share (2014 – 35.7p) be paid on 6 August 2015. This will result 
in total dividends for the year of 50.6p per share (2014 – 49.1p).
Share capital structure
The company has two classes of share capital – ordinary shares of 5p each 
and deferred ordinary shares of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends 
as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share 
at meetings of the company. All voting rights are however suspended 
in respect of any of the company’s shares that are held in treasury or 
by group companies.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not 
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference 
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the 
nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or 
£4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. The company is 
required to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits. 
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary shares 
carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up on such shares only 
after holders of the ordinary shares have received the sum of £100,000 in 
respect of each ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are 
held by Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
At 31 March 2015, 55,381,017 ordinary shares and 8,000,000 deferred 
ordinary shares were in issue. The ordinary shares therefore represented 
approximately 87%, and the deferred ordinary shares approximately 13%, 
of the total issued share capital by nominal value. Of the ordinary shares 
in issue at 31 March 2015, 3,000 shares were held by a group company. 
As stated above, all voting rights are suspended on these shares.
During the year, the company purchased and cancelled 30,000 ordinary 
shares at a total cost of £0.6m. The company’s issued share capital after 
these transactions, as at 26 May 2015, being the latest practicable date 
prior to signature of these accounts, was 55,381,017 ordinary shares and 
8,000,000 deferred ordinary shares.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of the company’s shares, 
although the articles of association contain provisions whereby the 
directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share which is 
not fully paid, provided that such refusal does not prevent dealings in the 
share from taking place on an open and proper basis. The directors may 
also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless it is (a) 
lodged, duly stamped, at the registered office or at such other place as 
the directors may appoint, accompanied by the certificate for the shares 
to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may 
reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the 
transfer; (b) in respect of only one class of shares; and (c) in favour of 
not more than four transferees.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares if a shareholder 
has not supplied information to the company in default of a request duly 
served under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and such shares 
represent at least 0.25% of the class of shares concerned.

There have been no changes in the substantial interests notified to the

Employee share trust
The Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust acquires and holds 
ordinary shares in the company for subsequent transfer to employees 
exercising options under the company’s executive share option scheme 
and the performance share scheme or calling for awards vesting under 
the company’s deferred bonus plan. The voting rights of shares held 
by the trust are exercisable by the independent trustee. The trustee has  
waived all dividends payable in respect of the ordinary shares held by the 
trust, except to the extent of 0.0001% of such dividends. At 31 March 2015, 
the trust held 273,640 ordinary shares.
Restrictions on voting rights
The directors may direct that a shareholder shall not be entitled to 
attend and vote either personally or by proxy or exercise any other right 
conferred by membership in relation to general meetings of the company 
in respect of some or all of the shares held by him, if he or any person 
with an interest in such shares has been duly served with a notice under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and is in default for the prescribed 
period in supplying to the company the information required or, in 
purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which 
is false or inadequate in a material particular.
Agreements which may restrict the transfer of shares or 
exercise of voting rights
The company is not aware of any arrangements which may restrict the 
transfer of any of its shares or the exercise of any voting rights.
Authority to allot and purchase shares
At the annual general meeting of the company held on 17 July 2014, 
shareholders granted to the directors authority to allot ordinary shares up 
to a nominal amount of £923,516, representing approximately one-third 
of the ordinary share capital then in issue, with authority to allot 
additional ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £923,517, representing 
approximately a further one-third of the ordinary share capital then 
in issue, by way of pre-emptive rights issues only, in accordance with 
guidance issued at that time by the Association of British Insurers. The 
directors were further authorised to issue ordinary shares up to a nominal 
amount of £138,527 other than pro rata to existing ordinary shareholders. 
These authorities last until 17 October 2015 or, if earlier, the conclusion of 
the next annual general meeting. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
55 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
At the annual general meeting held on 17 July 2014, shareholders also 
granted authority for the company to make market purchases of up to 
5,541,100 of its own ordinary shares, being approximately 10% of the 
ordinary share capital then in issue, at a price not more than the higher 
of (a) 5% greater than the average of the middle market quotations for 
such ordinary shares during the five business days preceding any such 
purchase; and (b) the higher of (i) the price of the last independent trade 
in such ordinary shares; and (ii) the highest current independent bid 
relating thereto on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out, 
nor at a price less than 5p, being the nominal value of an ordinary share. 
This authority lasts until 17 October 2015 or, if earlier, the conclusion of 
the next annual general meeting. At the same time, shareholders who 
were not members of the Cayzer family concert party (‘Cayzer Concert 
Party’) gave their approval for a waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and 
Mergers of the obligation that could arise on the Cayzer Concert Party 
under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers to make a 
general offer for Caledonia on the implementation by the company of 
the above authority to purchase its own shares. The approval was subject 
to the maximum percentage of voting rights in which the Cayzer Concert 
Party is interested not exceeding 49.9% as a result of purchases by the 
company. This waiver expires on 17 October 2015 or, if earlier, the 
conclusion of the next annual general meeting.
Change of control rights
There are no special control rights in relation to the company’s shares.
Options granted under the company’s executive share option scheme 
and its performance share scheme and awards made under its deferred 
bonus plan may become exercisable or vest as a result of a change of 
control, although the number of shares comprised in those options or 
awards may be reduced. The service contracts of certain directors and 
other senior executives also contain provisions whereby a liquidated sum 
is payable by the company in the event of termination within one year 
following a change of control. 
Further details of these change of control rights are set out in the 
directors’ remuneration report.
Investment trust status
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has confirmed that Caledonia 
has investment trust status for all financial periods from 1 April 2012.
Annual general meeting
The eighty-sixth annual general meeting of the company will be held at 
Cayzer House, 30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN on Thursday, 
16 July 2015 at 11.30 am. The notice of the annual general meeting and 
details of all of the resolutions to be put to shareholders are set out in 
a separate circular sent to shareholders at the same time as this annual 
report.
Directors
The directors of the company are shown on pages 30 and 31. All of the 
directors served throughout the year other than Mr H Y H Boël and  
Mr D C Stewart, who were appointed on 25 June 2014 and 17 March 2015 
respectively. In addition, Mr C M Allen-Jones and Mr R Goblet d’Alviella 
served as directors until their retirements from the board on 17 March 
2015 and 25 June 2014 respectively. Mrs S C R Jemmett-Page will join 
the board with effect from 1 July 2015.
Directors’ indemnity
Each of the directors has the benefit, under the company’s articles of 
association, of an indemnity, to the extent permitted by the Companies 
Act 2006, against any liability incurred by him or her for negligence, 
default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the affairs 
of the company.
Appointment and removal of directors and the articles 
of association
The appointment and removal of directors is governed by the company’s 
articles of association and prevailing company law.
The articles of association provide that at every annual general meeting 
one-third of the directors, or if not a multiple of three, the number 
nearest to one-third, shall retire by rotation and therefore be required 
to seek re-election by shareholders. New directors may be appointed by 
the board, but are subject to election by shareholders at the next annual 
general meeting of the company following their appointment. However, 
to comply with the provisions of The UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
company requires that all directors should be subject to annual election 
by shareholders. Shareholders may also appoint new directors by 
ordinary resolution. The articles of association limit the number of 
directors to not less than two and not more than twelve, unless the 
shareholders resolve otherwise.

introduced in May 2014, the election of those directors determined by 
the board to be independent under The UK Corporate Governance Code 
must be subject to the approval of both all shareholders of the company 
and separately those shareholders who are not controlling shareholders, 
being the Cayzer Concert party.
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the terms 
of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. The group will 
abide by those terms on condition that it is satisfied that the supplier 
has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms 
and conditions. The group does not follow any code or statement on 
payment practice.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report on pages 2 to 5 and the 
investment review on pages 10 to 21. The financial position of the group, 
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 22 and 23. In addition, note 22 to the 
financial statements includes the group’s capital management policies 
and procedures and processes for managing market risk and exposures 
to currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group has cash resources and committed bank facilities available 
to meet existing and new investment commitments. As a consequence, 
the directors believe that the group is well placed to manage business 
risks successfully.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual report and accounts.
Auditor
Resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting to re-appoint 
KPMG LLP as auditor of the company and to authorise the directors 
to agree the auditor’s remuneration. A description of how the Audit 
Committee ensures the objectivity and independence of the auditor 
is set out on page 37 within the Audit Committee report. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Responsibility statements
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the 
directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the directors have prepared 
the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law, the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and 
of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent
	 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union has been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the group and parent company financial statements respectively
	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that:
1.  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant information of which 
the company’s auditor is unaware
2.  the director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as 
a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance with 
the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Responsibility statements under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and The UK Corporate Governance Code
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 30 
and 31 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
1.  the group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the group
2.  the strategic report contained on pages 1 to 29 includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

Independent auditors report

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Caledonia Investments plc 
for the year ended 31 March 2015 set out on pages 60 to 78. In our 
opinion:
	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and 
of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
	 the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
	 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks 
of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were 
as follows:
Valuation of unlisted investments (£850.2m)
Refer to page 36 (Audit Committee report), page 64 (accounting policy) 
and page 68 (financial disclosures)
The risk
50.9% of the group’s total assets (by value) is held in investments where 
no quoted market price is available. Unlisted investments are measured 
at fair value, which is established in accordance with International Private 
Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines by using measurements 
of value such as price of recent orderly transactions, earnings multiples 
and net assets. There is a significant risk over the valuation of these 
investments and this is one of the key judgmental areas that our audit 
focused on.
Our response
Our procedures included:
	 Enquiry of management to document and assess the design and 
implementation of the investment valuation processes and controls in 
place. We attended the biannual Challenge Committee meetings and all 
Audit Committee meetings where we assessed the effectiveness of the 
Committees’ challenge and approval of unlisted investment valuations.
	 Assessment of investment realisations in the period, comparing actual 
sales proceeds to prior year end valuations to understand the reasons 
for significant variances and consideration of whether they are 
indicative of bias or error in the group’s approach to valuations.
	 Challenging the investment manager on key judgements affecting 
investee company valuations in the context of observed industry best 
practice and the provisions of the International Private Equity and 
Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. In particular, we challenged the 
appropriateness of the valuation basis selected as well as the underlying 
assumptions, such as discount factors, and the choice of benchmark 
for earnings multiples. We compared key underlying financial data 
inputs to external sources and investee company audited accounts 
and management information as applicable. We challenged the 
assumptions around sustainability of earnings based on the plans 
of the investee companies and whether these are achievable, and 
we obtained an understanding of existing and prospective investee 
company cash flows to understand whether borrowings can be serviced 
or refinancing may be required. Where a recent transaction is used to 
value any holding, we obtained an understanding of the circumstances 
surrounding the transactions and whether it was considered to be on 
an arm’s-length basis and suitable as an input into a valuation. Our work 
included consideration of events which occurred subsequent to the 
year end up until the date of this audit report.
	 We compared the investment property valuations of the directors to 
valuations performed by the external valuer and evaluated the 
competence, capabilities and objectivity of the valuer. With the 
assistance of our own valuation specialist, we considered the 
appropriateness of the external and internal valuations and inherent 
assumptions by comparing the group’s assumptions to externally 
derived data.
	 For the valuation of fund interests we obtained and agreed the latest 
reported net asset values from the fund managers. Our procedures 
also included obtaining audited financial statements of the funds and 
checking the historical accuracy of the net asset values.
	 Our procedures also included consideration of the appropriateness, 
in accordance with relevant accounting standards, of the disclosures in 
note 22 in respect of unlisted investments and the effect of changing 
one or more inputs to reasonably possible alternative valuation 
assumptions.
Carrying value of investments listed on recognised stock exchanges 
(£648.6m)
Refer to page 37 (Audit Committee report), page 64 (accounting policy) 
and page 68 (financial disclosures)
The risk
The group’s portfolio of listed equity investments makes up 38.8% of 
the total assets of the group and is considered to be one of the key 
drivers of operations and performance results. We do not consider these 
investments to be at high risk of significant misstatement, or to be subject 
to a significant level of judgement because they comprise liquid, quoted 
investments. However, due to their materiality in the context of the 
financial statements as a whole, they are considered to be one of the 
areas which had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy and 
allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit.
Our response
Our procedures over the completeness, valuation and existence of 
the group’s listed equity investment portfolio included, but were not 
limited to:
	 documenting and assessing the processes in place to record investment 
transactions and to value the portfolio;
	 agreeing the valuation of 100 per cent of investments in the portfolio 
to externally quoted prices; and
	 agreeing 100 per cent of investment holdings in the portfolio to 
independently received third party confirmations.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our 
audit
Materiality for the financial statements as a whole was set at £25m, 
determined with reference to a benchmark of total group assets, of which 
it represents 1.5%.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected and uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £1.2m in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The group audit team performed the audit of the group as if it was a single 
aggregated set of financial information. The audit was performed using 
the materiality levels set out above and covered 100% of total group 
revenue, group profit before tax, and total group assets. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
59 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
is unmodified
In our opinion:
	 the parts of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;
	 the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements;
	 information given in the corporate governance statement set out on 
pages 32 to 34 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share 
capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are 
required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency 
with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
	 we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s 
performance, business model and strategy; or
	 the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
	 the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
	 a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the 
company.
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review:
	 the directors’ statement, set out on page 55, in relation to going 
concern; and
	 the part of the corporate governance statement on pages 32 to 34 
relating to the company’s compliance with the ten provisions of the 
2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set 
out on page 57 , the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is 
provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the company’s 
members as a body and is subject to important explanations and

Significant accounting policies
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company domiciled 
in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England in 1928, under the 
Companies Acts 1908 to 1917. The address of its registered office is 
Cayzer House, 30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN. The ordinary 
shares of the company are premium listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors 
on 27 May 2015.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, as this is 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which Caledonia 
operates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Fair values of financial instruments
Most of the group’s financial instruments are measured at fair value in the 
statement of financial position and it is usually possible to determine their 
fair values within a reasonable range of estimates.
For actively traded financial instruments, quoted market prices are readily 
available. For other financial instruments, such as unlisted securities, 
valuation techniques are used to estimate fair value. Valuation techniques 
make maximum use of market inputs, including reference to the current 
fair values of instruments that are substantially the same (subject to 
appropriate adjustments).
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on market 
conditions and information about the financial instrument. These 
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters 
of significant judgement and therefore cannot be determined with 
precision.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
EU and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4 
of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRSs comprise accounting standards issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board and its predecessor 
body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee and its predecessor body.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and properties. 
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended 
Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture 
Capital Trusts (‘SORP’) issued by the Association of Investment Companies 
in November 2014 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements 
on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP .
The statement of comprehensive income of the company has been 
omitted from these financial statements in accordance with section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Under The UK Corporate Governance Code and applicable regulations, 
the directors are required to satisfy themselves that it is reasonable to 
presume that the company is a going concern. The directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
as discussed on page 55. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of preparing the financial statements.
Adopted IFRSs
In the current year, the group has not adopted any new standards 
or interpretations.
IFRSs not yet applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following 
standards had been issued by the IASB but not adopted by the EU:
	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
	 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in future 
periods in their issued form will have no material impact on the financial 
statements.
Assessment as investment entity
Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 
are required to account for most investments in controlled entities as held 
at fair value through profit or loss. Subsidiaries that provide investment 
related services or engage in permitted investment related activities with 
investees continue to be consolidated unless they are also investment 
entities. The board has concluded that the company meets the definition 
of an investment entity.
Basis of consolidation
In accordance with the IFRS 10/IAS 28 Investment entities amendments, 
the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of 
the company and service entities controlled by the company made up to 
the reporting date. Control is achieved where the company has the power 
over the potential investee as a result of voting or other rights, has rights 
to positive or negative variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect 
significantly the amount of its returns.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated 
to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the 
reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated to the 
functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
that are stated at fair value are translated to the functional currency at 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were 
determined.
In the financial statements, foreign exchange gains or losses are 
recognised in capital or revenue reserve depending on whether the 
gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue when 
the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established, normally 
the ex-dividend date. Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends 
receivable on or before the period end are treated as revenue for the 
period. Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities, loans and non-equity shares are 
recognised on an effective interest rate basis, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life 
of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The company’s share of net income from limited partnerships is 
recognised as revenue when received.
Where uncertainty arises over the collectability of an amount already 
included in income, the uncollectible amount or the amount in respect 
of which the recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognised as an 
expense. When the uncertainty over collectability is removed, normally 
on receipt, the income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
65 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. In the financial 
statements, management expenses and performance fees are included 
in revenue reserves. Expenses of acquisition of an investment designated 
as held at fair value through profit or loss or expenses of an aborted 
acquisition or disposal of an investment are presented as transaction 
costs, or deducted from the proceeds of sale as appropriate, and included 
in capital reserves. 
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense 
as they fall due.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined 
using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each reporting date. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other 
comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately in the period of a plan 
amendment.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial 
position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from 
this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Profit sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit 
sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. 
The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where 
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant and the fair value is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest.
Where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to the equity 
instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided to 
the subsidiary, the subsidiary recognises an equity-settled share-based 
payment transaction expense with a corresponding increase recognised 
in equity representing a contribution from the parent. In addition, the 
parent recognises an increase in equity and an increase in subsidiary 
investment equivalent to the amount of the share-based payment 
transaction.
An employee share trust is used for distributing option and performance 
share and deferred bonus awards to employees under Caledonia’s share 
remuneration schemes. The trustee purchases shares with money lent 
interest free by Caledonia and transfers shares to participating employees 
on receipt of the requisite consideration or calling of awards.
The transactions the employee share trust undertakes are considered 
to be performed by the trust as an agent for Caledonia. The transactions 
of the employee share trust are included in the separate financial 
statements of the parent company and, following the requirements of 
IFRS10, in the consolidated financial statements as if they arose in that 
company. Own shares held by the employee share trust as at the 
reporting date are accounted for as if they were treasury shares.
National Insurance on share option scheme gains and performance share 
and deferred bonus awards
National Insurance payable on the exercise of certain employee share 
options and performance share awards at the date of exercise and 
deferred bonus awards at the date of call has been charged as an expense 
spread over the respective vesting periods. The charge is based on the 
difference between the market value of the underlying shares at the 
reporting date and the exercise price for share options or £nil for 
performance share awards and deferred bonus awards and calculated 
at the latest enacted National Insurance rate.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred 
tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Investment trust 
companies that have approval as such under section 1159 of the 
Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting 
date and adjusted to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to 
be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are appropriately 
authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity. For interim 
dividends, this will normally mean the date on which they are paid and, 
for final dividends, the date on which they are approved in general 
meeting.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where 
a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established 
by the market concerned and are initially measured at cost, excluding 
transaction costs.
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing in financial 
assets are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss in both 
the consolidated financial statements and the company financial 
statements.
Investments designated as held at fair value through profit or loss are 
measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains or losses 
arising from changes in the value of investments designated as held at 
fair value through profit or loss, including foreign exchange movements, 
are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital return.
Listed investments are valued at bid price or the last traded price when 
a bid price is not available. Unlisted investments are valued using 
recognised valuation methodologies, based on the International Private 
Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, which reflect the 
amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, 
willing parties on an arm’s length basis. The portfolio valuation 
methodology is detailed on page 24. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
66 Annual report 2015 Caledonia Investments plc  
Significant accounting policies continued
Distributions from investment limited partnerships are treated as disposal 
proceeds or income in accordance with the nature of the distribution.  
Any surplus capital distributions after repaying partner’s capital are 
treated as realised gains.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Hedge accounting is not applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income as they arise.
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve. The following items are 
transferred into the capital reserve from profit or loss:
	 gains and losses on investments held at fair value through profit  
or loss
	 gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value of 
investments
	 expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation to capital 
transactions
	 actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes
	 taxation on items recognised in the capital reserve.
Property, plant and equipment
Property is measured at fair value. Gains arising from changes in the fair 
value are included in other comprehensive income for the period in 
which they arise and losses included in profit or loss. To the extent gains 
represent the reversal of cumulative losses previously recognised they 
are included in profit or loss.
Plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment loss.
Assets in course of construction are measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment loss.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the fair value or cost of items of 
property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using 
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Land and assets 
in course of construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are 
as follows:
Buildings  25-50 years 
Office equipment 3-5 years
Accumulated depreciation on revalued property is eliminated against 
the gross carrying amount of the asset. 
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, 
if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. 
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value 
as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are 
short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the fair value 
of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accrual basis in the statement of comprehensive 
income using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. The effective interest method allocates the 
interest expense over the life of the instrument so as to reflect a constant 
return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the 
company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is 
material.
In the financial statements, provisions recognised for investments are 
included in the statement of comprehensive income as a capital return.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded as the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Where the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust purchases 
the company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted 
from equity attributable to the company’s owners until the shares are 
transferred. Where such shares are subsequently transferred, any 
consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the company’s owners.

The warranty provision relates to the disposal of an investment in 2006. 
The provision was estimated based on the amount of the claim against 
the company. The claim was determined in the prior year and the agreed 
settlement covered by insurance.
The bank guarantee provision related to a bank loan drawn by a subsidiary 
and lent to another subsidiary, which did not have sufficient resources 
to settle the obligation in full. The provision was estimated based on the 
expected shortfall should the loan be repaid. During the year, the ultimate 
borrower was restructured and the loan obligation settled in full.
The solvency guarantee provision related to a subsidiary that had a claim 
against it, but insufficient resources to settle any such obligations. The 
provision was estimated based on the amount of the claim against the 
subsidiary. During the year, the provision was increased based on a review 
of the obligations.
The litigation provision related to a claim arising from the acquisition of 
a subsidiary in 2013. The amount of the provision was estimated based 
on the costs of defending the claim in the courts.
With the exception of the litigation provision, these provisions were 
allocated to the capital reserve. As the matters that gave rise to the 
provisions were expected to be resolved over the next year, all provisions 
were classified as current liabilities.

The company had outstanding share options and performance share 
scheme and deferred bonus awards (note 23).
As at 31 March 2015, the issued share capital of the company comprised 
55,381,017 ordinary shares (2014 – 55,411,017) and 8,000,000 deferred 
ordinary shares (2014 – 8,000,000). The ordinary and deferred ordinary 
shares have a nominal value of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as 
declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at 
meetings of the company. In respect of the company’s ordinary shares 
that are held by subsidiaries, all voting rights are suspended.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not 
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference 
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the 
nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or 
£4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. The company is 
required to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits. 
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary shares 
carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up on such shares only 
after holders of the ordinary shares have received the sum of £100,000 in 
respect of each such ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares 
are held by Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
company.
17 . Net asset value per share
The group’s undiluted net asset value per share is based on the net assets 
of the group at the year end and on the number of ordinary shares in issue 
at the year end less ordinary shares held by the Caledonia Investments plc 
Employee Share Trust. The group’s diluted net asset value per share 
assumes the exercise of all outstanding in-the-money share options and 
the calling of performance share and deferred bonus awards.

18. Operating segments
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive 
Committee, which reviews the company’s internal reporting in order to 
assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined 
the operating segments based on these reports.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on a measure of 
group total revenue, principally comprising gains and losses on 
investments and derivatives hedging those investments and investment 
income. Reportable profit or loss is after treasury income and ‘Other 
items’, which comprise management and other expenses and provisions. 
Reportable assets equate to the group’s total assets. Cash and cash 
equivalents and other items are not identifiable operating segments.
‘Other investments’ comprise subsidiaries not managed as part of the 
investment portfolio.

of the participating employers of those schemes.
At 31 March 2015, there was a litigation claim outstanding in respect 
of an investment made in 2013.
22. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash 
balances, borrowings and receivables and payables that arise from 
operations. The investment portfolio includes listed and unlisted 
equity investments, debt instruments and investments in funds that 
are intended to be held for the long term.
Risk analysis
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed are market 
risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at 
the reporting date and the risk management policies employed are 
discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes 
price risk, currency risk and fair value interest rate risk.
The strategy for managing market risk is driven by the investment 
objective, which is to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index over rolling ten year periods. Investments are made in a range of 
instruments, including listed and unlisted equities, debt and non-equity 
investment funds, in a range of sectors and regions.
Price risk
Price risk may affect the value of listed and unlisted investments as 
a result of changes in market prices (other than arising from interest rate 
risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual 
investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the 
market.
As the majority of financial instruments are carried at fair value, with fair 
value changes recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, 
all changes in market conditions will directly affect reported portfolio 
returns.
Price risk is managed by constructing a diversified portfolio of instruments 
traded on various markets and hedging where appropriate.
The exposures of listed and unlisted equity investments, equity linked 
bonds and funds were as follows:

The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% variation in equity 
prices. The sensitivity analysis includes all equity and fund investments 
held at fair value through profit or loss and adjusts their valuation at the 
year end for a 10% change in value.

Increase in prices 146.5 138.0 148.1 139.5 
Decrease in prices (146.5) (138.0) (148.1) (139.5)
The sensitivity to equity and fund investments has increased during the 
year due to investment portfolio gains in the year.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative 
of the inherent price risk as the year end exposure does not reflect the 
exposure throughout the year as a whole.
Currency risk
Investments in financial instruments and other transactions may be 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. 
Consequently, there is exposure to the risk that the exchange rate of the 
functional currency may change relative to other currencies in a manner 
that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of assets and 
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
The company’s non-functional currency denominated investments and 
gains and losses thereon are reviewed regularly by the directors and 
the currency risk is managed by the directors within the overall asset 
allocation strategies and risk. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

observation of market conditions and historic trends. The sensitivity 
analysis includes all foreign denominated debt investments.

Sterling appreciates (strengthens) – (0.1) – (0.1)
The exposure to foreign currency has decreased during the year due to 
the reduction in foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of investments in fixed 
interest securities and the level of income receivable from fixed income 
securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
The company and group held fixed rate, interest-bearing financial assets, 
with maturity of up to five years, cash at bank and term deposits, with the 
term to maturity of up to three months, and floating rate, interest-bearing 
financial assets. The group also had floating rate, interest-bearing 
borrowings.
The exposure to interest rate risk on financial assets and liabilities was

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the 
exposure to interest rates at the reporting date from a 50 basis point 
change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held 
constant throughout the year. This level of change is considered to be 
reasonable, based on observation of market conditions and historic 
trends.

Increase in interest rates (0.5) (0.6) (0.4) (0.4)
The group’s and company’s sensitivity to interest rates has changed in 
the year due to a reduction in fixed interest loans, against an increase in 
floating rate loans and net cash with a relatively lower rate of interest.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will 
fail to discharge an obligation or commitment. A credit policy is in place 
and exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored.
At 31 March 2015, the financial assets exposed to credit risk were 
as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents 140.0 32.9 138.7 35.5 
180.7 112.0 160.4 82.3 
Prior to making investments in debt instruments, management has 
in place a process of review that includes an evaluation of a potential 
investee company’s ability to service and repay its debt. Management 
reviews the financial position of investee companies, including their 
continuing ability to service and repay debt, on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables is mitigated 
by performing credit evaluations on investee companies as part of the 
due diligence process.
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash equivalents 
is mitigated by spreading investments and deposits across a number 
of approved counterparties in accordance with board policy. These are 
either investment grade banks with a credit rating of ‘AA3’ or ‘AA-‘ or 
higher, as determined by the rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch, or 
banks specifically approved by the board. These credit ratings are 
reviewed regularly.
At the year end, the group and company had cash deposits with the 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc of £98.0m and £96.7m respectively.
All transactions in listed securities are settled on contract terms using 
approved brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal, as delivery 
of securities sold is only made once the broker has received payment. 
Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been received by 
the broker. The trade will fail if either party fails to meet their obligations. 
Listed security trades are settled through HSBC Global Custody.
Fair value
Most of the financial instruments are carried at fair value in the statement 
of financial position. Usually, the fair value of the financial instruments can 
be reliably determined within a reasonable range of estimates. For certain 
other financial instruments, specifically operating and other receivables 
and payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the 
immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises as a result of the possibility that the group and 
company may not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The corporate treasury function provides services to the company 
and group, coordinating access to domestic financial markets for both 
borrowing and depositing. Group companies access local financial 
markets when this is more favourable, in liaison with the corporate 
treasury function. Executive management monitors the group’s liquidity 
on a weekly basis, including the level of undrawn committed facilities. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Capital management policies and procedures
The group’s capital management objectives are:
	 to ensure that the group and company will be able to continue 
as a going concern
	 to maximise the income and capital return to the company’s 
shareholders, principally through the use of equity capital, although 
the group will maintain appropriate borrowing facilities, to be used 
for short term working capital or bridging finance, currently £175m 
(2014 – £175m).
The group’s total capital at 31 March 2015 was £1,626.9m 
(2014 – £1,445.6m) and comprised equity share capital and reserves. 
The group was 0.6% geared at the year end (2014 – 2.8%) and had 
a further £166m of committed bank facilities.
The board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the group’s 
and company’s capital on an ongoing basis. This review includes:
	 the planned level of gearing, which takes into account planned 
investment activity
	 the possible buy-back of equity shares for cancellation, which takes 
account of the discount of the share price to net asset value per share
	 the annual dividend policy.
The group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are 
unchanged from the preceding year.
The parent company is subject to the following externally imposed 
capital requirements:
	 as a public limited company, the company is required to have 
a minimum issued share capital of £50,000
	 to maintain its approval as an investment trust company, the 
company is required to comply with the provisions of section 1158 
of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 as amended by the Investment Trust 
(Approved Company) (Tax) Regulations 2011.
The parent company has complied with these requirements, which 
are unchanged since the previous year end.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments held at fair value according 
to the subjectivity of the valuation method, using the following hierarchy:
Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 
that are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3  Inputs for the asset that are not based on observable 
market data.

In the year, group and company investments with a value of £0.9m and 
£2.9m were transferred from Level 1 to Level 3 and Level 2 to Level 3 
respectively, as a result of there no longer being any observable market 
data. In addition, the group transferred £5.5m from Level 2 to Level 3 
in respect of property investments.

The directors have used several valuation methodologies as prescribed 
in the valuation guidelines to arrive at their best estimate of fair value, 
including discounted cash flow calculations, revenue and earnings 
multiples and recent market transactions where available.
Significant unobservable inputs used at 31 March 2015 in measuring 
Level 3 financial instruments were developed as follows:
	 EBITDA multiples represent amounts that market participants would 
use when pricing investments. EBITDA multiples are selected from 
comparable public companies based on geographic location, industry, 
size, target markets and other factors that management consider 
reasonable. The traded multiples for comparable companies are 
determined by dividing the enterprise value of the company by its 
EBITDA. EBITDA multiples ranged from 5 to 12, weighted average 8.3.
	 Discounted cash flows use a medium term time horizon of five years 
and a cost of capital of 10%.
	 Marketability discounts represent the adjustment to comparable 
market multiples to reflect the illiquidity of the portfolio companies 
relative to the comparable peer group. Management determines the 
discount for lack of marketability based on its judgement, after 
considering market liquidity conditions and company specific factors 
such as the development stage of the portfolio company. Marketability 
discount rates ranges from 10% to 30%, weighted average 20%. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Private equity fund investments, included in Level 3, are valued in 
accordance with the valuation guidelines and are based on information 
provided by the general partner. The general partners’ policy in valuing 
unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value. Similarly, externally 
managed unquoted investment valuations are based on information 
provided by the managers.
23. Share-based payments
The company has an executive share option scheme, which entitles senior 
employees to purchase shares in the company at the market price of the 
shares at the date of grant and on similar terms, subject to service and 
company performance criteria. Under the terms of the scheme, options 
may be exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant, 
although only one-third of the options may be exercised after three years 
from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable six years 
after grant. A number of grants have been made under this scheme.
At the 2011 annual general meeting, shareholders approved a new 
performance share scheme to replace the existing share option scheme 
as the means of delivering long term incentive awards to senior 
executives. The performance share scheme entitles senior executives 
to receive options over the company’s shares which are exercisable at 
nil-cost, subject to service and performance conditions. Nil-cost option 
awards granted in 2012 may be exercised between three and ten years 
after the date of grant, although only two-thirds of the awards may be 
exercised after three years, with the remaining one-third becoming 
exercisable five years after grant. For nil-cost option awards granted 
in 2013 and 2014, half of the shares comprised in the awards may be 
exercised after three years, and half after five years.
The company also has a deferred bonus plan, under which senior 
employees compulsorily defer part of their annual bonus, being any 
bonus in excess of 50% of their basic salary for the bonus year, into shares 
and may voluntarily defer up to 50% of their remaining cash bonus into 
shares. The company will match the number of shares comprised in both 
compulsory and voluntary deferral, subject to service and company 
performance criteria.
The terms and conditions of the grants outstanding as at 31 March 2015 
were as follows, whereby all grants are settled by physical delivery of

the award and five years for the other half of the award. Investment 
executives’ awards are measured as to 80% by reference to pool total 
returns and 20% by reference to NAV total return, other than 
Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s awards, which are 60% and 40% respectively.

The options outstanding at 31 March 2015 have an exercise price in 
the range of 1446p to 1878p and a weighted average contractual life 
of ten years.
The fair value of services received in return for performance share 
scheme and deferred awards granted was measured indirectly, by 
reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Under the schemes, share options were granted with service and 
non-market performance conditions. Such conditions were not taken 
into account in the fair value measurement of the services received at 
the dates of grant. There were no market conditions associated with 
the share option grants.
The fair value of services received in return for deferred share awards 
was measured directly, by reference to the fair value of services received 
during the period. This was based on the amount of annual bonus that 
was compulsorily and voluntarily deferred in accordance with the rules 
of the company’s deferred bonus plan.

Discount rate at year end 3.1 4.2 
Future salary increases 4.1 5.0

Mortality rates are assumed to follow the Self-Administered Pension 
Schemes ‘Series 1’ Light tables applicable to each member’s year of 
birth, projected to calendar year 2012 in line with the core CMI scale of 
improvements. Allowance has also been made for further improvements 
in line with CMI core projections with a long term trend of 1.5% pa. Life 
expectancy on retirement in normal health is assumed to be 27.7 years 
(2014 – 27 .6 years) for males and 29.0 years (2014 – 28.8 years) for 
females who are currently 62 years of age.
Expected contributions to group post-employment benefit plans for the 
year ending 31 March 2016 were £0.2m (2015 – £0.7m).
In the UK, the funding is set on the basis of a triennial funding valuation 
by the actuaries for which the assumptions may differ from those above. 
As a result of these valuations, the group and the scheme trustees agree 
a Schedule of Contributions, which sets out the required contributions 
from the employer and employees for current service. Where the 
scheme is in deficit, the Schedule of Contributions also includes required 
contributions from the employer to eliminate the deficit. The most recent 
triennial valuations were completed in 2012. A summary of the recent 
funding obligations and weighted average duration of the defined benefit 
obligation was as follows:

Sensitivities
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the 
assumptions set out above. The following table summarises the estimated 
increase in defined benefit obligations to a change in individual actuarial 
assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant. This sensitivity 
analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined 
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in an assumption would 
occur in isolation, as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Increase in life expectancy of one year 1.5 1.5 
Risks
The schemes typically expose the group to risks such as:
	 Investment risk – the schemes hold their investments in equities and 
bonds, the value of which fluctuates, whether caused by factors specific 
to an individual investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments 
traded in the market.
	 Interest rate risk – the schemes’ liabilities are assessed using market 
rates of interest, based on corporate bond yields, to discount the 
liabilities and are therefore subject to any volatility in the movement 
of the market rate of interest. The net interest income or expense 
recognised in profit or loss is calculated using the market rate of 
interest.
	 Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the benefits under the 
schemes are linked to inflation. Although the schemes’ assets are 
expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, 
movements over the short term would increase the schemes’ 
net deficit.
	 Mortality risk – in the event that members live longer than assumed, 
the liabilities may turn out to have been understated originally and 
a deficit may emerge if funding has not been adequately provided for 
the increased life expectancy. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information

Information for investors
Dividends, change of address and 
other shareholder services
Shareholders who wish to have dividends paid directly into a 
UK bank account, rather than by cheque to their registered address, 
can complete a mandate form for this purpose. Mandates may be 
obtained from Capita Asset Services. Where dividends are paid 
directly into shareholders’ bank accounts, dividend tax vouchers 
are sent directly to shareholders’ registered addresses.
Capita Asset Services also offer an international payment service 
whereby overseas shareholders may convert their dividend 
payments into a chosen currency and receive payment either in 
the form of a currency draft or by a direct payment into an overseas 
bank account. Details of the currencies available under the service 
and how to apply, including the terms and conditions, are available 
online at international.capitaregistrars.com or an application pack 
can be requested by telephone on +44 20 8639 3405 (from outside 
the UK) or 0871 664 0385 (from within the UK, calls cost 10p per 
minute including VAT plus network extras) between 9.00am and 
5.30pm, UK time.
Communications with shareholders are mailed to the address held 
on the share register. In the event of a change of address or other 
amendment, shareholders should notify Capita Asset Services, 
under the signature of the registered holder, or where there is more 
than one registered holder, under the signature of the first named 
holder.
Post and telephone contact details for Capita Asset Services are 
shown on the opposite page. Capita Asset Services also provide 
an online facility to enable shareholders to manage securely their 
shareholdings via the internet. By registering to use the facility, 
shareholders can access a range of online services, including 
viewing shareholding details, transaction and dividend histories, 
change of address and bank mandate and use of the online proxy 
voting service. 
The online facility is available at www.capitashareportal.com.
Capita Asset Services also offer a share dealing service and dividend 
reinvestment plan for existing shareholders. The share dealing 
service is available online at www.capitadeal.com or by telephone 
on 0871 664 0384 (calls cost 10p per minute including VAT plus 
network extras, with lines open Monday to Friday 8.00am to 
4.30pm).
The dividend reinvestment plan provides a convenient way for 
shareholders to build up their shareholdings by using cash dividends 
to buy more shares in the company. You can elect for the dividend 
reinvestment plan online at www.capitashareportal.com, where 
you can view the terms of service, or you can request an application 
form by telephone on 0871 664 0381 (calls cost 10p per minute 
including VAT, plus network extras) or +44 20 8639 3402 if calling 
from overseas. In each case, lines are open from Monday to Friday 
9.00am to 5.30pm. Alternatively, an application form can be 
requested by email from shares@capita.com.

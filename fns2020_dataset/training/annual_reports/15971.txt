in a quest to survive the ongoing global economic crisis and 
remain in business, the first challenge within many companies’ 
business strategies is to become more productive, whilst 
reducing operating costs. 
as well as purchasing the latest fuel efficient vehicles, the 
adoption of new generation fleet telematics solutions is a sure 
and fast way of enhancing vehicle management practices. 
these telematics solutions can be as simple or as complex as 
a business requires, and fleets from as small as three vehicles 
through to fleets covering hundreds of vehicles can benefit.  
t rafficmaster and t eletrac’s fleet director is one of the leading 
fleet management systems in both the uK and north america. 
its combination of easy to use and intuitive tools can help a 
business manage its fleets more cost effectively and profitably. 
fleet director combines real time vehicle tracking, smartnav 
satellite navigation, up to the minute traffic data, two-way 
communication, safety camera warnings, exception alerts 
which tell a fleet manager if a vehicle is entering a no-go 
area or being driven out of hours and finally provides in-depth 
reporting and analysis. 
the benefits of using fleet director’s applications are 
significant both financially and environmentally. according to 
customer research, t rafficmaster and t eletrac have helped 
businesses increase productivity by 12% and have proven to 
reduce overtime by 15% and unauthorised vehicle use by 12%. 
these benefits have been particularly acknowledged in the 
us. t eletrac welcomed its 6,000th fleet customer in 2009, 
which means that more than 98,000 vehicles now benefit from 
t eletrac solutions. t eletrac continues to focus on all fleet 
sizes, from the smallest-like f riesenhahn plumbing, a well-
established business of more than 30 years in san antonio, 
t exas, that currently has four vehicles, three equipped with 
fleet director, to the largest-such as l ewis t ree service, one of 
america’s largest vegetation management organisations, that 
manages over 2,000 vehicles. 
the company also continues to develop its partnership with 
ryder t ruck. ryder adopted t eletrac as the technology 
underlying ryder rydesmart
®
 solutions. f or customers with 
split fleets—part owned, part leased from ryder—this means 
they benefit from seamless management technologies and 
consistent procedures across the entire fleet.
in the uK t rafficmaster’s partnership with automotive 
manufacturer citroën also remains strong. this has been 
underpinned by its own study that has independently measured 
an overall operating cost saving of £2,000 per vehicle per year 
with the support of the standard fit of smartnav, stolen vehicle 
tracking and speed camera alerts. 
charles p eugeot, head of commercial vehicles and business 
sector sales, explains, “citroën remains committed to  
providing its customers with the technology to optimise vehicle 
efficiency and safety.  this will empower even more operators 
with the means to cut costs, minimise emissions and reduce 
driver stress.” 
these savings not only contribute to a company’s bottom 
line but also reduce the impact business driving has on the 
environment. 
t rafficmaster and t eletrac have measured astonishing fuel 
savings driven through the use of its fleet management solution 
across its customer base. overall its fleet customers have 
reduced their fuel consumption by 13 per cent on average. this 
equates to an annual total of 280,000 tonnes of co 2 .
principally our technology is able to help businesses cut down 
on journey times, reduce the length of a journey, eliminate 
wasted and unauthorised journeys and enable both fleet 
operator and driver to become more proactive. this is possible 
through the company’s ability to provide unrivalled and accurate 
information, such as our traffic data and mapping, process 
data quickly, present concise and valuable reporting tools and 
finally provide clear communications between office, driver and 
ultimately the end customer .
a survey of our customers
revealed that implementing
our intelligent driving and
fleet management solutions
helped reduce fuel cost by
30% across fleets of all sizes.

the board is pleased to report strong results for 2009.  
revenue in 2009 grew by 4% to £57.5m and profit before tax 
grew by 14% to £5.1m for the group as a whole. our Business 
services division performed very strongly, with revenue 
growth of 23% and operating profit growth of 138%, as our 
fleet director product continues to deliver excellent service 
to a growing customer base. revenue in our consumer 
services division declined by 22% and operating profit 
declined by 79% as we moved away from project-based, 
non-recurring revenues to focus on building a business 
based on recurring subscription revenue. overall the group 
is now in a significantly stronger position, with the underlying 
subscription-based nature of our services driving revenue and 
profit growth. 
we have had a number of notable sales successes in 2009, 
with a particularly strong performance from our national 
accounts team. w e are providing services to an increasing 
number of large customer fleets as well as maintaining our 
traditional strength amongst smaller fleet operators as the 
operating cost benefits of our technology become increasingly 
recognised. 
since the year-end we have been able to take steps towards 
expanding our business through an acquisition. in January 
we completed the refinancing of the group, by successfully 
raising an additional £4.2m of equity (before expenses) and 
refinancing our long-term bank facilities. this allowed us to 
complete the acquisition of fleet management s olutions, inc., 
which expands the range of services we can offer customers 
and will allow us to take advantage of exciting opportunities 
globally. the refinancing also provides certainty of funding to 
underpin the group’s activities over the next few years.  
2009 was a very difficult year in which to make progress and 
the board recognises the tremendous drive and determination 
of our people. along with many other businesses we have 
had to make hard decisions to reduce costs, which has put 
additional pressures on our people and we thank those who 
are no longer with us for their contribution. 
there have been two board changes since the last annual 
report. our previous chairman, colin w alsh, stepped down 
at the last annual General meeting and the board takes 
this opportunity to again express our thanks to colin for his 
enthusiasm, inspiration and commitment to t rafficmaster 
over the previous seventeen years. in may 2009 we were 
delighted to welcome phil cartmell as a non-executive 
director . phil’s extensive experience in running a wide range 
of businesses over many years is already proving invaluable to 
the board.
in summary the board is very pleased with the progress the 
company has made. the uncertain market conditions in 2009 
have been well documented and the board believes that 
t rafficmaster has performed well against its competitors 
throughout the period and is well positioned to continue its 
development.

“The Board is pleased to report another year of strong

group has made great progress in positioning itself 
well to benefit from future opportunities” .  www.trafficmaster.co.uk  TrafficmasTer Plc   09

Case study
Robert	Heath	Heating is one of the uK’s leading heating and 
maintenance contractors, working across the south of england 
for local authorities, housing associations and social landlords.  
the company’s 110-strong team of engineers carry out repairs 
and servicing in circa 60,000 properties.
it decided to install fleet director after investigating a number  
of fleet management solutions:
stuart cocks, financial director at robert heath, said:
“once we saw what fleet director could deliver for us, at an 
extremely competitive price, it was the obvious choice.  
fleet director is also very easy to use — and our drivers have 
found the smartnav routing very user-friendly as well.  i believe 
fleet director has also played an important part in helping us 
not only maintain current customers but secure new business 
contracts as well.”
the company has since reduced private mileage costs by 25%. 10  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

t rafficmaster continued to make good progress in 2009. 
profitability grew strongly in our Business s ervices division, 
which now represents 70% of group revenues and 87% of 
operating profit before corporate costs and non-recurring 
items. our consumer s ervices division also had a good 
year, with our recurring stolen v ehicle t racking and t raffic 
businesses growing operating profit in aggregate, albeit 
offset by a decline in our project-based emerging products 
business. overall revenues and operating profits from our 
vehicle tracking subscription-based activities grew by 17% 
and 190% respectively to £50.2m and £7.8m.
Business services
through our fleet director product, our Business s ervices 
division offers customers in the us and the uK the ability to 
make significant operating efficiencies to their businesses 
through a range of fleet tracking services. divisional revenues 
continued to grow, to £40.0m, up 23% on 2008. profitability 
improved significantly, with divisional operating profit of 
£7.3m being 138% ahead of 2008. operating margins grew 
to 18% (2008: 9%) as the benefits of scale continue to be 
delivered, along with a shift in revenue mix towards higher 
margin subscriptions. our performance in 2009 demonstrates 
the benefits of having a subscription-based recurring 
revenue model at the core of our business. overall fleet 
subscribers have grown from 47,000 in 2005 to over 98,000 
in 2009, representing compound growth of 20% per year . 
customer churn in 2009 was 12%, which was in line with 
our average over the past five years. on a constant currency 
basis Business services revenue grew by 8% in the year and 
operating profit by 95%. 
 in the us, t eletrac continued to progress well. we expanded 
the major accounts sales team we established in 2008, 
and sales volumes derived through this team trebled in 
2009. notable successes in the past year include winning 
contracts with united site s ervices, united road t owing and 
mp nexlevel. w e have a growing pipeline of opportunities to 
provide service to customers with larger and more complex 
fleet requirements, which supplements our traditional 
strength in the smaller business market. as well as expanding 
our resource in major accounts we have continued to expand 
our smaller business sales teams, and since the year end 
have begun to establish a network of third party resellers to 
supplement our direct sales activities.
during 2009 we completed the transition of our customer base 
from legacy rf networks onto our current state of the art 
technology. t his process has been undertaken over a period of 
several years, and we are pleased that most of our customers 
have taken advantage of this transition to upgrade their service. 
t he completion of this transition process has resulted in surplus 
legacy inventory which we have provided against in 2009.
over the past year we have strengthened our partnership with 
ryder and sales of rydesmart, powered by t eletrac, have 
grown as the benefits of managing fleets efficiently 
have become even more pressing. ryder have committed to 
rolling out rydesmart across their entire rental fleet over the 
coming year .
in the uK sales of fleet director have continued to grow and 
we have won contracts with south t yneside council, liebherr, 
and Giffen Group over the past year . we have expanded our 
sales team and continued to develop our partnership with 
citroën under which we provide navigation and stolen vehicle 
tracking services as standard on relay, Berlingo and dispatch 
vans, and can support the vehicle owner by providing a range 
of additional services with fleet director . in early 2010 citroën 
announced that they would be extending our contract to 
include the base models of their entire van range.
fleet director continues to lead the industry, and during 2009 
won the fleet v an t echnology initiative of the year award and 
mobile electronics news’ Best fleet t racking product award, 
to add to a host of awards received over the past few years. 
as our business expands we are able to invest further in our 
product capability which will allow us to further improve our 
customer proposition compared to our competitors.
since the year-end we have announced the acquisition of f leet 
management solutions, inc (“fms ”). fms is a fast growing 
provider of satellite-based fleet tracking services enabling 
customers to manage their mobile assets anywhere in the world. 
“Business services has continued its strong 
progress in a tough environment. in the us, T eletrac 
continued to expand and we now have over 100,000 
vehicles using our services. our national accounts 
team had another successful year with some 
significant customer wins and sales volumes treble

Awards
fleet director collected the prestigious fleet v an t echnology 
initiative of the year award 2009
the a ward specifically recognised the latest range of software 
enhancements to the system – particularly the ability to 
identify the actual closest vehicle based on live traffic 
information, which is unique in the industry. t ogether with the 
other new features of live traffic information now overlaid on 
virtual mapping; the instant dashboard reports and two-way 
messaging, fleet director really impressed the judges with its 
ability to support both fleet managers and drivers.
Fleet Van Magazine
t rafficmaster’s move to put smartnav navigation and its unique 
personal assistant service onto Gps mobile phones and 
BlackBerry was hailed by Businesscar as taking the hand-held 
sat nav market “to a new level” and consequently awarded it 
the 2009 Businesscar t echnology award.
Business Car Magazine
t rafficmaster also received the Best fleet management 
product with fleet director and  Best t racking product  
for t rackstar at the men a wards.  the awards not only 
acknowledged the excellence of the product but also the 
highest quality service delivered by t rafficmaster to their

“overall T rafficmaster performed well in 2009.  
We have made some significant steps over the past 
twelve months, and the business is in a strong 
position to take advantage of the many 
opportunities for growth that we expect in 2010. ” 
the acquisition complements our fleet director service, 
which requires assets to be located in areas of mobile phone 
coverage. fms has established a strong presence in two 
key markets, the oil & gas market, and government, who 
require global, secure asset management systems. the us 
department of homeland s ecurity is currently deploying the 
fms service across 4,500 of its vehicles and the sales pipeline 
is growing.
Consumer services
our consumer s ervice division offers a range of t raffic 
and stolen v ehicle t racking services to consumers, and is 
also where we manage our emerging products activities. 
consumer s ervices revenues in 2009 declined 22% to £17.4m 
(2008: £22.4m), and operating profits declined by 78% to 
£1.1m (2008: £5.0m). almost all of the decline is driven by our 
non-recurring, project-based activities in emerging products. 
the ongoing, recurring consumer-led activities represented 
around 90% of consumer s ervices revenues in 2009.
stolen v ehicle t racking revenues declined 2% to £10.2m 
(2008: £10.4m) and the business reported an improved 
operating profit of £0.5m (2008: loss of £0.4m). our strong 
market position helped protect us somewhat, although the 
severe depression in prestige car sales has had an inevitable 
impact on the business. we have key relationships with Bmw, 
Jaguar, land-rover and aston martin amongst others, which 
help to protect our market share. we have continued to 
develop these relationships, and have been able to increase 
our penetration of vehicles requiring tracking.
our t raffic business provides users with access to market-
leading live traffic information through a range of different 
services. in line with overall consumer sentiment revenue 
declined 15% in 2009 to £5.4m (2008: £6.3m). with a largely 
fixed cost base, operating profit declined to a loss of £0.3m 
(2008: profit £0.4m), although the business generated positive 
contribution before depreciation of £1.0m (2008 £1.9m). 
during the year we signed a contract with navteq which 
enables navteq to use our market-leading live traffic data in 
a broad range of applications globally and as a core part of 
their pan-european traffic service offerings. w e also signed a 
two year extension to our contract with the uK Government’s 
department for t ransport (“dft”) for the supply of traffic data. 
this contract now runs until 2014. 
our emerging products developments continue to focus on 
paid-for development work in nascent markets for which a 
robust revenue model has yet to be fully established. all of the 
activities we undertake in this area are financed by external 
customers. this allows us to leverage existing investments, 
and work with customers and partners in establishing long-
term commercial opportunities. in 2009 we completed the first 
phase of the uK department for t ransport’s multi-year trial, 
evaluating the technological elements of road pricing, and 
have been awarded the contract for the second phase, which 
will complete in 2010. there is a significant international 
opportunity to develop and deploy road-pricing technologies 
in jurisdictions around the world and we are actively pursuing 
these opportunities in conjunction with partners.
Outlook
Business services has grown well driven by a growing 
subscriber base. owners of vehicle fleets are relying on 
technology to manage their mobile assets more effectively 
in the difficult financial climate. fleet director’s advanced 
capabilities allow our customers to realise operating 
efficiencies immediately and market penetration of fleet 
management solutions is rising.
our acquisition of fms after the year-end expands our range 
of fleet management capabilities, and allows us to address 
new markets. it also demonstrates our ability to identify and 
execute acquisitions which allow us to build scale, and expand 
the range of services available to our customers.
consumer s ervices has diverse revenue streams but 
continues to depend on overall levels of consumer spending 
in the economy. we are managing operating costs very tightly 
and are developing opportunities to grow our market share.
2009 was successful in a tough environment and looking 
ahead it appears that 2010 will again be challenging. however 
we believe that we are in strong position, and are approaching 
the future with confidence.

Case study
Lyndhurst,	Department	of	Public	Works in the state of new 
Jersey, achieved astonishing results within a month.
having fitted t eletrac’s fleet director, it drastically reduced 
idling and cruising time as well as completely stamping out any 
unauthorised vehicle movement out of town or out of hours.
Between the months of december 2009 and January 2010 the 
organisation saved 265 gallons of diesel.
Case study
Pro-Tect	Systems	Ltd, the uK’s sole distributor of t aser 
products, which are electronic control devices used by police 
forces and the military runs a fleet of only six vehicles, however 
it uses an advanced fleet management system to manage its 
drivers better . Glenn cameron, it director and office manager, 
explains his use of fleet telematics:
“we had a driver in scotland when a customer based in cumbria 
called in with an emergency technical fault. as the driver was 
travelling back down we notified him of the job details and 
immediately sent directions via smartnav. not only were we able 
to satisfy the customer’s demand, but we saved ourselves from 
sending out another driver on another day.” 14  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

financial revieW 
revenue and profit
r evenue for the year to 31 december 2009 was £57.5m, which 
was 4% ahead of 2008 (2008: £55.1m) and operating profit before 
non-recurring items was £6.3m, up 9% on 2008 (2008: £5.8m). 
t his performance was driven by a strong year for Business 
services, which grew revenue by 23% to £40.0m (2008: £32.6m) 
and operating profit by 138% to £7.3m (2008: £3.1m). eBitda * 
margins continued to grow, and in 2009 the Business services 
division grew eBitda * margins to 25% (2008: 15%). t his growth 
was delivered from a combination of the increasing proportion 
of revenue derived from recurring subscriptions, operational 
leverage in the business, and tight cost control. 
the consumer s ervices division saw revenue decline by 22% 
to £17.4m (2008: £22.4m), and operating profit decline by 
78% to £1.1m (2008: £5.0m). most of this decline was in the 
emerging products activities, which now make up around 3% 
of group revenue (2008: 10%). excluding these project-driven 
activities, revenue from our recurring consumer s ervices 
businesses was down 7% to £15.6m (2008: £16.7m), and 
eBitda * grew 13% to £3.2m (2008: £2.8m) as we continue 
to manage costs tightly and our revenue mix benefits from a 
higher proportion from subscriptions.
revenue recognition
during 2009 the group revised the methodology it uses to 
recognise revenue. t he revised approach, based on fair values 
of the individual components, recognises less revenue on 
initial unit sales and a greater proportion of contract revenue 
over the contract duration in line with the fair value of services 
delivered. previously the group used cost to determine 
the value of revenue components. t his has necessitated a 
restatement of the prior year’s accounts which was announced 
with our half year results in august 2009. management believes 
that the new methodology better reflects the underlying 
recurring nature of the group’s business, and provides more 
relevant information about future revenue streams. 
non-recurring items
we have recognised a non-recurring item of £1.0m (2008: 
£0.5m) which relates to the exit from our legacy rf networks 
in the us. w e have been migrating customers from this 
technology steadily over the past few years and finally 
closed the last remaining metropolitan network in 2009. the 
non-recurring charge relates to a provision against residual 
amounts of inventory which are not suitable for use by our 
customers in future.
interest
the net interest charge before the effect of foreign exchange 
remained broadly flat year on year at £0.9m (2008: £0.9m), 
as a portion of the group’s debt is hedged at fixed rates. in 
addition we recognised a foreign exchange gain of £0.7m 
(2008: nil) which arose on the retranslation of our us$ 
denominated bank debt into sterling at the year-end.
T ax
the group recorded a tax charge of £0.2m in the year (2008: 
£0.2m credit). the tax charge relates to various state-
level taxes payable in the us. the group still has access to 
significant levels of unutilised trading losses. 
Dividend
in line with previous years, the company is not proposing the 
payment of a dividend. the board reviews its dividend policy 
periodically, and is committed to the payment of a dividend at 
an appropriate time.
earnings per share
Basic earnings per share grew 6% to 3.62p in 2009 (2008: 
3.41p). in line with practice at many other companies, the group 
has prepared an adjusted earnings per share measure which 
is intended to increase the understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business. t his measure removes the effect 
of non-recurring items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
share-based payments and deferred tax movements. using 
this measure, basic underlying earnings per share grew 16% 
to 4.81p (2008: 4.14p). detailed calculations supporting this 
measure are shown in note 10 of the financial statements.
diluted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share 
were not materially different as the potential dilutive effect 
of share options in issue was minimal due to the share price 
compared to historic levels of award. www.trafficmaster.co.uk  TrafficmasTer Plc   15

Cash-flow and capital expenditure
n et cash-flow from operating activities was £0.4m (2008: £4.6m). 
t he reduction in operating cash-flow was caused primarily by 
the reduced level of external customer lease funding undertaken 
by our leasing partners, which resulted in a higher proportion 
of internally financed receivables than has historically been the 
norm. t his will result in increased cash inflow in future as the 
long term receivable is collected. c ash out-flow from investing 
activities reduced to £3.4m (2008: £5.0m) as we continue to 
manage investments in product development very tightly. c ash 
spent on capital expenditure fell as a proportion of depreciation 
and amortisation to 74% in 2009 (2008: 108%). 
Balance sheet
net assets at 31 december 2009 increased by 12% to £32.2m 
(2008: £28.7m). this increase of £3.6m was created primarily 
by the profit generated in the year of £4.9m, offset by £1.2m of 
adverse foreign exchange movements arising on the group’s 
$us denominated assets. inventory levels continued to be 
actively managed downwards, and ended the year at £6.6m 
(2008: £11.9m).
subsequent to the year-end, the balance sheet has been 
further strengthened following the successful raising of 
additional new equity of £4.2m before expenses, which was 
completed in f ebruary 2010.
Bank facilities and covenants
in f ebruary 2010 the group completed a refinancing exercise 
to finance the acquisition of fms, to strengthen its balance 
sheet and to extend the life of its long-term debt financing. 
an additional 13.6m ordinary shares were placed with 
shareholders, raising £4.2m of additional equity before 
expenses. in addition, the group secured a new multi-currency 
bank facility with Barclays Bank. the bank facilities comprise 
term loans of £2.5m and $12.4m and a revolving credit facility 
of $12.4m. the facilities, which run until July 2013, include 
a range of covenants and include a schedule of quarterly 
repayments for the term loans. the facilities have security 
over various group assets including the freehold of its head 
office building at cranfield, Bedfordshire. during 2009 the 
group satisfied all of its covenants on its previous bank facility. 
as at 28 f ebruary 2010, the group’s net debt position was 
£14m, which allows £5m of available cash headroom.
T reasury
the group operates a centralised treasury function, whose 
primary aim is to manage cash-flow and currency risks. 
the group has transactional and translational exposure to 
overseas currencies, primarily the $us through its t eletrac 
operation. the group’s policy is not to hedge translation risk, 
but to hedge transactional cash-flow exposure if appropriate. 
we have established a natural hedge for transactional risk 
by denominating most of the net debt in $us. the group has 
access to a range of instruments to help it manage risk. 
the group is a party to an interest rate collar and a swap 
instrument which have the effect of capping the amount of 
interest payable on a portion of the net debt.
Acquisitions
in f ebruary 2010 the group acquired fleet management 
solutions, inc. (“fms”). $7.5m consideration was paid at 
completion, and the acquisition is subject to a performance-
related earn-out arrangement under which a maximum 
additional consideration of $6m is payable over the next 
two years. fms is performing to plan, and integration is 
proceeding as expected.
our previous acquisition, t ri-mex Group ltd (“eurowatch”), 
which was completed in July 2008 is fully integrated and 
performing in line with expectations.

DirecT ors anD ar Ticles of associa Tion
the constitution of the board and its committees and details of 
directors’ attendance at meetings, together with a statement 
on board evaluation, is set out in the corporate Governance 
statement on pages 25 to 29.
the articles of association require that each director retire by 
rotation if they have held office for more than 3 years.
the articles of association state that a director may be 
appointed by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders. the 
board has power to appoint directors during the course of a 
year and, if so, that appointee has to retire at the annual 
General meeting of the company following the appointment.
under the articles of association the directors are responsible 
for the management of the company and in doing so may 
exercise all the powers of the company subject to the 
provisions of relevant legislation. the powers of the directors 
extend to the issue and buy back of shares as set out in the 
articles of association.
marKeT value of BuilDinGs
the directors estimate the market value of the freehold 
building in the group supports the net carrying value as shown 
in the financial statements. details of property, plant and 
equipment are shown in note 11.
Treasur Y mana GemenT /Treasur Y Polic Y
the group’s policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial 
resources are available for the development of the group’s 
business whilst managing its currency, interest rate and credit 
risks. the group’s policy in respect of the major areas of 
treasury activity is set out below:
currency T ranslation exposure
the results of the group’s foreign subsidiaries are translated 
to sterling at the average exchange rates for the period 
concerned. the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated into sterling at the closing exchange rates. any 
gains and losses resulting from translation are recorded in 
the translation reserve. the group does not hedge translation 
exposure by forward exchange contracts or currency swaps, 
nor does it currently hedge translation exposures arising on 
unremitted non-uK earnings.
currency T ransaction exposure
this arises where actual sales and purchases are made by a 
business unit in a currency other than its own functional 
currency. the group does not currently hedge currency 
transaction exposure by forward exchange contracts and 
currency swaps.
interest rate risk
t he group’s policy is to borrow funds to finance working capital 
and acquisitions. such borrowings are in the form of bank 
overdrafts and bank loans. such borrowings have variable 
interest rates based upon bank base rates and risks are 
therefore subject to fluctuations in such rates. t he group uses 
interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposures.
credit risk
cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to 
credit risk, represented by the loss that would be recognised if 
a customer failed to perform as contracted. the credit rating 
and performance of customers are monitored on a regular 
basis in accordance with board-approved policies.
f urther information relating to the group’s financial risk 
management can be found in note 26 on pages 60 to 63.
PaYmenT of creDiT ors
the group does not follow any code or standard on payment 
practice. its policy in relation to all its suppliers is to settle the 
terms of payment at the outset of a transaction and to abide by 
these terms provided that it is satisfied that the supplier has 
provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed 
terms and conditions. the number of days’ billings from 
suppliers outstanding for the company at 31 december 2009 
was 49 (2008: 48).
GoinG concern
the directors have carried out an assessment of going 
concern, details of which are included in note 1.
corPora Te social resPonsiBiliTY
the group recognises its responsibilities to the communities 
in which we operate, our employees, the environment and 
other stakeholders in society. the board continues to identify 
climate change, health and safety and business ethics as main 
risks in the context of corporate s ocial responsibility and 
believes that these issues are integral and important 
components of best practice in business management. the 
board is committed to managing these risks, as well as others 
that it has identified, on an ongoing basis and to developing 
policies to promote best working practices in these areas.
as a leading technology company, people are at the centre of 
our business. their intellectual capital, commitment and 
enthusiasm drive the enterprise and our success depends on 
attracting, engaging and developing the very best. our 
employees are provided with ongoing learning and 
development opportunities and personal development 
programmes that are aligned to the group’s strategic 
objectives. 20  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

our health and safety record continues to be good with no 
serious reported incidents during the year . all our staff have 
received health and safety training and we have an established 
structure in place for dealing with health and safety matters.
we are committed to continuing to provide a safe and secure 
working environment and equal opportunities for all our 
employees.
the board strongly believes in acting in an environmentally 
responsible manner, which is reflected in the way we operate 
and conduct our business. our business is built on the concept 
of ‘intelligent driving’; our products and services continue to 
foster efficient use of vehicles to avoid congestion, thereby 
eliminating wasted journeys and helping to reduce 
environmental impact. our products came runner up in the 
energy s aving t rust’s innovation 2007 awards and were 
acclaimed as a fleet hero which further endorsed their green 
credentials. in 2008, we received the prestigious Green fleet 
award for it and communication product of the y ear for fleet 
director .
we also believe that acting in an environmentally responsible 
manner should extend beyond the abilities of our products and 
services and should be reflected in the way we do business, to 
minimise our own carbon footprint while helping other 
companies to reduce theirs.
the board is committed to environmental management to 
reduce the group’s environmental impact. our environmental 
management system (ems) in the uK has been independently

the directors present their remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 december 2009.
remunera Tion commiTTee
the policy for directors’ remuneration is set by the board as a 
whole. the remuneration committee operates within this 
policy to advise on levels of remuneration.
the remuneration committee of the board is responsible for 
ensuring that the remuneration packages provided to 
executive directors are appropriate to individual levels of 
experience, responsibility and performance, are consistent 
with the company’s remuneration policy, and are in line with 
the principles of good corporate governance.
the remuneration committee is composed entirely of 
non-executive directors who have no financial interest in the 
group (other than as shareholders), no personal interest in the 
committee’s deliberations or decisions, and no involvement 
in the day-to-day management of the group’s operations. 
the members of the committee during the year were: 
ian coomber (chairman), colin w alsh , Geoffrey Bicknell, 
phil cartmell and alan mcw alter .
the committee usually meets at least twice a year . the chief 
executive is normally invited to attend its meetings in order to 
make recommendations concerning remuneration. the 
finance director and company s ecretary provide support to 
the committee and external advice is obtained when 
necessary. the chief executive is not present when his own 
remuneration is being discussed. during the year the 
committee received material assistance on remuneration 
decisions from the chief executive.
remunera Tion Polic Y
the group’s policy on directors’ remuneration is that its 
remuneration packages should be capable of attracting, 
rewarding and retaining both executive and non-executive 
directors who have the skills, experience and expertise that 
will enable the group to deliver superior levels of shareholder 
return.
account is taken of the salary and total remuneration levels 
prevailing in comparable jobs in similar size organisations, 
together with the individual performance and contribution of 
each of the executive directors.
the remuneration of executive directors consists of base 
salary, performance related bonus, benefits in kind (a car or 
car allowance, medical expenses insurance, life assurance 
and income protection insurance), share options and pension 
provision.
all executive directors participate in a bonus scheme that is 
related to consolidated group profitability. in addition, 
directors other than the chief executive have individual bonus 
schemes based on achieving goals specifically related to their 
areas of responsibility.
the remuneration details of each director are given on 
page 23.
service conTracTs
executive directors are all employed under agreements which 
set out their responsibilities and obligations to the group, and 
the terms of their employment include a twelve-month rolling 
notice period and meet the requirements of the combined 
code.
none of the service contracts contain any specific termination 
provisions.
the board notes and has reviewed the provision of the 
combined code concerning notice periods and the aBi/napf 
joint guidelines on service contracts. in agreeing these 
contracts, account has been taken of the board’s wish to retain 
people of high calibre.
unless the interests of the group require otherwise (which it is 
anticipated will only be in exceptional circumstances), it is the 
board’s intention that any future executive appointments to the 
board will be on the basis that notice periods will not exceed 
12 months or, if they do, this will only be for a short initial 
term.
in the event of early termination, the remuneration 
committee will take careful account of the prevailing 
circumstances in awarding compensation and will take 
appropriate professional advice to ensure that best practice is 
consistent with the parties’ contractual rights.
the committee would look favourably on a request by an 
executive director to take up a non-executive appointment at 
a non-competing company having regard to the time 
commitment that this would entail compared to the benefits 
that it could bring the group.
non-execuTive DirecT ors
the non-executive directors receive fees for their services. 
the executive directors determine the remuneration of the 
non-executive directors.
the non-executive directors have letters of appointment, with 
rolling notice periods of between one and three months. they 
are not eligible for pension scheme membership or for 
contributions to their own individual pension schemes, receive 
no benefits in kind, and do not participate in any profit sharing, 
share option or other incentive scheme. 22  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

in accordance with the articles of association, t ony eales,

Pensions
the company pays up to 10% of basic salary into personal 
pension funds set up by each of the executive directors.

TransacTions WiTh GrouP comP anies
no director has any material interest in any contracts with any 
group companies other than a service contract.
share oPTions
the company has operated the following share option plans 
for several years:
● ● 1996 hm revenue and customs approved and unapproved 
plans. awards under both of these plans are made at 
ruling market prices at the date of grant. awards can only 
be exercised if either the growth in earnings in each of 
three consecutive financial years exceeds the rate of 
increase in the uK retail prices index by at least 1%, or, in 
the case of the unapproved scheme only, the average of 
the growth in earnings in the second and third financial 
years exceeds the earnings in the first year by a 
percentage which is no less than the rate of increase in 
the uK retail price index plus 10%. this latter test has 
been introduced by the remuneration committee to 
operate alongside the original test to take account of the 
fact that, although the group may have achieved 
sustained average underlying growth, this might not 
necessarily have satisfied the year on year growth 
required by the original test. the remuneration 
committee is of the opinion that the adjustment produces 
a fairer result.
● ● the 2006 non-hm revenue and customs approved share 
option scheme were introduced in June 2006. awards 
made under this scheme was made at ruling market 
prices at the grant date and can be exercised if the growth 
in earnings p er share (eps) over the three year period 
ending 31 december 2008 is greater than 15%, and the 
growth in share price is at least 30%. these awards vest 
on a straight-line basis for share price growth between 
30% and 100%.
● ● in 2007, two share options arrangements were setup for 
the group’s employees in the uK and the us. a wards 
under both of these schemes are made at ruling market 
prices at the date of grant discounted by up to 20% and 
15% respectively. the scheme available to the uK 
employees of the group is approved by hm revenue and 
customs and is a s ave as you earn scheme. the us plan 
is an employee stock purchase plan.
all schemes are operated under the auspices of the 
remuneration committee and a total of 5,576,207 (2008: 
9,908,431) options have been awarded to a total of 52 staff and 
four directors. share option movements during the year are 
shown in note 23 on page 58.

throughout the year to 31 december 2009, the group complied 
with the provisions of the revised combined code on 
corporate Governance issued by the financial reporting 
council in June 2008 except as detailed below. the group has 
a policy of seeking to comply with established best practice in 
the field of corporate governance. the board has adopted core 
values and standards which set out the behaviour expected of 
staff in their dealings with shareholders, customers, 
colleagues, suppliers and other stakeholders of the group. 
one of the core values is the acceptance of the highest 
standard of integrity in the group’s business activities.
BoarD sTrucTure
currently, the board comprises the chairman, three other 
non-executive directors and four executive directors. the 
names of the directors together with their biographical details 
are set out on pages 16 and 17.
as announced previously, colin w alsh, long standing non-
executive director and chairman of t rafficmaster plc, retired 
from the board at the annual General meeting held in may 
2009. at the same meeting, alan mcw alter was appointed as 
chairman of t rafficmaster plc and phil cartmell as non-
executive director . the directors believe that the current 
structure of the board provides an excellent balance of 
relevant corporate and commercial experience together with 
effective non-executive director independence.
non-comPliance
the directors have strengthened significantly the board’s 
compliance with the changes introduced in the past few years. 
notwithstanding those changes, the combined code also 
requires the board to report the following areas of non-
compliance during 2009:
● ● the executive directors, not the chairman, take primary 
responsibility for meeting the major shareholders 
regularly to develop an understanding of their views 
which are communicated to the chairman, s enior 
independent non-executive director and the rest of the 
board.
The BoarD
the group is controlled through its board of directors. the 
board’s main roles are to create value for shareholders, to 
provide entrepreneurial leadership of the group, to approve 
the group’s strategic objectives and to ensure that the 
necessary financial and other resources are made available to 
enable them to meet those objectives. the board, which meets 
at least ten times a year, considers matters set out in an 
agenda circulated before each meeting. decisions of a 
strategic nature are approved by the board.
the specific responsibilities reserved to the board include: 
setting group strategy and approving an annual budget and 
medium-term projections; reviewing operational and financial 
performance; approving major acquisitions, divestments and 
capital expenditure; reviewing the group’s systems of financial 
control and risk management; ensuring that appropriate 
management development and succession plans are in place, 
reviewing the environmental, health and safety performance 
of the group; approving appointments to the board and the 
company s ecretary and ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue 
takes place with shareholders.
the board has delegated the following responsibilities to the 
executive management committee: the development and 
recommendation of strategic plans for consideration by the 
board that reflect the longer-term objectives and priorities 
established by the board; implementation of the strategies 
and policies of the group as determined by the board; 
monitoring of the operating and financial results against plans 
and budgets; monitoring the quality of the investment process 
against objectives; prioritising the allocation of capital, 
technical and human resources; monitoring the composition 
and terms of reference of divisional management committees; 
and developing and implementing risk management systems.
The roles of The chairman anD chief execuTive
the division of responsibilities between the chairman of the 
board, alan mcw alter, and the chief executive, t ony eales, is 
clearly defined and has been approved by the board.
the chairman is responsible for organising the business of 
the board and ensuring its effectiveness. the chairman has 
no involvement in the day-to-day business of the group. 
the chairman facilitates the effective contribution of non-
executive directors and constructive relations between 
executive and non-executive directors, and ensures that 
directors receive accurate, timely and clear information and 
ensures effective communication with shareholders.
the chief executive determines the group’s strategy, has 
direct charge of the group on a day-to-day basis and is 
accountable to the board for the financial and operational 
performance of the group.
senior inDePenDenT DirecT or

they are of sufficient calibre and number that their views 
carry significant weight in the board’s decision making.
the directors are given access to independent professional 
advice at the group’s expense, when the directors deem it is 
necessary in order for them to carry out their responsibilities.
details of the chairman’s professional commitments are 
included in the chairman’s biography.
none of the non-executive directors at the year end:
● ● has been employed by the group within the last five years;
● ● has, or had within the last three years, a material 
business relationship with the group;
● ● receives remuneration other than a director’s fee;
● ● has close family ties with any of the group’s advisers, 
directors or senior employees;
● ● holds cross-directorships or has links with other 
directors through involvement in other companies or 
bodies.
Professional DeveloPmenT
on appointment, the directors take part in an induction 
programme where they receive information about the group, 
the role of the board and the matters reserved for its decision, 
the terms of reference and membership of the principal board 
and management committees, and the powers delegated to 
those committees, the group’s corporate governance practices 
and procedures, including the powers reserved to the group’s 
most senior executives, and the latest financial information 
about the group. this is supplemented by meetings with other 
key senior executives. throughout their period in office the 
directors are continually updated on the group’s business, the 
competitive and regulatory environments in which it operates, 
corporate social responsibility matters and other changes 
affecting the group and the industry it operates in as a whole, 
by written briefings and meetings with senior executives. 
directors are also advised on appointment of their legal and 
other duties and obligations as a director of a listed company, 
both in writing and in face-to-face meetings with the 
secretary. they are reminded of these duties each year and 
they are also updated on changes to the legal and governance 
requirements of the group and upon themselves as directors.
Performance evalua Tion
the board, led by the chairman, performs an informal 
evaluation of the performance of the board, its principal 
committees, and individual directors with particular attention 
to those who are due for reappointment. this evaluation takes 
the form of a discussion with reference to the minutes of 
relevant meetings during the year under review.
re-elecTion
subject to the company’s articles of association, the 
companies act and satisfactory performance evaluation, 
directors stand for re-election every three years. in addition, 
non-executive directors who have served for more than nine 
years are put forward for annual re-election.
The comP anY secreT ar Y
the company s ecretary is responsible for advising the board 
through the chairman on all governance matters. the 
directors have access to the advice and services of the 
company s ecretary. the company’s articles of association 
provide that the appointment and removal of the company 
secretary is a matter for the full board.
informa Tion
regular reports and papers are circulated to the directors in a 
timely manner in preparation for board and committee 
meetings. the papers are supplemented by information 
specifically requested by the directors from time to time.
the non-executive directors receive monthly management 
accounts and regular management reports and information 
which enable them to scrutinise the group’s and 
management’s performance against agreed objectives.
rela Tions WiTh shareholDers
the chief executive and finance director give feedback to the 
board on issues raised with them by major shareholders and 
the group’s broker . in addition, the chairman is in regular 
discussions with the group’s broker and is available to 
shareholders as required. the annual General meeting is 
normally attended by all directors, and all shareholders have 
an opportunity to ask questions during the meeting and to 
meet with directors after the formal proceedings have ended.
the group maintains a corporate web site (www.trafficmaster .
co.uk) containing a wide range of information of interest to 
institutional and private investors. the group has frequent 
discussions with institutional shareholders on a range of 
issues affecting its performance. these include meetings 
following the announcement of the annual results with the 
group’s largest institutional shareholders on an individual 
basis. in addition, the group responds to individual and ad hoc 
requests for discussions from institutional shareholders. the 
senior independent director is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns, which contact through normal channels 
of chairman or chief executive has failed to resolve, or for 
which such contact is inappropriate.

in accordance with the guidance of the t urnbull committee the 
board of directors is responsible for the group’s system of 
internal control; sets appropriate policies on internal control; 
seeks regular assurances that enable it to satisfy itself that 
the system is functioning effectively; and ensures that the 
system of internal control is effective in managing risks in the 
manner which it has approved.
the directors have continued to review the effectiveness of the 
group’s system of financial and non-financial controls, 
including operational and compliance controls, risk 
management and the group’s high level internal control 
arrangements. these reviews have included an assessment of 
internal controls, management assurance of the maintenance 
of control and a report from the external auditor on matters 
identified in the course of its statutory audit work. a key part 
of these reviews is an annual “letter of assurance” process by 
which responsible managers confirm the adequacy of their 
system of internal financial and non-financial controls, their 
compliance with group policies (including those relating to 
safety, health and the environment), local laws and 
regulations (including the industry’s regulatory requirements) 
and report any control weaknesses identified in the past year .
the group views the careful management of risk as a key 
management activity. managing business risk to deliver 
opportunities is a key element of all activities. this is done 
using a simple and flexible framework which provides a 
consistent and sustained way of implementing the group’s 
values. these business risks, which may be strategic, 
operational, reputational, financial or environmental, should 
be understood and visible. the business context determines in 
each situation the level of acceptable risk and controls.

the board periodically considers the mix of skills and 
experience that the board requires and seeks the appointment 
of directors to meet its assessment of what is required to 
ensure the board is effective in discharging its responsibilities. 
if considered appropriate by the board, a nomination 
committee is formed to make recommendations to the board 
regarding the appointment of directors. during 2009 the

manage the process of appointing a new chairman and a new 
non-executive director . the nomination committee 
comprised colin w alsh, Geoffrey Bicknell, alan mcw alter and 
t ony eales. alan mcw alter did not participate in nomination

remunera Tion commiTTee
during the year the remuneration committee comprised ian 
coomber (chairman), Geoffrey Bicknell, alan mcw alter, 
phil cartmell (from may 2009) and colin w alsh (up to may

● ● its competitors and industry norms;
● ● compensation commitment; and
● ● contract periods.
with the specific approval of the board in each case, executive 
directors may accept external appointments as non-executive

to them. none of the executive directors held such an 
appointment during the year .
auDiT commiTTee

Bicknell (chairman), ian coomber, phil cartmell (from may 
2009), alan mcw alter and colin w alsh (up to may 2009). all the

the board has considered establishing an internal audit 
function and has decided that this would not be appropriate at 
this stage of the group’s development. the board considers 
that it currently receives sufficient assurance from external 
advisers and regulatory bodies on relevant areas of risk. the 
board is committed to reviewing the need for internal audit on 
a regular basis.
the committee meets with executive directors and 
management, as well as privately with the external auditors.
in 2009 the audit committee discharged its responsibilities by:
● ● reviewing the group’s draft financial statements and 
interim results statements prior to board approval and 
reviewing the external auditors’ detailed reports thereon;
● ● reviewing the group’s trading update announcements 
prior to release;
● ● reviewing the appropriateness of the group’s accounting 
policies;
● ● reviewing regularly the potential impact to the group’s 
financial statements of certain matters such as 
impairments of asset values and international financial 
reporting standards;
● ● reviewing and approving the audit fee and reviewing 
non-audit fees payable to the group’s external auditors;
● ● reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the audit of the 
group’s accounts, which includes key areas of extended 
scope work, key risks on the accounts, confirmation of 
auditor independence and the proposed audit fee, and 
approving the terms of engagement for the audit;
● ● reviewing an annual report on the group’s systems of 
internal control and its effectiveness, reporting to the 
board on the results of the review and receiving regular 
updates on key risk areas of financial control.
auDiT ors’ inDePenDence anD oBJecTiviTY
the audit committee monitors annually the non-audit 
services being provided to the group by its external auditors, 
and has developed an auditor independence policy to check 
that this does not impair their independence and objectivity, 
and that the group maintains a sufficient choice of 
appropriately qualified audit firms. the policy sets out four key 
principles which underpin the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditors: the auditor should not audit its own 
firm’s work, make management decisions for the group, have 
a mutuality of financial interest with the group, or be put in a 
role of advocate for the group. any activities that may be 
perceived to be in conflict with the role of external auditor 
must be submitted to the committee for approval prior to 
engagement regardless of the amounts involved. the audit 
committee monitors all services being provided by the 
external auditors annually to review their independence and 
objectivity, taking into consideration the relevant professional 
and regulatory requirements, so that these are not impaired 
by the provision of permissible non-audit services.
details of the amounts paid to external auditors during the 
year for audit and other services are set out in the notes to the 
financial statements on page 46.

remuneration report and corporate Governance statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations.
the directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included

1. accounTinG Policies
t rafficmaster plc is a company incorporated in the uK and listed on the l ondon stock exchange.
Basis of PreP ara Tion
the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the eu (‘ adopted ifrss’) and in accordance with the companies act 2006. the company has 
elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with uK Gaap; these are presented on pages 68 to 78.
the accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
group financial statements.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 30.
the consolidated financial statements are presented in GBp (£), which is the company’s functional currency.
GoinG concern 
t he group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the c hairman’s and c hief executive’s statements on pages 8 to 12. t he financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described in the f inancial r eview on pages 14 and 15. in addition, note 26 to the financial 
statements includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
as highlighted in note 19 to the financial statements, the group meets its day to day working capital requirements through a 
revolving multicurrency credit facility. a new facility has been agreed with the bank in January 2010 and expires after 42 months 
from the date of agreement. the current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over (a) the level of demand for the 
group’s products; (b) the exchange rate between sterling and the us dollar and thus the consequence for the cost of the group’s 
raw materials; and (c) the availability of bank finance in the foreseeable future. 
the group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the 
group should be able to operate within the level of its current and new facility. 
the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial 
statements.
f urther information regarding the group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position is set out in the chief executive’s statement on pages 10 to 12. f urther information regarding the 
financial position of the company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial review 
on pages 14 and 15. in addition notes 1, 25 and 26 to the financial statements include the group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
chanGe in accounTinG Policies
starting as of 1 January 2009, the group has changed its accounting policies in the following areas:
● ● accounting for borrowing costs
● ● determination and presentation of operating segments
● ● presentation of financial statements
● ● revenue recognition
accounting for borrowing costs
in respect of borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 
1 January 2009, the group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a 
qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. previously the group immediately recognised all borrowing costs as an expense. 
this change in accounting policy was due to the adoption of ias 23 Borrowing costs (2007). in accordance with the transitional 
provisions, comparative figures have not been restated. 
due to the lack of qualifying assets within the group, the change in accounting policy had no material impact on earnings per share.  www.trafficmaster.co.uk  TrafficmasTer Plc   37

Determination and presentation of operating segments
as of 1 January 2009 the group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the ceo, who is the group’s chief operating decision maker . this change in accounting policy is due to the adoption of ifrs 8 
operating s egments. previously operating segments were determined and presented in accordance with ias 14 s egment 
reporting. comparative segment information has been re-presented in conformity with the transitional requirements of the new 
standard. since the change in accounting policy only impacts presentation and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on 
earnings per share. the new accounting policy in respect of segment operating disclosures is presented as follows.
an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components. an operating 
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the ceo to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment 
and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 
segment results that are reported to the ceo include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis. unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets (primarily the company’s headquarters), 
head office expenses, and income tax assets and liabilities. 
segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible 
assets other than goodwill.
Presentation of financial statements
the group applied revised ias 1 presentation of financial statements (2007), which became effective as of 1 January 2009. 
as a result, the group presents in the consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in equity, whereas all 
non-owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
comparative information has been re-presented so that it also is in conformity with the revised standard. since the change in 
accounting policy only impacts presentation aspects, there is no impact on earnings per share. 
revenue recognition
previously revenue was allocated to components of a multiple-element revenue arrangement on a cost basis and has now been 
restated to allocate revenue to components on a fair value basis in line with the accounting policy for revenue recognition stated 
on page 40. in addition, this change has resulted in the recognition of intangible assets for certain non-cancellable contracts.
this change in measurement basis has been reflected as a prior year restatement as follows:
● ● revenues for the year ended 31 december 2008 have been revised from £55.8m to £55.1m
● ● amortisation of intangible assets included in cost of goods sold has been revised from £nil to £0.2m and other cost of goods 
sold revised from £21.1m to £20.4m. 
the net effect is to revise gross profit from £34.7m to £34.4m, operating profit from £5.7m to £5.4m and profit after tax from 
£5.0m to £4.7m for the year ended 31 december 2008.
in order to bring the accounting into line with the policy for the recognition of customer relationships on page 41, intangible 
assets are revised from £16.0m to £16.6m (31 december 2007 from £11.1m to £11.3m). 
in addition at 31 december 2008 deferred income is revised from £8.5m to £34.5m (31 december 2007 from £4.8m to £25.4m). 
n o movements have been recognised within the deferred tax asset as a result of these changes. t here is no effect on current tax.
t ogether, these changes revise net assets and equity from £54.5m to £28.7m (31 december 2007 from £40.8m to £20.5m). the 
effect of the restatement revises basic earnings per share for 2008 from 3.63p to 3.41p, and diluted earnings per share from 
3.63p to 3.41p.
aDoPTeD ifrss no T YeT aPPlieD
a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 december 
2009, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.   38  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

accounting for business combinations
the group will be required to adopt ifrs 3 Business combinations (2008) and ias 27 consolidated and s eparate financial 
statements (2008) for all business combinations occurring in the financial year starting 1 January 2010. 
the main changes arising from the new standard include:
● ● ifrs 3 (2008) applies also to business combinations involving only mutual entities and to business combinations achieved by 
contract alone.
● ● the definition of a business combination has been revised to focus on control.
● ● the definition of a business has been amended to clarify that it can include a set of activities and assets that are not being 
operated as a business, as long as an acquirer is capable of operating the set as a business.
● ● all items of consideration transferred by the acquirer are measured and recognised at fair value as of the acquisition date, 
including contingent consideration.
● ● the acquirer can elect to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value at the acquisition date, or at its proportionate 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
● ● t ransaction costs incurred by the acquirer in connection with the business combination do not form part of the business 
combination transaction.
● ● when an acquisition is achieved in successive share purchases (step acquisition), the identifiable assets and liabilities of the 
acquiree are recognised at fair value when control is obtained; and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss for the 
difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree. any amount 
related to previously held equity interests in the acquiree that was recognised directly in equity (e.g., the investment was 
classified as available-for-sale) is reclassified and included in the calculation of the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
● ● acquisitions of additional non-controlling equity interests after the business combination are accounted for as equity 
transactions.
● ● disposals of equity interests while retaining control are accounted for as equity transactions.
● ● t ransactions resulting in a loss of control result in a gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. the gain or loss includes 
a remeasurement to fair value of any retained equity interest in the investee.
● ● new disclosures are required.
primarily this change in accounting policy will be applied prospectively. however, where transactions costs have been capitalised 
prior to the adoption of the new policy, in respect of a future business combination which will be accounted for under ifrs 3 
(2008), these costs will be expensed in the year the new standard is adopted. the impact of this is considered in note 24.
measuremenT convenTion
the financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that certain assets are stated at their fair value. s uch 
assets relate to derivative financial instruments.
Basis of consoliD aTion
the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries.
subsidiaries are entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefit 
from their activities. subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
GooDWill
all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill acquired represents the excess of the 
fair value of the consideration and associated costs over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. at the date of acquisition, the 
goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested at least annually for 
impairment.
on a subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired, the profit and loss on disposal or termination is calculated after 
charging the carrying value of any related goodwill.

research anD DeveloPmenT
expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or 
sell the asset. the expenditure capitalised includes direct labour, the cost of materials and purchased services and directly 
attributable overheads.
other research and development expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense as 
incurred. capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
f ollowing the initial recognition of development expenditure, the cost is amortised over the product’s estimated useful life, 
usually between three and five years.
oTher inT anGiBle asseTs
other intangible assets that are acquired by the group which have a finite useful life are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. the estimated useful life for the current and the comparative periods are as 
follows:
licenses 15 years
customer relationships over contract term
ProPer TY , PlanT anD equiPmenT
property, plant and equipment are stated in the financial statements at cost less depreciation and any impairment in value. 
depreciation is provided to write-off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives (which are reviewed at least at each financial year end) as follows:
fixtures, fittings and computer equipment 5 years
motor vehicles 4 years
infrastructure 7 years
f reehold building 50 years
infrastructure relates to a network of nationwide sensors and transmitters that gather and distribute traffic data in the uK.
imPairmenT
financial assets
a financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect 
on the estimated future cash flow of that asset.
an impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. the remaining financial assets are 
assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
an impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised. f or financial assets measured at amortised costs and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the 
reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
non-financial assets
the carrying amounts of the group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. if any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated.
an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
a cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other 
assets and groups. impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. impairment losses recognised in respect of 
cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. 40  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009
17384	 06/05/2010	 Proof	6
an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. in respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior 
periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. an impairment 
loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. an impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying value that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
lease PreP aYmenTs
prepayments for leasehold land are stated in the financial statements at cost less depreciation. depreciation is provided to 
write-off the cost of the lease prepayments over the term of the lease (199 years).
oPera TinG leases
rentals under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period 
of the lease.
Pension cosTs
the group does not operate a pension scheme for its employees. it does, however, make contributions to the private pension 
arrangements of certain employees. these arrangements are of the money purchase type, and the amount charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income represents the contributions payable by the group during the year .
share-BaseD P aYmenTs
the company operates a number of share option schemes which allow employees to acquire shares of the company. the fair 
value of options is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. the fair value at the date at 
which the options are granted is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the  
vesting period, taking into account the number of options that are expected to be exercised. f air value is measured using the 
Black-scholes model. the number of options that are expected to be exercised is reviewed at each balance sheet date and, if 
necessary, estimates are revised.
revenue recoGniTion
revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
and services provided over the normal course of business. if it is probable that discounts will be granted and that amount can be 
measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction in revenue as the sales are recognised.
sale of goods
revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
have transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be 
estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably.
the timing of the transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sales. in most cases, 
transfer occurs at the time the product is shipped and delivered to the customer . however, in the case of some customers, bill 
and hold arrangements exist which accelerate the point at which ownership and the risks and rewards associated with the goods 
are passed to the buyer, and revenue is recognised in advance of shipping.
in certain circumstances, there remains additional activity to be performed in order for the customer to be able to use these 
goods for the purpose they were purchased. in these cases, revenue will only be recognised where this remaining activity is 
considered insignificant to the overall delivery of the goods and the costs associated with completing the activity can be reliably 
estimated and accrued for .
services
service revenue is generally recognised on a straight line basis over the service period, unless there is evidence that some other 
method better represents the stage of completion.
multiple element arrangements
Bundled sales or multiple-element arrangements require the group to deliver hardware and/or a number of services under one 
agreement, or a series of agreements which are commercially linked.

Our Accounts Our Governance Our Business
under such agreements, an assessment is made over the ability to identify and account for each of the components separately. 
in order for these components to be identified, it is determined whether the component has stand-alone value to the customer 
and whether the fair value of the component can be measured reliably. if these criteria are deemed to be met, the components 
are accounted for separately. 
where these agreements are accounted for separately, the consideration received is allocated to each of the identifiable 
components based on the relative fair values. f air values are determined on a hierarchical basis as follows:
● ● evidence where the group sells on a stand-alone basis
● ● evidence where the same or similar components are being sold by another third party
● ● Best estimate of the selling price
the amount of revenues allocated to the hardware element is accounted for in line with the policy for the sale of goods, and the 
amount allocated to services is accounted for in line with the policy for services.
alternatively, where it is determined that either the component does not have stand-alone value or it is not possible for fair value 
to be determined reliably, revenue is recognised on the entire agreement on a straight line basis over the service period.
customer relationships
in some circumstances, the accounting for revenue on multi element arrangements contracts in line with policies outlined 
above, results in the amount of revenue being allocated to the sale of goods being less than the cost of these goods. in these 
cases, any excess of directly attributable costs over the revenue allocated to the delivered goods is expected to be recovered over 
the term of the contract, and is recognised as an intangible asset, amortised over the initial non-cancellable, contract term.
foreiGn exchanGe Transla Tion
t ransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. f oreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling as follows:
● ● assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date with the resulting 
exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange translation reserve account;
● ● items of revenue and expense are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate with the resulting exchange 
differences recognised in the foreign exchange translation reserve account;
● ● cash flows are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate;
● ● exchange gains and losses arising from monetary items that, in substance, form a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are 
recognised in the foreign exchange translation reserve account;
the group has taken advantage of the relief available in ifrs 1 to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign 
operations to be zero at the date of transition to ifrs on 1 January 2004.
invenT ories
inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. the amount to recognise as an expense is determined using 
the weighted average principle which approximates to actual costs.
Taxa Tion
income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. income tax expense is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity. current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. the following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in 
a business combination; the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 42  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009
17384	 06/05/2010	 Proof	6
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entities except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
a deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the assets can be utilised.
financial asseTs anD liaBiliTies
financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the group balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
financial assets and financial liabilities are accounted for in the financial statements as follows:
● ● financial assets or liabilities held for trading, all derivatives other than hedging instruments and any other financial assets 
or liabilities designated at the time of initial recognition as ‘measured at fair value through profit and loss’ are stated at fair 
value and all changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income;
● ● l oans and receivables are measured at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method;
● ● other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
the group does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, nor does it hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the group’s principal financial instruments are borrowings for the 
purposes of funding operating activities and acquisitions. the group holds financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to interest 
rate fluctuations.
the group does not hedge its foreign currency denominated trading cash flows. the group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange 
rates on the translation of profits earned by overseas subsidiaries. average rates are used for the retranslation of such profits 
when they approximate to the rates of exchange on the dates of the transaction.
Deriva Tive financial insTrumenTs 1
the group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposures. embedded derivatives are separated 
from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the 
embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet 
the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.
derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 
subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described 
below.
cash flow hedges
changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity 
to the extent that the hedge is effective. t o the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in profit 
or loss.
if the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until 
the forecast transaction occurs. when the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to 
the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised. in other cases the amount recognised in equity is transferred to profit or 
loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
separable embedded derivatives
changes in the fair value of separable embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
other non-trading derivatives
when a derivative financial instrument is not held for trading, and is not designated in a qualifying hedge relationship, all 
changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
TraDe anD o Ther receivaBles
f air value of trade and other receivables is estimated at the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the reporting date.

Our Accounts Our Governance Our Business
lease receivables
under certain contracts credit terms are negotiated with customers over an extended period. the lease receivable element of 
the contract represents the amount which has been committed but not yet invoiced.
TraDe P aY aBles
t rade payables are not interest-bearing and are initially measured at their fair value, being payment or settlement amounts, and 
subsequently at amortised cost.
cash anD cash equivalenTs
cash comprises, for the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash in hand and deposits payable on demand and bank 
overdrafts. cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. cash equivalents are normally with the date of maturity of three 
months or less from the acquisition date.
equiTY insTrumenTs
equity instruments issued by the company are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
financial income anD exPenses
f inance expenses and income comprise interest payable, interest receivable on funds invested, discounts applicable to provisions 
and foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in the statement of c omprehensive income. f inance income and 
expenses are recognised in the statement of c omprehensive income as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Provisions
a provision is recognised in the statement of financial p osition when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. if the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash outflows at a pre tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risk specific to the liability.
DismanTlinG
liabilities for dismantling costs are recognised when the group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of 
plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. the amount 
recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and 
requirements. a corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equal to the provision is also created. this is 
subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the facility or item of plant.
2. seGmenT rePor TinG
the group operates under four reportable segments, as described below, which form the group’s strategic business units.
internal management reporting is structured based on two main divisions, Business s ervices and consumer s ervices, the latter 
being further analysed into three business segments which reflect their differing marketing and technological influences. the 
following summary describes the operations in each of the group’s reportable segments:
● ● Business services division
● ❍ fleet tracking - provides fleet tracking and dynamic navigation capabilities to business users.
● ● consumer s ervices division
● ❍ stolen v ehicle t racking - provides stolen vehicle tracking and navigation services to consumers and businesses
● ❍ t raffic- provides traffic and journey time data to business users, consumers and government agencies.
● ❍ emerging products - markets the group’s technology through new and innovative products and services
information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. performance is measured based on segment 
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (eBitda ), as included in the internal management reports which 
are reviewed by the board. eBitda is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is most  
relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities which operate within these industries. t he effects  
of non-recurring items are excluded from management’s measurement basis. interest and tax are not allocated to the segments.
inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. 44  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

 stolen v ehicle t racking      3,982 3,982
       5,681 5,681
the impairment tests for both cash-generating units involved the determination of recoverable amounts based upon value in use 
calculations. in the assessment undertaken in 2009, value in use was derived using discounted free cash flow projections based 
upon actual operating results, the annual business plan and directors’ long-term estimates based on past experience and 
external estimates related to market growth. management estimates discount rates using the weighted average cost of capital 
of the group, adjusted for risks specific to the cash-generating units. the key assumptions used are as follows:
   fleet stolen v ehicle 
   t racking t racking
     2009 2008 2009 2008
 pre-tax discount rate    10% 12% 12% 14%

 number of annual cash flows considered   4 5 4 5
the recoverable amounts for both cash-generating units exceeded their respective carrying amounts at 31 december 2009.
reasonable changes in the above key assumptions would not create an impairment of goodwill.

the group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised tax losses. account has been taken of future forecasts of 
taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised. if these forecast profits do not materialise, or 
change, or if there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses might be recognised, then the value of the 
deferred tax asset will need to be revised in a future period.

the group has made a provision for dismantling and removing the infrastructure (a network of nationwide sensors and 
transmitters) in accordance with ias 16. Because of the long-term nature of the liability, the biggest uncertainty in estimating 
the provision is the timing and the cost that will be incurred.
in determining the provision, the group have based their assessment on the size of the existing network and have assumed that 
the work will be carried out using technology and materials that are currently available.
the basis used to determine the amount of the provision requires the use of judgements and estimates regarding the costs 
associated with dismantling the network.
the provision is classified as non-current.

details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of

liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1 of the financial statements.
financial risK mana GemenT oBJecTives
financial risks include market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, 
liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. the group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by developing and 
consistently applying board approved policies and procedures. such policies and procedures are regularly reviewed for their 
appropriateness and effectiveness to deal with changing nature of financial risks.
the group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through a revolving credit facility which is due for renewal in July 
2013. the current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over (a) the level of demand for the group’s products; (b) 
the exchange rate between sterling and us dollar with the consequences for the cost of the group’s raw materials and us dollar 
denominated earnings; and (c) the availability of bank finance in the foreseeable future.
the group has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and industries. as a consequence, the directors believe that the group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
f urther information regarding the group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, is set out in the financial review and the directors’ report.
foreiGn exchanGe risK
approximately 70% (2008: 70%) of the group’s net assets are in currencies linked with the us dollar and are generated by a 
trading subsidiary in the usa.
exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on normal sales and purchases is minimised by trading in the foreign subsidiaries’ 
local currencies whenever possible. the group also mitigates its foreign currency exchange risk by borrowing in foreign 
currency, hence the group’s £6.9m revolving credit facility at 31 december 2009 is denominated in us dollars. this facility was 
replaced by new revolving credit facility and loan on 29 January 2010 totalling $24,750,000 and a term loan of £2,500,000.
the group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates on the translation of profits earned by its subsidiary in the usa. these 
profits are translated at average exchange rates for the year which is an approximation to rates at the date of transaction.
cash floW anD fair value inTeresT ra Te risK
the group has no significant interest-bearing assets and consequently its income and cash flows are largely independent of 
changes in market interest rates. the group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowings in the form of bank loans 
and overdrafts, mitigated by the effects of interest rates on cash balances. Borrowings at floating rates expose the group to cash 
flow interest rate risk. there are no fixed rate borrowings, therefore minimising the exposure of the group to fair value interest 
rate risk.
the group entered into a three year interest rate swap contract to hedge its interest rate risk exposure on the $12,375,000 and 
£2.5m term loans as required by the underlying loan agreement. the interest rate swap settles quarterly on a net basis. 62  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

creDiT risK
credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. 
management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. credit evaluations are 
performed on all customers requiring credit using information supplied by independent rating agencies where available. the 
group also uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
at the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risks. the maximum exposure to credit risk is 
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial p osition.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the group may have a secured claim. the 
group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. the group also manages its credit risk by 
transferring some of its usa-based receivables to finance companies on a non-recourse basis as set out in note 29. during the 
year, the group’s exposure to credit risk increased mainly due to a decision to self-fund some of its usa-based long-term 
receivables, or to transfer receivables on a recourse basis.
liquiDiTY risK
liquidity risk is the risk that the group may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. the group ensures that 
there are sufficient levels of committed facilities, cash and cash equivalents to ensure that the group is at all times able to meet 
its financial commitments. liquidity risk is managed by continuous monitoring of forecast and actual cash flows and matching 
the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. details in respect of the bank loan and facility are considered in note 19.
the following table details the group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. the table has been drawn up 
based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay. 
the table includes both estimated interest and principal cash flows.

f air value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between 
informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. where market values 
are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing rates translated at year end

sensiTiviTY anal Ysis
in managing interest rate and currency risks the group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the group’s 
earnings. over the long-term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on 
consolidated earnings.
at 31 december 2009, it is estimated that a general increase of two percentage points (2008: two) in interest rates would 
decrease the group’s profit before tax by approximately £400,000 (2008: £216,000).
it is estimated that a general increase of ten percentage points (2008: twenty) in the value of sterling against other foreign 
currencies would have decreased the group’s profit before tax by approximately £219,000 for the year ended 31 december 2009 
(2008: decreased by £556,000).
in both cases, the change from a decrease in rates is expected to be equal in size to the changes from an increase. 64  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

off balance sheet arrangements
as part of its credit management procedures, the group uses third party finance organisations as intermediaries to fund some of 
its medium term credit arrangements with customers.
under the agreed terms with these finance organisations, the group sells customer receivables on a non-recourse basis in order 
to accelerate cash flows on these transactions.
these transactions are primarily for multiple year service agreements with customers. whilst the group has limited exposure to 
credit risk on the balances recoverable from these customers, under the terms of these arrangements, the group is required to 
provide assistance to the financial organisations in recovering any overdue amounts.

30. mana GemenT JuDGemenTs anD esTima Tion uncer TainTies
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with ifrss requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that reflect the application of accounting policies and of reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. actual results may differ from these estimates.
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to the accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
JuDGemenTs
critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements are as follows:
● ● revenue recognition
● ● capitalisation of development expenditure
revenue recognition
certain aspects of the group’s revenue recognition policies require management to exercise judgement over whether certain 
conditions have been met, such as:
● ● the ability to identify and separately account for components of a multiple-element revenue arrangement
● ● the point at which the risks and rewards pass to the customer under agreements which are not clearly defined
● ● where additional activity is to be performed on sale of goods arrangements, whether the remaining activity is considered to 
be insignificant
capitalisation of development costs
it is group policy to capitalise and amortise development expenditure where research findings are applied to a plan or design for 
the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, if the product or process is technically and 
commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development. 
such expenditure is amortised over the period in which the group expects to obtain economic benefits. this policy includes 
judgements regarding the initial recognition of the asset based upon market research and expected future net revenues. it also 
includes estimations regarding the period of amortisation. 
Judgements regarding the feasibility of such research and market demand could impact significantly on the initial recognition or 
subsequent carrying value of such expenditure.  variations in the estimated amortisation period could also impact significantly 
on group profit through an increase or decrease in the amortisation charge.
off balance sheet arrangements
as set out in note 29, the group enters into agreements with third party finance organisations to fund medium term credit agreements.
in order to determine the accounting treatment for these arrangements, group management are required to determine whether 
the risks and rewards associated with the receivables have been passed to the third party finance organisation. one of the key 
factors considered by management is whether  these agreements are with or without recourse. in cases where the receivables 
are funded without recourse, management consider that substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with these 
receivables have been transferred from the company to the third party, and the arrangements are therefore considered to be off 
balance sheet and are de-recognised accordingly.
assumPTions anD esTima Tes
assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next 
financial year are as follows:
● ● Goodwill
● ● current asset provision
● ● deferred taxation
● ● dismantling provision
Goodwill
the directors use their judgement to estimate the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the 
group over future periods. t o assist in making this judgement, the directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the 
carrying value of the group’s capitalised goodwill, using discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the “value in use” to the group 
of the capitalised goodwill.
the assumptions used in the calculation are shown in note 12.  66  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

current asset provisions
in the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working 
capital, principally inventory and trade receivables. 
provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving inventories and bad and doubtful debts based on historical evidence, and the 
best available information in relation to the specific issues. in estimating the collectability of trade receivables, judgement is required 
assessing their likely realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related ageing of past due balances. 
specific accounts are assessed in situations where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to 
deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy. details of balances provided are included within note 17.
Deferred taxation
information regarding the recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets is considered in note 15.
Dismantling provision
in the uK, the group has obligations to dismantle a network of nationwide sensors expanding across numerous highways in the 
country, at the point that this technology is no longer used.
information regarding the provision is included in note 22.

Basis of PreP ara Tion
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the companies act 2006, applicable uK accounting standards, 
and under the historical cost accounting rules.
under section 408 of the c ompanies act 2006 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
the company’s results are included in the consolidated financial statements of t rafficmaster plc, a company registered in the 
united Kingdom.
the company has taken advantage of the frs 29 ‘financial instruments: disclosure’ exemption not to present its own financial 
instruments disclosure.
invesTmenTs
in the company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost 
less any impairment in value.
TanGiBle fixeD asseTs anD DePrecia Tion
depreciation is provided by the company in order to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by 
equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:

fixtures, fittings and computer equipment — 5 years
motor vehicles — 4 years
infrastructure — 7 years
f reehold building — 50 years
l easehold land — 199 years
infrastructure relates to a network of nationwide sensors and transmitters that gather and distribute traffic data.
oPera TinG leases
rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
research anD DeveloPmenT exPenDiTure
development costs on clearly defined projects, the outcome of which has been assessed with reasonable certainty, are 
capitalised to the extent that their recovery can reasonably be regarded as assured and are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the expected life of the product and five years. other research and development expenditure is written off in 
the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Pension cosTs
the company does not operate a pension scheme for its employees. it does, however, make contributions to the private pension 
arrangements of certain employees. these arrangements are of the money purchase type, and the amount charged to profit and 
loss account represents the contributions payable by the group during the financial year .
share-BaseD P aYmenTs
in accordance with frs 20, ‘share-based payments’ the share options are accounted for in the financial statements at their fair 
values at the grant date and charged to the profit and loss account over their vesting periods with the corresponding entries in 
reserves. f air value is measured using the Black–scholes model. the issuance by the company to its subsidiaries of a grant over 
the company’s options represents additional capital contribution by the company to its subsidiaries. an additional investment in 
the subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity.
revenue recoGniTion
revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
and services provided over the normal course of business. if it is probable that discounts will be granted and that amount can be 
measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction in revenue as the sales are recognised. www.trafficmaster.co.uk  TrafficmasTer Plc   71
17384	 06/05/2010	 Proof	6
Our Accounts Our Governance Our Business
sale of goods
revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
have transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be 
estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably.
the timing of the transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sales. in most cases, 
transfer occurs at the time the product is shipped and delivered to the customer . however, in the case of some customers, bill 
and hold arrangements exist which accelerate the point at which ownership and the risks and rewards associated with the goods 
are passed to the buyer, and revenue is recognised in advance of shipping.
in certain circumstances, there remains additional activity to be performed in order for the customer to be able to use these 
goods for the purpose they were purchased. in these cases, revenue will only be recognised where this remaining activity is 
considered insignificant to the overall delivery of the goods and the costs associated with completing the activity can be reliably 
estimated and accrued for .
services
service revenue is generally recognised on a straight line basis over the service period, unless there is evidence that some other 
method better represents the stage of completion.
multiple element arrangements
Bundled sales or multiple-element arrangements require the company to deliver hardware and/or a number of services under 
one agreement, or a series of agreements which are commercially linked.
under such agreements, an assessment is made over the ability to identify and account for each of the components separately. 
in order for these components to be identified, it is determined whether the component has stand-alone value to the customer 
and whether the fair value of the component can be measured reliably. if these criteria are deemed to be met, the components 
are accounted for separately. 
where these agreements are accounted for separately, the consideration received is allocated to each of the identifiable 
components based on the relative fair values. f air values are determined based on a hierarchical basis as follows:
● ● evidence where the company sells on a stand-alone basis
● ● evidence where the same or similar components are being sold by another third party
● ● Best estimate of the selling price
the amount of revenues allocated to the hardware element is accounted for in line with the policy for the sale of goods, and the 
amount allocated to services is accounted for in line with the policy for services.
alternatively, where it is determined that either the component does not have stand-alone value or it is not possible for fair value 
to be determined reliably, revenue is recognised on the entire agreement on a straight line basis over the service period.
customer relationships
in some circumstances, the accounting for revenue on multi element arrangements contracts in line with policies outlined 
above, results in the amount of revenue being allocated to the sale of goods being less than the cost of these goods. in these 
cases, any excess of directly attributable costs over the revenue allocated to the delivered goods is expected to be recovered over 
the term of the contract, and is recognised as an intangible asset, amortised over the initial non-cancellable, contract term.
foreiGn currencies
t ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
differences arising from the translation, at closing rates, of loans to overseas subsidiaries, foreign currency borrowings, trading 
and other items are taken to the profit and loss account. 72  TrafficmasTer Plc  annual report and accounts 2009

sTocK s
stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions
a provision is recognised in the Balance sheet when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. if the effect is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash outflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risk specific to the liability.
DismanTlinG
liabilities for dismantling costs are recognised when the company has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item 
of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. the amount 
recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and 
requirements. a corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equal to the provision is also created. this is 
subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the facility or item of plant.
Taxa Tion
the charge for taxation is based upon the result for the year and takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences 
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
deferred tax is recognised without discounting in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for 
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise recognised 
by frs 19.
net debit balances are recognised as assets only to the extent that they are expected to be recovered.
financial asseTs anD liaBiliTies
financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the company Balance sheet when the company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
financial assets and financial liabilities are accounted for in the financial statements as follows:
● ● financial assets or liabilities held for trading, all derivatives other than hedging instruments and any other financial assets 
or liabilities designated at the time of initial recognition as ‘measured at fair value through the profit and loss’ are stated at 
fair value and all changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit or loss;
● ● financial assets held to maturity are measured at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method;
● ● loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method;
● ● financial assets available for sale are measured at fair value with gains and losses on remeasurement of these assets 
recognised directly in equity;
● ● other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, nor does it hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and acquisitions. the company’s principal financial instruments are 
borrowings for the purposes of funding operating activities and acquisitions.
Deriva Tive financial insTrumenTs
the group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposures. embedded derivatives are separated 
from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the 
embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet 
the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit and loss.
derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 
subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below.
cash flow hedges
c hanges in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity to 
the extent that the hedge is effective. to the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

if the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until 
the forecast transaction occurs. when the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to 
the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised. in other cases the amount recognised in equity is transferred to profit or 
loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
separable embedded derivatives
changes in the fair value of separable embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
other non-trading derivatives
when a derivative financial instrument is not held for trading, and is not designated in a qualifying hedge relationship, all 
changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

the company has made a provision for dismantling and removing the infrastructure (a network of nationwide sensors and 
transmitters). Because of the long-term nature of the liability, the biggest uncertainty in estimating the provision is the timing 
and the cost that will be incurred. in particular, the company has assumed that the work will be carried out using technology 
and materials that are currently available.

the grants and related accounting treatment adopted by t rafficmaster plc under frs 20, ‘share-based p ayments’ are identical 
to those adopted by the group under ifrs 2, ‘share-based p ayments’. f or details refer to note 23.
the company’s total expense recognised within administrative expenses for the year arising from share-based payments was 
£223,000 (2008: £275,000).
there is a potential deferred tax asset of £29,000 arising from the share-based payment expense in 2009 (2008: £4,000). this has 
not been recognised as the future economic benefit is uncertain.

on 3 f ebruary 2010 t rafficmaster plc acquired the entire share capital of us-based fleet management s olutions, inc (fms) for a 
total consideration of $13.25m (£8.1m) including $6m (£3.7m) of deferred contingent consideration based on certain 
performance criteria being met in the calendar years 2010 and 2011.
the company is party to a cross guarantee with respect to the bank borrowings of certain group companies. at 31 december 
2009 and 2008 the bank balances of the subsidiaries which are party to this guarantee were not overdrawn.
on 21 July 2008, the company acquired the entire share capital of tri-mex Group ltd and its subsidiaries (collectively trading 
under the ‘eurowatch’ brand) for a deferred contingent consideration capped at £4,750,000. the consideration is payable over 
the following three years subject to the achievement of certain earn-out criteria. the directors believe that it is not probable that 
those criteria will be met in the current economic climate. www.trafficmaster.co.uk  TrafficmasTer Plc   79

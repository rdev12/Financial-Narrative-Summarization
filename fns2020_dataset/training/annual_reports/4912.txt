OUR BUSINESS AT A GLANCE
The Group operates in  
global markets, providing 
manufacturers and printers 
with the ability to code, mark 
or print data, information or 
graphical images on to their 
products or packaging at 
high speed, typically in line 
in the manufacturing or 
printing process.

WHAT WE DO
Our complete solutions approach is based 
upon expert applications knowledge and, 
where required, innovative coding 
automation software for effective 
manufacturing line integration.
Demand for our products and services is 
created through legislation and mandate, 
typically meeting the need to inform 
consumers, and through providing 
manufacturers and printers with an 
economic means of decorating, 
identifying, tracing, protecting or 
authenticating their products for 
commercial or regulatory purposes.
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS
Our products are designed to support  
our ‘make to order’ manufacturing strategy. 
Typical lead times for the equipment we 
sell are less than four weeks. Fluids and 
other consumables are often supplied to 
customers next day.
Our next generation of equipment uses 
our unique intelligent Technology, i-Tech, 
which makes production lines lower 
maintenance, lower cost and more 
efficient all round.
We support a global customer base 
through an extensive sales channel 
network comprised of directly held sales 
subsidiaries and third party distributors. 
Every sales channel is trained and equipped 
to provide professional sales advice, 
installation, service and support. 
MARKETS
In 2014, our revenue split by location 
of customers was 23 per cent in the 
Americas, 43 per cent in Europe and 
34 per cent in Asia/Rest of World. 
We have an installed base well in excess 
of 200,000 printers operating worldwide.
Typical customers are manufacturers, 
including multinational, regional and 
national companies, spread across a wide 
range of market sectors. We also supply 
printers of labels, mail and other web 
based materials to meet their short run 
and variable printing needs.
Food, beverage, pharmaceutical and 
commercial printing are the largest sectors; 
combined they represent approximately  
66 per cent of total sales. Our breadth of 
industry coverage and lack of reliance on 
any one or small group of customers 
provides protection against sector 
specific market risk. STRATEGIC

FURTHER PROGRESS AND AN INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Group has made good 
progress in growing sales, 
profits and cash during the 
year while continuing to 
develop new products and 
investing in further expanding 
our digital printing business.
Our business in Europe reported double-
digit sales growth in local terms, benefiting 
from more buoyant markets in the early 
part of the year. We also reported good 
growth in the Americas and Asia. Market 
conditions have been changeable and we 
have seen a more cautious attitude among 
customers in many markets over the 
second half of our year.
We are pleased with the success of 
our latest i-Tech product range, which 
provides customers with class-leading 
performance, while our research and 
development teams are busy working 
on further product innovations. The 
aftermarket business continues to grow 
in line with our expectations. 
Our latest full-colour digital label press has 
been well received by customers and we 
are seeing increasing adoption of digital 
printing technology among label converters. 
Activity levels among our sales teams, and 
the increase in sales of N-Series digital label 
presses this year, give us confidence in the 
potential for continued growth. 
Over the last year, we have committed 
capital to a number of expansion projects. 
We commissioned our new factory in 
India, purchased land and started ground-
work on a new factory in the UK, which 
will primarily serve the European and 
American markets, and approved the 
building of a new factory in China to 
meet our expansion plans in Asia. 
We have provided new and expanded 
demonstration and laboratory facilities 
for our digital printing business. 
Good progress has been made against 
our sustainability agenda and we were 
pleased that our determination to 
reduce our environmental impact was 
recognised with a fourth consecutive rating 
improvement from the Carbon Disclosure 
Project. We also remain a member of the 
FTSE4Good index. 
Earlier in the year, Philip Ruffles, who was a 
non-executive Director, and Garry Havens, 
an executive Director, both stepped down 
from the Board. I thank them for their 
contribution to the Group over many 
years. In November, we announced the 
appointment of two new Board members, 
Sucheta Govil and Rachel Hurst. Sucheta 
joins us as a non-executive Director and has 
a background of senior roles in marketing 
and significant experience in Asia. Rachel 
is the executive Director responsible for 
Group operations, including manufacturing, 
product marketing and engineering.
The Group’s global workforce is more than 
2,300 strong. I would like to thank them, our 
distribution partners, and our suppliers for 
their contribution to our continuing success.
Our balance sheet remains robust and our 
cash generation increased our year-end net 
cash position to £40.1 million. The Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 14.76 pence, 
making a total of 22.74 pence for the year 
as a whole, an increase of 5 per cent. STRATEGIC

The Group has had a good year 
and delivered results in line with our 
expectations. We continue to invest in 
research and development and in growing 
the capability and capacity of our digital 
printing business. However, we remain 
cautious about 2015. As announced in our 
Interim Statement, the investments we are 
making, coupled with uncertain market 
conditions, mean we expect results in 2015 
to be at a broadly similar level to this year.
Our strong product range and our 
investments in developing our capabilities 
mean we remain optimistic about the 
Group’s longer-term prospects.

CAPITALISING ON NEW OPPORTUNITIES
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S OVERVIEW
In 2014, we balanced 
progress in sales 
performance with 
investments to sustain 
longer-term growth, while 
delivering profit 
improvement. 
We increased underlying pre-tax profit 
(see note 3) by 9 per cent and at the same 
time continued to invest in core business 
capacity and in enhancing and growing our 
digital printing business. 
Market conditions varied as the year 
developed but they generally improved in 
most regions of the world, compared with 
the last two years. The year started well, 
with a wave of confidence in Europe as 
economic growth rates improved and the 
Eurozone crisis ended. Uncertainty about 
the Chinese economy receded and 
prospects for the broader Asian and North 
American markets were positive.
Against that backdrop, our order intake in 
the early months of the year was good, 
continuing the momentum from the final 
quarter of 2013. We saw growing 
customer confidence, culminating in a 
number of large project opportunities and 
successes for our sales teams. We 
reported sales growth at constant 
currency of 11 per cent in our interim 
results, with our strongest performance 
being in Europe.
However, as we entered our second half 
year, economic news was less positive in 
both Europe and parts of Asia. The 
deteriorating political situation in the 
Middle East and the tensions in Ukraine 
also affected customer confidence. 
Summer in the northern hemisphere once 
again proved a strong period for 
aftermarket sales but the return of general 
uncertainty slowed the intake of orders for 
new equipment. Sales growth in the 
second half year was 7 per cent, before the 
impact of exchange rate movements. 
Our core coding and marking business had 
a good year, with a number of large project 
wins for new equipment, successes in our 
key focus sectors of food, beverage, 
pharmaceutical and tobacco, and another 
year of strong aftermarket sales. I have 
been pleased with the performance of our 
European businesses, where revenue 
growth is well ahead of recent years, and 
with the USA and Canada, where we have 
maintained prior-year progress. In Asia, all 
subsidiaries delivered strong growth, 
although weakness in the Chinese 
economy in the second half of the year 
held back sales. In our interim results, we 
reported increased price pressures in 
China and other developing markets, and 
the potential for further deterioration in 
margins if prices continued to fall. However, 
pricing was relatively stable during the 
second half year. 
Aftermarket revenues remain the largest 
proportion of Group sales and during 2014 
we had a special focus on improving 
aftermarket retention rates, across all 
products and businesses. Our ‘win-back’ 
programme was successful, improving an 
already impressive retention rate and 
increasing sales as a result.
We made good progress in the digital 
printing business, where we have focused 
on growing sales of full-colour digital ink jet 
printing presses into the label sector. There 
are clear drivers for transitioning to digital 
printing technology in this sector and while 
the rate of change is difficult to predict, the 
opportunity is attracting attention from 
both customers and competitors. We 
recognised revenue on 19 N-Series digital 
presses in the year and received orders or 
commitments for a number more that we 
will realise during 2015. 
Full-colour printing is a new venture for the 
Group and while the applications and 
customer groups are adjacent to those for 
coding and marking, we have faced a 
considerable learning curve as we establish 
capability and capacity in the very 
demanding field of colour management. 
We are progressing well in that regard and 
in particular with the print quality and 
performance of our products, which is a 
testament to the hard work of many of our 
people as we develop our knowledge and 
skills. Feedback from customers has been 
very positive, confirming the economic 
gains and ultimate benefits to brand 
owners of using digital ink jet in their label 
printing business. The installed base of 
digital presses is growing and as our 
customers bring them up to full utilisation, 
we expect to see substantial growth in the 
fluids business.  STRATEGIC
REPORT

STATEMENTS
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 | 7
We had a successful year of new product 
introductions in 2014. Early in the year, we 
launched enhancements to our continuous 
ink jet, laser and thermal ink jet printer 
ranges, both in hardware and fluids. We 
complemented this with a portfolio of 
product launches in the spring, to coincide 
with the important InterPack exhibition in 
Dusseldorf, Germany. Finally, in September 
we launched the N610i seven-colour digital 
label press at LabelExpo in Chicago, and 
were pleased to make immediate sales at 
the show. 
We have continued to invest in 
production capacity and opened our 
new factory in India this year. Further 
investment is planned, with work on a new 
factory in China commencing during 2015. 
We are taking preliminary steps towards 
constructing a new factory and warehouse 
facility in the UK, on a site we have acquired 
next to our Group headquarters. We also 
made progress towards our goal of business 
excellence, making organisational changes 
to sharpen our focus on key process 
simplification and further improve 
customer service. 
There have been a number of changes in 
the management team around the Group in 
2014. We filled the role of General Manager 
in three of our largest businesses, China, 
India and the USA, through internal 
promotions. We also added a considerable 
number of people to our digital printing 
organisation, with many coming from the 
industry, helping to rapidly advance our skills 
and knowledge. At the end of the year, we 
were pleased to announce the promotion 
of Rachel Hurst, our Group Operations 
Director, to the Domino Printing Sciences 
plc Board. Rachel will now take full 
operational responsibility for our 
manufacturing, engineering, product 
management and marketing functions, and 
will lead the next stages of our business 
excellence programme.
There is no shortage of opportunity for 
our business to grow. The overall sales 
performance this year, in both the core 
business and new digital press products, 
gives me confidence in our ability to deliver 
medium-term sales increases at or above 
global GDP growth. As we look forward 
to 2015 and beyond, it is clear the digital 
printing business has great potential but 
requires significant investment. While I 
expect to see sales progression in 2015, 
progress in profit will be held back as we 
plan to invest further in research and 
development and in the broader sales and 
support organisation, helping to fuel 
future growth.

industry, we have significantly invested in our Life 
Sciences sector programme, as a key part of our 
global commitment to the industry.
CUSTOMER FIRST
WESTERN REGION – USA
Government mandated initiatives in North 
America, such as DQSA and UDI, address 
counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals and medical 
devices. This means it is important to be  
able to print compliant serialised codes on 
products and packaging. As a consequence, 
we have introduced our Life Sciences sector 
programme in North America, incorporating:
 
• Comprehensive market insight, to enable 
a clear sector-driven strategy
• Effective organisational infrastructure
• Best-in-class product and customer

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
India remains a strong market for Domino. This year 
we have again enjoyed double-digit growth, ahead of 
GDP, supported by a strengthened market orientation 
across all our operations in the region.
CUSTOMER FIRST
EASTERN REGION – INDIA
Critical to our success in 2014 has been 
developing an organisation-wide focus  
on increasing value to our customers, as a 
means of creating competitive advantage. 
 
Key deliverables this year have included:
• Improving overall response times for  
our customers, by restructuring the  
Indian team and improving alignment  
with Domino’s global operations
• Improving customer intimacy and 
efficiency, from simplifying business 
processes and automation 
• Reducing time to market, by localising 
manufacturing for key coding and marking 
technologies, including thermal ink 
jet printing. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 14
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Agility and innovation are increasingly critical to 
successful product development. This is particularly 
true for Domino’s marking materials, where we have 
been formulating ink solutions that improve our 
customers’ efficiency while reducing waste.
PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
In 2014, we developed a number of key ink 
technology platforms using advanced materials, 
enabling us to respond more rapidly to 
changing market requirements while delivering 
high performance. This has resulted in several 
successful product introductions, offering 
improved overall equipment effectiveness 
(OEE) through wider manufacturing process 
tolerances. These have included:
 
• New pigmented ink products for the 
industrial coding market
• Higher performing inks for the flexible 
packaging sector in Asia. 
 
Equally, our target for best-in-class 
environmental performance from our 
products has delivered leadership in materials 
selection and use for coding applications.  
We have achieved this through a combination 
of programmes, including:
 
• Growing our innovation ecosystem,  
inside and outside our business
• Driving cutting-edge collaborations  
with academia
• Working with the Royal Society of 
Chemistry to deliver professional 
Chartered Chemist training.
 
Our platform approach to technology 
development, combined with environmental 
sustainability, has delivered commercial 
results this year and underpins our longer-

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Domino has a long tradition of driving 
excellence across its operational sites. 
This year, we have started the process of 
delivering best-in-class practices across 
our global network.
BUSINESS EXCELLENCE 
AND SUSTAINABILITY
In 2014, we devoted significant time to 
mapping our customers’ journey with 
Domino. The first initiatives, which aim  
to redesign our processes to deliver an 
outstanding customer experience, have 
already started to produce real benefits.
Our first milestone project in this 
programme improved the speed and 
accuracy of quotes generated by our field 
sales team in Europe and the USA. By 
developing and implementing a cloud-based 
quotation tool, we have been able to:
• Reduce the time to quote from hours 
to just a few minutes
• Free up significant capacity within our 
sales team
• Deliver more accurate and 
informative quotes. 
In addition, we have continued our focus on 
sustainability, by driving efficiency, eliminating 
waste and improving financial returns through 
careful resource management.
Having established some early success 
with our programme, we expect to build 
momentum in our drive for more efficient 
business processes. During 2015, we will 
increase our focus on customer experience 
management, process automation and 
network integration. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 16
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
This year, we strengthened our shared focus by 
updating and further embedding our corporate guide, 
The Domino Effect, across our organisation.
CULTURE, PEOPLE & VALUES
The principles of The Domino Effect have 
been a major factor in developing our Group 
into a FTSE 250 company, while retaining 
the special culture of a much smaller, 
more intimate business. We have kept the 
programme’s fundamental elements but 
sought to more clearly articulate our 
objectives and the means by which we 
will achieve them, in part to recognise 
our increasingly global footprint.
We have done this throughout the year with 
activities across the global business, designed 
to engage with all levels of the organisation.

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Domino continues to invest in initiatives where our 
expertise in industrial and packaging markets, combined 
with our development capability, allow us to take leadership 
positions. In digital printing, we are addressing the need for 
faster and shorter run production of high-resolution print in 
mono and colour applications. 
STRATEGIC INVESTMENT
In 2014, we continued to develop our leading 
digital ink jet label press, the N610i. Central 
to this was the introduction of our seven-
colour capability, adding orange and violet 
to the existing CMYK and white inks we 
launched at LabelExpo 2013. These new inks 
increase the range of colours available to 
label convertors and end users, offering the 
inherent benefits of digital ink jet to a wider 
range of customers.
During the year, the N610i has continued 
to prove its performance and value to 
customers, as shown by:
• Repeat sales to a number of major 
European label convertors
• Growth in our North American business, 
including a number of important US-based 
label convertors.
Outside colour, our range of mono 
products, including the K600i, has continued 
to be the choice of many customers requiring 
high-speed, variable data over-printing in 
mailing, addressing, security and 
transactional applications. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 18
BUSINESS MODEL
The fundamentals of our business model are 
based on forging long-term relationships with 
customers, building an installed base of printers 
and providing consumables, spare parts and 
aftermarket services through the full lifecycle of 
their use. Our success is significantly influenced 
by our ability to provide solutions that optimise 
the total cost of ownership to our customers.
Once the product is installed, our ongoing aftermarket 
commitment provides a continuing revenue stream as 
we help our customers maintain optimum production 
efficiency through the life of the product to replacement. 
We are then well placed to support customers who invest 
in latest technology, often improving their production 
efficiency. This total lifetime commitment ensures long-
term customer relationships are equally beneficial to our 
customers and the Group’s profitability.

DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE 
OF THE BUSINESS
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
The Group operates its business 
worldwide. Our primary segmentation is 
by geography, in three principal regions – 
Europe, Americas, and Asia/Rest of world. 
We have a number of subsidiaries, with 
some undertaking product development 
and manufacturing, and others that  
are purely sales and service channels.  
In addition, a network of distributors 
represents us across approximately  
140 countries. Our distributors typically 
have the same operational characteristics 
as our wholly owned sales subsidiaries  
and many of them are entirely focused on 
the Group’s business in their designated 
geographic markets. 
Alongside the ‘Domino’ brand, which 
generates approximately 90 per cent of 
Group sales, we operate a number of 
specialist businesses selling under their own 
brands in particular market segments. 
Our core business is in coding and 
marking. We develop, manufacture and sell 
equipment, consumables and services to 
manufacturers who need to code, mark or 
print variable data on to their products or 
packaging. We are also developing a new 
business area in digital printing. In our case, 
digital printing involves using ink jet printing 
technology to print labels in their entirety 
or to overprint additional information 
where fast changeover times or some 
variability in image is required. The end 
users of digitally printed output are 
typically the same brand owners and 
manufacturers that are the Group’s coding 
and marking customers. 
The digital printing business is still a small 
percentage of Group turnover and is 
included as part of the total business within 
our primary geographic segmentation. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 20
EUROPE
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
In Europe, the Group operates direct sales businesses in the 
UK, France, Germany, Benelux, Spain and Portugal, and 
makes some direct sales in Switzerland and Sweden. 
Distributors cover other territories. 
Legislation and industry mandates remain 
key drivers of our customers’ investments. 
We enjoyed success in the European food 
and beverage sectors in 2014 as customers 
increasingly adopted product traceability 
solutions, and in the tobacco sector 
where product authentication is a key 
requirement. The latest legislation in the 
pharmaceutical sector, the Falsified 
Medicines Directive, requires unique 
identification codes to be added to each 
packet of drugs sold in Europe. This is 
attracting significant attention from 
manufacturers, who are required to 
comply fully by 2018. To date, we have 
completed a small number of installations 
meeting these needs and expect demand 
to increase from 2016. 
EUROPE 
• Strong revenue growth in many 
markets, assisted by a return of 
confidence in the early part of  
the year
• Increased sales of digital label 
presses, including repeat business 
with existing customers. 
OUR KEY GOALS IN EUROPE FOR 
2015 INCLUDE:
• Growth in new equipment sales 
• Full adoption of the Group’s  
latest i-Tech product range
• Increased penetration of the 
label printing market with the 
high-speed N610i seven-colour 
ink jet digital press.
HIGHLIGHTS
Will Edwards
European Sales 
Director
Western Europe is a more mature 
market for coding and marking with a large 
installed base of equipment, whereas many 
Eastern European economies continue to 
invest in new production capacity. 
Market conditions in many parts of 
Europe improved in the early part of 
2014 compared with the previous year. 
Increased confidence among some 
customers meant we secured a number 
of larger orders during the first half of 
our financial year. This position changed in 
the second half year, as political tensions 
re-emerged and economic news was less 
positive. Continuing low economic growth 
in many markets, including Germany, 
appears to have reduced confidence again 
and growth prospects in Europe for 2015 
are uncertain. STRATEGIC

Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 | 21
Europe is an important market for our 
digital printing business and we made 
good progress during the year, with both 
monochrome and full-colour web-based 
printing solutions. We established a new 
demonstration and laboratory facility at 
our headquarters near Cambridge in the 
UK, and expanded our manufacturing 
operations in Switzerland.
Thirteen full-colour digital label presses 
were sold in Europe during the year, to a 
mix of new and existing customers. There 
are clear signs that label printers and brand 
owners are seeing the benefit of digital 
label printing and we remain well placed to 
grow our business as adoption of digital 
printing technology increases. 
In line with our overall goals, our targets 
for Europe are to grow equipment sales 
volumes year on year and to increase our 
aftermarket revenues, as the installed base 
of equipment expands. We expect to see 
higher growth rates in Southern and 
Eastern Europe. 
In 2014, total sales revenue from customers 
located in Europe, when translated into 
sterling at average exchange rates, increased 
by 9 per cent compared with 2013. Revenue 
growth in local currency was 12 per cent, 
with equipment revenues growing by 19 per 
cent and aftermarket revenues increasing by 
6 per cent. Sales to customers located in 
Southern and Eastern Europe represented 
approximately 28 per cent of the total and 
grew by 1 1 per cent in local terms during 
the year.

translation of results.
We share profit between our manufacturing 
and sales businesses in line with normal 
arm’s-length rules. This means that regions 
such as Europe, where we undertake a 
significant proportion of our manufacturing, 
enjoy higher profit margins as a result 
of including the profits they make on 
inter-company sales to other regions. 
In 2014, the total segment result from 
subsidiary companies located in Europe 
was £59.6 million, an increase of 6 per cent 
on prior year (before exceptional items). 
This reflected strong volume growth 
coupled with robust pricing and a 
favourable sales mix.

market for our digital printing 
business and we made good 
progress during the year”.

AMERICAS
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
The Group has sales subsidiaries in Canada, 
the USA and Mexico, and sells through an 
extensive distribution network throughout 
Central and South America. 
The North American market is highly 
developed and contains many of the largest 
multinational manufacturing companies 
in the sectors we serve. Market drivers 
include legislation and industry mandates. 
In particular, adoption of the Food Safety 
Modernisation Act in the USA in 201 1 has 
increased demand for product traceability 
and authentication systems. 
Market conditions in North America were 
stable during 2014, while Central and South 
American markets remained difficult. 
Some of these markets recorded growth 
but some countries continue to be plagued 
by political, economic or fiscal issues. 
Our strategy in North America during 
2014 was to focus on larger opportunities 
in the food, beverage and pharmaceutical 
sectors and to invest to increase our digital 
printing capability. We were pleased to win 
large orders for our core ink jet and laser 
products with a number of major brand 
manufacturers. Our digital label press 
business has started to gain traction, with 
a further six full-colour presses sold in the 
US during the year. 
We have built a strong team to support 
our digital printing business in North 
America and we are investing to expand 
the digital printing demonstration and 
customer training areas at our US 
headquarters near Chicago.
As a part of simplifying our North 
American operations, we successfully 
integrated our Canadian and US businesses 
during 2014. We have retained field sales 
and service teams in Canada and a small 
office in Montreal, while combining the 
marketing, sales support and other back 
office functions into our US operations, 
improving efficiency and giving customers 
more comprehensive support. 
Revenue in North America grew by 5 per 
cent in local terms but decreased by 2 per 
cent when reported in sterling. Equipment 
revenue growth was 1 per cent and 
aftermarket revenues were 5 per cent 
higher, both in local terms. 
Our strategy in Central and South America 
is to focus on supporting and developing 
our distributor network, enabling sales to 
larger multinational accounts where global 
relationships are important. We do not 
compete for the very low price business 
that is prevalent in some countries. 
In sterling terms, our 2014 sales in Central 
and South America were £9.7 million, 
11 per cent below 2013. The decline in 
local currency was 7 per cent. Revenues 
declined significantly in some countries, 
such as Venezuela, where the political and 
fiscal position has made international trade 
very difficult. Revenues in Brazil, the largest 
market in South America, were similar to 
the prior year and remain depressed when 
compared with earlier years.

Average selling prices of equipment in China 
were affected during the first half of the year, 
as we responded to aggressive pricing from 
competitors, in particular through our local 
dealer network. Average prices stabilised 
at this lower level in the second half year. 
Retained customers are those who 
continue to buy consumables, spares 
and services from us after the original 
equipment sale. Customer retention 
rates are lower in Asia than elsewhere 
in the world and one of our priorities is 
to win back customers and increase our 
aftermarket sales. Retention rates were 
stable in 2014 compared to 2013.
Our strategy in Asia is to continue to 
expand our market coverage and further 
develop capabilities in our sales channels. 
This is underpinned by our direct operations 
in China, India and South Korea, where we 
maintain market-leading positions. Our 
extensive network of distributors provides

Demand for our products and services 
continues to grow across the region, 
as manufacturers invest to meet the 
requirements of a rapidly increasing 
consumer population. Legislation and 
industry mandates are broadly in line 
with Western equivalents and customer 
investment is often in new capacity as

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
This enables us to offer customers short 
lead times and to meet their specific 
requirements, despite supplying many 
product variants. 
Our process starts with product design, 
developing product platforms that use 
common parts and are easy to assemble. 
We need an engaged supply chain, with 
supplier partners undertaking a high 
degree of product integration. Our Group 
sourcing function therefore works closely 
with a relatively small but experienced 
supply base, to ensure high-quality, flexible 
and timely supply, alongside constant cost 
reduction. Our factories fulfil orders and 
ship to customers. 
The Group has manufacturing operations 
in Europe, America and Asia/ROW. The 
principal sites are in:
• Cambridge, UK, which is the main 
manufacturing hub for ink jet products;
• Liverpool, UK, and Gurnee, USA, which 
are our two main fluids manufacturing 
operations; and 
• New Delhi, India, and Shanghai, China.
We manufacture laser products in 
Hamburg, Germany, print and apply label 
machines in Malmo, Sweden, continuous 
ink jet printers in Texas, USA, and in 
Gottmadingen, Germany, fume extractors 
in Rotherham, UK, and digital label presses 
in Egliswil, Switzerland.
All our main production locations are 
accredited to the ISO9001 quality standard 
and the ISO14001 environmental standard. 
We maintain high standards of health and 
safety and our goal is for our entire network 
to achieve accreditation to the ISO18001 
occupational health and safety standard. 
Our Liverpool and Gurnee plants already 
hold that standard and we were pleased to 
gain accreditation at our Cambridge site 
during 2014.
In addition to plans for a new factory in 
China, the Group has planning permission 
for an extensive development and 
expansion at its headquarters in Cambridge. 
Initial ground work has started but we have 
not yet decided the timing of the full build. 
During 2014, our priorities included:
• Completing the new factory in India
• Expanding our digital label press 
manufacturing capacity and capability in 
Switzerland to meet expected demand 
for the next phase of growth
• Introducing a number of new hardware 
and fluids products 
• Rolling out a number of business 
process excellence initiatives across the 
Group network.
Risk management and disaster recovery 
planning in the supply chain is a priority 
for us and we regularly stress test our 
procedures. During the year, we suffered 
flash flooding at our main UK production 
site. Our disaster recovery process 
functioned well, with only two days’ 
production time lost and negligible 
disruption to our customers. The cost of 
recovery was not material to Group profits.
Our goals for 2015 include:
• Implementing standard processes and 
common IT systems across the network 
to improve efficiency and reduce costs
• Investing in new production capacity in 
China and the UK.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Each year, the Group invests approximately 
5 per cent of its revenues in research and 
development. One of our key priorities 
is to maintain a strong and innovative 
product range, which we build on through 
regular updates and improvements, as 
well as new products. In addition to our 
printers, we develop new fluids that 
perform better for end users, responding 
to their changing needs and developments 
in packaging materials. 
Our product creation process includes 
formal gates at each stage, from innovation 
through to commercialisation. This process 
improves predictability and reduces time 
to market. 
Our Group manufacturing 
strategy can be summarised 
as ‘make to order, ship direct 
to customer’. STRATEGIC

Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 | 25
We introduced a number of new printer 
and fluids products during the year, 
including variants of our continuous ink jet 
and thermal transfer printer ranges. In 
digital printing, we formally launched the 
seven-colour N610i digital label press. We 
introduced enhanced performance inks for 
our continuous ink jet and thermal ink jet 
products, extending the range of materials 
we can code on to. We also developed 
and launched our first water-based ink, for 
the K-Series monochrome digital press.
Priorities for 2015 include:
• Further investment in developing our 
coding and marking products, using 
common platform architecture
• Developing enhanced performance 
fluids products
• Working with partners to deploy 
next-generation print-head technology 
for digital press products. 
THE EMERGENCE OF DIGITAL PRINTING
Digital printing is an area of opportunity 
for us as manufacturers respond to the 
changing demands of consumers and society 
in general. Short print runs and the ability 
to personalise products and add variable 
data are helping brand owners to increase 
consumer choice while reducing production 
costs, environmental impacts and waste. 
This demand closely aligns with Domino’s 
core expertise in coding, marking and 
printing variable data at high speed on 
or near line, as an integral part of our 
customers’ production processes. 
In addition to monochrome overprinting, 
which is our core business, our customers 
are now deploying full-colour ink jet printing 
in a range of packaging, industrial and related 
areas. As the packaging and printing sectors 
are our biggest source of revenue, this is 
where we are focusing our development 
of digital printing.
Our K-Series monochrome presses are 
used to both overprint variable data onto 
pre-printed stock and for mailings, business 
forms and other printed matter. The 
N-Series full-colour press is focused on 
label printing. This typically involves printing 
high-quality images onto a variety of 
materials, which are then converted into 
labels and applied to packages during the 
production process. This application is 
adjacent to our core business but has the 
potential to overlap, by merging the printing 
of fixed and variable data directly onto 
labels or even packaging itself. 
Historically, package and label printing is an 
off-line activity, often done by converters 
who supply the brand owners. However, 
brand owners are increasingly interested in 
having their own digital printing capability. 
Over time, we expect to see some adopt 
this capability.
We introduced the N-Series digital press 
product in 2013 and recognised nine 
printers in revenue in that year. We were 
pleased to record 19 units in revenue in 
2014, with a further eight where we had 
started installation at year end or had 
customer commitments to install and 
recognise revenue during 2015. 
We have continued to invest in our 
digital printing skills and capabilities, both 
in our sales channels and in our product 
development, support and marketing 
areas. We manage the digital print business 
as an integral part of the Group, but with a 
dedicated team responsible for its strategy 
and direction. 
PEOPLE
The Group employs more than 2,300 
people worldwide. We seek to provide a 
safe and engaging environment for them, in 
which they can fully develop, achieve their 
potential and share in our success.
Our aim is to attract, develop, motivate 
and retain high-calibre people who 
contribute to the business. We do this 
by providing a competitive package of 
monetary and non-monetary rewards and 
benefits, which promotes team working 
across functions and geographies. 
We conduct employee engagement and 
management effectiveness surveys across 
the Group to find out how we are doing 
and how we can improve our staff’s 
working experience. In 2014, we 
responded to feedback by revising and 
reinvigorating The Domino Effect, a 
statement of our values, strategies and 
goals that cements the link between the 
individual’s role and our Group-level 
strategies and objectives. Recent feedback 
indicates that this has heightened our 
people’s sense of purpose. 
‘Performance plus’ is our web-based 
training system, which staff use to learn 
new skills and confirm their knowledge 
and understanding of compulsory subjects, 
such as health, safety and business ethics. 
In many of our operations, we support 
apprenticeship schemes and enable young 
people to gain experience in a wide variety 
of functions.
The working environment is important to 
the welfare of all our staff. During 2014, we 
invested further in our UK headquarters, 
improving laboratory and office space for 
our research and development teams and 
enhancing the environment, for example 
through energy efficient ‘daylight’ lighting. 
We maintained our good safety record 
during the year and continue to closely 
monitor accidents and near misses. 
We are committed to equality and 
diversity in our workforce and to providing 
equal opportunity for all. Across the 
Group, we employ people with a wide mix

Customers use our products in high 
throughput and often time-critical 
applications, which mean that reliability and 
production uptime are paramount for them. 
Any product failure can cause disruption to 
our customers, which in severe cases may 
result in lost production or spoilage. 
• Lost customers
• Damage to our brand 
• Additional cost and lost profit.
• We measure the quality and performance 
of all designs, during our product creation 
process 
• Post installation, we measure and monitor 
our products’ performance and have 
mechanisms to deal swiftly with any issues 
that customers experience
• We have customer and technical support 
teams worldwide, with highly trained and 
well equipped technicians to help 
customers resolve problems.

Maintaining product leadership requires 
significant ongoing investment in research  
and development. Developing new products 
involves risks, including failure to reach 
production, not achieving product 
performance requirements or the market 
being smaller than we expected. 
• Failure to achieve a return on investment
• Loss of market share
• Reduced sales, profits and cash flow.
• The Group has a well-established and 
proven product creation process, with 
rigorous stage-gate reviews and approvals. 
This involves detailed review of product 
specifications, business plans, risk 
assessments, systems design, development 
and pre-launch validation. We co-ordinate 
product launches and closely monitor the 
early-life technical and commercial 
performance of all new products.

Risk Impact Mitigation
5
As far as possible, the Group operates a 
dual-sourcing policy for critical components. 
In some cases, technological advances or 
supply capabilities mean we must rely on a 
single source. A number of Group suppliers 
are in Asia, resulting in lengthy supply chains 
and exposing us to potential disruption 
through supplier failure or transportation 
difficulties. Natural disasters could affect our 
ability to operate for an extended period. 
• Increased costs
• Longer lead times, resulting in lost sales
• Reduced profits and cash flow.
• Where alternative sources are not 
available or not approved, we hold buffer 
stocks to maintain supply through periods 
of reduced availability 
• We have business continuity and disaster 
recovery plans in all our manufacturing 
operations. These were tested and 
proven during 2014, when our main 
factory in Cambridge, UK, was flooded 
following exceptional weather. Our 
recovery process meant there was no 
material impact on customers
• The Group also has business 
interruption insurance.
6
Certain chemicals we use in our fluids 
products expose us to the often unique 
regulatory and legislative requirements of the 
many countries in which we sell. Chemicals 
that could come into contact with packaging 
are controlled and there are regular updates 
and exclusions from approved lists. While we 
can typically overcome these at a cost, by 
reformulating the product, in the worst case 
it could lead to product withdrawal, affecting 
supply to our customers.
• Disruption to supply and customer 
dissatisfaction
• Additional costs
• Reduced sales, profits and cash flow.
• Our regulatory affairs team monitors 
legislation and regulatory matters affecting 
the business and in particular the use of 
chemicals, including labelling and safety 
information requirements. We maintain a 
policy of strict compliance with mandated 
and best-practice use of chemicals 
• A number of our management and staff 
take part in industry and advisory bodies, 
giving us an overview of developments in 
this area.
7
The Group continues to invest in its digital 
printing business. This is a new market, which 
is developing as technology becomes capable 
of high-speed, high-quality, short-run printing. 
We expect the market to grow strongly over 
the next five years but those projections 
could overstate the opportunity in the short, 
medium or longer term. There is also a risk 
that we cannot capitalise on that 
market growth.
• Failure to achieve a return on investment
• Reduced prospects for sales and profit 
growth.
• We have invested considerable amounts 
in our digital printing business, to add 
skills, competencies, resources and the 
capacity for growth 
• We carefully monitor market trends and 
customer behaviour, and have set 
milestone sales targets to validate 
adoption rates 
• We continue to work with partners,  
to ensure we have access to the latest 
technology. Our association with industry 
bodies ensures we have the widest 
possible view of market developments. 
8
The Group sells in developed and developing 
economies worldwide, and is subject to 
changes in their economic or political 
situations. Typically, there are one or more 
countries in which local conditions make 
trading or payments more difficult. In 
isolation, these are manageable and are 
unlikely to be material to Group results. 
However, international sanctions or regional 
policies could affect our ability to sell 
our products. 
• Lost sales
• Bad debts
• Additional costs to overcome trade 
barriers.
• We maintain close contact with our sales 
businesses and distributors, so we can 
anticipate issues with importing goods or 
fiscal controls
• Our regulatory teams are able to respond 
quickly to changing compliance needs
• Where available, we maintain high-level 
insurance on distributor debt, in case of 
material default. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 30

MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
SALES GROWTH
Sales growth is a function of new 
equipment installations plus recurring 
revenues from consumables, spares and 
services. New equipment installations 
include replacement and new manufacturing 
capacity. New equipment volumes vary  
to some extent year to year, based on 
customer investment cycles and the 
general economic outlook. Recurring 
aftermarket revenues are typically stable 
and increase each year as the installed base 
of equipment grows. 
Our goal is continuous growth in sales 
confirming the effectiveness of our product 
strategy and the development of our 
channels to market.
In 2014, sales increased by 4 per cent on 
the prior year. New equipment revenues 
increased by 6 per cent, and aftermarket 
revenues by 3 per cent. 
Key financial indicators:
• Sales growth
• Gross margin rate
• Underlying operating return on sales
• Cash conversion (operating cash flow as 
a percentage of operating profit)
• Return on capital employed.
Non-financial indicators:
• Health and safety of staff (accident rates)
• Environmental impact (carbon emissions).
UNDERLYING OPERATING RETURN 
ON SALES
Underlying operating return on sales 
(operating returns) is operating profit 
before amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets, adjustments to contingent 
consideration and exceptional costs, as a 
percentage of sales. The long-term trend  
in operating returns is an indicator of our 
business efficiency, the effectiveness of  
our resource allocation and our direction. 
The business has high operational leverage 
and we aim to use that leverage to deliver 
strong profit growth from incremental 
sales growth. 
Our goal is to increase operating returns  
in the medium term, with an aspirational 
target of 20 per cent. 
Underlying operating returns in 2014 were 
16.3 per cent (2013: 15.7 per cent).
GROSS MARGIN RATE
Gross margin rate is gross profit before 
exceptional costs as a percentage of total 
sales. The Group operates in global 
markets, making sales in local currencies 
and sourcing components and sub-
assemblies in three continents. Gross 
margin rate is influenced by selling prices, 
input costs, absorption of overheads, sales 
mix and movements in exchange rates.
Our goal is to maintain a gross margin 
rate at or around 50 per cent through 
appropriate pricing, cost and 
business efficiency. 
Reported gross margin was 48.1 per cent 
in 2014, in line with 2013. The benefit of 
favourable movements in exchange rates 
was offset by sales mix and adverse pricing 
effects, primarily in developing markets in 
the first half year. 
The Board uses five key 
financial indicators and two 
non-financial indicators to 
monitor our progress with 
implementing our strategy.  STRATEGIC

CASH CONVERSION
Operating cash flow is net cash inflow 
from operating activities before exceptional 
items and taxation. This is measured as a 
percentage of operating profit before 
exceptional items. The Group has a track 
record of strong cash flow and we carefully 
monitor the rate at which we convert 
operating profit into cash. The key 
determinant of operating cash flow is 
working capital use, specifically inventory 
and receivables. 
Our target is to achieve a minimum of 
100 per cent conversion of operating profit 
into cash each year.
In 2014, operating cash flow was 117 per 
cent of operating profit. There were no 
exceptional items.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Return on capital employed is operating 
profit before exceptional items, as a 
percentage of total assets less current 
liabilities before contingent consideration 
on acquisitions. Contingent consideration 
depends on future performance. Our 
measure of capital use in the business 
focuses on the operating return generated 
from the total assets and current liabilities 
deployed. Cash and short-term debt or 
overdrafts are included in assets. 
Our target is a return on capital employed 
in excess of 20 per cent per annum.
In 2014, return on capital employed was 
24.6 per cent.
CARBON EMISSIONS
Baseline sites included all main factory 
operations and associated offices in 
Cambridge, UK, head office and 
manufacturing site; Liverpool, UK, fluids 
plant; Shanghai, China, manufacturing 
and sales office site; and Gurnee, USA, 
fluids plant. Recognising that as the Group 
expands we will potentially use more 
energy, we aim to deliver energy efficiency 
gains, to reduce our total carbon impact as 
measured by the volume of carbon dioxide 
emitted per square metre of space.
In 2014, our total emissions were 10,462 
tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (2013: 10,437 
tonnes) from a total of 67,307 square metres 
(2013: 63,659 square metres). This represents 
0.155 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent per square 
metre, compared with 0.164 tonnes in 2013. 
ACCIDENT RATES
The Group reports all accidents and 
incidents resulting in an injury, however 
minor. Our target is a continuous reduction 
in the number of accidents, through safe 
working practices and education.
The fluctuation year-on-year is relatively 
low. In 2014 the number of accidents 
resulting in injury decreased, continuing 
the trend of recent years.  | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 32
STRENGTHENING OUR FINANCIAL POSITION
FINANCIAL REVIEW
before exceptional costs). This reduction 
reflects timing differences in project spend 
which we expect to reverse during 2015. 
Operating profit before exceptional costs, 
reassessment of contingent consideration 
and the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets was £57.0 million, up 8 per cent 
(2013: £52.7 million).
OTHER NON-TRADING ITEMS
Provision for contingent consideration 
associated with acquisitions made in prior 
years has been reduced by £2.1 million. 
Provisions are based on our latest view of 
the likely outcome, taking into account the 
specific terms of earn-out arrangements. 
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
was £3.1 million (2013: £3.3 million).
INTEREST AND FINANCING COSTS
The Group remained in a net cash position 
throughout the year and managed its cash 
resources through a combination of interest 
bearing deposits and short-term debt 
facilities. Investment income was £1.2 million 
(2013: £1.1 million) and interest costs were 
£0.7 million (2013: £0.8 million). 
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
The Group reports both statutory and 
underlying measures of performance 
(see note 3). Profit before tax was 
£56.5 million (2013: £17.7 million). 
Underlying profit before tax increased 
by 9 per cent to £57.6 million (2013: 
£53.0 million). Underlying profit before 
tax is stated before exceptional items, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
adjustments to provisions for contingent 
consideration arising on acquisitions and 
non-cash interest charges derived from 
the accounting for discounted contingent 
consideration arising on acquisitions. 
TAXATION
The tax charge of £11.9 million reflects a 
one-off benefit of £1.4 million from the 
movement in deferred tax, as a result of 
Sales in 2014 were £350.2 million, 
reflecting year-on-year growth of 4 per 
cent. Acquisitions had no impact but 
exchange rate movements reduced 
reported results and had a substantial 
effect on sales growth, which was 9 per 
cent at constant exchange rates. 
Equipment revenue represented 43 per 
cent of Group sales and grew by 10 per 
cent in local terms. We recognised 19 
N-Series digital label presses in revenue 
during the year, compared with nine in 
2013. These machines command a 
considerably higher price than the 
coding and marking product range, and 
contributed £7 million to revenues 
compared with £3 million in 2013. This 
accounted for one fifth of the total 10 per 
cent growth in equipment sales. 
Consumable revenues, including fluids, 
increased by 7 per cent on prior year in 
local terms. Spares and service revenues 
also grew by 7 per cent. 
The gross margin rate was 48.1 per cent, in 
line with 2013. The sales mix, coupled with 
reduced margins on equipment sales, in 
particular in developing markets in the first 
half year, reduced the gross margin rate by 
nearly 1 percentage point. This was offset by 
the benefit to gross margin rate from the 
different impacts on revenue and cost of 
sales from movements in foreign exchange. 
Selling and distribution costs and 
administrative expenses were £93.2 
million, an increase of 4 per cent on the 
prior year (before exceptional costs). We 
have increased our investment in sales and 
support resources in the digital printing 
business and have seen a general increase 
in payroll costs, as a result of bonuses 
earned in the year. 
Investment in research and development 
was £18.2 million (2013: £19.5 million;

rate, excluding this and other prior year 
adjustments, was 25.1 per cent (2013: 25.7 
per cent). The Group benefited from 
reductions in the UK corporation tax rate 
during the year. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share were 39.79 pence 
(2013: 5.22 pence). Underlying earnings per 
share were 40.01 pence (2013: 35.30 
pence). Fully diluted earnings per share 
were 39.46 pence (2013: 5.18 pence), on a 
weighted average number of shares in issue 
of 113,065,499.
DIVIDENDS
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 14.76 pence which when added to the 
interim dividend of 7.98 pence gives a total 
dividend for the year of 22.74 pence per 
share. The dividend is covered 1.8 times by 
underlying earnings per share. The value of 
dividends paid during the year represented 
47 per cent of net cash inflow from 
operating activities (2013: 55 per cent).
CASH
Net cash inflow from operating activities 
before taxation was £65.8 million (2013: 
£54.9 million). The net favourable working 
capital movement, after the impact of 
exchange rates, was £0.7 million. 
Inventories increased in line with 
production volumes. Trade debtors, 
excluding the impact of exchange rate 
movements, increased in line with sales. 
These movements were more than offset 
by the increase in creditors, which included 
the impact of accrued bonus payments. 
We invested £12.5 million (2013: £9.1 
million) in fixed assets in the year, including 
£2.3 million to buy land in preparation for 
building additional factory space in 
Cambridge, UK. The Group balance sheet 
reflects an investment in printers that are 
subject to lease arrangements with 
customers. These are treated as fixed 
assets and amortised over their useful lives. 
Additions of £2.1 million of these assets 
were made during the year, increasing our 
gross investment to £10 million. The net 
book value at 31 October 2014 was £4.6 
million, an increase of £1.3 million in 
the year.  STRATEGIC

million in the year. 
Gross cash at the year end was £40.5 
million. Net cash, after taking into account 
a small loan on property in South Korea, 
was £40.1 million.
NET ASSETS
Net assets at the year end totalled 
£212.2 million (2013: £198.4 million). 
TREASURY 
The Group is exposed to interest rate 
movements and to changes in the value 
of sterling relative to a number of foreign 
currencies. Our policy is to manage these 
exposures in a way that provides certainty 
on a transaction basis in the short term, 
while guarding against any speculation. We 
place surplus cash on short-term deposit 
with approved banks, with limits on the 
amount of exposure to any individual bank. 
Bank debt is primarily short term, with 
drawdown renewed as required. This has 
proven to be cost effective and has 
enabled us to take advantage of higher 
deposit rates in some jurisdictions. 
The Group has a £50 million revolving 
credit facility with the Royal Bank of 
Scotland, which is committed until 30 
November 2016. This is adequate to meet 
our expected working capital requirements.
We make sales and receive income 
in a range of currencies. We manage 
transactional exposure where possible 
by using simple forward contracts, which 
means selling or buying currency based on 
our expected net cash inflows or outflows 
on a rolling three or 12-month basis. Our 
main exposures are to the US dollar and the 
euro, both of which we sell forward, aiming 
to cover 90 per cent of our exposure over a 
rolling 12-month period. During the year, 
the Chinese government continued to 
support the internationalisation of the 
renminbi (Chinese Yuan). We have started 
using renminbi contracts on a rolling 
three-month basis and expect to extend 
this towards a full 12 months, as we gain 
experience in that market. Other material 
exposures include the Indian rupee. We 
currently have no plans to take a forward 
position in this currency.
Forward contracts maturing during the 
year reduced net sterling receipts by £0.3 
million, when compared with the prevailing 
rate in the prior year. Contracts in place 
covering expected cash flows in 2015 will 
realise net losses of £1.1 million, when 
compared with 2014 rates.
We do not hedge translation effects on 
reported profits in the income statement. 
In 2014, the impact of exchange rate 
movements on translation of overseas 
profits and short-term balances held by 
Group subsidiaries in non-functional 
currencies reduced reported profits by 
£0.2 million. Similarly, we do not hedge 
Group investments denominated in foreign 
currencies in the balance sheet. In 2014, 
this resulted in a decrease in reserves of 
£8.3 million. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 34

COMMITMENT TO REPORTING
Sustainability is as important to our 
stakeholders as it is to us, so we strive 
to continually improve our corporate 
responsibility reporting, so all our 
stakeholders can see how we are doing. 
We were delighted that our efforts were 
recognised this year by meeting the new,

sixth consecutive year of membership.
PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
We work to establish an environmental 
leadership position with our printers, by 
developing resource-efficient technologies 
that reduce energy use, waste and emissions 
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
This year, we made further advances in 
the design of our revolutionary A420i 
continuous ink jet printer. These changes 
reduced both make up and ink use – the 
main sources of VOC emissions during 
coding – by 50 per cent. In addition, the 
printer’s reduced service routine will cut 
our service engineers’ travel by up to 
1.2 million miles a year, as our installed

base increases. We were delighted that 
the Green Organisation recognised these 
innovations by giving us a Green Apple 
award for environmental best practice.
Our V-Series printers provide excellent 
environmental efficiency, by using up to 
60 per cent less ribbon than competitors’ 
printers and not requiring an additional 
compressed air power source. In addition, 
the smart power saving mode we designed 
ensures that during operation, the printer 
consumes at least 15 per cent less power 
than equivalent products. 
In designing our next generation of 
continuous ink jet printers, we are using a 
Life Cycle Analysis tool. This gives us insight 
into the impact of changes to product 
architecture, at the earliest stage of 
research and development.
The European Printing Ink Association 
(EuPIA) is a division of CEPE, an industry 
body for manufacturers of paints, printing 
inks and artists’ colours. We are the only 
coding and marking business that is a 
member of CEPE and we have signed up 
to EuPIA’s exclusion list, which is a list of 
raw materials that signatories voluntarily 
exclude from their printing inks. As such, 
we formulate our ink products with safety 
in mind and can reassure our customers 
that our inks offer leading performance in 
their composition and safety. 
We operate in global markets, with 
our operations covering 16 countries 
and our value chain reaching to more than 
140. We continue our drive to progress 
sustainability throughout our supply chain. 
As part of this, we launched this year the 
Domino Supplier Code. The Code is 
founded on the UN Global Compact and 
mandates the minimum ethical, labour, 
health and safety, and environmental 
standards we expect our suppliers to 
meet. The Code can be downloaded from 
our website, www.domino-printing.com.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
CUSTOMER FIRST
We actively seek our customers’ views and 
welcome their interest in our operations, 
by responding to many questionnaires and 
audit requests each year. We are always 
pleased to host customer visits to our 
global operations.
We motivate our staff to provide 
exemplary service. Our Group Training 
Academy ensures our global engineers are 
always up to date on our products’ latest 
enhancements and new features. We 
employ learning technologies to run virtual 
training sessions that reach all corners of 
the world, without the need for travel. 
During the year, we delivered over 30 
virtual sessions, engaging more than 300 
engineers in more than 40 countries. 
Coding and marking technologies play a 
crucial role in supporting national and 
international efforts to protect consumer 
health and tackle counterfeiting. Our 
reputation as experts in the field has led to 
governments, manufacturers and industry 
bodies around the world inviting us to advise 
on how to better identify products and 
enable authentication for a safer supply chain. 
For instance, we have been closely involved 
in developing measures to improve patient 
safety through pharmaceutical coding. 
BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
We are committed to positive action in 
pursuit of sustainability. Our Corporate 
Responsibility Policy, which we established 
in 2011, provides the framework by which 
we set environmental and ethical standards 
for every business and channel in our 
Group. Our Board receives quarterly 
reports on our performance and 
compliance with these standards.

Note: This footprint is a report on all of the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. We have reported on 97 per cent of the Group by staff head count. The remaining 3 per 
cent of staff are distributed across 36 small sites which, due to their small size and the low energy intensity of their activities, are 
not significant to our footprint. The sources reported are under our operational control. We have used the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol methodology for compiling our greenhouse gas data. 
We work hard to improve the breadth 
and depth of our understanding about our 
environmental and social performance and 
report on several indicators which can be 
viewed on our website. We have had ISO 
14001 certification at all our ink plants for 
over 10 years. This year we asked external 
auditors to conduct social audits (SMETA 
pillar 4) at our manufacturing sites in the 
UK, Germany and China, which confirmed 
that we are demonstrating excellent ethical 
standards in our operations. We also 
completed our fourth year of reporting to 
the Carbon Disclosure Project. We were 
particularly pleased to have increased our 
reporting score again, from 74C in 2013 to 
81B in 2014.
Since 2011, we have measured our 
greenhouse gas emissions at our four 
largest manufacturing sites
1
. This year, we 
improved our data collection methodology 
and reassessed our previous data. As a 
result, we have seen a 7 per cent decrease 
in our emissions from the 2011 baseline. 
We also measure the greenhouse 
gas footprint of the entire Group and 
have similarly reassessed this, using our 
improved data collection methodology. 
This year, our footprint was 10,462 tonnes 
of CO
2
 equivalent, a 0.2 per cent increase 
on last year’s total emissions. However our 
objective was to reduce our emissions 
relative to our floorspace by 3 per cent. 
We achieved a 5 per cent decrease. 
We have also continued to improve 
our recycling initiatives. Our total waste 
tonnage was 1,530 tonnes across the 
Group, of which 47 per cent was recycled 
in comparison to 1,444 tonnes and 40 per 
cent recycled in 2013.
The health and safety of our staff, 
contractors and visitors is of paramount 
importance to us. We have OHSAS 18001 
at all our ink plants and our Cambridge 
HQ and manufacturing site. Our objective 
is to continue to reduce the number of 
accidents across the Group. We support 
this continual improvement by assessing 
procedures and performance in all our 
sales channels and business units each year. 
We expect and encourage staff to be 
proactive on health and safety issues and 
The Group is committed to 
protecting internationally proclaimed 
human rights throughout our value 
chain. We base our actions on the 
UN Declaration of Human Rights 
and the UN Convention Against 
Corruption. The most significant 
human rights impacts for our 
business are:
• respecting the diversity of our 
staff and customers and looking 
after their health and safety;
• ensuring our suppliers respect 
the rights of their staff;
• contributing positively to the 
wellbeing of the communities 
in which we operate; and 
• maintaining a firm stance 
against corruption.

provided more than 6,100 hours of health 
and safety training this year. As a result, our 
accidents reduced to 73 this year in 
comparison to 104 last year. This is an 
average of 0.032 accidents per person.
In addition to formal health and safety 
systems, we have run anti-smoking and 
weight loss campaigns and provided 
opportunities to engage in sports activities.
We take a zero-tolerance approach 
to corruption. We require that all our 
employees, agents and business partners 
demonstrate the highest standards of 
professionalism, fairness and integrity when 
conducting business on our behalf. We do 
not make any contributions to political 
parties and our charitable donations 
are not made to gain any commercial 
advantage. This year, all our staff have 
undertaken training to refresh their 
knowledge of anti-corruption legislation 
and confirm their commitment to 
Domino’s standards.
CULTURE AND PEOPLE
Domino is its employees. Our highly 
skilled and motivated employees drive the 
success of the business. We aim to employ 
a workforce that reflects the diversity of 
our customers and the communities we 
operate in. 
We maintain an environment where 
all employees can develop to their full 
potential and advance their careers. Across 
the Group this year, we delivered more 
than 31,000 hours of formal training to our 
staff, an average of 13 hours per person. In 
addition, we provide many opportunities 
to develop on-the-job skills. For instance, 
this year our Digital Printing team worked 
with a leading professor of colour imaging, 
to support their professional development 
and enhance their skills in this area. 
Through our quarterly National Employee 
Council meetings, we ensure open 
discussion with our employees on the status 
of all areas of our operations. In addition, we 
run internal surveys annually to find out 
how employees view group management. 
As a result, we know that we continue to 
achieve high levels of staff satisfaction with 
the support and communication they 
receive from their managers.
Our employee benefits package is designed 
to respond to staff needs at every stage of 
their working life. We also provide many 
opportunities to socialise and team build. 
For example, Domino France staged a 
‘country lunch’ for all employees to share, 
Domino China held an open day for our 
employees’ families to visit the factory and 
join in games and lunch together, and in the 
UK our social club has staged 23 events for 
staff and their families. As a result of our 
efforts to be an excellent employer, we 
were proud to offer long-service awards to 
715 staff across the Group, for 10 years or 
more service.
We work best as a business when we 
work with our local communities. As well as 
creating local jobs, we have apprenticeship 
schemes, we offer work experience 
placements for local studentsand we engage 
with educational initiatives to promote 
science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics to young people. 
We also take great pleasure in our ties 
with charities in our communities. For 
example, during 2014:
• Domino China supported a number of 
initiatives working with disabled people;
• Domino India made donations and 
dedicated staff time to support a 
local orphanage;
• Domino Germany donated their old 
laptops to a local school; and
• Domino France sponsored a 
community disabled basketball team. 
We also encourage staff to become 
involved in charitable activities and 
fundraising by matching their funds, 
and allowing them to nominate which 
organisations the Group supports. This 
year, our business donated more than 
£50,000 to charitable causes, with a 
further £21,000 donated by our staff. 
Domino UK has fielded a team in the 
London to Cambridge charity bike ride for 
seven consecutive years and this year one 
of our colleagues swam across 
Windermere, England’s largest natural lake. 
While a team of runners from Domino 
Laser entered a relay race to raise money 
for city forests. 
Our dedication to sustainability is driving 
us to achieve the best in all areas of our 
business. We are committed for the long 
term to operate our business according to 
a strong set of values and ethical practices. 
We know that by making unrelenting 
efforts to improve our performance, we 
are enhancing our business for the benefit 
of all our stakeholders.
Our new Indian factory was designed 
with energy efficiency in mind. By 
making the most of natural daylight, 
we should have no need for electric 
lighting during the day, and fresh air 
ventilation is improving the working 
environment while reducing the need 
for air conditioning. The Domino 
India team is very proud of the new 
building and has applied to the Indian 
Building Council for Green 
Factory certification.

CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
We remain committed to 
achieving high standards of 
corporate governance and 
we have established policies 
and procedures which are 
designed to facilitate good 
governance in a practical 
and workable way. 
We are very pleased to welcome Sucheta Govil and Rachel Hurst 
who were both appointed to the Board on 25 November 2014. 
They will bring a new perspective and valuable experience. Sucheta 
Govil has a wide knowledge of international business, particularly in 
Asia, the Middle East and Africa, the regions which provide exciting 
growth opportunities for Domino. Rachel Hurst has a broad 
understanding of all aspects of the Group’s operations gained during 
her 24 years with the Company. She has been instrumental in the 
development of Domino’s global manufacturing capability.
The reports on the following pages explain our governance 
arrangements in more detail and describe how we have applied 
the principles of corporate governance contained in the Code 
which applies for the year under review.
We have considered the new Corporate Governance Code 
2014 which applies to financial years ending after 1 October 2014 
and we have, where we considered it necessary, revised our 
arrangements to ensure compliance with this new code for the 
current year.

Except as stated in the section on dialogue with shareholders, the 
Company has, throughout the year, been in compliance with the 
Code Provisions and has applied the principles set out in the Code. 
An explanation of how the principles have been applied is set out 
in this report and in the reports of the Committees. STRATEGIC

BOARD OVERVIEW
The aim of the Board is to promote the long-term success of the 
Company. It is responsible for creating a framework of strategy and 
controls within which the Company operates. The Board takes 
account of the impact of its decisions not only on shareholders but 
also on a wider group of interested parties including employees and 
local communities. The Board is responsible for monitoring the 
implementation of strategy by the management team.
A number of key items are specifically reserved for the Board’s 
approval. For example, budgets, major acquisitions and significant 
new product programmes. Other matters are delegated to the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. There are 
terms of reference for each of these Committees which specify 
their responsibilities which are available on the Company’s website.
BOARD MEMBERSHIP 
Information about the Directors is given on page 39. 
Attendance
All Directors attended each Board meeting
THE CHAIRMAN
The role of the Chairman is to provide leadership to the Board 
and to ensure that the Board and its Committees operate 
effectively. He sets the agenda for Board meetings and chairs 
the meetings to facilitate open and constructive debate.
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the business and for the development of strategy 
for approval by the Board. 
There is a formal document agreed by the Board setting out the 
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer.
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
The role of the Senior Independent Director is to act as a 
sounding board to the Chairman and to provide an additional 
point of contact for shareholders. He acts as an intermediary for 
other Directors and is responsible for the evaluation of the 
performance of the Chairman.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The non-executive Directors have a wide range of senior level, 
international skills and experience. Details of their background are 
given on page 39. Their role is to provide an independent element 
to the Board and to constructively challenge management. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 42
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
INDEPENDENCE OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board has reviewed the independence of the non-executive 
Directors and concluded that they are independent. The review 
took into account the results of the performance evaluation 
together with the factors listed in the Code.
The Board believes that to be judged independent each Director:
• should be free from any relationship or connection which could 
affect his ability to discharge his responsibilities impartially; and
• should have demonstrated a scrupulously independent 
approach by conducting himself impartially in all matters relating 
to the Group and by challenging the views of management and 
other Board members in a robust and constructive manner.
TIME COMMITMENT
The non-executive Directors are expected to spend 
approximately 20 days per year on Domino business. This includes 
attendance at Board and Committee meetings, preparation for the 
meetings and the provision of advice and assistance to the 
Company outside of the Board and Committee meetings.
BOARD MEETINGS
There are regular scheduled Board and Committee meetings 
throughout the year and ad hoc meetings may be held as 
necessary. This year there were eight Board meetings including a 
two-day strategy meeting and a further two day meeting in 
October to review the budget and strategic issues.
There is an annual work plan which lists the recurring items to be 
dealt with at each scheduled Board and Committee meeting.
BOARD PAPERS
The Directors receive detailed Board papers in advance of each 
meeting. These include routine reports on the performance of the 
business and on any matters for Board decision. Standard formats 
have been developed for the reports to make it easy to track 
progress against targets and identify key facts. In addition to 
written reports, presentations are also given to the Board.
T opics of some of the presentations given to the 
Board during the year:
• Health & Safety
• UK business
• New product launches
A detailed agenda is prepared for each meeting to make sure there 
is sufficient time allocated to deal with all issues. The Chairman and 
non-executive Directors generally meet before the Board meeting 
to discuss significant agenda items.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company has adopted and followed a procedure under which 
Directors must declare actual or potential conflicts of interest as 
they arise. The Board reviews potential conflict of interest situations 
arising from other posts held by Directors on an annual basis.
During the year authorisation has been given for potential conflicts 
arising as a consequence of other positions held by some Directors. 
No actual conflicts of interest arising in respect of specific 
arrangements or transactions have been declared to the Board.
In determining whether to authorise conflicts of interest, only 
those Directors who have no interest in the matter may make the 
decision and they must act in good faith in the manner most likely 
to promote the Company's success.
DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company actively seeks to enter into a dialogue with 
institutional shareholders and holds regular meetings with them 
both in the UK and in the US and Europe. This year an open day 
was held for fund managers and analysts at which presentations 
were given by senior managers and the Company’s new N610i 
digital printer was demonstrated.
In order to assist non-executive Directors to develop an 
understanding of the views of major shareholders, reports are 
made of meetings with such shareholders. Although Sir Mark 
Wrightson, the Senior Independent Director, has been available to 
attend meetings with shareholders as suggested by Code provision 
E1.1 no meetings have been requested by shareholders. The Board 
considers that Sir Mark has a good understanding of the issues and 
concerns of major shareholders.
The Annual General Meeting is used as an opportunity for 
communication with private shareholders. All the Directors attend 
the meeting and are available to answer questions. Time is set 
aside after the formal business of the AGM for shareholders to 
talk informally with the Directors.
AGM 2014
2014 AGM held on 19 March 2014 at Domino's offices in 
Bar Hill, Cambridge.
All resolutions passed. 
High level of voting (up to 86% of the issued share capital).
All Directors were re-elected to the Board with at least 92% of 
the votes cast in favour.
FINANCIAL CONTROL
The key internal financial controls that were in operation during 
the year were:
FINANCIAL REPORTING
All operating units complete business plans and budgets for the 
year. Each month, the unit produces written reports in a defined 
format on its performance against these plans and provides 
updated business forecasts. The reports and forecasts are 
reviewed by the executive Directors and significant issues are 
reported to the Board. STRATEGIC

STATEMENTS
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 | 43
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
The Company has written accounting policies and procedures. 
Local management are required to provide written confirmation  
of compliance with the policies and procedures. There is a formal 
internal audit process which seeks to verify that policies and 
procedures have been correctly applied and to confirm that there 
is an effective process of management and control within the 
business. Internal audits are carried out by suitably qualified and 
experienced staff that have no current connection with the 
operation being audited.
SECURITY OF THE GROUP'S COMPUTER SYSTEMS
The Group relies on financial and management information 
processed by, and stored on, computer systems. Controls and 
procedures have been established to endeavour to protect the 
security and integrity of data held on the system, with standby 
arrangements in the event of failure of a major system. Tests are 
conducted on an annual basis to assess the security of the systems. 
This year there has been a particular focus on cyber security and a 
presentation was made to the full Board on this issue.
TREASURY
The treasury function operates under guidelines approved by 
the Board and regular reports are made to the Board on 
treasury activities.
CAPITAL INVESTMENT
The Company has defined procedures for the review and control 
of capital expenditure. Expenditure requires different levels of 
approval according to the amount. Significant expenditure requires 
full Board approval and all approval requests are presented in a 
defined format to ensure that full justification is provided.
OPERATIONAL CONTROLS
All Domino businesses are required to operate in accordance with 
detailed standards and procedures which cover all material aspects 
of their operations. Compliance with these standards is subject to 
assessment by internal and external review.
There have been no significant control failures during the year.
COMPLIANCE
There is a Group policy on standards of conduct and business 
ethics and a separate anti-bribery policy. Both documents are 
available on the website.
There is a schedule of delegated authority designed to ensure that 
all material transactions are considered at the appropriate level 
within the Group and are subject to review by the head office legal 
department. All subsidiaries have access to local lawyers and the 
head office legal department.
RISK MANAGEMENT
There is a risk management sub-committee chaired by Andrew 
Herbert, the Chief Financial Officer, which meets at least quarterly. 
The role of the subcommittee is to:
• promote effective identification and management of risk 
throughout the Group;
• maintain a risk register identifying significant risks, risk control 
measures and responsibility for control measures:
• review and confirm that all significant risks have been identified 
and suitable control measures adopted;
• monitor implementation of risk control measures for all 
significant risks; and
• ensure all subsidiaries operate an effective risk management 
process.
The risk management sub-committee receives presentations on 
topics selected by it.
Some of the topics considered by the sub-committee 
during the year:
• Digital Printing
• Research and development
A senior manager is given responsibility for devising and 
implementing control measures for each significant risk. The 
manager is required to provide a quarterly report to the sub-
committee on the status of implementation of control measures  
to manage that risk.
The sub-committee reports to the executive management 
committee which in turn reports to the Board. A formal risk 
management review of subsidiaries is conducted as part of the 
internal audit programme. Monthly reports to the executive 
Directors submitted by subsidiaries and business units cover risk 
control issues relevant to the particular subsidiary or business unit.
Internal control and compliance statement
The Directors acknowledge their overall responsibility for the 
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
They have established a system that is designed to provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss and to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. There is a continuing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks 
faced by the Group that has been in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of the annual report. The 
process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the 
revised Turnbull guidance. Steps continue to be taken to embed 
internal control further into the operations of the business and 
to deal with any issues that come to the Board’s attention. The 
Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of 
internal control. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 44
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
I am pleased to present the 
Audit Committee's report 
describing our work during 
the past year.
Membership
Sir Mark Wrightson (Chairman and member with financial 
experience), Chris Brinsmead and Sir David Brown.
Key responsibilities
• The integrity of the financial statements
• Audit arrangements
• Review of internal controls and risk management

Attendance
All Committee members attended each meeting.
AUDIT PLANNING
The Committee oversees the plans for the audit to ensure it is 
comprehensive, risk based and cost effective.
As in previous years, Deloitte drafted an initial audit plan in 
conjunction with executive management and presented it for 
review by the Committee. The plan described the proposed  
scope of the work and the approach to be taken. It also proposed 
the materiality levels to be used based on forecast profit. This year 
the materiality level has been reduced to take account of changes 
in the audit approach and the Financial Reporting Council’s review 
of materiality.
In order to focus the audit work on the right areas, the auditor 
identified particular risk issues based on its knowledge of the 
business and operating environment, discussions with management 
and the half year review. 
REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDIT FINDINGS 
The Committee reviewed the full and half year financial statements 
and the report of the auditors on these statements. The Deloitte 
partner responsible for the Domino audit attended the Audit 
Committee meetings to present the reports and answer questions 
from Committee members. Senior Deloitte staff who have had 
day-to-day involvement in the conduct of the audit also attend.
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee's report describing 
our work during the past year. Stuart Henderson, the Deloitte 
engagement partner, will stand down this year under the normal 
rotation arrangements. This provides a convenient point to review 
our audit arrangements and, as previously announced, we have 
started an audit tender process. We expect to make a final decision 
on auditor appointment in March 2015. We view selection of the 
right firm of auditors as an essential part of the governance process 
and we have planned to devote significant time to a thorough 
selection programme. The section in this report on audit tender 
describes the programme in more detail.  STRATEGIC

The Committee considered the following significant issues:
Issue Assessment
Goodwill and other 
intangibles
The assessment of goodwill for 
impairment continues to be a key 
area of management judgement.  
The Committee addressed this 
matter by reviewing the assumptions 
underlying these judgements and 
considering the advice of the auditor 
on their validity.
Valuation of contingent 
consideration in respect of 
acquired businesses
The valuation of contingent 
consideration requires assumptions 
to be made about the expected 
future results of the acquired 
businesses. The Committee reviews 
these assumptions. This is also an 
area of focus for the auditor and the 
Committee receives detailed reports 
from the auditor.
Revenue recognition Management judgement has to be 
applied in some cases to determine 
the point at which revenue on a sale 
is recognised. The issue is particularly 
relevant to N-Series digital printing 
sales which are comparatively high 
value and may have a protracted 
installation process. Revenue 
recognition is an area of focus for  
the audit and Deloitte carried out 
detailed testing and provided a 
report on this issue to the 
Committee.
Inventory held in Graph-
Tech
Graph-Tech AG was acquired in 
2012 and has built up significant 
inventory holdings for the 
manufacture of digital printers. 
Deloitte’s Swiss team has checked 
the quantity and valuation of 
inventory and the Committee has 
reviewed their findings.
The Committee has reviewed the annual report and accounts  
to ensure that they are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess  
the Company's performance, business model and strategy. The 
Committee considers whether the report contains sufficient 
information to enable shareholders to make this assessment.  
It also considers whether the information is presented in a 
comprehensible and balanced manner and that sufficient 
prominence is given to critical issues. 
ASSESSMENT OF AUDITOR
The Committee is required to assess the qualifications, expertise, 
resources and independence of the external auditor and the 
objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process. This assessment 
was carried out during the year on the basis of the Committee's 
own appraisal of the performance of the auditor and the views of 
the senior management team as well as consideration of materials 
provided by the auditor. The criteria used for this assessment 
remained unchanged from last year and were as follows:
• delivery of a thorough and efficient global audit in compliance 
with the agreed plan and timescales;
• provision of accurate, robust and perceptive advice on key 
accounting and audit judgements, technical issues and best 
practice;
• a high level of professionalism and technical expertise 
consistently demonstrated by all audit staff;
• maintenance of continuity within the core audit team; and
• strict adherence to independence policies and other regulatory 
requirements.
INDEPENDENCE OF AUDITOR 
The Committee monitors arrangements to ensure that the 
partner in charge of the audit is changed every five years and that 
the relationship between the auditor and management does not 
affect the auditor’s independence.
The Committee is responsible for devising and maintaining a policy 
for the engagement of the auditor to provide non-audit services. In 
order to seek to minimise any potential impairment of the auditor’s 
independence, the Company’s policy is that, except for tax 
compliance and acquisition due diligence work, the auditor will not 
be engaged to provide non-audit services without the consent of 
the Committee. The Committee considers that it is cost effective  
to use the auditors for tax and due diligence work because of its 
expertise in these areas coupled with in-depth knowledge of 
the business.
During the year Deloitte has provided the following 
non-audit services:
• audit related assurance services; and
• taxation compliance services. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 46
None of this work was carried out on a contingency fee basis.
The Committee considered the nature of the potential threat to 
independence posed by the provision of non-audit services and 
the safeguards applied. It concluded that the non-audit work 
undertaken by the auditor did not impair independence.

self-interest threat
The teams

advisory work and

INTERNAL AUDIT
The Group has an internal audit process where trained finance staff 
unconnected with the entity being audited carry out internal audits 
according to defined procedures. The procedures were revised 
during the year with the aim of ensuring resources are deployed as 
effectively as possible. Under the revised arrangements the Group 
Finance Controller, who heads the internal audit function, compiles  
a list of areas to be audited based on a risk assessment and 
determines the type of audit to be conducted. Full audits, self-audits 
and self-certifications may be used. The proposed schedule of audits 
is subject to approval by the Audit Committee.
The Committee receives reports on audits conducted which 
include a list of the outstanding points raised by the audits. 
Summaries of internal audit reports were circulated to all 
Committee members and full reports were available on request.
The Group Financial Controller has a direct reporting line to the 
Chairman of the Committee. The Group Financial Controller is 
required to meet with the Committee at least once a year without 
the executive Directors being present.
RISK MANAGEMENT REVIEW
The Committee reviewed the scope and effectiveness of systems 
to identify and address financial and non-financial risk. The review 
was based on the report of the Risk Management Committee 
which identified the key risks, risk control measures and the 
implementation status of risk control measures. The report was 
presented to the Committee by the Chief Financial Officer who 
also chairs the Risk Management Committee. The report on page 
26 provides further information on the risk management process.
WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the Group 
whistleblowing policy. There is a dedicated e-mail address which 
enables staff anywhere in the Group to raise issues directly with 
head office. E-mails sent to this address are initially received by the 
Group HR Director and the Company Secretary and investigated 
appropriately. Any concerns raised are reported to the Audit 
Committee.
MEETINGS
The Committee met three times during the year and all Committee 
members attended each meeting. Representatives of the auditor 
including the partner responsible for the Domino audit also 
attended each meeting. The executive Directors are invited to 
attend the meetings. At two meetings the Committee arranged  
to speak with the auditor without the executive Directors being 
present and on one occasion the Committee met with the Group 
Financial Controller without the executive Directors being present.
The following table lists the standing agenda items which have 
been dealt with by the Committee.
Meeting date Standing agenda items
June • Review half year interim statement 
before consideration by the Board.

AUDIT TENDER
Deloitte has been the Company's auditor since 1993 and there 
has been no tender held for audit services during that time. The 
Committee considers that the auditor's knowledge of the Group's 
business and systems gained through experience has significantly 
contributed to the rigour and effectiveness of the audit process. 
However, as previously reported the Committee intends to comply 
fully with the FRC Audit Committees Guidance regarding the 
frequency of audit tender and has started an audit tender process.
Auditor selection will be made by the full Board and the Group 
Financial Controller. Specific criteria have been defined and each 
tenderer will be assessed against these criteria.
This selection process is expected to be completed in March 2015. 
Therefore, in the notice for the AGM in 2015, Deloitte, as the 
incumbent auditor, will be proposed for reappointment. If Deloitte 
is not successful in the tender process it will resign and the 
successful firm will be appointed by the Directors so that it is in 
position to carry out audit services for the 2015 financial year.  
The successful firm will then be proposed for reappointment by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2016.
TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Committee keeps its terms of reference under review  
and makes recommendations for changes to the Board.  
The full terms of reference are available on Domino's website  
at www.domino-printing-sciences.com.

Membership and attendance
Peter Byrom (Chairman), Nigel Bond, Chris Brinsmead, 
Sir David Brown, Sir Mark Wrightson.
The Committee met four times in the year.
All members then in office attended all of the meetings with the 
exception of Sir Mark Wrightson who attended three meetings.
Key responsibilities
• Monitor the composition and performance of the Board and 
its committees
• Evaluate the balance of skills and experience on the Board and 
the diversity of its members
• Monitor executive development and succession planning
• Evaluate the independence of the non-executive Directors and 
their time commitments.
During the year the Committee continued to develop its 
succession plans for both the executive team and for the non-
executive Directors taking into account their respective tenures 
of office and analysing current or anticipated gaps in skills or 
experience. We will continue to appoint the best candidates but 
with an emphasis on recruiting candidates from a more diverse 
background and with international experience.
Since the end of the year the Board has been bolstered by the 
appointment of Sucheta Govil as a non-executive Director. 
Sucheta has extensive sales and marketing experience, particularly 
in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Her biography can be 
found on page 39.
Odgers Berndtson was engaged for Sucheta’s appointment. 
The firm has no other connection with the Company.
Also since the year-end the Board has appointed Rachel Hurst, 
Group Operations Director, as an executive Director. Rachel has 
24 years’ experience with the Company and during this time has 
gained a detailed understanding of all aspects of the Group’s 
operations and has been instrumental in the development of 
Domino’s global manufacturing capabilities. As executive Director 
her role is extended to encompass all the Group’s research and 
development and product development and introduction 
activities. Her biography can be found on page 39.
The subject of diversity has received much attention through the 
Davies Report and subsequent reviews. The Board fully appreciates 
the benefits of diversity and is committed to equal opportunities 
for all. Domino’s equal opportunities policy is available on the 
Company’s website. At present some 70 per cent of Group 
employees live and work outside the UK and our workforce is 
becoming increasingly diverse as we extend our activities in Asia. 
The senior leadership team in the Company comprises 1 1 people, 
of whom three are women. Further information on gender 
representation can be found on page 25. The Company has a 
graduate recruitment programme and a development programme 
for high-flyers to develop the pool of talent available to meet the 
longer-term needs of the Company
During the year the Committee also carried out the 
following tasks:
• Reviewed its own terms of reference
• Reviewed the succession plan for the executive management
• Considered the independence of the non-executive Directors
• Approved renewed terms of office as non-executive Directors 
for Sir Mark Wrightson, Chris Brinsmead and Sir David Brown 
• Carried out an evaluation of the Board and its committees
• Since the year end has reviewed and approved the form of 
this report.

ANNUAL STATEMENT BY THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIR
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 October 2014. This 
report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and 
approved by the Board.
In what remain uncertain market conditions, the Group has 
delivered good results in 2014. Sales have grown year-on-year at 
constant currency by 9 per cent. Underlying profits grew by 9 per 
cent to £57.6 million; net cash inflow from operating activities 
before taxation was £65.8 million. Good progress has been made 
during the year towards the delivery of the Group’s major strategic 
priorities. The results which have been achieved are testimony to 
the calibre of leadership and the commitment of our employees in 
improved but still challenging conditions. These factors have been 
taken into account by the Committee and are reflected in the 
remuneration awarded to the executive Directors in 2014.

CHANGE TO REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015
The Committee has made changes to its proposed Remuneration Policy for 2015 which will necessitate the Policy being put to 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM. The Committee feels that there are a number of factors which have required the Committee to propose 
changes now rather than wait until the end of the original Policy period. They are:
• An analysis carried out by the Committee which demonstrated that the current maximum incentive opportunities cannot deliver the 
total upper quartile payout targeted by the current Policy even where maximum performance is achieved.
• The momentum generated by shareholders encouraging all FTSE 250 companies to have mandatory bonus deferral in shares, the 
facility to add holding periods post vesting of incentives, increased shareholding requirements and the introduction of malus and 
clawback provisions.
• The new UK Corporate Governance Code, the relevant provisions of which are:
 – “Schemes should include provisions that would enable the Company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of any sum, and 
specify the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to do so.”
 – “For share-based remuneration, the Remuneration Committee should consider requiring Directors to hold a minimum number of 
shares and to hold shares for a further period after vesting or exercise, including for a period after leaving the Company, subject to 
the need to finance any costs of acquisition and associated tax liabilities.”

The following table sets out how the Committee proposes to incorporate all of the above factors into a revised Policy and shows the 
changes from the current Policy:

Proposed Policy 2015

Benefits See Policy Section of the Report. No change.
Pension See Policy Section of the Report. No change.
Annual bonus
Maximum opportunity 100 per cent of salary p.a. 150 per cent of salary p.a. 
Rationale:
An increase was required to provide the incentive opportunity 
to achieve the Committee’s total remuneration policy.
Payment All cash. Subject to shareholder approval the bonus will be provided 
under the Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus 
Plan. Bonus will be provided as follows:
• 2/3
rds
 cash; and
• 1/3
rd
 deferred shares which will be subject to the following:
 – continued employment until the end of a three year 
vesting period; and
 – malus and clawback provisions.
Rationale:
A deferred share element will be introduced to increase the 
retention element of the package, to address shareholder 
desires around the structure of bonus and to provide alignment 
with the new UK Corporate Governance Code. Whilst the 
performance period for the Bonus Plan is annual the 
Committee’s intention was to introduce an additional long-term 
equity element through an increased opportunity to earn shares 
which would then have to be held by the executive Directors to 
meet the substantially increased minimum shareholding 
requirement; thereby providing a long-term alignment between 
the executive Directors and shareholders through a retained 
and locked-in shareholding. 
Performance conditions Performance conditions (weightings):
• Group profit (30 per cent)
• Group cash (20 per cent)
• Personal objectives (50 per cent).
The personal objectives operate as a 
multiplier on the level of achievement 
of the financial performance 
conditions.
Performance conditions (weightings):
• Group Profit (50 per cent)
• Group cash (30 per cent)
• Personal Objectives (20 per cent).
Rationale:
This change simplifies the operation of the bonus targets 
making it more transparent to all stakeholders and allows the 
Committee to provide greater granular detail on performance 
outcomes for more of the potential bonus earned. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 52

Rationale:
To protect the Company, to meet shareholder expectations 
and to align with the new UK Corporate Governance Code.
Holding periods None. The Committee will have the flexibility to introduce additional 
holding periods of up to two years following vesting. It is not 
the Committee’s current intention to impose an additional 
holding period; however the Committee will review market 
practice on an annual basis.
Rationale: 
To provide the Committee with the flexibility to add holding 
periods if it believes appropriate in the future taking into account 
the needs of the Company and future market practice.

This shareholding requirement would be targeted over five

requirement was met.
Rationale:
To meet shareholder expectations that minimum shareholding 
levels should increase and to align with the new UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
CONSULTATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Committee consulted with the Company’s top shareholders as well as the main shareholder representative bodies prior to finalising 
the design of the proposed bonus arrangements and other changes to the Remuneration Policy. The Remuneration Committee is grateful 
for the significant degree of engagement with the Company and its advisers shown by those shareholders consulted throughout the 
consultation process, and for their comments and feedback. At the end of this process the Remuneration Committee is pleased that the 
majority of Shareholders consulted (both by number and percentage of shares held) have indicated they are supportive of the plan.
In documenting the revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which will be put to a binding vote at the forthcoming AGM, the Committee 
has sought to strike a sound balance between flexibility, discretion and judgement consistent with the guidance published by the GC100 
and Investor Group and taking into account the factors set out above such that the Policy is likely to be properly responsive to the 
dynamic markets in which the Group operates for fully three years ahead.
I look forward to receiving your support for the resolutions seeking approval of the Annual Report on Remuneration at our forthcoming 
AGM and of the Remuneration Policy applicable to our executive Directors which will apply, subject to subsequent shareholder approval 
at the AGM, from the beginning of the Company’s current financial year, being 1 November 2014.

2. ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON VARIABLE PAY IN SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION TABLE
In order to execute its business strategy, the Company needs high-quality Directors and the remuneration packages need to be able to 
attract, retain and motivate such individuals. The annual bonus and the Long-Term Incentive Plan are used to ensure that, when merited 
by performance, an opportunity is offered to earn total remuneration at the upper quartile of the market.
The Committee considers that performance conditions for all incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business strategy, 
shareholder expectations and external advice regarding the market benchmarks. To the extent that any performance condition is not 
met, the relevant part of the award will lapse. There is no retesting of performance.
The main components of the Remuneration Policy, and how they are linked to and support the Company’s business strategy, are 
summarised in each of the following sections.
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN AWARDS
In respect of the year under review, the executive Directors’ performance was carefully reviewed by the Committee, in consultation with 
the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the other executive Directors, and performance as against the annual bonus plan measures in 
relation to Nigel Bond and Andrew Herbert was as follows:

1 Group profit is defined as underlying pre-tax profit before discretionary bonus charges.
2 Group cash is defined as net cash inflow from operating activities before taxation as adjusted to eliminate the cash effect (if any) of any one-off items included in the reconciliation between 
pre-tax profit and underlying pre-tax profit.
The Group profit and cash components operate separately and payments are made on a straight-line basis between the threshold and 
maximum levels. If an executive Director achieves his personal objectives, a multiplier is applied to the amount earned under the financial 
conditions. The value of the multiplier is dependent on the level of achievement, with the maximum that can be earned under this 
element being 50 per cent of salary by means of a multiplier of 2. However, the personal objectives multiplier will only be applied if the 
executive Director has reached and maintained his shareholding requirement, as set by the Committee. 
If the executive Director meets his personal objectives but the financial conditions are not achieved, then no bonus payment will be made. 
The Committee reviewed the structure of the annual bonus this year on the basis of its appropriateness both in terms of the Company’s 
strategy as well as market practice and corporate governance principles. At the end of this review the Committee felt that a new bonus 
arrangement should be implemented for the 2015 financial year – the Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan.  | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 56
2. ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON VARIABLE PAY IN SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION TABLE CONTINUED
Full details of the plan and the Committee’s rationale behind its design are set out in the 2015 Notice of AGM. In addition, the key terms 
of the plan are out in the Policy Section of the Remuneration Report.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) AWARDS
The awards granted under the LTIP are subject to performance conditions to be met over a performance period of three years or more. For 
awards made in 2008 and subsequent years, including 2014, the performance period is three years. At the end of the performance period the 
awards will vest to the extent the performance conditions have been satisfied. There is no retesting of performance conditions and if they are 
not satisfied, the awards will lapse. The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 19 March 2008.
The performance conditions applicable to the LTIP are set out below. 
The Committee assessed the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied for the 2011 award which were tested in 
2014, with the following results:

SAVE AS YOU EARN (SAYE) AND SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (SIP)
The executive Directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE and SIP schemes. On 12 August 2014, Andrew Herbert was granted a 
SAYE option over 1,890 shares at an exercise price of £4.76. Each executive Director has contributed £125 per month to the SIP.
4. PENSION ENTITLEMENTS
Executive Directors are entitled to be members of the defined contribution scheme that is available to all Domino UK employees. 
They do not participate in any defined benefit scheme.
For the year commencing 1 November 2013, the Company contribution was 25.5 per cent of salary for the executive Directors, a portion 
of which was taken as a cash supplement by Nigel Bond and Andrew Herbert under the terms of the supplementary pension plan which 
they joined with effect from 6 April 2011. The value of the cash supplement was £95,000 and £59,000 respectively. The value of such cash 
supplement is not taken into account when calculating annual bonus and LTIP award levels, which are determined by reference to base 
salary only.
5. PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS/PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
There were no payments to past directors or payments for loss of office during the year being reported on.
6. STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING
The executive Directors are required to build and maintain a holding of at least 40,000 Domino shares. For the 2015 financial year, the 
Committee has determined to increase the minimum shareholder requirement to 200 per cent of salary following its review of the new 
UK Corporate Governance Code which required the Committee to consider the level of the minimum shareholding required. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 58

IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY IN COMING YEAR
The Chairman’s Annual Statement sets out an amended policy for the forthcoming financial year subject to shareholder approval at the 
2015 AGM. Full details of the proposed Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan are set out in the Notice of AGM.
 
The Remuneration Policy and its implementation for the forthcoming financial year is summarised below:
Package structure The main elements of executive remuneration effective from 18 March 2015 (being the date of the AGM at 
which shareholder approval for this report will be sought) are:
• Base salary
 Nigel Bond’s and Andrew Herbert’s salary for the coming year are £430,000 and £270,000 respectively.  
An average salary increase of 2.97 per cent was awarded to the Group’s UK employees and managers in 
July 2014.
• Fees 
 Following advice from our Remuneration Consultants and having regard for benchmarks and more usual 
practices in the FTSE 250, the Board has made changes to the fee structure to create committee chair fees 
(£5,000 per annum) and adjusted the non-executive Director fees for 2015 to £45,000. The Chairman’s fee 
has not changed. The fees for 2015 for individual Directors are therefore as follows:
 – Peter Byrom – £172,000
 – Sir Mark Wrightson – £50,000
 – Sir David Brown – £50,000
 – Chris Brinsmead – £45,000
 – Sucheta Govil – £45,000
• Bonus – See Chairman’s Annual Statement and Notice of AGM.
• Long-Term Incentive Plan with maximum opportunity of 100 per cent of base salary delivered in shares 
based on EPS growth (50 per cent) and relative Total Shareholder Return (50 per cent).
 – Under the EPS growth element, 25 per cent of the element (12.5 per cent of the total award) vests for 
EPS growth of RPI +12 per cent over the performance period, increasing on a straight-line basis to full 
vesting (50 per cent of the total award) for EPS growth of RPI +30 per cent.
 – Under the Relative Total Shareholder Return element performance is measured against the FTSE 250. 
25 per cent of the element (12.5 per cent of the total award) vests at median performance of the index, 
rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting (50 per cent of the total award) for upper quartile performance.
Pay for performance • Key principle for the short- and long-term incentives is to provide a strong link between reward and 
individual and Group performance to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. 
• When merited by performance, an opportunity is offered to earn total remuneration at the upper quartile 
levels of remuneration paid, against companies of a similar market capitalisation and with similar revenues to 
the Company.
The details of the targets applicable to the bonus for the coming year are considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive as 
they are the key metrics which are critical to the operation of the Company, so they have not been disclosed as the Committee feels it 
would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to do so. However, details of the targets and the extent to which they have been 
satisfied will be disclosed in the 2015 annual report on remuneration.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
INTRODUCTION
This section of the Remuneration Report contains details of the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy that will govern the 
Company’s future remuneration payments.
The policy described will be applicable, subject to subsequent approval by shareholders at the Company’s AGM in March 2015 from the 
beginning of the Company’s current financial year, being 1 November 2014.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
The Company’s business strategy is to provide industrial customers with a full suite of products to meet their coding and marking and 
identification needs. The objective is to enable Domino to continue to grow its market share in this industry and deliver a sustained 
increase in profitability, cash flow and shareholder value. To achieve these objectives, it is vital that the Remuneration Policy devised 
and applied by the Committee supports this strategy. 
In order to execute this strategy, the Company needs high-quality Directors and the remuneration packages need to be able to attract, retain 
and motivate such individuals. Salary and benefit packages for executive Directors are linked to both individual and business performance and 
are designed to ensure that the Group is managed in the interests of shareholders. Whilst salaries are generally set by reference to the 
median of the market, the annual bonus and Long-Term Incentive Plan are intended to give executive Directors an opportunity to earn 
total annual remuneration at the upper quartile of the market in terms of payments made when merited by performance.
NEW POLICY
The Notice of AGM provides details of the proposed new Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan and other changes 
to the Policy and sets out the Committee’s rationale behind the revised Policy set out below. In addition, the Annual Statement of the 
Chairman sets out which elements of the revised Policy are different from the current Policy. It should be noted that other than the 
introduction of the new 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan and changes to the operation of the LTIP all other Policy elements remain unchanged.
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Committee is comfortable that the proposed Policy is in line with the revised Code. The following table sets out the key elements of 
the revised Code and how the Company’s remuneration policy for executive Directors is in line with the Code:
Code provision Company Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors remuneration should be designed 
to promote the long-term success of the Company.
The Company has an LTIP with a three year performance period and under the 
new Policy provision for the Committee to add holding periods post vesting. 
The new Policy incorporates bonus arrangements where part of the bonus is 
deferred in shares for three years with the facility for the Committee to add 
holding periods post vesting. It is the Committee’s view that these arrangements 
provide a holistic approach to ensuring executive Directors are focused on the 
long-term success of the Company.
Schemes should include provisions that would enable 
the Company to recover sums paid or withhold the 
payment of any sum, and specify the circumstances in 
which it would be appropriate to do so.
The proposed new Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan 
includes malus and clawback provisions. In addition, the proposed new Policy 
includes similar provisions for the LTIP. Full details of these provisions are set out 
in the Notice of AGM. It is the Committee’s opinion that these changes meet 
both the letter and spirit of the Code.
For share-based remuneration, the Remuneration 
Committee should consider requiring Directors to hold 
a minimum number of shares and to hold shares for a 
further period after vesting or exercise, including for a 
period after leaving the Company, subject to the need 
to finance any costs of acquisition and associated tax 
liabilities.
The new Policy contains the following relevant features:
• Minimum shareholding requirements for executive Directors increased to 
200 per cent of salary.
• The provision for the Committee to add holding periods post vesting for the 
new Bonus Plan and the existing LTIP.
The Committee does not currently believe with the increased shareholding 
requirement and the introduction of bonus deferral in shares for the first time 
that additional holding periods are required. However, the Committee will 
consider this position on an annual basis.   
| Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 64
DISCRETION
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has  
the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
The main components of the Remuneration Policy, and how they are linked to and support the Company’s business strategy, are 
summarised below:

Performance

Base salary is set annually

Salary levels are 
reviewed on an annual 
basis by reference to the 
median for comparable 
positions in FTSE 250 
companies of a similar 
market capitalisation and 
with similar revenues to 
the Company. Broadly, 
the Company seeks to 
pitch base salary around 
the median level for such 
comparable positions, 
without tracking it 
mechanistically. The 
Committee is aware of 
the dangers of 
comparisons and the risk 
of upward ratcheting of 
remuneration without 
corresponding 
improvements in 
corporate and individual 
performance.
Broadly pitched around 
the median level for 
comparable positions, 
without tracking it 
mechanistically.
When considering any 
increases to base salaries 
in the normal course (as 
opposed to a change in 
role or responsibility), 
the Committee will take 
into consideration:
• reference to the 
increases provided to 
executives in the 
comparator group;
• pay and employment 
conditions of 
employees 
throughout the 
Group, including 
increases provided to 
the employee 
population; and
• inflation.

policy in the following financial 
year, the nature of the targets and 
their weighting for each year (see 
page 55).
Details of the performance 
conditions, targets and their level 
of satisfaction for the year being 
reported on will be set out in the 
Annual Remuneration 
Committee Report.
The Committee retains 
discretion in exceptional 
circumstances to change the 
performance measures and 
targets and their respective 
weightings part way through a 
performance year if there is a 
significant and material event 
which causes the Committee to 
believe the original measures, 
weightings and targets are no 
longer appropriate. 
Discretion may also be exercised 
in cases where the Committee 
believes that the bonus outcome 
is not a fair and accurate 
reflection of business 
performance. The Committee 
has discretion not to pay a bonus 
even if performance conditions 
are met.
Malus and clawback provisions 
are included in the rules of the 
Plan.
Dividend equivalents may be 
provided on deferred shares.
Maximum 150 per cent of 
base salary. 
At threshold levels of 
performance, 0 per cent 
of base salary can be 
earned, with a straight-
line pro-rate allocation 
between threshold and 
maximum.
Bonus performance conditions:
Group profit (underlying pre-tax 
profit before discretionary bonus 
charges)

.
Group cash (net cash inflow from 
operating activities before taxation 
as adjusted to eliminate the cash 
effect (if any) of any one-off items 
included in the reconciliation 
between pre-tax profit and 
underlying pre-tax profit)
1
. 
Personal objectives
The Committee may change the 
balance of the conditions, or use 
different conditions for subsequent 
years, as appropriate; provided that 
at least 50 per cent of the conditions 
are financial. No material change will 
be made to the type of performance 
conditions without prior shareholder 
consultation.
The Remuneration Committee is of 
the opinion that given the 
commercial sensitivity arising in 
relation to the detailed financial 
targets used for the bonus, disclosing 
precise targets for the bonus plan in 
advance would not be in shareholder 
interests. This avoids the risk of the 
Company inadvertently providing a 
profit forecast because profit targets 
are linked to budgets and giving 
international competitors an unfair 
advantage because they are not 
required to report to the same 
disclosure standard as a UK listed 
company. 
Actual targets, performance 
achieved and awards made will be 
published at the end of the 
performance periods so 
shareholders can fully assess the 
basis for any pay-outs under the 
bonus arrangements.

2. RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION POLICY
Our principle is that the pay of any new recruit would be determined following the same principles as for the executive Directors 
disclosed in the Policy Table. 
The Committee will not pay more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and is mindful of guidelines and 
shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short- or long-term incentive payments made on recruitment and the 
appropriateness of any performance conditions associated with an award.
The table overleaf summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration: | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 70
2. RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
Salary • Set by reference to market and taking into account individual experience and expertise 
in the context of the role.
Maximum variable incentive • Bonus and long-term incentive of 150 per cent and 100 per cent of base salary 
respectively (i.e. 250 per cent total) in line with our current policy for executive 
Directors (350 per cent of salary if a sign-on payment is made).
Sign-on payments • The Committee’s policy is not to provide sign-on compensation.
• However, in exceptional circumstances where the Committee decides to provide this 
type of compensation it will endeavour to provide the compensation in equity, subject 
to a holding period during which cessation of employment will generally result in 
forfeiture and subject to the satisfaction of performance targets. In addition, where 
practical the Committee will endeavour to consult with its key shareholders prior to 
entering into any commitment. The maximum value of this one-off compensation will 
be proportionate to the overall remuneration offered by the Company and in all 
circumstances is limited to 100 per cent of salary which will only be provided in 
exceptional circumstances.
Share buy-outs • The Committee’s policy is not to provide buy-outs as a matter of course.
• However, should the Committee determine that the individual circumstances of 
recruitment justified the provision of a buy-out, the value of any incentives that will be 
forfeited on cessation of a Director’s previous employment will be calculated taking into 
account the following:
 – the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Director’s 
cessation of employment;
 – the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the 
likelihood of them being satisfied; and
 – any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (lapsed value).
• The Committee may then grant up to the equivalent value as the lapsed value, where 
possible, under the Company’s incentive plans. To the extent that it was not possible or 
practical to provide the buy-out within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive 
plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used.
Relocation policies • In instances where the new executive is non-UK domiciled, the Company may provide, 
as a one-off or ongoing as part of the Director’s relocation benefits, compensation to 
reflect the cost of relocation for the executive in cases where they are expected to 
spend significant time away from their country of domicile as determined appropriate 
and on a case-by-case basis.
• The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis but will take 
into consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance and schooling.

3. SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Company’s policy on Directors’ service contracts is that they should be on a rolling basis without a specific end date.
Director Effective term Notice period
Nigel Bond Rolling (with no fixed expiry date) 12 months by the Company,
6 months by executive Director
Andrew Herbert Rolling (with no fixed expiry date) 12 months by the Company,
6 months by executive Director
The Committee’s policy for setting notice periods is that a maximum 12 month period will apply for executive Directors. The Committee 
may in exceptional circumstances arising on recruitment, allow a longer period, which would in any event reduce to 12 months following 
the first year of employment. 
Under their letters of appointment, the non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, are entitled to receive six months’ notice of the 
termination of their appointment.
The Company follows the UK Corporate Governance Code’s recommendation that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to 
annual reappointment by shareholders.
TERMINATION PAYMENTS
The Committee will honour executive Directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses. 
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are 
no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no 
agreement between the Company and its Directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in 
good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or 
compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an executive Director’s office or employment.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing individual the Remuneration Committee will always seek to minimise cost to 
the Company whilst seeking to address the circumstances at the time.

Domino Printing Sciences 
plc 2015 Deferred Bonus 
Plan
If the individual is a good leaver, the Plan will 
operate as if the participant remained employed 
other than the maximum bonus capable of being 
earned for the year being pro-rated to the amount 
of the financial year worked.
A 'good leaver' is defined as a participant ceasing to 
be in employment by reason of death, injury, ill 
health, disability, redundancy, retirement or at the 
Committee’s discretion.
All deferred bonuses will vest at the end of the 
relevant three year deferral periods if the 
participant is a good leaver. 
Deferred bonuses lapse if the participant is a bad 
leaver (any participant who is not a good leaver).
The Committee has discretion to determine that 
an individual is a good leaver. This discretion would 
only be used in exceptional circumstances and 
where practical the Committee would consult with 
key shareholders prior to its exercise. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 72
3. SERVICE CONTRACTS CONTINUED
Approach Application of Remuneration Committee 
discretion
Long-term incentive A Bad leaver is defined as a participant ceasing to 
be in Employment by reason of incompetence, 
misconduct or resignation. Where employment 
terminates for a bad leaver reason, all unvested 
awards lapse immediately. 
A Good leaver is defined as a participant whose 
employment ceases for any reason other than a bad 
leaver reason.
Awards held by a good leaver will vest immediately 
on cessation of employment to the extent that 
performance conditions (as waived, varied or 
amended by the Committee) are satisfied and time 
pro-rated (unless the Committee decides 
otherwise).
On cessation of employment the Committee has 
the ability to waive or amend performance 
conditions. The Committee also has discretion not 
to apply time pro-rating to awards in the case of 
good leavers. The Committee would only use this 
discretion in exceptional circumstances.

The Committee will make all decisions in relation to 
the Plan immediately prior to the change of control

Any payments will be made immediately following 
the Committee’s determination and conditional on 
the change of control occurring. 
All deferred share awards will vest following the 
Committee’s determination and conditional on the 
change of control occurring.
The Committee will have discretion on whether to 
pro-rate to time.
It is the Committee’s policy in normal circumstances 
to pro-rate to time; however, in exceptional 
circumstances where the nature of the transaction 
produces exceptional value for shareholders and 
provided the performance targets are met the 
Committee will consider whether pro-rating is 
equitable.
LTIP Awards would vest based on the level of 
satisfaction of the performance conditions at the 
date of the change of control and subject to 
pro-rating to the time elapsed.
Under the terms of the LTIP, on a change of control, 
the Committee has the ability to waive or amend 
performance conditions. The Committee also has 
discretion not to apply time pro-rating to awards. 
The Committee would only use this discretion in 
exceptional circumstances.

5. CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE 
COMPANY IN DEVELOPING POLICY
The Remuneration Policy for all employees is determined in terms 
of best practice and ensuring that the Company is able to attract 
and retain the best people. This principle is followed in the 
development of our Remuneration Policy for executive Directors. 
However, employee views are not specifically sought in 
determining this policy. The Company does not use any 
remuneration comparison metrics.
Salary and benefit packages are linked to both individual and 
business performance. All employees participate in bonus schemes, 
which, together with salary reviews linked to business performance, 
enable all employees to share in the success of the Group. All 
employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE and SIP, with 
subsidiary general managers and other senior managers also 
eligible to participate in the executive share option schemes 
as outlined below.
SAVE AS YOU EARN (SAYE) SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
All UK-based employees including executive Directors are entitled 
to participate in the SAYE scheme. This is not subject to any 
performance conditions. Since this is a standard, HMRC approved 
scheme open to all employees it was not considered appropriate 
to include such conditions.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (SIP)
The Company operates a HMRC approved SIP to enable 
employees to invest in the Company’s shares in a tax efficient way. 
This plan is open to all UK-based employees.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
The Company has operated executive share option schemes since 
1985. Executive Directors and other senior executives do not 
participate in these schemes. Executive share options are currently 
granted to subsidiary general managers and other senior managers. 
The exercise of executive options granted after 2003 is conditional 
on EPS growth exceeding the level of growth in the RPI plus 9 per 
cent. For options granted before 2005, basic EPS was used for the 
performance condition. For options granted in 2005, and 
subsequent years, underlying EPS is used. 
Achievement of EPS performance conditions is assessed by 
reference to earnings per share as reported in the Group’s audited 
results and the RPI published by the Office for National Statistics.
6. CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS 
The views of our shareholders are very important to us and the 
Committee is happy to receive constructive feedback with respect 
to our remuneration policies or structure which we take on board 
to formulate our arrangements. 
As disclosed earlier in this report, the Remuneration Committee 
consulted with the Company’s major shareholders when designing 
the Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan and 
other changes set out in the proposed Policy. In explaining the 
background and design of the Bonus Plan, the central elements of 
the Company’s remuneration policy were explained. A majority of 
those shareholders consulted expressed their support for the new 
plan and associated changes to the Policy.

AUTHORITY OF THE DIRECTORS TO ISSUE SHARES
At the last Annual General Meeting on 19 March 2014, the 
Directors were given authority to allot up to £842,202 in nominal 
value of relevant securities. This figure represented approximately 
15 per cent of the Company’s total issued ordinary share capital at 
that time.
Also at the last Annual General Meeting the Directors were given 
authority to allot shares in the Company for cash without regard 
to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This 
authority expires on the date of the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 18 March 2015 and the Directors will seek to renew this 
authority for the following year under the Companies Act 2006.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
At the last Annual General Meeting, shareholders authorised 
the Company to make market purchases on the London Stock 
Exchange of up to 16,282,582 ordinary shares, representing 
approximately 14.5 per cent of its issued share capital at that time. 
This authority will expire at the end of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company unless renewed at that meeting.
AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders.
 
APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS
The Articles give the Directors the power to appoint additional 
or replacement Directors. The Articles also require Directors 
to retire and submit themselves for election at the first Annual 
General Meeting following appointment and for one third of the 
Directors to retire by rotation at each Annual General Meeting. 
The Board has decided that each Director will retire at each 
Annual General Meeting.
The non-executive Directors were appointed for specific terms 
subject to re-election and to the Companies Act provisions 
relating to the removal of a Director. The terms of appointment 
of the non-executive Directors are available on the Company's 
website or can be obtained from the Company Secretary.
POWER OF DIRECTORS
The Directors may exercise all powers of the Company subject to 
relevant statutes, any directions given by shareholder resolution 
and the Articles. The Articles, for example, contain specific 
provisions relating to the Company’s power to borrow money. 
The Articles also contain powers relating to the issue of shares 
and the purchase of the Company’s own shares.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
INDEPENDENT LEGAL ADVICE
There is a procedure in place for Directors to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense if this is necessary in 
connection with their duties.
DIRECTORS’ INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year 
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. The Directors also have 
the benefit of the indemnity provision contained in the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The Company has made qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has various contractual arrangements for the supply 
of materials, components and equipment. It also has contractual 
arrangements in place for the distribution of its products by third 
party distributors.
The Company has a borrowing facility agreement which includes 
change of control provisions. On a change in control of the 
Company this facility could be withdrawn or renegotiated.
There are a number of other agreements that may be terminated 
on a change in control. None is considered to be significant in 
terms of the potential impact on the Group.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Details of share capital are shown in note 25. The Company has 
one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of 
the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on 
the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles and prevailing legislation. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities or on voting rights.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
SHARE SCHEMES – WAIVER OF DIVIDENDS
The trustees of the Company’s employee benefit trust and the 
qualifying employee share trust (the Trusts) have agreed to waive 
dividends payable on the Company’s shares held by the Trusts, 
except for the shares relating to the Share Incentive Plan. As at 
15 December 2014 the Trusts held 35,867 shares on which 
dividends payable had been waived. This represents 0.04% per 
cent of the issued share capital at the year end.
SHARE SCHEMES – VOTING RIGHTS REGARDING CONTROL OF 
THE COMPANY
The trustees of the qualifying employee share trust have the 
discretion to sell the shares held in the trust or to consent to the 
acquisition of control of the Company by another party. The 
trustees of the Share Incentive Plan have the discretion to seek 
direction from participants as to how to exercise the voting rights 
attaching to the shares held in the trust. If no direction is given the 
trustees are prohibited from exercising the voting rights. STRATEGIC

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES
The Board takes account of the significance of environmental, 
social and ethical matters to the business of the Group and a 
separate Corporate Responsibility Report is set out on pages 34 
to 37. This report contains disclosures of the Group’s greenhouse 
gas emissions. Nigel Bond is the Director responsible for 
environmental, social and ethical issues.
POLITICAL DONATIONS
No political donations were made (2013: £nil).
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Applications for employment made by disabled persons are given 
full and fair consideration, having regard to the abilities and 
aptitudes of the candidates. If existing employees become disabled, 
every effort is made to accommodate them within their existing 
jobs or, if this proves to be impossible, to find them suitable 
alternative employment. Opportunities for development and 
promotion are open to all employees.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
Employee communication is organised both centrally and locally. 
Centrally organised communication deals with the affairs of the 
Group as a whole and the media used for this purpose include the 
annual report and accounts, information circulars and meetings. 
Directors and other senior managers provide regular briefings by 
webinar to managers throughout the Group. Operating units 
organise local presentations by Directors or managers and hold 
briefings to pass on information to employees and to ascertain 
their views. Regular employment engagement surveys are also 
used to obtain feedback from employees.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Reports on corporate governance are set out on pages 38 to 74.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
described within the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are also described on pages 32 to 33.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a 
broad spread of customers across different geographic areas and 
industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group 
is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors 
have also considered the Group’s forecasts and projections, as well 
as the principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is 
exposed (see pages 26 to 29). After making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
AUDITORS
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as the Company’s auditor 
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
The following applies to each of those persons who were 
Directors at the time this report was approved:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole;
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of 
Directors on 15 December and is signed on its behalf by:
Nigel Bond
Chief Executive Officer
15 December 2014
Andrew Herbert
Chief Financial Officer
15 December 2014
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company 
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. STRATEGIC

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE  
MEMBERS OF DOMINO PRINTING SCIENCES PLC
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DOMINO PRINTING 
SCIENCES PLC
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 October 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income 
statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
consolidated and parent Company balance sheets, consolidated 
and parent Company statements of changes in equity, consolidated 
and parent Company cash flow statements and the related notes 
1 to 33. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Valuation of goodwill of £85.8 million and other intangible assets 
of £14.4 million (see notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements).
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets, is a judgmental process which includes 
assumptions around future profits and revenue growth, hence 
there are inherent uncertainties to these models. Goodwill and 
other intangible assets are material balances within the Group 
financial statements and Domino Printing Sciences plc operates in 
a global market which is susceptible to economic change.
We evaluated management’s assumptions in the cash flow 
forecasts used in the value in use calculation for goodwill and 
other intangible assets, described in note 15 to the financial 
statements. These included the cash flow projections, growth 
rates and sensitivities used. Together with our internal valuation 
specialists, we challenged the discount rate applied to the separate 
cash generating units by comparing this against industry 
benchmarks on similar assets, the prevailing Group cost of capital 
at the year end, and our understanding of the future prospects of 
the business. We have considered the level of risk adjustment 
applied to each of the cash generating units. In order to challenge 
the long-term growth rate applied to the cash flow projections we 
have considered market data and benchmarked the rate against 
comparator companies. We have applied reasonable sensitivities 
to the model.
GOING CONCERN
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement contained within the Directors’ report that the Group is 
a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team: | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 80
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE  
MEMBERS OF DOMINO PRINTING SCIENCES PLC
CONTINUED
Last year our report included one other risk relating to the 
valuation of Domino’s investment in TEN Media LLC. This is no 
longer a key risk in our audit as it is no longer material to the 
Group financial statements.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with 
the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed 
on page 45.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. 
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with 
respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express 
an opinion on these individual matters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £3.2 million (2013: 
£4.0 million), which is approximately 6.0 per cent (2013: 7.5 per 
cent) of pre-tax profit and 1.5 per cent (2013: 2 per cent) of equity. 
In 2013 pre-tax profit excluding exceptional items was used. The 
percentage applied has reduced to be more comparable with 
Domino Printing Sciences’ peer group. As set out in note 5 to the 
financial statements, pre-tax profit is adjusted by excluding the 
effect of separately disclosed exceptional non-recurring items and 
certain non-cash items as these can be volatile. This measure 
provides a more comparable measure with similar organisations. 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Valuation of contingent consideration 
The assessment of the carrying value of contingent consideration is 
a judgmental area as it is based on the same cash flow forecasts as 
used in the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible 
assets. These cash flows are then used to assess the total amounts 
payable to the previous owners of acquired businesses where the 
consideration owed is determined based on future profitability of 
the underlying business. As described in note 23 to the financial 
statements, the provision has reduced by £3.2 million this year to 
£4.8 million.
We considered the appropriateness of management’s assumptions 
used in the forecasts which support both the quantum and the 
timing of future payments for contingent consideration in light of 
the reassessment made to the provision through observation of 
underlying agreements in place and discussions with operational 
management external to finance. We confirmed that the 
movement in contingent consideration for each acquisition is 
consistent with the underlying forecasts and that the balance 
reflects the agreed repayment schedules. 
Revenue recognition
There are significant judgments involved in applying the Group’s 
revenue recognition policies in relation to accounting for significant 
contracts with multiple revenue streams (e.g. installation, 
implementation and support). These judgments are most significant 
for sales of Digital Press machines which were launched in 2013, 
particularly as regards the recording of these Digital Press sales in 
the correct period. The Group’s policy on revenue recognition is set 
out in note 1 to the financial statements. 
We carried out tests relating to controls over revenue recognition, 
including the accounting for multiple element arrangements and 
the timing of revenue recognition. We reviewed the terms of 
individual sales for Digital Press machines and agreed evidence of 
delivery and installation, for sales spanning the year and the year 
end period and the treatment of these contracts in the financial 
statements to assess whether the revenue recognition is 
consistent with those terms, the Group’s policy and relevant 
accounting standards.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £64,000 (2013: 
£80,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
. 
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our work primarily on 
19 locations.
• 11 of these locations, accounting for 87 per cent (2013: 95 per 
cent) of the Group’s profit before tax and 88 per cent (2013: 
92 per cent) of its revenue, were subject to an audit. For 4 of 
the 11 locations the audit work was completed by component 
audit teams (16 per cent of Group profit before tax and 13 per 
cent of Group revenue), at the other locations, the audit work 
was carried out by the Group audit team. 
• At a further 8 locations, accounting for 13 per cent (2013: 5 per 
cent) of the Group’s profit before tax and 12 per cent (2013: 8 
per cent) of its revenue, we carried out analytical procedures 
to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement of the aggregated financial information 
of the remaining operating locations not subject to audit. 
Our work at each location was carried out at levels of materiality 
applicable to each individual entity which ranged from £0.9 million to 
£2.2 million. We also tested the consolidation at the parent level.  STRATEGIC

OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES 
ACT 2006:
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY 
EXCEPTION
ADEQUACY OF EXPLANATIONS RECEIVED AND ACCOUNTING 
RECORDS
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if 
in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. Under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain 
elements of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters or our review.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
OUR DUTY TO READ OTHER INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL 
REPORT
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether 
the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we 
communicated to the audit committee which we consider should 
have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If 
we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

PARENT COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2014 | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 90
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
GENERAL INFORMATION
Domino Printing Sciences plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 133. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 3 and in the 
Report of the Directors on pages 75 to 77.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
The Company has elected to also prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except in respect of revalued properties (as permitted 
by IFRS 1) and certain financial instruments of the Group and Company, and has been prepared on a basis consistent with the IFRS 
accounting policies set out below.

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
financial statements other than IFRS 15 and the enhanced disclosure requirements in IFRS 9 and IFRS 12.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are described 
within the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are also described in the Strategic Report. In addition, note 30 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital and risk along with details of exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a broad spread of customers across different geographic areas and 
industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors 
have also considered the Group’s forecasts and projections, as well as the principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed 
(see pages 26 to 29). After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from authorisation of the 
Financial Statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
SUBSIDIARIES
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the entities controlled by the Group. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of the Group’s subsidiaries. The cost of acquisition is measured at 
the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. For acquisitions made 
before the year ended 31 October 2010, costs directly attributable to the transaction are also included in the measurement of acquisition 
cost, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 (revised 2008). For subsequent acquisitions, costs directly attributable to the 
transaction are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in 
a business combination are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling 
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, subsidiaries’ accounting policies are amended to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The Company’s investments in its subsidiaries are carried at cost less provision for any impairments.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
ASSOCIATES
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally with a shareholding of 20 per cent 
to 50 per cent of the voting rights. 
The Group has a 25 per cent holding in Mectec Coding Benelux BV (Mectec BV), a company incorporated in The Netherlands, a 40 per 
cent holding in Mectec Coding Benelux BVBA (Mectec BVBA), a company incorporated in Belgium, and a 20 per cent holding in Radex 
AG (Radex), a company incorporated in Switzerland, all of which have been accounted for as associates. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The results and assets and liabilities of the Group’s associates are 
wholly immaterial to the Group’s results and balance sheet and therefore disclosure of the information required by IAS 28, ‘Investments in 
Associates’, has not been made.
NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of combination. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the 
non-controlling interest’s interest in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the 
non-controlling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 92
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
Contingent consideration is payable to the former shareholders of current Group subsidiaries at amounts based on the future 
performance of those subsidiaries as agreed at the time of acquisition. These liabilities have been measured at their fair value based on 
management estimates of the expected consideration payable and after discounting the amounts payable to their present value. 
Movements in these liabilities arising from a reassessment of their fair value at the balance sheet date are taken to profit or loss.
GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised 
as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from the 
combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to 
being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS – BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, and that can be separately and reliably measured at fair value, are 
separately recognised on acquisition. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over their expected useful 
lives. The periods over which the assets are being amortised are:
Technology 5–10.5 years
Customer relationships 5–13 years
Non-compete agreements 5 years
Trademarks 10 years
Order backlog 2 years
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
Proprietary rights are measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives (currently 10 years).
SOFTWARE 
Software that is not integral to an item of hardware is classified as an intangible asset. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the licence term and three years. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE
IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’, requires development spend to be recognised in the Income Statement as incurred unless the expenditure meets 
certain criteria, in which case it is capitalised and written off to the Income Statement over a suitable period. The criteria used to determine 
the accounting treatment relate to the technical and commercial feasibility of the product or process, as well as the intention and ability of the 
entity to complete development, use or sell the resulting asset and reliably measure the development expenditure attributable to that asset. 
Through its formal Product Creation Process, the Group monitors the extent to which development expenditure meets these criteria. It 
capitalises this expenditure and writes it off to the Income Statement over a suitable period. All other development expenditure is charged to 
the Income Statement as incurred. There was no expenditure capitalised in the period (2013: £nil).

BORROWING COSTS
All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and other exceptional costs and after the share of results of associates and any 
profit or loss arising on the disposal of available for sale investments, but before investment income and finance costs.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation with the exception of certain properties at the Group’s 
Headquarters in Cambridge which are stated at deemed cost following transition to IFRS, being valuation less accumulated depreciation at 
1 November 2004. The Directors have considered the value of the assets that are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are 
satisfied that the aggregate value of those assets is not less than the aggregate amount at which they are stated in the Company’s accounts.
Depreciation of fixed assets is provided on a straight-line basis so as to write off their cost over their expected useful working lives. The 
annual rates applied are:
Freehold land nil
Buildings 2.5%
Motor vehicles – owned 20%
Motor vehicles – leased Lease term
Plant and machinery 5%–20%
Computer equipment 20%–33%
Fixtures and fittings 15%–20%
Leasehold improvements Lease term
IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset 
may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless 
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised as income, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
LEASED ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment leased under finance leases is capitalised and depreciated over its expected useful life. The finance charges 
are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding. 
The costs of operating leases are charged to the Income Statement as they accrue. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 94
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EQUIPMENT LEASED TO CUSTOMERS 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Equipment leased to customers under operating leases is capitalised and depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful working life. 
Costs capitalised comprise materials, direct labour and attributable overheads. 
Amounts due in relation to equipment leased to customers under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the 
Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of 
return on the Group’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either ‘available for sale’ financial assets or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends 
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
any impairment.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with an original maturity of six months or less, balances on bank accounts, cash in transit and 
cash floats held in the business.
Bank overdrafts and interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of issue costs. Finance charges are accounted 
for on an accruals basis and charged to the Income Statement when payable.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its 
retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a 
collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the 
initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted. 
For shares classified as available for sale (AFS), a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is 
considered to be objective evidence of impairment. For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS and finance 
lease receivables, objective evidence of impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
• default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
• it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s 
past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as 
well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
When an AFS debt instrument is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity including the 
related foreign exchange gains or losses are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not 
exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised through profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss. 
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial liabilities’. 
OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Other financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables and are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CASH FLOW HEDGES
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Group designates these instruments as 
cash flow hedges. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash 
flows of the hedged item. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same 
line of the Income Statement as the recognised hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The fair value of the Group’s and Company’s forward contracts is shown as a financial asset and/or liability at the balance sheet date. In 
the Company’s books, these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 and accordingly the movement in fair 
value between the two balance sheet dates is taken through profit or loss.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 96
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
INVENTORIES
Inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Cost represents materials, direct labour and overheads attributable to the stage of production. Cost is calculated using a weighted 
average method. 
INVESTMENT IN OWN SHARES
The cost of the Company’s shares held by various trusts to satisfy equity-settled compensation schemes are deducted from equity 
attributable to shareholders in the Company and Group balance sheets.
REVENUE
Revenue comprises sales to customers after discounts and excludes sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the customer;
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control 
over the goods sold;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Where the sale of printing equipment is conditional on customer acceptance of any aspect of performance and, either legally or 
in substance, risk does not pass to the customer until this acceptance is achieved, revenue is not recognised until such acceptance 
is confirmed.
Sales of services are recognised when the service has been performed and the receipt of payment is reasonably certain. Revenue on 
longer-term service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the service, generally on a straight-line basis over 
the life of the contract.
Operating lease income is accounted for on a straight-line basis with any rental increases recognised during the period to which they relate.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group’s primary reporting segment, as defined by IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’, is geographic by location of subsidiary, which reflects 
how the Board of Directors assesses segment performance and makes decisions about resource allocation. 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, 
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
the number of shares that will eventually vest. There are both non-market and market based performance conditions attached to the 
vesting and exercising of equity instruments.
Where plans have market based performance criteria, fair value is measured by the use of a Monte Carlo model, and by Black-Scholes 
models in all other cases. The expected life used in the models is based on management’s best estimate of behavioural consideration 
based on historic exercise patterns. No changes to the fair value are made when the expected or actual level of awards vesting differs 
from the original estimate due to the non-attainment of market based conditions.
Charges made to the Income Statement in respect of share-based payments are credited back to retained earnings.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its ‘functional currency’). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are 
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or 
loss for the year. 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the 
rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The trading results and cash flows from operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated 
at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences arising in the consolidated accounts on the retranslation at the closing rate of the Group’s opening net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries, together with any differences arising between the average rate and the closing rate in the Income Statement, are 
shown within a separate reserve in equity (the ‘exchange reserve’).
Under IFRS, goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisition of overseas subsidiaries must be considered to be denominated in the 
functional currency of the acquired company. As such, foreign exchange differences arise due to the movement in exchange rates 
between balance sheet dates. The differences arising are shown within the exchange reserve.
PENSION SCHEME ARRANGEMENTS
The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme for its UK employees and has similar schemes in other countries. The pension 
cost charge represents contributions payable in respect of the period.
TAXATION
Current taxation is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws in the relevant territory that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. The tax charged for the period reflects the expected tax payable 
for the period along with adjustments for tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group’s deferred tax 
provision is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly in equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
TAXATION RESERVE
Elements of current and deferred tax arising on share-based compensation charges are recognised in the taxation reserve. Where the 
accrued tax deduction in respect of these charges exceeds the cumulative remuneration expense recognised in profit or loss, the excess 
is recognised in this reserve.
Current taxation on the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is also 
recognised in the taxation reserve of the Group. The taxation relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in Group profit or loss. 
In the Company’s books, since these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, the current taxation on changes 
in fair value is taken to profit or loss. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 98
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
DIVIDENDS
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved 
by the Company’s shareholders. Dividends are shown as a component of the movement in shareholders’ equity.
2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
(A) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the 
Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
In accordance with IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’, the Group is required to recognise, on the acquisition of a subsidiary, internally 
generated intangible assets which the acquired company may hold but are not reflected in the balance sheet of the subsidiary. Examples 
of such assets would be trademarks, customer lists and networks, intellectual property rights and technology portfolios. These assets are 
recognised separately from acquired goodwill.
Valuing such assets is dependent on numerous factors, including company forecasts and market benchmark data. Because of the 
complexity and subjectivity of this work, the Group engages independent, third party valuation experts to advise on the value of material 
assets to be recognised on acquisition and the period over which these assets should be charged to the Income Statement. 
(B) KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below.
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash 
generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value. The nature of the markets in which the Group operates means 
there is some uncertainty in future cash flows and in identifying a suitable risk-adjusted discount rate for each unit. The carrying value of 
goodwill at 31 October 2014 was £85.9 million. Goodwill is initially measured as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
The Group initially estimates the amounts payable under ‘earn-out’ plans to the former shareholders of acquired companies based on 
the business model produced at the time of acquisition. Earn-out clauses within acquisition agreements typically contain provisions for 
amounts payable to the former shareholders based on future financial performance. In order to calculate the expected future payments, 
the acquisition business model contains estimates of the future financial performance for the acquired business. 
The post-acquisition performance and expected future performance of acquired companies is reviewed throughout the year. Any 
adjustments required to contingent consideration arising from a significant departure of financial performance from the original acquisition 
plan are made as required. A corresponding adjustment is made to goodwill for acquisitions made before the year ended 31 October 
2010, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 (revised 2008). For subsequent acquisitions, the corresponding adjustment is 
made to the Income Statement, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 (revised 2008).

PROVISIONS
The Group assesses the carrying value of both debtor and inventory balances based on past losses, current trading patterns and 
anticipated future events.
Provisions for expected future cash outflows are made based upon past experience and management’s assessment of likely outflow, after 
taking the appropriate professional advice when necessary. 
3. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
Information reported to the Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is 
categorised by location of subsidiary into three main regions: Europe, The Americas and Rest of World. These are therefore defined as 
the Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies as described in note 1. Transactions 
between segments are accounted for on an arm’s length basis. The Group has subsidiary companies operating in these segments in the 
following countries:
Europe: United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Belgium
Americas: USA, Canada and Mexico
Rest of World: China, Korea, Singapore and India

1 The expected life used in the models is based on management’s best estimate of behavioural consideration based on historic exercise patterns.
2 Domino SAYE schemes have maturity periods of three, five or seven years.
3 Initial awards relating to the 1997 scheme vest after three years and are placed in trust for the benefit of the participants for a further three years. Bonus awards follow on the fourth, fifth and 
sixth anniversaries of the date of grant. Initial awards under the 2008 scheme vest unconditionally after three years.
4 The Domino share price volatility used is based on a volatility percentage calculated from historic share price data.
5 The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds consistent with the assumed expected life at the date of grant.
6 The expected dividend yield used at the date of grant is the dividend per share for the previous financial year divided by the share price at the end of that financial year.
The Company has two share option schemes for employees of the Group. 
The Executive Option scheme has a vesting period of three years. If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the 
date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee resigns from the Group before the options vest. Options are 
exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Company’s shares over the three days prior to the date of grant. 
The SAYE schemes have vesting periods of three, five or seven years. Options are exercisable for a period of six months from the date 
of vesting, after this period the options expire. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the 
Company’s shares over the three days prior to the date of invitation discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent.

Tax charge for the year 11,913 11,845
The standard rate of tax for the year, based on a weighted average of the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 21.8 per cent 
(2013: 23.4 per cent). The actual tax charge for the current and preceding year differs from the current rate for the reasons set out in 
the above reconciliation. 
Tax for the period is charged at a composite tax rate of 21.1 per cent (2013: 67.0 per cent). The underlying rate (excluding the impact of 
the non-taxable gain of £2,071,000 arising on the reassessment of acquisition related contingent consideration, a one-off £1,428,000 credit 
to the deferred tax charge as a result of changes to the withholding tax rate on dividends paid from the Group’s Chinese subsidiaries, and 
other prior year adjustments) is 25.1 per cent (2013: 25.7 per cent, excluding the impact of the £30,283,000 non-deductible impairment 
of the Group’s investment in TEN Media and the non-taxable gain of £1,943,000 arising on the reassessment of acquisition related 
contingent consideration).
The Finance Act 2013, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 
to 20% effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation 
of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
In addition to the amount charged to the Income Statement of £11,913,000 and credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income of 
£284,000, a charge of £72,000 relating to tax has been recognised directly in equity (2013: credit of £129,000). This principally comprises 
the element of the deferred tax movement that has been recognised in equity in respect of share options and the current tax charge for a 
shortfall in tax deductions related to share-based payments on exercised options.

The Board recommends a final dividend of 14.76 pence per share. The proposed final dividend is subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting and has not been included as a liability at 31 October 2014. Subject to approval, the dividend will be paid on 10 April 
2015 to those shareholders appearing on the register at the close of business on 6 March 2015.
14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
(A) BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year 
(112,366,531) less the weighted average shares in the Company purchased by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (153,719) less the 
weighted average shares issued to the Company’s QUEST scheme (35,867) less the weighted average number of shares held to satisfy 
the Group’s Share Incentive Plan (36,258). The weighted average number of shares used is 112,140,687 (2013: 111,586,441).
(B) DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
The weighted average number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation is the figure used in the basic earnings per share 
calculation adjusted by 924,812, being the number of shares deemed to be issued for no consideration if all share options had been 
exercised. The weighted average number of shares used is 113,065,499 (2013: 112,446,606).
The earnings used in the diluted earnings per share calculation is the profit on ordinary activities attributable to shareholders.
(C) UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Group presents an alternative measure of earnings per share before the post-tax effects of:
• amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations (2014: £2.3 million; 2013: £2.6 million);
• the non-cash interest charge on discounted contingent consideration (2014: £0.04 million; 2013: £0.1 million);
• the non-cash credit arising on reassessment of acquisition related contingent consideration (2014: £2.1 million; 2013: £1.9 million); and
• exceptional costs arising on impairment of goodwill, acquisition intangibles and available for sale investments, business restructuring and 
redundancies (2014: £nil; 2013: £32.9 million).

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated upon acquisition to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to 
benefit from that business combination. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2014
£’000
2013
£’000
Domino core products 66,696 70,145
Citronix product range 10,044 10,003
Purex product range 4,729 4,812
PostJet product range 4,382 4,382
85,851 89,342
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money. The growth 
rates are based on industry growth forecasts within the CGUs. Likewise, changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on recent 
history and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and, where applicable, 
business plans relating to acquired businesses. Cash flow projections for the next five years are prepared based on these sources and 
estimated growth rates. The five year compound annual growth rates applicable to each CGU range between 0 and 23 per cent. Cash 
flows beyond five years are then calculated into perpetuity using a growth rate of two per cent, on the basis that these businesses are 
held for the long-term benefit of the Group.

The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU are as follows: Domino core products – 13.3 per cent; Citronix product 
range – 13.3 per cent; Purex product range – 13.3 per cent; PostJet product range – 14.3 per cent. The Group has conducted a sensitivity 
analysis increasing these discount rates by a further three per cent. At this level, the minimum headroom attributable to any CGU is 
£3,717,000 and, as such, no impairment would be required to be recorded.

18. FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS CONTINUED
Both the total net book value of associates and the share of associates’ results are immaterial to the Group. As such, the Group does not 
disclose any summarised financial information in respect of these associates.
The Group owns 3.5 per cent of epc Solutions Inc and 14.85 per cent of TEN Media LLC. In assessing the fair value of these 
investments, the Directors consider factors such as the recent performance of the company, the relatively small percentage shareholding, 
the shareholder structure, the unquoted status of each of the companies’ shares and any recent transactions involving the equity 
instruments of the companies.
In the case of epc Solutions Inc, the investment was fully impaired in 2008. The Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to 
continue to record this investment at nil value as at 31 October 2014. The valuation and the considerations on which it is based are 
therefore not based on published price quotations or observable market data.
In the case of TEN Media LLC, the investment was fully impaired in 2013. The Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue 
to record this investment at nil value as at 31 October 2014. The estimated fair value of TEN Media LLC as at 31 October 2014 is £nil 
(2013: £nil). 
The Group also holds a 25 per cent investment in the equity of Mectec Coding Benelux BV, a company incorporated in The Netherlands, 
a 40 per cent investment in the equity of Mectec Coding Benelux BVBA, a company incorporated in Belgium, and a 20 per cent holding in 
Radex AG (Radex), a company incorporated in Switzerland. These entities make up their accounts to 31 December (since they are not 
controlled by the Group) and are accounted for as associates under the equity method.

CREDIT RISK
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable 
to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. The Group seeks to limit 
credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through trading only with counterparties that are banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

23. CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
The Group makes estimates of the amounts expected to be paid to the former shareholders in respect of the acquisitions of Graph-Tech AG 
(Graph-Tech) and PostJet Systems Ltd (PostJet) as the amounts payable will ultimately be determined with reference to post-acquisition 
performance. These estimates are established by applying the contractual calculations of contingent consideration to budgeted performance, 
discounting the result back to the present value. Discount rates vary between 0.35 per cent and 0.86 per cent, being the rates that have been 
applied to the calculations for Graph-Tech and PostJet respectively. Suitable exchange rates have been used where necessary to express the 
amount in sterling at the balance sheet date.
The amounts expected to be paid and the maturity profile of those obligations is expected to be as follows:

24. DEFERRED TAXATION
(A) MOVEMENT IN THE YEAR
It is Group policy to measure deferred tax at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
As at 31 October 2014, the following rates have been applied to UK balances:
Rate applied
UK deferred tax assets and liabilities expected to be settled in the year ending 31 October 2015 20.4%
UK deferred tax assets and liabilities expected to be settled in the year ending 31 October 2016 20.0%
Other deferred tax assets and liabilities 20.0%
The net impact to the Group of revaluing the applicable UK deferred tax assets and liabilities to these rates is a credit to income of £35,000. 
The net impact to the Group of revaluing all deferred tax assets and liabilities to the applicable rates is a charge against income of £140,000.

– other temporary differences (2,052) (4,393)
(7,368) (9,913) 
The majority of other temporary differences recognised as an asset relate to deferred tax on unrealised profits in stock and fixed assets 
throughout the Group, and deferred tax on a range of items in Domino Amjet Inc. The majority of other temporary differences recognised 
as a liability relate to deferred tax on unremitted profits from Domino China Ltd, Domino Asia Ltd and Domino Printech India Private Ltd.
A deferred tax asset of £nil has been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of unutilised tax losses (2013: £5,000). 
At the balance sheet date the Group had £143,000 of unprovided deferred tax assets (2013: £nil), relating to tax losses (which would 
become recoverable if appropriate companies were to make taxable profits in the future) of £648,000 (2013: £nil).
With the exception of a deferred tax liability of £1,206,000 in respect of unremitted earnings in China and India where management 
intend to remit earnings in the foreseeable future, no liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with 
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries on the basis that the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

27. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s treasury and currency policies are described in the Strategic Report on page 33. 
The Company is party to a number of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are used to hedge significant future transactions and 
expected cash flows in foreign currencies. The instruments purchased are primarily in the currencies of the Group’s principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, the total amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Company is committed are 
as below (at contractual rates). These contracts were due to mature between 14 November 2014 and 30 October 2015.
Group and Company

Forward foreign exchange contracts 25,627 22,281 
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the coming year and are renewed on a revolving basis in 
line with the Group’s treasury policy.
At 31 October 2014, the fair value of the Group’s and the Company’s forward contracts is estimated to be a net liability of approximately 
£376,000 (2013: a net asset of £183,000). These amounts are based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet 
date and comprise £346,000 (2013: £392,000) of financial assets and £722,000 (2013: £209,000) of financial liabilities. 
All of the Group’s forward contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 for the purposes of hedge accounting 
and the movement in the value between 1 November 2013 and 31 October 2014 has been taken directly to equity in the consolidated 
accounts. In the Company, the movement in value has been taken through the Income Statement, in accordance with the provisions of 
IAS 39.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS RECOGNISED IN THE BALANCE SHEET
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 
The Group manages foreign currency risk as detailed below. The Group does not currently enter into any interest rate swaps or other 
derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manufactures products in the UK, Europe, the USA and Asia and sells its products and services across global markets in a 
range of currencies. This creates an exposure to both transactional and translational risk as rates of exchange fluctuate. Exchange rate 
exposures are managed within approved treasury policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.  | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 128
30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
The Group is principally exposed to the impact of movements in the euro, the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi. The carrying amounts

FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase and decrease in sterling against the relevant foreign currencies. 
10 per cent represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a 10 per cent change in foreign currency rates on:
(i) Foreign currency monetary assets and monetary liabilities outstanding at the balance sheet date.
(ii) The value to the Group of its investments in foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro, the US dollar or the 
Chinese renminbi.

Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 |129
30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
The movement in profit for the year is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to exchange movements in US dollar, euro and 
renminbi denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The movement in equity is mainly as a result of the Group’s exposure to its 
investments in subsidiaries in Europe, the USA and China, in addition to US dollar and euro denominated long-term intercompany loans 
made by the Company.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis above is not fully representative of the inherent foreign exchange risk to which the Group 
is exposed as it does not take account of the impact on the Income Statement of translation of the annual profits and losses made by 
overseas subsidiaries. For further details of the impact of foreign exchange on the Group, see the Treasury section of the Strategic Report 
on page 33.
FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover anticipated receipts and purchases in selected 
foreign currencies within 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the net exposure generated. Contracts denominated in euros and US dollars are 
placed on a rolling 12 month basis. Smaller Contracts are also placed, typically over no more than three months, in a variety of other 
currencies in which the Group trades.
All of the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 for the purposes of 
hedge accounting.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with forward foreign exchange contracts that are designated 
as cash flow hedges are expected to occur:

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND SENSITIVITY
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow and deposit funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate cash deposits and borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis below assumes that for floating rate cash deposits and liabilities, the quantum as at the balance sheet date was in 
place for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 
31 October 2014 would increase/decrease by £401,000. The Company’s profit for the year ended 31 October 2014 would decrease/
increase by £86,000.
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The 
Group has adopted a cautious approach to credit risk management, only entering into transactions with counterparties with recognised 
credit ratings, either through independent third party appraisal or through the Group’s own trading records and other publicly available 
financial information. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and credit exposure is 
controlled by counterparty limits. 
The Group seeks to limit credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through trading only with counterparties that are 
banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Disclosures related to the credit risk associated with trade receivables are shown in note 20. | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 130
30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
The following tables detail the Group’s and the Company’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group 
can be required to pay. 
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. The contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments is considered in note 27.

The liquidity risk inherent in the contractual maturities of the Group’s financial liabilities is managed in conjunction with non-derivative 
financial assets.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:
(i) The fair value of a non-derivative financial asset and financial liability is the carrying amount, as this approximates their fair value.
(ii) The fair value of a derivative is estimated by calculating the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward 
price at the balance sheet date for the residual maturity of the contract.
The carrying amounts of all financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements approximate their fair values.

Domino Printech India Private Ltd (Domino India) has received notification from the Indian tax authorities of unpaid excise duty for its 
inks (including penalties and interest charges). Advice has been taken from external legal counsel and as a result management believes the 
grounds for the claim to be without foundation. The Group has not recognised a provision in respect of this notification at the balance 
sheet date. Advisers have estimated that the maximum possible payment to settle the case, were it to be upheld, would be £3,861,000

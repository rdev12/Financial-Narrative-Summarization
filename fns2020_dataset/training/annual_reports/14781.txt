Annual Report and Accounts 2006 4
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 4 Introduction
I am pleased to report improved
results in the second half of the
year and satisfactory full year 
results for the year ended 
31 December 2006.
The business has delivered 
further sales growth, and margins
are recovering after a period of
turbulence arising from increasing
commodity prices. 
Management have successfully
completed the first acquisition since
the Strategic Review in 2001, and
the business is well placed to make
further progress in 2007 . 
Results
As anticipated, profit before 
taxation reduced by 11% to £2.35m
(2005: £2.64m), although it should
be noted that much of this reduction
is attributable to the translation 
of dollar earnings at a weaker
exchange rate.
Earnings before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation of 6.3p
were slightly ahead of market
expectation, although down by 
17% compared with 2005 (7 .6p).
Reported earnings, which reflect the
exceptional gain on sale of freehold
property, were 7 .0p (2005: 7 .6p).
Net cash inflow from operating
activities increased by 42% to
£0.85m (2005: £0.60m). Net bank
borrowings increased during the
year from £2.06m to £4.38m
reflecting investment in the
relocation of our office premises in
Hong Kong and also the acquisition
of KRP Power Source (UK) Limited
in August. 
Dividends
The Board proposes a final 
dividend of 2.45 pence per share
(2005: 2.4 pence) to be paid on 
8 May 2007 to shareholders on the
register on 13 April 2007 . This brings
the total dividends for the year to
3.6 pence per share, an increase 
of 3% over the prior year (3.5 pence
per share), which is covered by
earnings 1.9 times (2005: 2.2 times).
Company Secretary
David Collins retired as Company
Secretary on 31 December 2006
after more than twenty years 
of service to the company. 
Colin Wilson ACA was appointed 
as Group Financial Controller in 
April 2006, and assumed
responsibility as Company Secretary
upon David Collins’ retirement.
Prospects 
Following four years of profit
growth, the company has
demonstrated some resilience in
recovering from the challenging
market conditions prevalent in 
the first half of 2006. During the
second half of the year a turning
point was reached, with sales,
margins and operating cash flow 
all showing improvement. We look
forward with confidence to further
organic growth, and will continue 
to seek to augment this with
suitable acquisitions when
appropriate opportunities arise.

Chief Executive’s review
Covering the year ended 31 December 2006
Overview
The business has reported
satisfactory results in view of the
underlying market conditions, and
enters 2007 with a positive outlook.
Financial results
Turnover increased 6% to £38.55m
(2005: £36.52m), with similar rates
of growth across both Electronics
and Plastics, and both in Asia and
the UK.
Operating profit reduced as
expected by 12% to £2.28m 
(2005: £2.60m). This was a
reflection of the more challenging
trading conditions prevailing for
much of the year, and especially 
the first half. In particular, material,
energy and operating costs
increased sharply, leading to
pressure on margins until their
effect could be fully reflected 
in selling prices. 
Notwithstanding these pressures,
reported profits would have been
virtually unchanged at constant rates
of exchange, the effect of which are
explained below. 
Profit before taxation decreased by
11% to £2.35m (2005: £2.64m), or
by 17% to £2.16m (2005: £2.60m)
before adjusting for exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation. The
exceptional gain related to the sale
of freehold property in Hong Kong
arising on the relocation of Stadium
Asia office premises amounting to
£0.34m (2005: sale of surplus UK
freehold property of £0.33m).
Reported earnings per share were
7 .0 pence, a decrease of 8% 
on last year (2005: 7 .6 pence). 
Earnings before exceptional gains
and goodwill amortisation were 
6.3 pence (2005: 7 .6 pence).
Effects of foreign currency
exchange rates
During the year the United States
dollar weakened against Sterling by
approximately 15% and ended the
year at the lowest level for many
years. The translation effect of these
movements reduced reported sales
by £1 .49m (4%), profit before taxation
by £0.14m (6%) and net assets by
£0.89m (11%) when compared with
the opening rate of exchange.
Furthermore, the Chinese Yuan has
appreciated by a further 5% during
the year against the United States
Dollar, adding approximately £0.2m
to operating costs in China.
Electronics
Sales overall grew by 6% to
£27 .96m and it was especially
satisfying to experience a return 
to growth in our UK operations.
Automotive volumes continued 
to decline as expected, although
significant new business has been
awarded that will enter production
during 2007 .
Our phased withdrawal from the
telecom market was completed
during the first half of the year,
without incurring significant exit
costs, and we do not anticipate
further activity in this sector. 
Strong growth was experienced in
consumer markets and there are
further substantial opportunities in
the pipeline.
Material prices, which increased
rapidly throughout the first half of
the year, were more stable in the
second half. Most major customers
have now accepted price increases
to reflect new economics, although
some marginal business was
sacrificed where such increases
could not be achieved.
Our goal remains to work with
substantial long term partners who
recognise the value of quality,
service and reliability when
executing sourcing decisions.
Whilst operating margin for the full
year reduced by 1.5% to 6.7%, the
performance in the second half
(7 .3%) marked a recovery from the
6.1% reported at the interim stage.
Stadium Power contributed more
than £3.3m of sales, including
£0.4m from the acquisition of 
KRP Power Source (UK) Ltd on 
30 August 2006. Growth was less
than expected as a result of
technology changes in the gaming
machine sector resulting in lower
demand for hardware. Development
of a range of industry standard
items for manufacture by Stadium
Asia and distribution through
Stadium Power and KRP will 
be completed during 2007 .

70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 6 Growth in sales was attributable to
new product launches and additional
market share won by Stadium
Building Products.
Profits were virtually unchanged; 
a commendable performance when
taking into account the substantial
increases in material and energy
costs incurred during the year.
Balance sheet and cash flow
Cash flow from operations
amounted to £0.85m, stated after
meeting pension deficit funding
contributions of £1.09m (2005: net
inflow of £0.60m after pension
contributions of £1.24m).
Net cash outflow on fixed assets 
of £1.00m included the relocation 
of the Hong Kong office of Stadium
Asia Limited at a net cost of £0.2m.
There was further investment in
manufacturing plant and equipment
in Asia and the UK totalling £0.80m,
slightly ahead of the corresponding
depreciation charge.
The acquisition of KRP Power
Source (UK) Limited was completed
on 30 August 2006 at a total 
cost of £0.57m. This additional
investment in the business was
funded by drawing down net bank
loans of £2.70m, and resulted in
year end borrowings of £4.38m
(2005: £2.06m).
Pensions
The market value of the pension
scheme assets increased by 11%
during the year to exceed £22m. 
The net pension liability, measured
on a basis consistent with that 
used in the prior year, would 
have reduced from £4.86m to
approximately £3.0m. The directors,
in consultation with the scheme
actuary, have recognised more
recent guidance on expected
mortality rates. The effect of this
new guidance has resulted in 
an 8% increase to the scheme
liabilities before deferred tax
amounting to £2.04m, and a net
pension liability of £4.45m.
Acquisitions
During the year we completed 
the acquisition of KRP Power 
Source (UK) Limited for net cash
consideration of £0.57m. Since
completion on 30 August 2006 
the business has performed 
slightly ahead of our expectations
contributing an operating profit
(before goodwill amortisation) 
of £0.06m.
Further acquisition activity, focused
particularly on businesses with
product design, marketing and
distribution capabilities, remains 
a priority. 
Outlook
Current trading is ahead of the
corresponding period last year 
and the immediate outlook 
is encouraging.
We anticipate growth in revenues
and a further recovery in margins 
in 2007 , although sustained dollar
weakness against both Sterling 
and the Chinese Yuan may offset
the full effect of this improvement 
in reported earnings.

On 7 June 2005 Ken Leung exercised 25,000 options granted on 18 April 2002 at a price 
of 35 pence each. At that date the quoted share price was 81 pence resulting in a gain 
of £11,500.
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 8 The market price of ordinary shares at 
31 December 2006 was 59.5p, and the 
shares traded in the range 56p to 71p 
during the year. 
Full details of directors’ shareholdings and
options to subscribe are recorded in the
Register of Directors’ Interests, which is
open to inspection by members. 
Authority to purchase own shares
A resolution renewing the Company
authority to purchase its own issued ordinary
shares of 5 pence each will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting. This authority 
is limited to purchases through the London
Stock Exchange at a price of not less than 
5 pence per share and not more than 5%
above the average of the middle-market
quotations of the Company’s shares as
shown in the Alternative Investment Market
Daily Official List for the 10 business days
before the purchase is made, covering a
maximum number of 4,320,000 shares,
being approximately 15% of the Company’s 
present issued ordinary share capital.
The directors would not propose to exercise
the authority to make purchases unless the
expected effect of the purchase would be to
increase earnings per share of the remaining
shares in the capital of the Company, and
unless the purchase is generally in the 
best interest of shareholders. Any shares
purchased under this authority would be
treated as cancelled and the number of
shares in issue reduced accordingly. The
directors presently intend that a resolution 
to renew this authority will be proposed at
each succeeding Annual General Meeting.

70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 9 Financial risks
The financial risks experienced by the Group
are set out in detail in Note 15 to the
accounts on page 28.
The main risks faced are interest rate risk,
liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The
directors regularly review and agree policies
for managing these risks.
Foreign currency risk is managed by
matching payments and receipts in foreign
currency to minimise exposure. Foreign
currency is bought to match liabilities as 
they fall due where currency receipts are
insufficient to match the liability. The results
of Stadium Asia are reported in Hong Kong
dollars, as a result of this the Group’s
balance sheet can be affected by
movements in the Hong Kong dollar.
Liquidity risk is managed by the Group
maintaining undrawn overdraft borrowing
facilities in order to provide short term
flexibility.
Interest rate risk is managed by holding a
mixture of cash and borrowings in Sterling
and US dollars at floating rates of interest.
Payment of suppliers
It is the Company’s policy to pay all suppliers
within payment terms formally agreed on 
an individual basis. The average period of
credit taken during 2006 was 60 days 
(2005: 60 days).
Donations
The Group made charitable donations 
during the year amounting to £1,000 
(2005: £1,000). No contributions were 
made to any political organisation.
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee
communication and involvement through
representation by Works Committee, and
participation in schemes offering an element
of performance related remuneration. In
addition, the share option schemes outlined
in note 17 to the accounts offer employees
the opportunity to benefit from the future
development prospects of the Group.
It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair
consideration to all applications from
disabled persons, with due consideration
being given to respective aptitudes and
abilities. The same policy applies in the event
of employees who become disabled during
employment. Appropriate training is provided
where applicable.
Independent auditors
PKF (UK) LLP were appointed as auditors
during the year following the resignation 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
A resolution to reappoint PKF (UK) LLP as
auditors to the company will be proposed at
the annual general meeting. So far as each
of the directors is aware at the time the
report is approved:
● there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware, and
● the directors have taken all steps that
they ought to have taken to make
themselves aware of any such
information.

Directors’ report continued
STADIUM GROUP plc
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 10 The Directors
The board of directors, which leads and controls the company, has a formal schedule of
matters reserved for it, and consists of:
Non-executive chairman
Chief executive
Managing director – Electronics
Managing director – Stadium Asia
Senior independent director
The chairman and the senior independent director provide the appropriate balance between
the executive and non-executive directors, for a company of this size.
The board of directors take independent professional advice where necessary, at the
company’s expense. The board meets monthly, and the monthly management accounts and
other relevant information are circulated to all board members in advance of these meetings.
The consolidated group management accounts allow the performance of individual businesses
to be monitored against budget, previous forecasts and prior year actual results.
Existing directors are required to retire and submit themselves for re-election at least every
three years or at the first AGM after appointment. The appointment of new directors is
delegated to a nominations committee, which makes recommendations to the Board.
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of the non-executive directors, and its 
policy and the details of each director’s remuneration are clearly explained in its report 
on pages 13 and 14 and in note 5.
A proportion of the executive directors’ remuneration is structured so as to link rewards to
corporate and individual performance. The board will consider every year whether the report 
of the Remuneration Committee should be an item on the AGM agenda.
Relations with the shareholders
After the announcement of the interim and final results the directors meet the major
institutional and private shareholders to discuss trading and future developments. The board
encourages all shareholders to participate at the AGM. Corporate news and financial
information is provided on the company’s website at www.stadium.co.uk.
Combined Code
The board recognises that the Combined Code represents best practice for AIM-listed
companies, and regulates its activities with regard to the principles and provisions contained
therein.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and to
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and
hence for taking steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Corporate Governance
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 11 Statement of directors’ responsibilities (continued)
The directors understand their responsibility, under company law, to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company and the group at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group
for the year to that date, along with public information that gives a balanced and
understandable assessment of the company’s position and prospects. In preparing these
financial statements the directors have:
– selected suitable accounting policies and applied them consistently;
– made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– used applicable accounting standards;
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the website.
Internal control
The system of internal controls established by the directors is intended to be comprehensive,
although the limitations of any system of control is such that it is designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and it provides a reasonable,
rather than absolute, level of assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The principal features of the system of internal financial controls are:
– budgetary control over all operating units, measuring performance against pre-determined
targets on at least a monthly basis
– regular forecasting and reviews covering trading performance, assets, liabilities and cash
flows
– delegated limits of authority covering key financial commitments including capital
expenditure and recruitment
– identification and management of key business and inherent risks
– implementation and annual review of a group compliance manual.
The board continually reviews the effectiveness of other internal controls, including financial,
operational, compliance controls and risk management.
Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which comprises the non-executive directors, meets to consider the
scope and key issues in planning the external audit. The external auditors report their findings
and any recommendations to the Audit Committee prior to the approval of the financial
statements.
Going concern
The directors confirm that, after having made appropriate enquiries, they have a reasonable
expectation that the group and company have adequate resources to continue operating for
the foreseeable future. Accordingly the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in
the preparation of the accounts.

70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 12 I present, on behalf of the Remuneration Committee of the board of directors, a report on
executive remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2006.
All matters relating to the remuneration of the executive directors are dealt with by the
Remuneration Committee which comprises the two non-executive directors of the company.
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the executive directors are
fairly rewarded for their contribution to the overall performance of the group, and that their
remuneration is set in such a manner as to attract, retain and motivate suitable individuals with
due regard to the effect upon the operating costs of the company.
The Remuneration Committee considers all elements comprising executive remuneration,
including basic salary, annual performance related payments, benefits in kind, grants of share
options and other longer term performance related remuneration, pension provision and period
of contractual notice.
Basic entitlements
Each of the executive directors has a service contract which is subject to a notice period of
twelve months.
The executive directors are each paid a basic annual salary which is open to review each
January. In addition, the executive directors are entitled to annual performance related bonuses
which are dependent upon the attainment of specific financial targets. Further benefits in kind
are awarded as appropriate, including the provision of a company car and private medical
insurance.
Pension provision
The UK executive directors are members of the Stadium Group Retirement Benefits Plan
(1974), with benefits accruing at a rate at which they become entitled to a pension of two
thirds of final earnings at 60 years of age. Membership of the plan also provides a death in
service benefit of four times earnings and a widow’s pension of half the directors’ pension. 
The plan is contributory at the rate of 7 .5% (2005: 7 .5%).
Share options and other long term performance related payments
The executive directors are entitled to participate in the 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme
on the same terms as all other employees. In addition, executive directors have been granted
further options under this scheme which are normally exercisable after five years and are
subject to more stringent performance criteria. Details of these options are set out on page 8
and note 17 to the accounts.

Report of the Remuneration Committee 
on behalf of the Board
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 13 The executive directors participate in a long term incentive scheme which commenced on 
1 January 2006 and matures on 31 December 2008. Payments under the scheme are
dependent upon the level of real growth (adjusted for RPI changes) in fully diluted earnings 
per ordinary share, against a base point of pre-exceptional earnings per share from continuing
activities before goodwill amortisation.
Only current directors who continue to be employed on 1 January 2009 will receive any
payment. Payment will be determined according to the following scale:
Real EPS growth Bonus as a %
(after costs of scheme) of 2008 salary
<25% Nil
25% 25
each add. 1% up to 35% 2
35% 45
each additional 1% 3
Upper limit 100
There will be no substantive changes to the scheme in future without prior shareholder
approval. Copies of the terms of the scheme are available for inspection at the Registered
Office, Stephen House, Brenda Road, Hartlepool and will be available immediately prior to 
the Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration is determined by the board as a whole, and is set at
levels intended to attract individuals of an appropriate calibre.
Details of directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2006 are provided in 
note 5 to the accounts.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 14
Report of the Remuneration Committee 
on behalf of the Board continued
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 14 We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (‘the financial statements’)
of Stadium Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the consolidated
profit and loss account, the consolidated and company balance sheets, the consolidated cash
flow statement, the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses and the
related notes. The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section
235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom accounting standards (‘United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice’) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view
and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with
the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the directors’ report,
the unaudited part of the report of the remuneration committee, the chairman’s statement, the
chief executive’s review and the corporate governance statement. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
● the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the group’s and the parent
company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of the group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
● the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985; and
● the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

Consolidated cash flow statement
for the year ended 31 December 2006
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 19 Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries. Businesses
acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition
or until the effective date of disposal.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill is included within intangible assets, and amortised over its useful
economic life. In accordance with FRS 10 previously written off goodwill has not been
reinstated into the balance sheet, and is written back to the profit and loss account in the
event of a subsequent disposal.
Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided at rates
calculated to write down the cost of assets (excluding freehold land) over their estimated
useful lives by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
Freehold buildings 2%
Plant and machinery 10%-25%
Fixtures and equipment 10%-25%
Investments in subsidiary undertakings in the accounts of the Company are stated at cost less
provision for impairment.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
determined on a first in, first out basis including transport and handling costs and, in the case
of manufactured products, includes all direct expenditure and production overheads based on
normal levels of activity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to
pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance
sheet date. A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only
when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that
there will be suitable taxable surpluses from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.

for the year ended 31 December 2006
70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 20 Pension costs
Defined benefit scheme
Assets and liabilities arising from retirement benefit obligations and the related funding are
reflected at fair value in the financial statements, and operating and finance costs are
recognised in the financial periods in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from actuarial
experience during the accounting period are recognised in the Statement of total recognised
gains and losses. In the separate company accounts, the multi-employer scheme for which 
the net pension liability cannot be split between entities is accounted for as a defined
contribution scheme.
Defined contribution schemes
Contributions payable are charged to the profit and loss account in the accounting period in
which they are incurred.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the prevailing rate on the date
of the transaction.
Trading assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the rate prevailing at the year end. Gains and losses arising on the translation of foreign
currencies are dealt with as part of operating profit.
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at the
year end exchange rate. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of opening assets and
liabilities, and on long term financing denominated in foreign currency, are taken directly 
to reserves.
The profits and losses of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at the
average exchange rate prevailing during the year. Exchange differences arising are dealt with 
in reserves. 
Turnover
Turnover represents the value of invoiced sales of goods and services during the year, net of
value added tax and discounts. Invoices are raised when goods are despatched to customers
and title to the goods passes.

27 Annual Report and Accounts 2006
70011 NOTES NEW  17/3/07  6:56 am  Page 27 15 Derivatives and other financial instruments
Set out below are the narrative and numerical disclosures which the directors consider to be material, and
required by Financial Reporting Standard 25 “Financial Instruments – Disclosure and Presentation. ”
Narrative disclosures
Financial instruments:
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources
and various items such as trade debtors, trade creditors, etc. that arise directly from its operations. The main
purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the finance of the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments
shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign
currency risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised
below.
Interest rate risk:
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group holds
cash and borrows in Sterling and US dollars at floating rates of interest.
Liquidity risk:
As regards liquidity, the Group’s policy is to maintain undrawn overdraft borrowing facilities in order to provide
flexibility in the management of the Group’s liquidity. At the year end the Group had overdraft facilities of 
£2,482,000 (2005: £4,150,000) of which £1,434,000 was being used (2005: £1,758,000).
Foreign currency risk:
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by operating units
in currencies other than Sterling, being the Group’s functional currency. The Group matches payments and
receipts to minimise exposure, and buys the currency when the liability falls due.
The Group has one significant overseas business, Stadium Asia. As a result the Group’s balance sheet can be
affected by movements in Hong Kong dollars.
Numerical disclosures
Interest rate & currency profile of financial liabilities:
The Group’s financial liabilities are denominated in Sterling and HK$ and have floating interest rates. The floating
rate financial liabilities comprise:
•  Bank borrowings in HK$ that bear interest at bank base rate less 2%.
•  Loans and overdraft in Sterling that bear interest at rates based on bank base rates plus 1%.
Maturity of financial liabilities and undrawn facilities:
The maturity profile of the Group’s loans and overdrafts and undrawn facilities at 31 December 2006 was as
follows:
2006 2005
Liabilities Undrawn Liabilities Undrawn
£000’s £000’s £000’s £000’s

At 31 December 2006 the group had net borrowings denominated in HK$ of £503,000 (2005: £542,000).
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities:
Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities as at 31 December 2006.

In the opinion of the directors, there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of cash
and bank borrowings in view of their short term nature.

the Group expect to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years. The total amount
unrecognised is £1,367 ,000 (2005: £797 ,000). Future tax charges will be affected by the extent to which these
unprovided deferred tax assets are recognised.

24 Pension commitments
(a) The Group operates two principal pension schemes for current employees.
(i) The Stadium 1974 Pension Scheme
This is a defined benefit plan available to employees and executive directors, with active membership
at 31 December 2006 of 41 (1 January 2006: 46). It was closed to new entrants in 1995. During 2006
the Company paid total contributions of £1,261,000 and has agreed with the actuary to make
contributions at a similar level during 2007 , subject to further advice.
Pension costs attributable to this scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an
independent actuary using the projected unit method. The latest actuarial review considered the
position as at 7 April 2005, and assumed that the annual investment return would exceed salary
increases (including merit) by a margin of 3%. At 7 April 2005 the middle market value of the 
scheme assets was £17 ,167 ,000.
(ii) The Stadium 1996 Pension Plan
This is a defined contribution scheme with active membership at 31 December 2006 of 78
(1 January 2006: 90). The profit and loss account effect of this scheme, together with other minor
pension contributions made on a money purchase basis, was a cost of £60,000 (2005: £68,000).

Oil & Gas
New Build Jackup Drilling Rigs
Lamprell is ﬁrmly established as one 
of the world’s leading facilities for the 
construction of new build jackup 
drilling rigs.
With a highly sophisticated engineering 
capability and custom-built construction 
and load out facilities, Lamprell has 
gained a reputation as a reliable and 
professional builder of state-of-the-art 
drilling rigs. The Group has successfully 
delivered several LeTourneau 1 16E  
and Friede & Goldman Super M2 
jackup rigs to international and regional 
drilling operators.
New Build Offshore
Lamprell’s expertise in the new build 
offshore segment extends beyond 
jackup drilling rigs and covers a  
wide range of offshore ﬁxed and 
ﬂoating facilities. This includes the 
construction of process modules  
for ﬂoating production, storage and 
ofﬂoading units (“FPSOs”) and ﬂoating 
storage and regasiﬁcation units 
(“FSRUs”), tender assist drilling 
barges, mobile offshore production 
units (“MOPUs”), turrets, process & 
utility decks, living quarters (“LQ”), 
wellhead decks (“WH”) and other 
offshore ﬁxed structures. Lamprell’s 
New Build Offshore centre of 
excellence is one of the few facilities  
in the MENA region that has both the 
expertise and the capability in building 
large-scale complex process decks 
(+10,000 tonnes).
Rig Refurbishment
Since 1990, Lamprell has completed 
over 300 rig refurbishment projects. 
The rig refurbishment scope varies 
with every project and can range  
from a simple repair to a major 
docking lasting several months for  
the upgrade or replacement of older  
and sometimes damaged equipment 
and machinery.
The Company has successfully 
completed numerous refurbishment 
projects for drilling contractors, 
including Arabian Drilling Company, 
Ensco, Japan Drilling Company, 
Nabors, National Drilling Company, 
Noble Drilling, Rowan, Saipem 
and Transocean.

excellent project execution track 
record, certiﬁed systems & processes 
and strong engineering capabilities 
(providing engineering services from 
concept design to commissioning), 
Lamprell E&C delivers fully integrated

for land and offshore rigs. The Land 
Rig Services group operates from 
facilities in Hamriyah, Jebel Ali, Dubai 
Investments Park and Kuwait and also 
provides ﬁeld services as required.
Renewable Energy
Wind Farm Installation Vessels
Lamprell’s strategic goal of becoming 
the fabricator of choice in the growing 
wind farm installation market is 
endorsed by the experience and 
expertise that the Group has gained 
with the new build construction  
of wind turbine installation vessels  
for Seajacks and Fred. Olsen 
Windcarrier; two major companies  
in this expanding marketplace.
The offshore wind sector provides 
Lamprell with the opportunity  
to utilise its engineering skills in a 
sector where there is a recognised 
lack of installation capacity. Having 
constructed ﬁve high tech, specialised 
vessels for the European market and 
with one more currently under 
construction, Lamprell has the right 
skills and experience in this market. 05 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

maintained its competitive position 
and support from its customers  
by winning new contracts with an 
aggregate value in excess of USD 930 
million during 2012. Notably in our 
recent statement on 6 February 2013, 
we were pleased to announce that 
the Jindal Group had awarded  
a new contract to Lamprell for one 
conﬁrmed, together with one optional, 
jackup rig.
In another positive development, 
Lamprell signed a joint venture 
agreement for the fabrication, 
refurbishment and repair of land 
drilling rigs in Saudi Arabia, enhancing 
our strong presence in that market. 
We plan to leverage on our long-term 
relationships with our Saudi partners 
and our well-established expertise in 
the land rig sector.
Board and management changes
It has been a very busy year with 
changes both at the Board and at the 
management levels, some planned 
and others required in response to the 
events of 2012.
In October, Nigel McCue, Jon Cooper 
and Chris Hand stood down from 
their respective positions as Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer.  
At the same time, Peter Whitbread, 
who had previously served as 
Lamprell’s Chief Executive from 1992 
to 2009, was appointed to the Board 
as Interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.  
In November, Frank Nelson was 
appointed as Interim Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer. Their efforts have ensured a 
smooth transition of the stabilised 
business to the new management 
team led by James (Jim) Moffat, 
whose appointment as the new Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer was announced  
in early December. I am absolutely 
delighted that someone of Jim’s 
expertise and calibre has agreed  
to join our team. He assumed his 
responsibilities on 1 March 2013, and 
will bring the highest standards of 
leadership, engineering and project 
execution to Lamprell.
Business Review
Chairman’s Statement
A challenging year for Lamprell
At the time I took over as Lamprell’s 
Non-Executive Chairman in the 
middle of June 2012, the Company 
had already announced that there 
were signiﬁcant operational difﬁculties 
and delays in delivery of the wind farm 
installation vessel Windcarrier 1 Brave 
Tern. Unfortunately, as the Summer 
progressed, it became clear that the 
scale of these issues was far greater 
than previously anticipated, and that it 
affected other key contracts, including 
notably the Windcarrier 2 Bold Tern 
and the Caspian Sea jackup project.
On 3 October, the Board made the 
difﬁcult but necessary decision to 
replace the entire senior management 
team and directed the newly 
appointed, interim management team 
to reassess Lamprell’s business in 
light of the deteriorating ﬁnancial 
position. At the same time the Board 
appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers 
to conduct an independent review  
of the ﬁnancial performance of the 
underperforming projects. The results 
of this comprehensive assessment 
were announced on 19 November, 
revealing total projected losses far in 
excess of what had been previously 
anticipated or announced.
Despite the disappointing update, the 
Board worked closely with the interim 
management team to address the 
problems facing the business as 
efﬁciently and effectively as possible. 
During the following months, we 
made excellent progress in mitigating 
the losses from the underperforming 
key projects and stabilising the 
Group’s ﬁnancial position. With 
support from Lamprell’s lenders,  
we also began the process of 
restructuring the Group’s ﬁnancial 
arrangements which is expected to 
be completed in Q2 2013.
In spite of the setbacks of 2012, the 
durability of our industrial franchise 
continues to prove strong and  
our clients, especially our existing 
clients, have continued to place their 
trust in our ability to perform to high 
standards. As a result, Lamprell has 
2012 was unquestionably 
the most challenging year 
in Lamprell’s history. After 
years of sustained growth 
and proﬁtability, the 
Company experienced  
a number of signiﬁcant 
operational and reporting 
issues, which resulted  
in substantial ﬁnancial 
losses prompting the 
Board to make major 
changes to the way in 
which the business is 
structured and managed. 07 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
It was also pleasing that, after 
stepping down from his interim CEO 
role, Peter Whitbread has agreed  
to stay on as a Director to support 
Jim and his team in rebuilding the 
business and positioning it for  
future success.
Other Board changes in 2012 
included the retirement of Richard 
Raynaut and resignation of Brian 
Frederick as Directors, and the 
appointment of Deena Mattar as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 April 2012. Jonathan Silver 
stepped down from the position  
of Chairman to become Deputy 
Chairman, followed closely by  
my appointment on 15 June as 
Non-Executive Chairman.
Further Board changes will be taking 
place during the next few months.  
As a result of the considerable time 
commitment required of the Non-
Executive Directors during the past 
year, Colin Goodall and Deena Mattar 
have informed the Board that they will 
not be standing for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
A search is underway for additional 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
As a Board, it is our objective to 
deliver long-term, sustainable success 
for the beneﬁt of all Lamprell’s 
stakeholders. While there have been 
many changes at the most senior 
levels in the Company, I consider that 
the Board has reasserted its position 
to provide a clear direction and strong 
and effective leadership for the future 
of the business.
FSA investigation
In November 2012, Lamprell 
announced an investigation by the 
Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) 
into the Company’s handling of inside 
information. Having completed the 
investigation, the FSA imposed a ﬁne 
of approximately USD 3.7 million on 
Lamprell for failing in its obligations as 
a listed company to keep the market 
fully informed of its deteriorating 
ﬁnancial position during early 2012.
From early in 2012, Lamprell’s 
ﬁnancial performance began to 
deteriorate due to operational issues 
and to delays in completing key 
projects. It became clear that the 
Company’s systems did not allow 
management to assess fully the 
impact of these operational issues. 
Lamprell was, therefore, unable to 
update the market in a timely manner 
as to its ﬁnancial performance. When 
the extent of the ﬁnancial deterioration 
was recognised, the FSA concluded 
that Lamprell did not act sufﬁciently 
quickly to update the market or to 
prevent employees from continuing  
to deal in its shares once the inside 
information regarding the poor 
ﬁnancial performance had been 
recognised. The steps that the 
Company has taken to improve its 
systems and controls are set out in 
the Corporate Governance report.
Dividends
Given the post-tax losses in 2012, 
Lamprell will not pay a dividend  
for the year. We look into the future 
with optimism, and will review our 
dividend policy once the business 
returns to proﬁtability.
Outlook
As a result of the events of 2012,  
the Company has been forced to 
re-evaluate its business structure  
and the projects that it wishes to 
pursue. We have had to make many 
signiﬁcant changes to the business,  
to return to our core activities, but it  
is important to reafﬁrm the underlying 
strength of the Company’s franchise 
and its sustainable competitive 
advantages in the marketplace. As 
previously mentioned, the continued 
and ongoing support of our customers 
has been particularly heartening. 
On behalf of all the employees and 
Directors of Lamprell, I would like to 
express our appreciation.
Despite continued global 
macroeconomic uncertainty, demand 
for our products and services remains 
strong in the midst of a robust and 
expansive oil and gas industry. In 
particular, we see a steady stream of 
new build and refurbishment projects 
in our home market of the Middle  
East as well as increased activity in 
the North Sea. In recent years there 
have been signiﬁcant changes in our 
competitive landscape, in particular 
the entry of Asian players who can 
offer very competitive ﬁnancial 
incentives to clients. However, we  
are conﬁdent that Lamprell’s strong, 
historic track record of delivery and 
continued commitment to quality 
positions the Company well to beneﬁt 
from continued growth in the oil  
and gas industry. Our current order 
book of USD 1.3 billion and the bid 
pipeline of USD 4.1 billion collectively 
represent a solid foundation for the 
business to grow in the coming years.
In light of the above, I sincerely believe 
that Lamprell can look forward to 
2013 and beyond with renewed 
conﬁdence. During 2013, we will be 
focusing on our traditional areas of 
strength, namely new build jackup 
rigs, rig refurbishment and offshore 
platform construction. With the strong 
bidding activity across the business  
in these areas, we expect this year to 
show signs of stability returning with 
the ﬁrst shoots of growth appearing 
towards the end of the year.
On behalf of the Board, I would like  
to thank all of Lamprell’s stakeholders 
and in particular our employees for 
their continued trust and support 
during these challenging times.

Consolidating 
our position
Although our yards remained busy throughout 2012 
and generated revenues for the year of USD 1,045 
million, the Group suffered a loss before tax and 
exceptional items of USD 105 million as a result  
of a series of operational hurdles, the failure to 
appreciate certain project risk and project delays. 
The challenges that Lamprell 
experienced in 2012 led to major 
changes within the Company, including 
a complete change of leadership  
and a comprehensive review of our 
projects and operations. With a new 
management team in place and a 
number of improvements to our 
business processes underway, we are 
now conﬁdent that Lamprell is well 
placed to overcome these challenges 
and leverage its leading market position 
to return to proﬁtability.
2012 challenges/overview
Starting in mid-2012, Lamprell 
experienced signiﬁcant delays  
on several of its largest projects, 
including the wind farm installation 
vessels Windcarrier 1 and 2 for Fred 
Olsen, as well as the jackup rig that 
was built in modular form in the UAE 
and is being assembled at a facility  
in Astrakhan, Russia. As the year 
progressed, it became clear that 
these delays would result in material 
ﬁnancial losses. However, the 
previous management team struggled 
to quantify the losses or prevent the 
situation from deteriorating further.
As a result of the departure of the 
previous senior management team  
in October 2012, Lamprell’s Board 
asked me to rejoin on an interim basis 
to assess the full extent of the issues 
Business Review
Chief Executive’s Review 09 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
facing the Company, and to help 
stabilise its operations while it recruited 
a new, permanent management team. 
With the Board’s support, the interim 
management team conducted a 
comprehensive assessment of 
Lamprell’s operations, with a primary 
focus on the key underperforming 
projects and their effect on the  
Group’s ﬁnancial position. The results  
of the assessment, published on  
19 November 2012, revealed a series  
of operational and ﬁnancial issues 
contributing to major losses in 2012.
One of the cornerstones of Lamprell’s 
success has always been its rigorous 
approach to project execution. Since 
my retirement as Lamprell’s CEO in 
2009, the Company’s business has 
undergone signiﬁcant change; over 
the past several years, the Company’s 
operations have grown signiﬁcantly  
as the Group has taken on a number 
of increasingly large and complex 
projects. This has generated higher 
revenues but the growth came at  
a price as the Company’s existing 
project management systems were 
unable to cope with these larger 
projects of a prototype nature. This 
left Lamprell struggling to fulﬁl its 
commitments to its stakeholders.
Having established the scale of the 
problems and identiﬁed key areas  
of weakness, my team negotiated 
revised delivery schedules for the key 
underperforming projects still under 
construction, and fully focused its 
efforts on their completion under these 
new terms. In spite of the ﬁnancial 
setbacks arising from certain key 
projects, Lamprell continued to deliver 
major projects to a consistently high 
standard, including the ﬁrst two new 
build jackup rigs to NDC, as well as the 
Seajacks “Zaratan” and the Windcarrier 
1 Brave Tern liftboats. Most recently, 
and perhaps most signiﬁcantly, the 
Group fulﬁlled its promises to deliver  
the Windcarrier 2 Bold Tern vessel to 
the client in mid-February 2013. This 
only became possible as a result of 
improved project management and 
strict ﬁnancial controls, as well as the 
dedication and commitment of the 
project team who worked tirelessly  
on this complex project.
New contract awards
The recent operating environment has 
been demanding, both because of 
the Company’s internal issues which 
we are now resolving and also due  
to the increasingly competitive nature 
of the sectors in which the Company 
operates. Nevertheless, the Company 
managed to maintain the support  
of its clients and was awarded more 
than USD 930 million in new contract 
wins during 2012. This included 
various, major new build projects in 
both the oil and gas industry, such as 
two more fully outﬁtted and equipped 
LeTourneau rigs for our key client, 
NDC, and the fabrication of two 
topsides and jackets for a new client, 
and the renewables sector where 
Seajacks awarded us a new contract 
for a fourth liftboat vessel, of a similar 
design as those already delivered 
to Seajacks.
The rig refurbishment market for both 
the onshore and offshore segments 
remained positive in 2012, which 
allowed Lamprell to win multiple 
orders for jackup rig upgrade and 
refurbishment projects. This has 
historically been a keystone for our 
franchise and we continue to be the 
regional leader by market share for 
this type of business.
Saudi Arabia joint venture
In another positive development, in 
September 2012 Lamprell signed a joint 
venture agreement with Shoaibi Group, 
a Saudi industry and energy services 
provider, and Al Yusr Townsend and 
Bottum, a Saudi integrated logistical 
services provider, to form Lamprell 
Arabia Ltd. The joint venture, which  
will be based in the oil-rich Eastern 
province of Saudi Arabia, intends to 
establish a presence for fabrication, 
refurbishment and repair of land drilling 
rigs. I am excited by the opportunities 
presented by the joint venture which 
builds on the Group’s existing business 
in a country where we foresee extensive 
needs for such services, which are a 
core part of our offering.
Our people
Our employees are the foundation of 
our business. Their hard work over 
the past four decades has built 
Lamprell into the business we are 
proud of today, and their wellbeing is 
essential for the continued success of 
our Company. Since my return to the 
business in October 2012, a primary 
focus has been to re-energise the 
workforce, with a view to improving 
morale and thereby increasing 
productivity. These efforts have 
produced results such as delivery  
of the Windcarrier 2 vessel on the 
promised revised delivery date.
At the same time, we have been 
forced to take some tough decisions 
to control costs in the Group at a time 
when it was struggling ﬁnancially.  
This put additional pressure on our 
operations and has been a delicate 
balance to manage. However, once 
we re-established control over the  
key operational issues, we have  
been able to reassure our staff of  
the attractiveness of Lamprell as an 
employer. Today, Lamprell employs 
over 11,000 staff.
Ongoing changes and outlook
In 2012 we encountered numerous 
operational and ﬁnancial problems, 
which forced us to reassess how  
we run our business. The interim 
management team has introduced 
new initiatives aimed at strengthening 
Lamprell’s project reporting systems, 
organisational structure, ﬁnancial 
controls and risk management. One 
such initiative was the introduction of 
a new organisational structure which 
prioritised project management and 
aligned project execution with the 
Group’s reporting structures.
These initiatives will take some time  
to bed down into the business but,  
as I pass the mantle of leadership to 
the permanent CEO, James Moffat,  
I am proud of the genuine progress 
that we have made over the last six 
months and I believe that the outlook 
for our business remains strong for 
2013 and beyond.

Chief Executive’s Review
As I join Lamprell as its 
new Chief Executive,  
I see a business with  
an attractive regional 
footprint and signiﬁcant 
potential where several, 
very serious issues 
undermined its ﬁnancial 
health in 2012 and 
threatened its ability to 
win and execute work. 
Despite this, the Company 
managed to retain the 
trust of its clients and its 
leading market position 
and that is a testament to 
the fundamentals of this 
business and its historic 
ability to execute projects.
Improving
our performance 11 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Security (“HSES”), in particular safety, 
has always been a core value for me. 
Hence I was pleased to see that, 
despite the operational challenges 
faced by the Group in 2012 as well  
as increasing the total number of 
manhours worked to over 37 million, 
Lamprell maintained and in fact 
improved its strong safety track record. 
The total recordable incident rate 
(“TRIR”) in 2012 declined by nearly 80% 
over 201 1, having already improved by 
58% in 201 1 over the previous year. 
This is a signiﬁcant achievement.
Given the nature of our business there 
are inherently signiﬁcant health, safety 
and environment risks and despite our 
recent successes we must continue  
to improve. To this end, I have already 
tasked the management to implement 
several new HSES strategic objectives 
and key initiatives such as personal 
HSES contracts and hazard 
identiﬁcation, which I expect to deliver 
results during 2013. Across the Group,  
I will be driving a culture where HSES 
will be a key consideration in making 
everyday decisions, both at a corporate 
and at an individual level.
The interim management team has 
done a great deal to stabilise Lamprell’s 
operations and ﬁnancial position after 
the events of 2012. Our key priority  
this coming year is to implement and 
complete the initiatives introduced by 
them, in order to avoid similar issues  
in the future, and to position the 
Company for the next stage in its 
development. We will continue to 
improve operations by increasing focus 
on risk management, project execution 
and ﬁnancial controls.
I would like to thank Peter and  
his team for their efforts during the 
challenging transition period, and  
I look forward to working closely with 
them to rebuild Lamprell’s reputation 
for operational excellence and 
proﬁtable growth.

Operational Highlights
Despite the signiﬁcant challenges 
faced by the Group in 2012, 
Lamprell’s operational capabilities  
and the fundamental processes and 
principles upon which it operates 
resulted in the successful completion 
of several landmark projects, the 
achievement of key milestones  
and the award of signiﬁcant new 
contracts. The Group continued  
to focus on growing its reputation  
for delivering high quality work and 
has consolidated its competitive 
advantage within its core business. 
The Company continued to develop 
its project controls to enhance  
its ﬁnancial performance and  
project execution and to improve the 
processes and systems that will drive 
our performance.

Highlights by business sectors
New Build Jackup Drilling Rigs
Lamprell consolidated its position as a 
leading international builder of jackup 
drilling rigs in the sub-350ft class with 
a total of 12 new build rigs completed 
since the Group entered this segment 
ﬁve years ago. Lamprell is currently 
constructing eight more LeTourneau 
Super 116E class design jackup rigs, 
for a number of its existing customers.
Wind Farm Installation Vessels
Despite the challenges faced on the 
Fred Olsen Windcarrier vessels, the 
projects remain worthy of mention 
given their prototype design and their 
scale. Each weighed more than 
15,000 tonnes at delivery and they 
were the ﬁrst wind farm installation 
vessels of their size to be built in the 
region, and the largest vessels ever to 
be built by the Group. At load out, the 
“Brave Tern” and its sister vessel the 
“Bold Tern” represented the largest 
transport moves on wheels ever to 
take place in the Middle East.
The Group’s award of a fourth vessel by 
Seajacks, the “Hydra” , further reinforced  
its strong position in the wind turbine 
installation segment. The “Hydra” is  
a repeat design of the ﬁrst generation  
of smaller vessels that the Company 
successfully delivered on time and budget 
(Seajacks “Kraken” and “Leviathan”).
New Build Offshore Facilities
With the capability to build large-scale 
complex process decks (more than 
10,000 tonnes), Lamprell’s expertise 
in the new build offshore segment 
covers a wide range of offshore ﬁxed 
and ﬂoating facilities. Progress on the 
construction of an offshore topside 
structure comprising a two level utility 
deck and a ﬁve level accommodation 
module for a leading integrated 
energy provider continued on 
schedule as did construction on the 
Nexen Petroleum project (wellhead 
and a Production, Utilities and 
Quarters (“PUQ”) deck). Both projects 
are currently proceeding on schedule 
and on budget.

Operational Highlights
Upgrade and refurbishment of 
offshore jackup rigs
Lamprell maintained its reputation  
as the region’s leading rig upgrade 
and refurbishment facility with the 
completion of over 300 upgrade and 
refurbishment projects representing  
a regional market share in excess  
of 60%. Recent notable projects 
included the “Noble George McLeod” 
and the “Noble Jimmy Puckett” for 
Noble Drilling; Rig “657” for Nabors 
and the “Rowan Gilbert Rowe”  
for Rowan Drilling along with the 
Hercules 266 among others. The 
combined work scope on these 
projects included, but was not limited  
to, living quarter upgrades and 
refurbishment, as well as high 
volumes of class driven work such  
as structural steel renewal, piping 
replacement, machinery upgrades, 
recertiﬁcation and painting. In addition, 
many customers approach Lamprell  
for its expertise in the stringent “Saudi 
Aramco Schedule G” compliance 
which allows rigs to operate offshore 
Saudi Arabia. In recent months, similar 
projects have been awarded to 
Lamprell on a repeat basis by these 
same, existing customers.
Land Rig Services
In addition to the two new build land 
drilling rigs delivered to Weatherford, 
the Land Rig Services business unit 
focused its activities on land rig 
upgrade and refurbishment and the 
inspection and overhaul of mechanical 
and rotary equipment. A major 
milestone was the successful 
completion of NDC’s rig “ND 32”, the 
“walking rig”. The Group has recently 
expanded its Land Rig Services 
business into Saudi Arabia through 
the establishment of the “Lamprell 
Arabia” joint venture. This will be a  
key focus for this business unit over 
the coming few years because of  
the anticipated levels of land rig 
refurbishment work which will be 
required in Saudi Arabia.
Service businesses
The Group continued to see demand 
for its service business offerings across 
a range of complementary markets. 
The Group has a strong regional market 
presence through O&M, INSPEC  
and Sunbelt services, which offer  
a substantially different proﬁle to the 
core new build operations. 15 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

HSES performance
Lamprell has always held itself to  
the highest HSES standards. In 2012, 
the Group achieved some signiﬁcant 
HSES milestones across some of the 
more complex projects, including the 
achievement of 1 million manhours 
without lost time incident (“LTI”) on  
the “Jindal Star” jackup drilling rig, the 
completion of the “Greatdrill Chaaya” 
with 3.9 million manhours without a 
single LTI, the completion of NDC 
“Makasib” and “Muhaiyimat” with 3.4 
and 4.1 million manhours without LTI 
respectively, among others. Even in 
relation to the underperforming key 
contracts, Lamprell’s commitment  
to safety was paramount and self-
evident as can be seen by the fact 
that the Windcarrier “Brave Tern” 
windfarm vessel was delivered after 
4.9 million manhours without a single 
LTI. This strong HSES performance is 
reﬂected in the Group’s overall results 
with the achievement of a combined 
LTI Frequency Rate of 0.22.
To build on this safety track record 
and to ensure consistency across  
all divisions and branches, the  
Group further expanded its Safety 
Observation Audit Programme 
(“SOAP”) by adding the Work Area 
Safety Hazard system (“WASH”) to 
assist workers to identify potential 
hazards at an early stage. Both 
systems will eventually lead to the 
launch of a new internal HSES identity 
programme entitled “Nothing to 
Chance” which will encompass  
all aspects of internal HSES 
management, training, processes  
and communication in order to further 
engage the workforce with HSES.
Quality
Lamprell’s reputation is founded  
upon its ability to deliver high quality 
projects to its customers on time and 
on budget and is focused on ensuring 
delivery of its existing contracts. 
Lamprell aims to achieve maximum 
customer satisfaction and quality of 
product and service. The Company 
achieves this objective through 
compliance with all national  
and international standards and 
requirements with respect to quality 
assurance and through ensuring 
cost-effective jobs and services, and 
delivery on time. Lamprell achieves 
this by understanding customer 
requirements, working together  
with our customers to meet those 
requirements, understanding our 
processes well and monitoring and 
measuring our activities.
To address some of the challenges 
faced in 2012, the Group continued to 
take measures to improve its systems 
and processes. The Group has 
reorganised the project management 
team to allow further control by the 
respective project manager on the 
landmark long-term projects. This key 
change will make project managers 
more accountable for their respective 
projects while enabling senior 
management to have greater  
visibility of individual projects,  
thereby improving project controls 
and reporting. The Company also 
strengthened the systems controlling 
key vendor deliveries and, under the 
leadership of a new Vice President  
for Procurement and Supply Chain,  
is working to ensure that new 
contracts and orders are currently 
being received in accordance with 
agreed delivery schedules. The 
restructuring of the Group’s core 
engineering function headed by a new 
Vice President for Engineering, has 
also helped to address some of the 
engineering-related challenges faced 
in 2012.

Risk Assessment
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board recognises that Lamprell’s 
business is potentially exposed to 
many different risks but believes that 
there are some business risks which 
can be accepted by the Group 
provided that acceptance of such 
risks creates value for the Group and 
that the risks are properly managed. 
On that basis, the Board and 
management take steps to identify 
and evaluate the inherent risks, 
thereby enabling better management 
and mitigation of their impact on the 
business. Risk management, being 
critical to achieving the Group’s 
strategic objectives and stakeholders’ 
expectations, is coordinated by senior 
managers in the Group with the 
overall responsibility residing with the 
Board. Outlined below is a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group, together with the 
mitigating actions or circumstances.
The process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the signiﬁcant risks 
faced by the Group is ongoing and, in 
light of the events of 2012, the Board 
has tasked the new management 
team to refresh the risk management 
processes. These risk management 
systems cannot completely eliminate 
risks and thus there can never be an 
absolute assurance against the Group 
failing to achieve its objectives or a 
material loss arising. In the Board’s 
regular review of the Group’s strategic 
plans, consideration is given to those 
risks which have been identiﬁed as 
potential impediments to achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives. The 
management will, where practicable, 
deploy strategies to mitigate or 
transfer risks, such as, for example, 
the purchase of insurance, the 
development of contractual 
mechanisms to limit liabilities, and  
the employment of expertise either 
in-house or externally sourced to 
manage potential hazards.
The risk factors below are not 
intended to be presented in any 
assumed order of priority. Any of the 
risks and uncertainties discussed in 
this document could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s 
business. In addition, the risks set  
out below may not be exhaustive and 
additional risks and uncertainties, not 
presently known to the Company, or 
which the Company currently deems 
immaterial, may arise in the future.  
In particular, the Company’s 
performance might be affected by 
changes in market and/or economic 
conditions and in legal, regulatory and 
tax requirements. 17 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Financial and 
economic risks 
(Detailed 
analysis of the 
ﬁnancial risks 
can be found on 
pages 69 to 72)
Availability of 
financing
If the Company is unable to ﬁnd ﬁnancing 
for its future projects, the business will  
not grow.
The Company has the support of its lender 
group and is continuing discussions with 
the various lenders for the reﬁnancing of its 
debt, with a view to securing a longer-term 
ﬁnancial platform to fund future growth and 
also, in the short term, to ensure that there 
is no impact on operations in the meantime.
Liquidity risk There is a risk that the Company is unable 
to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they  
fall due.
Management maintains adequate levels of 
liquidity in the form of cash and committed 
credit facilities. It also manages the cash 
ﬂow exposure proactively and very regularly.
The ﬁnancial assets are spread across 
multiple, creditworthy ﬁnancial institutions.
Counterparty 
credit risk
The Company will suffer ﬁnancial or 
commercial exposure resulting from the 
failure of key institutions, customers, 
partners or subcontractors.
Before entering into major contracts, the 
Company may undertake credit checks 
with a view to determining the risk of 
counterparty default. It has also developed 
close relationships with key suppliers to 
ensure early identiﬁcation of problems and 
to react quickly.
Geopolitical risk, 
changes to fiscal 
regime(s)
The Company operates in markets where 
legal systems are still developing and which 
do not offer the certainty or predictability of 
legal systems in mature markets. Changes 
could adversely impact the ﬁnancial 
condition of the Group.
The majority of the Company’s business 
and personnel are located in the UAE which 
is a very stable ﬁscal regime with minimal 
taxation and with international standards  
of living and conducting business.
Equity financing 
risks
The Group may, in the longer term, seek to 
raise further funds through the issue of 
additional shares or other securities. Any 
funds raised in this way may have a dilutive 
effect on existing shareholdings.
The Board considers that it must be able  
to avail of all options to fund growth in the 
business, whichever is determined to be in 
the best interests of the business including 
equity ﬁnancing, if required.

Operational 
risks
Project delivery Failure to deliver on time and/or on budget 
may subject the Company to ﬁnancial or 
commercial risks under the contract with 
customers and/or reputational damage to 
Lamprell’s franchise.
There are also risks attached to delays 
caused by our subcontractors or suppliers, 
which will have a knock-on impact to our 
delivery schedule with the end client.
Lamprell operates a system of procedures 
and project reviews which, combined with 
management oversight, rigorous contract 
management and internal audit, aim to 
mitigate any risk of unsuccessful project 
delivery and to improve efﬁciencies.
The Company has developed long and 
stable relationships with customers and 
suppliers evidencing the strong track 
record of successful project execution in 
our core competencies. The Company will 
not compete for prototype projects, but 
rather will focus on projects which are 
well-understood and where the risks can 
be managed more effectively.
Human capital 
risks
There are currently signiﬁcant challenges  
to attract and retain sufﬁcient numbers of 
skilled personnel, on whose performance 
the Company depends for success; if it 
loses any of these key personnel, the 
overall business may be impaired.
The Company’s ability to perform its 
contractual obligations may be adversely 
affected by inﬂation and rising labour costs, 
as well as by work stoppages and other 
labour problems.
By using market-based compensation 
levels and providing an appealing work 
environment conducive to development  
of individual skills and experience, the 
Company seeks to implement a clear HR 
strategy designed to align the business 
strategy with the goal of attracting, 
developing and retaining the best people 
for Lamprell.
A key differentiator for many staff is that the 
Company is based in and principally 
operates out of the UAE which generally 
has high living standards.
Business 
disruption
The Company could be subject to 
substantial liability claims due to the 
hazardous nature of its business, such as 
ﬁre and ﬂood, and this potentially can delay 
or disrupt operations. Certain countries in 
which the Company’s customers operate 
have experienced armed conﬂict, terrorism 
or civil disorder.
Hazards are managed through prevention, 
mitigation, continuity planning and risk 
transfer through the purchase of insurance.
The Company monitors closely the 
changing landscape of political risk, 
particularly high risk countries.
Contractual 
commitments
Warranty claims
The Company could be exposed to liability 
to customers under contractual provisions 
(resulting from product defects, faulty 
workmanship or errors in design as well as 
warranty claims and other liabilities, or from 
a failure to identify and report possible 
contractual risks) that may materially and 
adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
The Company seeks to mitigate these risks 
through the operation of working practices 
and processes designed to deliver high 
quality products and services, as well  
as seeking contractual limits to its liability,  
and maintaining an appropriate insurance 
programme. All signiﬁcant contracts are 
reviewed internally prior to submission to 
the client.
HSES risks The Company conducts its business within 
an increasingly strict environmental and 
health and safety framework and may be 
exposed to potential liabilities and 
increased compliance costs.
The Company takes all reasonable steps  
to ensure that the right people doing the 
right job to a high quality. It maintains  
high standards in these important areas 
through effective HSES leadership and 
organisational arrangements, together with 
appropriate policies and planning, which 
are all in place to deliver a strong culture  
of safety awareness.

Risk Assessment 19 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Headline risk Potential impact that we face How we protect the business
Strategic risks
Competitive 
environment, 
cyclical market
Demand for the Company’s services may 
be adversely impacted by a fall in the levels 
of expenditure by existing customers, or in 
the market in general.
Equally, the Company operates in a highly 
competitive industry, both regionally and 
from international competitors.
We market the Company on the basis of its 
ability to provide and service high quality 
products and systems.
The Company has developed long-term 
and stable relationships with customers. 
Existing customers have often awarded 
new contracts to the Company, showing 
the underlying strength of the business.
The Company operates in both the oil &  
gas and the renewables sectors. We are 
continually seeking to differentiate our offering 
by reviewing our competitive advantage and 
targeting customers accordingly.
Fluctuations in 
order book
Over-reliance on 
limited number of 
customers
The Company operates on a project-by-
project basis for major contracts and it 
does not have long-term commitments with 
the majority of its customers, which may 
cause its visible order book to ﬂuctuate 
signiﬁcantly (particularly in relation to rig 
refurbishment work).
The Company is dependent on a relatively 
small number of signiﬁcant contracts at any 
given time, some of which are with the 
same customers.
Given the amount of repeat business  
from many of our existing clients, this is 
testament to the Company’s ability to 
consistently deliver high quality products 
and systems.
This risk is addressed by seeking to 
improve the balance in the business 
portfolio between clients, service offerings 
and sectors, crossing both the oil & gas 
and the renewables sectors.
Mergers and 
acquisitions
A failure to identify, complete and 
successfully integrate target acquisitions 
represents a brake on growth and can also 
impact morale among employees.
Lamprell has taken various steps to 
integrate MIS (which was acquired in 2011) 
into its business, including rebranding, 
alignment of remuneration packages 
among employees and regular 
communication from senior management 
to all levels of staff.
Compliance 
and legal risks
Major shareholder Lamprell Holdings Ltd, the entity holding  
a major shareholding in the Company,  
may have interests which conﬂict with  
the interests of other stakeholders.
Lamprell Holdings Ltd.’s shareholding  
has been stable for years and is a stated 
long-term strategic shareholder in  
the Company.
Breach of ethics A substantive breach of the Lamprell code 
of conduct and/or non-compliance with 
laws or regulations may potentially lead to 
damage to the business, reputation and 
even to claims for compensation or ﬁnes.
Lamprell has implemented a number of 
enterprise-wide policies and procedures to 
prevent and/or mitigate the likelihood of any 
breach or non-compliance including by way of 
example updating the anti-bribery policy, internal 
audit reviews and ethics training programmes. 
Further measures are expected to be taken 
during 2013 and beyond.
The Board and management will take all 
appropriate action for any breach of the 
Company’s ethical standards.

Signiﬁcant operational 
issues and delays on a 
number of Lamprell’s 
large projects adversely 
affected the Group’s 
ﬁnancial performance in 
2012, resulting in a loss 
before income tax and

year of USD 105.0 million, 
as we anticipated in our 
announcement to 
shareholders in 
November 2012.
Our ﬁnancial 
recovery 
underway 21 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Results from operations
In 2012, Lamprell’s Group total 
revenue was down on the previous 
year to USD 1,045.5 million (2011: 
USD 1,147 .9 million). Revenue arises 
from various business streams with 
the majority generated from new  
build construction projects, which 
included 10 new build jackup rigs, 
four liftboats for the offshore wind 
farm installation sector and two  
land rigs. Revenue from new build 
fabrication projects across the Group 
decreased by 29% to USD 560.0 
million (2011: USD 789.7 million).
The reduction in new build revenue  
was driven primarily by the renewables 
segment, which saw a substantial 
reduction to USD 66.4 million (201 1: 
USD 289. 1 million). This segment 
suffered not only from lower levels  
of activity but also from the Group’s 
contractual obligations to pay liquidated 
damages for delays in delivery to  
a number of signiﬁcant projects,  
in particular the Windcarrier 1 and 
Windcarrier 2 wind farm installation 
vessels which were deducted from  
the ﬁnal value of the contract.
The revenues for the Company’s  
new build oil & gas segment, which 
comprises the fabrication and 
construction of offshore jackup and 
land rigs, were broadly in line with the 
previous year, totalling USD 493.6 
million compared to USD 500.6 million 
in 2011. The small decline in revenues 
in this segment was a result of the 
Caspian Sea jackup rig project where, 
as announced by the Company in 
November 2012, there were delays 
which deferred revenues for that 
project from 2012 to 2013.
The Group has historically performed 
well in the ﬁeld of rig refurbishment 
(which includes both repair and 
maintenance as well as rig upgrades). 
However the 2012 revenues for this 
segment were impacted by lower 
volumes following a strong 
performance experienced in 201 1, 
resulting in USD 176.9 million in revenue 
for the year (201 1: USD 191.0 million).
On a more positive note, the Group’s 
offshore platform construction 
business saw signiﬁcantly higher 
levels of revenue during the year 
following the award of two large 
projects. Revenue in this segment 
increased from USD 52.5 million in 
2011 to USD 179.7 million in 2012.
Other revenue increased to 
USD 128.9 million (2011: USD 114.6 
million) driven by additional revenue 
streams from the other businesses 
that were acquired in 2011 as part  
of the MIS group of companies.
Group’s losses for 2012
Delays and cost overruns caused by 
operational issues on a number of 
major projects resulted in a gross loss 
of USD 19.6 million for the year (2011: 
proﬁt of USD 132.9 million), and a 
corresponding negative gross margin 
of 1.9% (2011: positive 11.5%). The 
major components of this loss, which 
are in line with the Company’s 
announcement to shareholders in 
November 2012, relate to the following 
key projects:
> Windcarrier 1 “Brave Tern”: 
USD 36.3 million;
> Windcarrier 2 “Bold Tern”: 
USD 32.5 million;
> Seajacks “Zaratan”: USD 7 .1 million;
> Caspian Sea jackup project: 
USD 25.8 million;
> Minor EPC projects: USD 12.0 million.
The operating loss for the year before 
exceptional items and income tax was 
USD 84.5 million (201 1: proﬁt of 
USD 90.2 million before exceptional 
items) and includes marginally higher 
overhead costs resulting primarily from 
changes in the executive management 
team, the consulting fees associated 
with the external review of the business 
and an impairment of USD 4.4 million in 
relation to the continued implementation 
of the Group’s ERP system together 
with certain lease-hold rights. These 
costs are partially offset by the effect of 
other income including a one-off gain of 
USD 4.3 million in relation to an 
insurance claim.
EBITDA for the year before exceptional 
items was negative USD 62.3 million 
(201 1: positive USD 100.8 million before 
exceptional items). The EBITDA margin 
declined from 8.8% in 201 1 to a 
negative 6.0% in 2012, reﬂecting the 
operating performance of the business.
Finance costs
Net ﬁnance costs in the 2012 period 
increased to USD 21.5 million (2011: 
USD 16.2 million). This increase is 
largely the result of the banking 
facilities relating to the acquisition of 
MIS, utilisation of new facilities and 
increased facility and guarantee 
charges related to new contract 
awards in the year.
Taxation
The tax charge of USD 0.8 million in 
2012 is in respect of tax on the Group’s 
service operations in Kazakhstan and 
Qatar acquired in 201 1 as part of the 
MIS group of companies (201 1: 
USD 0.2 million). The Group is not 
currently subject to income tax in 
respect of its operations which are 
substantially undertaken in the UAE, 
and the Company does not anticipate 
any liability to income tax arising on 
these operations in the foreseeable 
future. The Company, which is 
incorporated in the Isle of Man, had no 
income tax liability, or beneﬁt for the 
year ended 31 December 2012, as it is 
taxable at a 0% rate in line with the local 
tax legislation.
Net loss and loss per share
The Group recorded a loss before 
income tax and exceptional items for 
the year of USD 105.0 million (2011: 
proﬁt before exceptional items of 
USD 74.0 million) in line with our 
expectation as announced in 
November and the operating losses 
noted above.
The fully diluted loss per share amounts 
to 42.45 cents (201 1: earnings per share 
before exceptional items of 26.47 cents) 
reﬂecting the operational performance 
of the Group for the year.

Capital expenditure
Following signiﬁcant investment in 201 1 
resulting from the completion of our 
Hamriyah facility, and as a result of 
losses made during 2012, the Group 
had reduced capital expenditure i 
n 2012. Expenditure on property,  
plant and equipment during the  
year amounted to USD 16.8 million 
(201 1: USD 55.5 million). The main 
areas of expenditure were buildings and 
related infrastructure at Group facilities 
(including capital work in progress 
completions) amounting to USD 8.2 
million (201 1: USD 26.0 million) and 
operating equipment of USD 6.5 million 
(201 1: USD 9.9 million).
Balance sheet
Total non-current assets at the end  
of 2012 were USD 390.4 million  
(2011: USD 417 .1 million), which  
have been negatively impacted by a 
USD 9.5 million decrease in the net 
book value of property, plant and 
equipment and a USD 11.0 million 
decrease in identiﬁed intangible 
assets due to higher depreciation  
and amortisation charges following 
the completion of the MIS acquisition 
and the minor impairment of 
intangibles referenced above.
Trade and other receivables decreased 
to USD 398.3 million (201 1: USD 668.8 
million) as a result of a number of 
successful project completions,  
namely the disposal of Hull 108  
and the completion of the Seajacks 
“Zaratan” project, and the improved 
debtor management within the 
business. The working capital position 
improved signiﬁcantly in the last quarter 
of 2012 as the Group’s collection of 
trade debtors and other receivables 
improved and accordingly the Group 
ended the year with a strong net cash 
position of USD 104. 1 million (201 1: net 
debt of USD 101.7 million).
Exceptional items in these ﬁnancial 
statements relates to a regulatory  
ﬁne recorded in the relevant year 
amounting to GBP 2.43 million 
(equivalent USD 3.72 million converted 
at an exchange rate of USD 1.53 per 
GBP) and related legal expenses of 
USD 1.0 million. In the prior year, 
exceptional items related to the 
acquisition of MIS.
Operating cash ﬂow and liquidity
The Group’s net cash ﬂow from 
operating activities for the year 
reﬂected a net inﬂow of USD 250.7 
million (2011: net outﬂow of USD 54.6 
million) generated by a combination  
of successful post-MIS project 
completions, in particular the sale 
proceeds of Hull 108 for USD 126.5 
million in May 2012, and improved 
working capital management. Prior  
to working capital movements,  
the Group’s net cash outﬂow was 
USD 50.8 million (2011: inﬂow of 
USD 101.4 million) due to the losses 
described above.
Net cash outﬂow from investing 
activities totalled USD 18.5 million 
(2011: USD 408.8 million). The change 
is a result of lower levels in investment 
activity compared to 2011, which 
included the acquisition of MIS, as 
well as reduced margin deposits of 
USD 22.3 million.
Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities 
was an outﬂow of USD 148.9 million 
(2011: inﬂow of USD 371.1 million). 
This largely arose from repayment  
of borrowing of USD 173.9 million 
including mandatory repayment  
of debt under the MIS acquisition 
facilities, which were drawn in July 
2011, and an increase in ﬁnance costs 
due to servicing of this debt.
Business Review
Financial Review 23 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Of the total cash of USD 263.4 million 
at 31 December 2012, USD 115.3 
million was restricted in the form  
of margin deposits primarily for 
guarantees on major projects.
The period end outstanding 
borrowings was USD 159.3 million 
(2011: USD 251.1 million), which  
has reduced as a result of the part 
repayment of the debt facility used  
for the MIS acquisition.
Shareholders’ equity decreased from 
USD 533.9 million at 31 December 
2011 to USD 406.1 million at 
31 December 2012. The movement 
reﬂects lower retained earnings of 
USD 192.8 million (2011: USD 322.2 
million) and a total comprehensive 
loss for the year of USD 109.0 million 
(2011: comprehensive income of 
USD 61.4 million).
Restructuring of debt facilities 
and going concern
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. The ability of the 
Group to continue as a going  
concern is reliant upon the continued 
availability of external debt ﬁnancing 
and access to bank guarantees for  
its major projects. The deterioration  
of the Group’s performance in  
2012 arising as a result of the 
underperformance of certain key 
projects, the majority of which have 
now been completed, caused the 
Group to seek waivers for certain  
of its banking covenants for the year 
ended 31 December 2012. These 
waivers were obtained prior to 
31 December 2012. The Group  
is currently in discussions with its 
lenders to restructure its debt facilities 
and agree revised covenants on  
a long-term basis and has agreed 
further covenant waivers to facilitate 
the continuation of the negotiations.
The Group expects to conclude 
discussions with lenders in a 
satisfactory manner and has 
continued to meet all interest and 
other payment obligations. After 
reviewing its cash ﬂow forecasts for  
a period of not less than 12 months, 
from the date of signing of these 
ﬁnancial statements, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation  
that the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group therefore continues to 
adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its ﬁnancial statements.
Dividends
Given the post-tax losses in 2012,  
the Board of Directors of Lamprell 
recommends that the Group makes 
no dividend payment for the year. We 
look to the future with optimism, and 
will review our dividend policy once 
the business returns to proﬁtability.
Financial outlook
The Board anticipates that in the  
early part of 2013 revenue levels will 
decrease due to reduced activity. 
However, activity levels are expected 
to improve towards the middle of  
the year in line with the solid order 
book which is already USD 1.3 billion. 
In the longer-term, the Company is 
encouraged by the strong bidding 
activity across the business with the 
pipeline totalling more than USD 4.1 
billion. The Company has taken and 
will continue to take further action to 
stabilise the business and prepare the 
foundations for growth in the coming 
years, by focusing on its traditional 
areas of strength.
With all this in mind, the Company 
expects 2013 to be a recovery year, 
with stable revenues as compared to 
2012 and a gradual return to 
proﬁtability during the year.

Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the Company 
are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 
to 48. 27 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Capital structure and signiﬁcant shareholders
Details of the authorised and issued share capital together  
with details of movements in share capital during the year are 
included in Note 26 to the ﬁnancial statements. The Company 
has one class of share in issue, ordinary shares of 5 pence each, 
all of which are fully paid. Each ordinary share in issue carries 
equal rights including one vote per share on a poll at general 
meetings of the Company, subject to the terms of the Company’s 
Articles of Association and applicable laws. Votes may be 
exercised by shareholders attending or otherwise duly 
represented at general meetings. Deadlines for the exercise of 
voting rights by proxy on a poll at a general meeting are detailed 
in the notice of meeting and proxy cards issued in connection 
with the relevant meeting. There are no restrictions on the 
transfer of shares.
Details of employee share schemes are disclosed on pages 41  
to 42 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and in Note 8 to the 
ﬁnancial statements. During the year the following awards of 
ordinary shares of 5 pence were granted:

Please see the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 48 for more details.
The awards under the Lamprell plc Free Share Plan, the Lamprell 
plc Retention Share Plan and the Lamprell plc Performance 
Share Plan are granted at Nil price.
Pursuant to the Company’s share schemes, the Employee 
Beneﬁt Trust, as at the year-end, held a total of 14,686 (2011: 
449,734) ordinary shares of 5 pence, representing less than 
0.01% (2011: 0.17%) of the issued share capital. The voting rights 
attaching to these shares cannot be exercised directly by the 
employees, but can be exercised by the Trustees. However,  
in line with good practice, the Trustees do not exercise these 
voting rights. In the event of another company taking control of 
the Company, the employee share schemes operated by the 
Company have set change of control provisions. In short, awards 
may, in certain circumstances and in approved proportions, be 
allowed to vest early or be allowed to be exchanged for awards 
of equivalent value in the acquiring company.
The Company was given authority at the 2012 AGM to make 
market purchases of up to 26,000,000 ordinary shares of 
5 pence. This authority will expire at the 2013 AGM, where 
approval from shareholders will be sought to renew the authority.
Approval from shareholders is also proposed to be sought to 
authorise the Directors to allot the Company’s unissued shares 
up to a maximum nominal amount of £3,900,000, representing 
approximately 30% of the Company’s current issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) and to issue equity 
securities of the Company for cash to persons other than existing 
shareholders, other than in connection with existing exemptions 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association or in 
connection with a rights, scrip dividend, or other similar issue,  
up to an aggregate nominal value of £650,000, representing

Auditors
As far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. In 
addition, each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
Auditors are aware of that information.
The auditor for the year ended 31 December 2012 was 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. PricewaterhouseCoopers has 
expressed its willingness to continue in ofﬁce as auditor and a 
resolution to reappoint it will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Going concern
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis. The ability of the Group to continue as a going 
concern is reliant upon the continued availability of external debt 
ﬁnancing and access to bank guarantees for its major projects.  
The deterioration of the Group’s performance in 2012 arising as a 
result of the underperformance of certain key projects, the majority 
of which have now been completed, caused the Group to seek 
waivers for certain of its banking covenants for the year ended 
31 December 2012. These waivers were obtained prior to 
31 December 2012. The Group is currently in discussions with its 
lenders to restructure its debt facilities and agree revised covenants 
on a long-term basis and has agreed further covenant waivers to 
facilitate the continuation of the negotiations.
The Group expects to conclude discussions with lenders in a 
satisfactory manner and has continued to meet all interest and 
other payment obligations. After reviewing its cash ﬂow forecasts 
for a period of not less than 12 months, from the date of signing 
of these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The 
Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its ﬁnancial statements.
The ﬁnancial information has been prepared under the  
historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting 
policies below.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors conﬁrm that suitable accounting policies have 
been used and applied consistently. They also conﬁrm that 
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been 
made in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2012 and that applicable accounting standards 
have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with 
the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis since the Directors have reasonable expectation 
that, ﬁrstly, the Company’s and the Group’s activities are 
sustainable and, secondly, that adequate resources are available 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company website. Your attention is drawn to the fact that 
legislation in the Isle of Man governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from other 
jurisdictions and uncertainty regarding the legal requirements  
is compounded as information published on the internet is 
accessible in many countries with different legal requirements 
relating to the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements.
Subsequent events
As announced in December 2012, James Moffat joined the 
Company in the role of Chief Executive Ofﬁcer on 1 March 2013. 
Mr Moffat was then appointed to the Board on 19 March 2013. 
The interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Peter Whitbread, stepped 
aside from that role on 1 March 2013 but retained his position  
as an Executive Director on the Board.
The Company announced on 18 March 2013 that it had 
concluded a settlement with the Financial Services Authority 
(“FSA”) in relation to the FSA’s investigation into the Company’s 
handling of inside information, as previously announced to the 
market. As a result, the FSA has found that Lamprell breached 
Listing Principle 2, DTR 1.3.4R, DTR 2.2.1 and LR 9 Annex 1 (R) 
and imposed a ﬁne of GBP 2,428,300 on Lamprell (which had 
been discounted by 30% pursuant to the stage 1 early 
settlement discount scheme).

Letter from the Chairman
It is the Board’s duty to create a culture of strong corporate 
governance and transparency within Lamprell and in this way 
provide a clear direction and strong and effective leadership for 
the business as a whole. Good governance sets the tone for an 
organisation and any company that fails to maintain such 
standards will suffer as a result.
My primary focus since I became your Chairman in June 2012 
has been to stabilise the business and to steer the business 
back to focus on its core competencies. To this end, the Board 
has concentrated on a few key issues. The top priority was to 
establish the right kind of relationship between the Board and  
the executive management team, where the management team 
reports on key projects in an effective and comprehensive 
manner and submits proposals to the Board and the Board  
in turn delivers an appropriate balance of positive support 
combined with healthy, constructive challenge where required.
The Board has been forced to restructure itself during the course 
of 2012 and all three Executive Directors left the Board in 
October 2012. However, there have been some welcome 
changes on the Board including the appointment of Deena 
Mattar as an independent Non-Executive Director. Deena 
represents the ﬁrst woman to be appointed to the Board but, 
more than this, her wealth of experience in the area of ﬁnancial 
reporting and in acting on the board of a large listed company 
has been invaluable. This has helped to strengthen the control 
framework for the business.
Contrary to previous years, in 2012 the Board has decided not  
to undertake a process for evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
Board and the individual Directors because of the many changes 
to the Board composition during the year and because of  
the recent arrivals of Peter Whitbread and James Moffat as 
Executive Directors. This may be contrary to best practice but 
we are working towards creating a good, strong mix of skills 
represented on the Board, though additional work is required to 
ensure that the complexity of Lamprell’s business is reﬂected at 
Board level.
I have had many discussions with key stakeholders in our 
business and these have allowed me to understand better their 
views on our Company, its strategy and perceived risks facing 
the business. In return, I will ensure that clear views and a strong 
leadership translate into effective risk management and a focus 
by the Company on its strengths.
Finally, looking forward to 2013, enhanced corporate governance 
will remain a high priority for me as well as the wider Board.  
As well as looking to make further appointments to the Board,  
I expect the Board to place particular emphasis on monitoring 
and mitigating risk and controls, as well as on the structured 
approach to risk management across the enterprise.

Listings and Corporate Governance Codes
The Company is incorporated in the Isle of Man. The Company 
has a Premium Listing on the Ofﬁcial List of the London  
Stock Exchange and therefore, the Board maintains a strong 
commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance 
with the application of the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) to the business, as if the 
Company was incorporated in the United Kingdom. The 
Company has largely complied with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 31 December 2012, with the only 
exceptions as set out and explained below.
The Board
Role of the Board
The role of the Board is to provide leadership of the Company, 
set values and standards, and to ensure that the Company’s 
obligations to its shareholders and other stakeholders are met. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to itself  
for decision, including but not limited to, matters of a strategic 
nature, approval of the annual budget, approval of major 
acquisitions, investments and disposals, major changes to the 
Group’s capital structure, the preparation of ﬁnancial statements, 
the recommendation or declaration of dividends, the entry into 
material contracts, succession planning and appointments to the 
Board, executive remuneration and reviewing the Company’s 
overall corporate governance arrangements.
Composition and balance of the Board
The Board at the date of publication has six Directors, consisting 
of the Non-Executive Chairman, three Non-Executive Directors 
and two Executive Directors. The Board of Directors represents 
a strong combination of industry speciﬁc, regional and 
operational experience, supported by the diverse professional 
skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors.
It has been a very busy year with many changes at the Board, 
some planned and others required in reaction to the events of 
2012. The Company is delighted to welcome John Kennedy, 
Deena Mattar, Peter Whitbread and Jim Moffat to the Board of 
Directors, further enhancing the Board’s skills, experience and 
diversity. Meanwhile, the Company notes that Nigel McCue, Jon 
Cooper and Chris Hand stood down from the Board and also 
notes the retirement of Richard Raynaut and resignation of Brian 
Frederick as Directors respectively.
The Directors believe that the current extensive knowledge  
and experience of the Non-Executive Directors, combined with 
the focus and experience of the Executive Directors, enable  
the Board to lead and give direction to the Group without any 
imbalance that may allow any individual or group of individuals  
to dominate its decision-making. Any Director having a concern 
in this or any other regard may raise this with the Chairman or the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, Colin Goodall.
The current membership of the Board and the commitments of 
the Directors are detailed on pages 24 to 25, which records the 
names of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. The names of the Chairmen and 
members of each of the principal Board Committees are detailed 
along with the biographical information on each of the Directors 
which can be found on pages 24 to 25.
Independence on the Board
The Board considers that independence is a matter of 
judgement and therefore it believes that the Non-Executive 
Directors should be free from any business or other relationships 
that could materially interfere in the exercise of their independent 
judgement. It is the Board’s policy to provide its Non-Executive 
Directors with fair remuneration for the contribution they make 
with respect to the business and affairs of the Company and  
the responsibilities they undertake in performing their duties  
as Non-Executive Directors.
The Board considers the Non-Executive Chairman and two of 
the Non-Executive Directors to be independent in accordance 
with the deﬁnition of the Code and their appointment to be  
in the best interests of the shareholders. The Deputy Chairman, 
Jonathan Silver, is not considered to be independent in 
accordance with the deﬁnition of the Code. However, in light  
of his experience and detailed knowledge of the Company and 
the Middle East, the Board has determined that his continuing 
role is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In light of the above, at the time of publication of this report, only 
two out of ﬁve members of the Board (excluding the Chairman) 
are considered as independent Non-Executive Directors. This  
is consistent with the requirements for “smaller companies” as 
deﬁned by the Code, although it should be noted that, for much 
of the ﬁrst half of 2012, the Company was not considered a 
“smaller company” as it was a member of the FTSE250 index. 
The Board is actively searching for additional candidates to  
act in the role of independent Non-Executive Directors and the 
Company will make announcements in that regard as required.
Attendance at meetings during 2012
The Board plans to meet at least six times in a year but,  
in 2012, the Board actually met a total of 14 times due to the 
extraordinary events that took place during the year. Because  
of the urgency of many issues arising from those events, many  
of the meetings were conducted by telephone conference call. 
However, the Board was still able to attend scheduled Board 
meetings with the Directors present in person on six occasions.
The Board executes a number of resolutions in writing to 
conduct Company business. The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors met without the executives present when necessary 
and the Executive Directors maintain frequent verbal and written 
contact with the Non-Executive Directors to discuss various 
issues affecting the Company and its business. The agenda for 
each Board and Committee meeting is considered by the 
relevant Chairman and papers for each scheduled formal Board 
and Committee meeting are distributed by the Secretary to the 
Board beforehand. The Chairman maintains regular contact with 
the Executive Directors to discuss speciﬁc issues.

5 Brian Fredrick resigned as a Director on 14 June 2012.
6 Richard Raynaut retired from the Board on 7 June 2012.
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (“CEO”)
Until he stood down on 15 June 2012, Jonathan Silver was the Non-Executive Chairman. Mr Silver is a partner of a ﬁrm that 
represents the Company as one of its legal advisers and was therefore deemed not independent on appointment as the Chairman  
of the Company.
John Kennedy assumed the role of Non-Executive Chairman on 15 June 2012 and the Board determined that he was independent 
within the deﬁnition in the Code and that his appointment as the Chairman of the Company was in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders.
Nigel McCue was the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and an Executive Director until 4 October 2012 when he was replaced by Peter 
Whitbread who was appointed as Interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and an Executive Director. Mr Whitbread assumed this management 
role until he stood down on 1 March 2013 but he continued in the role of an Executive Director thereafter. James Moffat took up the 
role of full-time Chief Executive Ofﬁcer with effect from 1 March 2013 and was subsequently appointed as an Executive Director on 
19 March 2013.
There is a documented and approved split within the Group for the roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO, 
which are summarised below.
The Chairman manages the Board and leads implementation of Board decisions meaning that he:
> presents a strong and coherent leadership to external stakeholders;
> leads the Board to drive the strategic leadership for the Group including vision and direction;
> 
chairs all Board and general meetings, and ensures that they are run in an effective and efﬁcient manner;
> ensures that there are constructive and effective relationships and open communication between all Directors, and between the 
Board and the management team;
> leads the Board and Committee performance evaluation and Director induction processes;
> ensures effective communication with shareholders and that the views of key stakeholders are understood by the Board; and
> operates the Board smoothly and efﬁciently for effective decision-making to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business.

Governance
Financial 
Statements 32 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
The CEO has the Board’s delegated authority on all matters of 
management and is accountable for the same (where such 
matters are not reserved for the Board) meaning that, among 
other things, he:
> leads the Executive Directors and the senior executive team  
in the day-to-day running of the Group’s business, including 
chairing the Executive Committee and communicating its 
decisions/recommendations to the Board;
> executes the Group’s business plans and objectives;
> establishes organisation structure, plans and policies and 
effectively implements the same;
> recommends the Group’s business plans and budgets prior 
to Board approval;
> monitors and appraises performance of all key management 
personnel;
> reviews operational and ﬁnancial performance of the Group 
against established goals;
> manages the Group’s risk proﬁle;
> 
together with the CFO, communicates with investors, 
analysts, shareholders and the market; and
> together with the Chairman, presents a strong and coherent 
leadership to external stakeholders.
Appointments to the Board
Appointments to the Board are ordinarily based on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The 
composition and working of the Nomination Committee are 
explained under “Principal Board Committees” on page 33. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the registered ofﬁce  
of the Company during normal business hours and will be 
available at the AGM 15 minutes prior to the meeting and  
during the meeting.
Induction and training
A formal induction programme is provided to new Directors  
on their appointment. The programme is designed to cover 
Companies Act requirements, dealing restrictions as outlined  
in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Model Code 
on Directors’ dealings in securities contained in the Listing  
Rules of the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, 
Board and business related matters, meetings with senior 
management, site visits and the opportunity to meet with  
major shareholders.
The Company encourages Directors to refresh their knowledge 
and skills and to keep up to date with the latest developments  
in corporate governance, ﬁnancial reporting, the oilﬁeld 
construction industry and wider market conditions. The  
Board and its Committees receive brieﬁngs on legislative  
and regulatory developments and new accounting requirements 
as appropriate and believe that, given the experience and skills  
of its Directors, the identiﬁcation of general training needs is  
best left to individual discretion.
Retirement and re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, all 
Directors are subject to re-election at the ﬁrst AGM after their 
appointment and one third, or the number nearest to one third  
of the Board, shall retire from ofﬁce at every Annual General 
Meeting. Any Director who has been in ofﬁce for more than three 
years at the start of an Annual General Meeting shall also retire. 
At the Company’s 2013 AGM all current Executive and Non-
Executive Directors will retire and will offer themselves for 
re-appointment in accordance with section B.7 .1 of the Code, 
with the exception of Colin Goodall and Deena Mattar.
Performance appraisal and Board evaluation
In the ordinary course and pursuant to the provisions of the 
Code, a performance evaluation of the Board (along with the 
Chairman and the other Directors, the Committees and their 
members) would take place on an annual basis. However, the 
year under review was not in the ordinary course and so the 
Board has not undertaken the evaluation process; there were 
numerous changes in the composition of the Board and at 
different times of the year, meaning the Board considers that  
any performance evaluation process would not deliver results  
of relevance or value.
The Board expects to re-establish the proper and formal 
performance evaluation process for 2013 and it will report the 
results in next year’s Annual Report.
Remuneration of Directors
The principles and details of Directors’ remuneration are 
contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37  
to 48. The composition and working of the Remuneration 
Committee are explained under “Principal Board Committees” 
on page 33.
Insurance
The Company maintains Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ Liability 
insurance cover, the level of which is reviewed annually by the 
Board and is determined to be appropriate in the circumstances.
Secretary and external advisers
Our Secretary to the Board is responsible to the Board, is 
available to individual Directors in respect of Board procedures 
and provides general support and advice. He ensures that the 
Board is kept properly informed and is consulted on all matters 
reserved to it, and that written materials and other information 
are delivered in a timely fashion.
The Directors are also entitled to take independent professional 
advice, at the Company’s expense, if required.
Conﬂicts of interest
The Board has procedures in place for the disclosure of  
conﬂicts of interest. Prior to appointment, director-elects  
provide information on any conﬂicts of interest by means of a 
questionnaire, and thereafter potential conﬂicts are considered  
at the relevant time during each Board meeting, as they arise. 
Accordingly, each Director is aware of his or her duties to avoid  
a situation where he or she has a potential actual conﬂict of 
interest, the requirement to keep the same under review and to 
inform the Chairman and the Company Secretary of any change 
in circumstances, which are duly minuted.
Securities dealing policies and codes
Details of the shares and interests held by the Directors are set 
out on page 47 . Lamprell has a share dealing policy that applies 
to all Directors and senior management. Under the policy, 
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report 33 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Directors are required to obtain clearance from the Chairman 
and Chief Executive before dealing in Lamprell’s securities. 
Directors and management are prohibited from dealing in 
Lamprell’s securities during designated prohibited periods  
and at any time at which the individual is in possession of inside 
information (as deﬁned in the relevant legislation). This policy 
adopts the terms of the Model Code, as set out in the Listing 
Rules published by the UK Listing Authority.
Principal Board Committees
The Board is principally assisted by the Audit, Remuneration  
and Nomination Committees. A summary of the activities of  
each principal Committee is set out below. The Committees  
are constituted with appropriate written terms of reference, 
which are reviewed annually and are available on the Company’s 
website. The Committee terms of reference did not require any 
material changes further to the annual review. The minutes of 
meetings and/or reports from the Chairmen of the Committees 
are made available to the Board for its next scheduled meeting 
following the Committee meeting in question, or as soon as 
practicable thereafter.
Audit Committee
Membership and meetings
The members of the Audit Committee are Deena Mattar, who 
acts and has acted as Chairman since 23 August 2012, Colin 
Goodall and John Kennedy. Others may be co-opted onto the 
Committee by the Committee members. The Board considers  
all the members of the Audit Committee who are Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent in character and judgement and  
free from any relationship or circumstance that may, or could  
or would be likely to, or that appears to, affect their judgement.
The Audit Committee met (including meetings by conference call) 
twice during the year and the attendance at its meetings is 
reported on page 31. Meetings of the Audit Committee are 
supposed to be held not less than three times a year. While the 
actual number of formal meetings was less than the prescribed 
number, one of the meetings which ordinarily would have been 
held during the ﬁnancial year was delayed until February 2013.  
In addition, due to the extraordinary events of 2012, a number  
of additional Board meetings were held which addressed many 
of the issues which would, in the ordinary course, be addressed 
by the Audit Committee.
The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer is invited to attend meetings, where 
appropriate, and the Company’s auditors (both internal and 
external) are regularly invited to attend meetings. Other Board 
members are invited to attend, although at least once a year the 
Audit Committee meets the Company’s external auditors without 
management being present.
Role of the Audit Committee and areas of key focus 
during 2012
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee include 
consideration of matters relating to the appointment and 
activities of the Company’s auditors and the independence of the 
Company’s auditors, reviewing the integrity of the Company’s 
annual and interim reports, preliminary results announcements 
and any other formal announcement relating to its ﬁnancial 
performance. The Audit Committee also reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
monitors the procedure to ensure that employees may raise 
ethical concerns in conﬁdence.
The areas of key agenda items for review by the Audit 
Committee in 2012 included:
> the ﬁnancial statements for the Group, both for the ﬁnancial 
year 2011 as well as 1H 2012;
> review of the internal audit reports and plans;
> external auditor’s independence, objectivity and  
the effectiveness;
> the control environment and systems; and
> anti-bribery and corruption policy and procedures for  
the business.
In addition, at the Committee meeting in February 2013, the 
Committee reviewed the report by the external consultants 
relating to the underperforming major projects.
External auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers acted as the Company’s external 
auditors throughout the year and provide the Audit Committee 
with relevant reports, reviews, information and advice and  
the Audit Committee adjudged that they remained effective.  
In making the assessment, the Committee had due regard to 
their expertise, resourcing and independence. The Committee 
remains satisﬁed of their effectiveness. The Committee was also 
pleased with the rapid response by PricewaterhouseCoopers to 
the Company’s request to undertake the comprehensive review 
of the underperforming major projects. In accordance with UK 
regulations, PricewaterhouseCoopers adheres to a partner 
rotation policy based on best practices.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the performance of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the external auditors, who retire  
at the end of the AGM and recommends their reappointment. 
The Board concurs with the recommendation of the 
Audit Committee.
Non-audit services and activities
The Audit Committee has overall responsibility for ensuring  
that the external auditors’ independence and objectivity  
are not compromised. One of the key risks to this is the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor. 
During 2012, in addition to undertaking the external audit, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers was also engaged to provide various 
other advice including in connection with our Russia and Iraqi 
operations and with our reﬁnancing efforts. Further, during Q4 
2012, PricewaterhouseCoopers also performed an extensive 
review of various underperforming, key projects which 
underpinned the Company’s announcement regarding  
the same on 19 November 2012.
The Audit Committee, in accordance with the Policy on Auditor 
Independence adopted by the Group, and having considered  
the nature of work carried out believes that, whilst being cost 
effective, the appointment of the external auditors to provide this 
advice did not affect the objectivity, or the independence, of the 
external auditors.

The Remuneration Committee met (including meetings by 
conference call) seven times during the year. The attendance  
at its meetings is reported on page 31.
Role of the Remuneration Committee and areas of key 
focus during 2012
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee provide 
for it to determine and agree with the Board the framework  
or broad policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer, other Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and 
other such members of the executive management as it is 
designated to consider. The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is a matter for the Executive Directors. No Director  
or manager may be involved in any decisions as to his  
own remuneration.
Details of the key agenda items for review by the Remuneration 
Committee during the year can be found in the Director’s 
Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 48.
Nomination Committee
Membership and meetings
The current members of the Nomination Committee are John 
Kennedy, who acts as Chairman of the Committee and has 
acted in this role since 23 August 2012 (in addition to his role  
as Chairman of the Board), Colin Goodall, Deena Mattar and 
Jonathan Silver. Until the principal Board Committees were 
reconstituted in August 2012, Colin Goodall acted as Chairman 
for both the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination 
Committee. John Kennedy took over the Chairmanship of the 
Committee from Colin Goodall after the Nomination Committee 
was reconstituted in mid-2012.
The Nomination Committee met (including meetings by 
conference calls) four times during the year and the attendance 
at its meetings is reported on page 31.
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee’s terms of reference are to review 
periodically the structure, size, composition, skills, knowledge 
and experience required of the Board compared to its current 
position and make its recommendations to the Board with  
regard to any changes. The Nomination Committee also 
considers the future composition of the Board, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing the Company, 
and skills and expertise needed on the Board. The Nomination 
Committee also makes recommendations to the Board about 
the membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Nominations to the Board and areas of key focus 
during 2012
There should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors to the Board. This is a 
matter for resolution by the Board, taking advice from the 
Nomination Committee.
Deena Mattar was appointed to the Board with effect from  
1 April 2012 and John Kennedy was appointed as Chairman  
of the Board on 15 June 2012. Later in the year, on 4 October 
2012, Peter Whitbread was appointed to the Board (and made 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer). In the ordinary course, for any potential 
appointments to the Board, details of possible candidates  
are provided by the consultants and initially reviewed by the 
Nomination Committee. The Directors then hold meetings with 
selected candidates. Subsequently, the Nomination Committee 
meets to recommend an appointment which is then proposed to 
the Board for approval. This transparent and effective process 
was not followed in the case of Peter Whitbread because of the 
extraordinary circumstances of his appointment following the 
departure of the former Executive Directors from the Board.
External consultants
For Board appointments in 2012 and to date in 2013, the 
Nomination Committee has used the services of several 
executive recruitment consultants, namely Korn Ferry,  
Maxwell Drummond and the McNair Partnership. There is no 
connection between the Company and Korn Ferry or the McNair 
Partnership. However, with regard to Maxwell Drummond, the 
Chairman of the Board is also the chairman and a director on the 
board of that company. The Chairman has declared such interest 
to the Board as required and the Board has determined that this 
should not prevent the Company from using Maxwell 
Drummond’s services.
Women on boards
The Board noted the publication of the Davies Review on 
Women on Boards in February 2011 and it recognises the 
importance of gender diversity throughout the Group, and 
especially at Board level. The Board aims to have a broad range 
of skills, backgrounds and experience. With this in mind, the 
Board was pleased to announce the appointment of Deena 
Mattar to the Board. Her appointment strengthened the Board 
and she has made a valuable contribution to the Company at this 
exciting phase in its development.
Other Board Committees
The Board and the principal Board Committees may also 
delegate authority from time to time to an ad hoc sub-committee 
or task force, as may be required to review or manage a speciﬁc 
matter. The Board or relevant Board Committee will determine 
the terms of reference and the membership of such sub-
committee or task force, as necessary, and such sub-committee 
or task force is operated in the same manner as the principal 
Board Committees.
Control environment
Accountability and audit
The Board plays a direct role in the development of the Group’s 
internal controls and risk management systems in addition to 
overseeing controls and risk management procedures via the 
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report 35 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Audit Committee. However, the primary responsibility for 
developing and implementing internal control and risk 
management procedures covering strategic, commercial, 
operational and ﬁnancial aspects of the business lies  
with management.
The Board regularly receives a comprehensive written report  
from the interim Chief Financial Ofﬁcer at each face-to-face  
Board meeting, as well as periodic updates between such 
meetings. The Board is kept well informed about the Group’s 
ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂow position, enabling the Board  
to identify when delivery of its goals are under threat. In addition  
to ﬁnancial reporting, the interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (and now 
the new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer) provides a detailed presentation at 
each face-to-face Board meeting covering the various projects and 
highlighting any impediments to delivery of the Group’s targets.
Financial reporting
The statement on the responsibilities of the Directors in relation 
to the preparation of the accounts and the Directors’ evaluation 
of the business as a going concern is contained in the Directors’ 
Report on pages 26 to 28.
Risk management and internal controls
As is consistent with best practices for the industry, Lamprell has 
an internal control environment and supporting policies and 
procedures, all of which form part of its risk management 
strategy. Individual managers are responsible for ensuring 
compliance within their departments which includes the 
identiﬁcation, evaluation and mitigation of risks within their areas 
of responsibility. The application and consistency of these 
policies and procedures are regularly reviewed by the Group’s 
Internal Audit function, and are then overseen and reported to 
the Audit Committee, which is ultimately responsible for reporting 
on the same to the Board.
In light of the issues which arose in relation to the completion  
of certain projects in 2012 and the related underperformance  
of the business, the Group has commenced a series of initiatives 
to implement additional controls and to enhance the risk 
management environment within the business, including  
by way of example:
> improved ﬁnancial reporting such as the use of a more robust 
ﬁnancial forecasting model and cash proﬁling, as well as 
ensuring closer links between project budget and 
procurement;
> closer control over major projects including higher visibility  
by management of staff utilisation ﬁgures and all major new 
contracts are overseen by the Board to ensure that the project  
is ﬁrmly within the core competencies of the Group; and
> 
better communication between the Board and senior 
management through the reconstitution of the Executive 
Committee, and between senior management and other  
staff by way of “townhall-style” meetings by management.
The internal systems and controls including ﬁnancial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management systems will  
be strengthened further during the coming year, to build on  
the above initiatives. This process is ongoing but, with the 
appointment of the new executive team, the Board is conﬁdent 
that the controls and processes will continue to improve.
The Board (through the Audit Committee) conducts an annual 
review of the effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and  
risk management systems. Where signiﬁcant weaknesses have 
been identiﬁed, additional safeguards have been, and are being, 
implemented and monitored. Future reviews of the systems’ 
effectiveness will take into account any new controls and 
processes that are implemented subsequently.
Additional information on the principal risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group, together with the mitigating factors, can be 
found on pages 16 to 19.
Internal audit and assurance
Lamprell has an established Internal Audit function within the 
organisation and the internal auditors report on a regular basis to 
the Audit Committee. This may cover either planned activities or, 
for issues of urgency, unscheduled audits. The internal auditors 
will follow best practices for such audits and will seek input from 
the management team before making recommendations and/or 
observations to the Audit Committee, which will evaluate the 
reports and feedback from management, and will agree any 
work planned and/or undertaken.
The Directors receive assurances from the following internal and 
external controls:
> annual self-assessment of agreed internal controls by process 
owners and review of its results by the internal auditors;
> regular executive reports from management in areas covering 
key issues, performance, business outlook, human resources 
and health, safety and environment;
> ﬁnancial performance reports including analyses of signiﬁcant 
variances regularly reported by the management;
> external audit reports, presentations and management letters 
from the Group’s auditors;
> reports from the internal audit function; and
> reports from internal quality audits.
During the year an additional exercise was undertaken by the 
Company’s auditors to review the four key underperforming 
projects. A report was provided to the Board on the ﬁndings of 
this exercise which supplemented management’s own review of 
the wider business (including these projects).
Executive Committee
In order to assist and support the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer in  
the implementation of the Group’s business plans, the interim 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer reconstituted the Executive Committee 
(“ExCom”), comprising the members of the executive 
management team (now including James Moffat since his arrival 
in March 2013). The ExCom is the primary body that meets  
to make informed decisions through periodic discussion and 
deliberations on critical strategic, operational and ﬁnancial 
matters (including the review of major risks facing the Group) 
relating to management of the business, prior to making 
recommendations to the Board or a principal Board Committee. 
It meets regularly and in any event not less than once per month.

The Company’s Memorandum of Association sets out the 
objectives and powers of the Company. The Articles of 
Association details the rights attaching to each share class, the 
method by which the Company’s shares can be purchased or

voting at general meetings. The Articles also set out the rules 
relating to Directors (including, by way of example, their 
appointment, retirement, duties and powers).
Communications
Engagement with shareholders
The Board receives regular feedback from research analysts  
and major shareholders, compiled by the Company’s brokers 
and ﬁnancial public relations consultants. Lamprell places 
considerable importance on communication with our 
shareholders and all shareholders receive hard copies of our 
Annual Report and Accounts. As a result of the extraordinary 
events of 2012, there were far fewer meetings with major 
shareholders and analysts than has historically been the case. 
However, with the increased stabilisation of the business, it is 
anticipated that the Chairman, the new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, 
the interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the interim Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer will start to hold regular meetings with such key 
stakeholders during the course of 2013.
These documents, as well as all announcements that  
we make to the market and presentations to analysts and 
considerable other information, are available on our website  
at www.lamprell.com. The interim and preliminary results  
of the Company, along with all other press releases, are posted 
on the Company’s website as soon as they are announced  
and are available for download.
Colin Goodall is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
and is available to shareholders if they have any concerns for 
which contact through the normal channels of the Chairman,  
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer or the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer cannot 
be resolved or for which such contact is inappropriate.
2013 Annual General Meeting
All shareholders have the opportunity to attend the Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”). All Directors were present at the 2012 
AGM and all Directors intend to be present at the 2013 AGM, 
which is scheduled to be held on 27 May 2013, to meet with 
shareholders and to answer shareholders’ questions. The Notice 
of the AGM, and related papers containing the text of resolutions 
to be proposed at the AGM, and explanatory notes, where 
necessary, will be posted to the shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the AGM.
The total number of proxy votes lodged at the AGM on each 
resolution categorised as for, against, and votes withheld will be 
made available both at the meeting and subsequently on the 
Company’s website. Each separate issue is presented as a 
separate resolution and the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees will be available to answer 
questions from shareholders.
Communication with employees
The Company also sees communication among its employees 
as a key priority. With the change in leadership team towards the 
end of 2012, the interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and later the new 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, as well as other senior managers, have 
started holding regular “townhall-style” meetings with employees 
at the Company’s main facilities. These meetings represent  
an opportunity for junior employees to have access to senior 
management which in turn will feed back any major issues to the 
Board. The Board expects the management team to build on this 
improved communication process in the years ahead.
Statement of compliance with the Code
Details on how we have applied the principles of the Code to our 
activities (as well as any exceptions to the Code) are set out and

Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present to you, on behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”), the Committee’s report 
on our Directors’ remuneration for the ﬁnancial year 2012. The Committee aims to foster shareholder conﬁdence in the integrity of our 
remuneration decisions and to demonstrate a high level of transparency and disclosure in relation to the same. During 2012, the 
Company encountered a number of considerable challenges and, as a result, was forced to take certain decisions relating to the 
remuneration of the Directors on an exceptional basis.
The ﬁnal quarter of 2012 was particularly challenging as the Company sought to replace the three Executive Directors that left the 
Board on 3 October. On extremely short notice, the Board was able to secure the services of Peter Whitbread as Interim CEO and 
Frank Nelson as Interim CFO to bring some immediate stability during a critical period for the Company. The Committee was actively 
involved in establishing remuneration packages for these interim appointments as well as the permanent CEO, James Moffat, who 
joined the Group in March 2013.
These packages are explained in full below but, regardless, we will constantly aim to set executive remuneration levels which:
> are in the best interests of the Company;
> 
take account of pay in the rest of the business;
> are reasonable and in line with shareholder and market guidelines; and
> will be applied consistently for the future.
The Committee has continued to work with and been advised by Mercer and DCG on various points relating to executive 
remuneration and we consulted them for advice on market trends and other relevant matters.
The terms of reference of the Committee determine the policy for the remuneration of Lamprell’s Executive Directors and various members 
of senior management. The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website – www.lamprell.com.
Richard Raynaut, Brian Fredrick, Colin Goodall, Deena Mattar and John Kennedy were all members of the Committee for certain 
periods during 2012. Messrs. Raynaut and Fredrick departed from the Board in June 2012 and the Board subsequently reconstituted 
the composition of the Committee, with me being appointed as Committee Chairman. In addition, the former CEO (Nigel McCue) and 
the Interim CEO (Peter Whitbread) attended meetings by invitation but were at no stage present when elements of their own 
remuneration were discussed.
The following pages provide a more detailed description of current Lamprell Executive Remuneration including changes that have 
been agreed upon during 2012.

Executive remuneration policy and pay principles
Our remuneration policy for Executive Directors gives consideration to remuneration policy and levels for the wider employee 
population and is designed to enable the recruitment, retention and motivation of Executive Directors and senior managers of the 
highest calibre. Our remuneration policy aims to drive business performance and maximise shareholder value through offering 
remuneration packages to our senior management that are appropriately balanced between base salary and variable compensation 
and taking into account policy and practice in the UAE and the wider market.
Our key remuneration principles are:
> base salaries should be competitive and bonuses should reﬂect both collective ﬁnancial performance and personal performance. 
Personal performance will be determined based on stretching, quantitative and qualitative targets set individually at the beginning 
of each year;
> the individual performance targets for the Executive Directors are recommended by the Company Chairman and approved by the 
Remuneration Committee. Individual performance targets for the Vice Presidents are recommended by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer;
> maintaining the highest possible health and safety standards is of paramount importance to the Company and its business and is 
the collective responsibility of all Executive Directors, Vice Presidents and Employees. Any fatality that takes place in a facility 
operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be taken into account when considering whether to pay the whole or part 
of the personal performance bonus;
> performance shares are awarded in order to align the interests of senior staff and shareholders and to encourage the recipients to 
remain with the Company.
These principles will only be deviated from in exceptional circumstances in which case those circumstances will be disclosed herein. 
The Remuneration Committee met seven times during this ﬁnancial year. Items covered in the meetings included:
> 
variable pay;
> investor consultation;
> review of PSP awards;
> review and agreement of ﬁnancial targets for the annual bonus plan;
> impact of 2012 business performance on incentive plans;
> termination packages for the departing Executive Directors;
> terms and conditions for the remuneration packages for the incoming Executive Directors (both interim and permanent); and
> Non-Executive Director fee structure.

The above table sets out the typical balance of ﬁxed and variable remuneration for executives in the ordinary course. However, as a 
result of the exceptional circumstances which faced the Company in 2H 2012, the Company also employed additional incentive 
mechanisms (which are not reﬂected in the above table) to attract and recruit high calibre executives on very short notice. Further 
details of these additional mechanisms are set out on pages 43 to 44.
Each element is described in further detail in separate sections below. The Committee considers all elements of the pay structure to 
be important in supporting the Company’s remuneration policy.

In line with market practice in the UAE and consistent with 
regional peer companies, the Executive Directors also receive 
other beneﬁts including car allowances, housing allowances, 
utilities for housing, school fees for children up to the age of 18, 
annual airline tickets, medical and life insurance, petrol costs and 
club memberships. The cash value of the beneﬁts received by 
each Executive Director in 2012 is shown in the summary annual 
remuneration table on page 46.
Annual bonus
Focus and motivate Executive Directors to achieve annual 
performance targets
Performance measures
The Committee establishes performance measures and  
targets under the annual bonus plan for Executive Directors. 
Performance measures used are designed to reward the delivery 
of key priorities for the year. In the 2012 plan year, target pay-out 
of two thirds of the bonus was based on ﬁnancial targets, with 
the remaining one third dependent on the achievement of 
personal objectives. In setting ﬁnancial targets, the Board 
focuses on key annual strategic objectives. For 2012, ﬁnancial 
metrics were based upon achievement of a net proﬁt target, and 
the Committee determined that in order to achieve the maximum 
pay-out in respect of the portion of the bonus dependent upon 
the achievement of ﬁnancial targets, such targets would be 
required to be exceeded by at least 20%.
In setting the personal objectives for the Executive Directors,  
the Committee focuses on the Company’s strategic plan and 
taking into account the Company’s corporate values. Personal 
objectives cover a variety of ﬁnancial and operational targets  
that contribute to the achievement of goals in the strategic plan. 
The Committee evaluates executive performance against the 
individual bonus criteria in determining the level of bonus award 
to be made.
2012 bonus performance
The annual bonus plan is discretionary and the Committee 
reserves the right to make adjustments to pay-outs if it believes 
exceptional circumstances warrant doing so. In particular,  
the Committee has an overriding discretion to consider,  
if deemed necessary, performance on environmental, social  
and governance issues when determining the annual bonus 
payments for the Executive Directors. As a consequence of  
the disappointing ﬁnancial performance in 2012 and the failure  
to achieve key business and personal targets, the Committee 
declared that no bonus payments would be made to any  
of the Executive Directors in respect of 2012.
Long-term incentives
Reward and motivate executives for achievement of 
longer-term value creation and align executive and 
shareholder interests
Long-term incentives plans (“LTIPs”) are provided to eligible 
employees under the provisions of four different share-based 
plans: The Lamprell plc Executive Share Option Plan, the 
Lamprell plc Retention Share Plan, the Lamprell plc Free Share 
Plan and the Lamprell plc 2008 Performance Share Plan. The 
2008 Performance Share Plan is intended to be the Company’s 
primary long-term incentive vehicle for Executive Directors and 
Senior Management. Any value earned under the Company’s 
LTIPs is not pensionable.
Executive Directors will not receive regular grants of options 
under the Executive Share Option Plan or receive regular awards 
under the Retention Share Plan. Awards under these two plans 
will only be used in exceptional circumstances. Please refer to 
the commentary on pages 43 to 44 for details of the incentive 
mechanisms used in order to attract and recruit the interim 
executives on very short notice in Q3 2012, as well as the 
permanent CEO in Q4 2012.
The Committee regularly reviews both the overall suitability  
of the Company’s share-based remuneration, the level of awards 
made under the plan operated and the performance conditions 
attached to those awards. In light of the events of 2012, the 
Committee will undertake a review of the Company’s current 
LTIPs to determine whether they fulﬁl the needs of the Company 
to attract, retain and incentivise employees of the highest quality.
The Lamprell plc 2008 Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
In the ﬁrst instance, the Committee plans to use the PSP as the 
primary long-term incentive vehicle for Executive Directors, with 
deviations only in exceptional circumstances. Executive Directors 
and other key individuals may participate in this plan, which 
offers performance contingent awards of Lamprell shares on  
an annual basis. The awards will take the form of a promise to 
deliver free shares, but may be structured in an economically 
equivalent form subject to an assessment of local tax and 
regulatory issues. Annual awards are capped at 100% of base 
salary (150% of base salary in exceptional circumstances).
Performance shares will normally vest on the third anniversary  
of the date of grant of the award, subject to any applicable 
performance conditions having been satisﬁed. In addition,  
the Committee will have an overriding discretion, in exceptional 
circumstances (relating to either the Company or a particular 
participant) to reduce the number of shares that vest (or to 
provide that no shares vest).
PSP performance measures
The Committee believes that the performance conditions  
for vesting of PSP awards should strike a balance between 
achieving alignment with shareholder returns and reward for 
delivery of strong underlying performance.
The Committee decided that the awards made in 2012 will vest 
subject to achieving predeﬁned Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) 
growth over a three-year period. At that time, the Committee 
considered that EPS, calculated using the point-to-point method, 
was an appropriate measure for the Company’s success. This 
method compares the adjusted EPS in the Company’s accounts 
for the ﬁnancial year ended prior to the date of grant with the 
adjusted EPS for the ﬁnancial year ending three years later and 
calculates the total growth over the three-year period.

However, as the Company underwent signiﬁcant changes during 
the last six months of the year, the Committee was obliged to 
reconsider the use of PSP awards. In the ﬁrst instance, the 
Committee agreed contractual terms with the incoming interim 
executives, neither of which envisaged an award under the PSP . 
Secondly, during 2013, the Committee will review whether EPS  
is the most appropriate performance measure for PSP awards 
and the appropriate vesting period. The Committee recognises 
that the driver must be to incentivise strong earnings growth 
which is in line with the creation of future shareholder value  
and this must occur over a sustained period. The Committee  
is reviewing whether EPS is the most appropriate performance 
measure for the PSP and, to the extent that any change is made, 
the Committee will report the same in the subsequent Annual 
Report for the Company.
The Lamprell plc Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”)
The ESOP provides for options over Lamprell shares to be 
granted at market value to eligible employees. The options  
will normally vest after three years and be exercisable up to the 
10th anniversary of the date of grant. No awards were made to 
Executive Directors under this plan in 2012. However, please 
refer to the commentary on pages 43 to 44 for details of the 
incentive mechanisms used in order to attract and recruit the 
interim executives on very short notice in Q3 2012, as well as  
the permanent CEO in Q4 2012.
The Lamprell plc Retention Share Plan (“RSP”)
The RSP provides for the conditional allocation of shares  
to eligible employees selected by the Board. Awards will  
normally vest and the shares be released with any accumulated 
dividends, if determined by the Board, two years after the date  
of grant. The RSP is targeted towards mid-level management 
employees in critical positions and, accordingly, no awards were 
made to Executive Directors under this plan in 2012.
The Lamprell plc Free Share Plan (“FSP”)
The FSP provides for the unconditional allocation of shares to 
eligible employees selected by the Board. Awards will normally 
vest after such period as the Board may determine. The FSP has 
effectively been replaced by the RSP . No awards were made to 
Executive Directors under this plan in 2012.
Retirement beneﬁts
Provide retirement beneﬁts in line with local market practice
Under employment law in the United Arab Emirates, the 
Executive Directors participate in a terminal gratuity scheme 
operated by the Company as a pension equivalent. This is 
operated as a cash payment based on the length of service and 
ﬁnal salary of the Executive Director and the value of these cash 
provisions is c. 5–8% of base salary per annum, depending upon 
length of service.
Under the terms of the local UAE labour law the terminal gratuity 
accrues beneﬁt to an employee as follows:
> 21 days per annum for the ﬁrst ﬁve years of employment
> 30 days per annum for the remainder of their employment
The beneﬁt accrues for incomplete years on a pro rata basis,  
is calculated using the current base salary and has a maximum 
beneﬁt amounting to two years of the annual base salary.
Directors’ contracts
The policy set out below provides the general framework for service 
contracts with the Executive Directors. It is the Company’s policy 
that Executive Directors should have contracts with a rolling term. 
Maximum notice period is one year.
Aspect of contract Policy
Notice period (both parties) Twelve calendar months.
Termination payment Up to one times annual basic 
salary, plus beneﬁts but excluding 
bonus. The Company may elect to 
pay sums in lieu of notice in three 
separate tranches: 50% within 
seven working days of the 
termination date; 25% three 
months after the termination date; 
and 25% six months after the 
termination date.
Vesting of long-term 
incentive scheme awards
In line with the rules of the relevant 
equity incentive scheme.
Pension Based on existing arrangements 
and terms of the UAE Labour Law 
with respect to terminal gratuity.
The general policy on termination is that the Company does  
not make payments beyond its contractual obligations, i.e. no 
ex-gratia payments are made. None of the Executive Directors’ 
contracts provides for liquidated damages, longer periods of 
notice on a change of control of the Company, or additional 
compensation on an Executive Director’s cessation of 
employment. Directors are obliged to mitigate the costs of 
termination if at all possible. With the departure of the three 
Executive Directors from the Board in October 2012, the 
Company agreed to certain termination payments, further  
details of which are set out on page 43.
In light of the disappointing business performance in 2012 that  
led to the termination of the three Executive Directors, the Board 
has undertaken to review the standard clauses in the Directors’ 
contracts relating to bonuses and other incentive awards. The 
review will seek to establish discretionary authority for the Board to 
recover elements of incentive pay in exceptional circumstances.

In view of the extenuating circumstances following the termination of the CEO, CFO and COO and the arrival of the incoming Interim 
CEO in October 2012, the following speciﬁc information regarding the service contracts for the Executive Directors and the Interim 
CFO should be noted.
Service contract for Executive Director, Nigel McCue
Mr McCue, who was employed by the Company under a service contract dated 16 October 2006, left the Board on 3 October 2012, 
and it has been agreed that his employment will terminate on 3 April 2013. Under his service contract he was entitled to full salary and 
beneﬁts for a notice period of 12 months. However, it has been agreed that the Company will pay Mr McCue, in settlement of all 
claims, full salary and beneﬁts to 3 April 2013, representing six months of the 12 months’ notice period. No compensation will be paid 
in respect of salary for the balance of his notice period from 3 April to 3 October 2013. All unvested share-based incentives held by 
Mr McCue will lapse on termination of his employment. The award granted to Mr McCue under the Lamprell plc 2008 Performance 
Share Plan which was due to vest on 15 April 2013 will lapse in its entirety as the Company’s EPS performance has not reached the 
target set when the award was granted.
Service contract for Executive Director, Christopher Hand
Mr Hand, who was employed by the Company under a service contract dated 26 January 2011, left the Board on 3 October 2012, 
and it has been agreed that his employment will terminate on 3 April 2013. Under his service contract he was entitled to full salary and 
beneﬁts for a notice period of 12 months. However, it has been agreed that the Company will pay Mr Hand, in settlement of all claims, 
full salary and beneﬁts to 3 April 2013, representing six months of the 12 months’ notice period. No compensation will be paid in 
respect of salary for the balance of his notice period from 3 April to 3 October 2013. All unvested share-based incentives held by 
Mr Hand will lapse on termination of his employment. The award granted to Mr Hand under the Lamprell plc 2008 Performance Share 
Plan which was due to vest on 15 April 2013 will lapse in its entirety as the Company’s EPS performance has not reached the target 
set when the award was granted.
Service contract for Executive Director, Jonathan Cooper
Mr Cooper, who was employed by the Company under a service contract dated 18 March 2011, left the Board on 3 October 2012, 
and it has been agreed that his employment will terminate on 3 October 2013 in accordance with his service contract (or at such time 
as Mr Cooper commences alternative employment, if earlier). All unvested share-based incentives held by Mr Cooper will lapse on 
termination of his employment. The award granted to Mr Cooper under the Lamprell plc 2008 Performance Share Plan which was 
due to vest on 15 April 2013 will lapse in its entirety as the Company’s EPS performance has not reached the target set when the 
award was granted.
Service contract for interim executives
Under their service contracts, the Company agreed, among other matters, to grant each of Peter Whitbread and Frank Nelson an 
option over shares to the value of £400,000 and £195,000 respectively (the “Intended Options”). These grants were agreed to be 
made subject to the rules of the Lamprell plc Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) but were not subject to performance conditions 
and were scheduled to vest on the earlier of a change of control of the Company or 31 March 2013 (in respect of Mr Whitbread) or  
11 June 2013 (in respect of Mr Nelson). These grants were agreed to be made at an exercise price of 76.25 pence (in respect of 
Mr Whitbread) and 80.50 pence (in respect of Mr Nelson).
The Company was unable to grant the Intended Options by reason of a prohibition on dealings in the Company’s shares which is 
anticipated to end shortly following the date of publication of this report subject to the possibility of a continuing prohibition. In light of 
this, the Company has agreed with each executive that his service contract will be amended such that he will be granted a special, 
one-off incentive. This special, one-off incentive is designed to replicate the Intended Options and will be granted shortly after the 
date of this report, or, if later, as soon as the Company is no longer within a prohibited period. This incentive will comprise two 
components: a market value option and a cash award.
Mr Whitbread and Mr Nelson will be granted an option over 524,590 and 242,236 shares respectively, at an exercise price equal to the 
market value of a share immediately before the date of grant. Each option will be granted on one-off terms, which will be set out in deeds of 
grant. The deeds of grant will incorporate by reference the terms of the ESOP , save that the options will vest in full on the earlier of 11 June 
2013 and a change of control of the Company and will not be subject to any performance conditions.

Mr Whitbread and Mr Nelson will also each receive a cash award intended to reﬂect the difference between (i) the value which the 
executives would have received if the Intended Options had been granted to them; and (ii) the value which they will receive by way of the 
market value options granted under the terms described above. Each award will be granted on terms which will be set out in deeds of 
grant. The cash awards will vest in full on the earlier of 11 June 2013 and a change of control of the Company.
If the Company is unable to grant the special share incentives by 21 March 2014 or the date of a change of control of the Company (if 
earlier) (the “Long Stop Date”), either because the Company remains in a prohibited period until that date or otherwise, the Company has 
agreed to pay each of the executives a cash amount equal to the increase in the market value of 524,590 or 242,236 shares (in respect of 
Mr Whitbread and Mr Nelson respectively) from a price of (i) 76.25 pence or 80.50 pence per share (in respect of Mr Whitbread and 
Mr Nelson respectively) to (ii) the middle market quotation for a share on the Long Stop Date.
The Committee considered these arrangements to have been essential to secure the services of Mr Whitbread and Mr Nelson, which were 
secured on a short-term basis during a critical period for the business, and at very short notice. The Committee was satisﬁed that the 
incentives are appropriate and align the interests of Mr Whitbread and Mr Nelson with those of shareholders. As these were special 
arrangements to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, Mr Whitbread’s and Mr Nelson’s recruitment, shareholder approval was not required 
for these arrangements by virtue of 9.4.2(2)R of the UK Listing Rules. Any beneﬁts under these arrangements will not be pensionable.
Service contract for incoming permanent CEO, James Moffat
As announced, James Moffat joined the Company as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer on 1 March 2013. Mr Moffat has been an Executive 
Director of the Company with effect from 19 March 2013 and as such was not a statutory Director of the Company during 2012. 
However, as with Mr Nelson, the Company has decided to include certain information regarding his remuneration package within this 
section in the interests of full disclosure.
Mr Moffat is employed on the terms of a service contract dated 25 November 2012, terminable by either party on 12 months’ notice. 
Mr Moffat’s base salary is USD 753,000 and his annual bonus, pension and other beneﬁts reﬂect the Company’s policy as stated 
above. In addition, Mr Moffat will be granted an option over shares with a value of USD 753,000 at an exercise price equal to the 
market value of a share immediately before the date of grant. The option will be granted on, or as soon as practicable after, the date of 
this report, or, if later, as soon as the Company is no longer within a prohibited period. The option will be non-pensionable and will be 
granted on one-off terms, which will be set out in a deed of grant. The deed of grant will incorporate by reference the terms of the 
ESOP , save that the options will vest in full on the earlier of 1 March 2016 and a change of control of the Company and will not be 
subject to any performance conditions.
As in the case of Mr Whitbread and Mr Nelson, if the Company is unable to grant the special share incentives by the Long Stop Date, 
either because the Company remains in a prohibited period until that date or otherwise, the Company has agreed to pay Mr Moffat a 
cash amount equal to the increase in the market value of options over shares with a value of USD 753,000 as at 1 March 2013 from 
(A) 130.75 pence per share to (B) the middle market quotation for a share on the Long Stop Date.
As in the case of Mr Whitbread and Mr Nelson, the Committee considered this arrangement to have been essential in order to secure 
the services of Mr Moffat at a time when the ﬁnancial position of Lamprell was unstable and when Mr Moffat was well-established in a 
very senior and secure position within a large, international company. The Committee was satisﬁed that the grant of the option is 
appropriate and aligns the interests of Mr Moffat with those of shareholders. As this was a special arrangement to facilitate, in unusual 
circumstances, Mr Moffat’s recruitment, shareholder approval was not required for this arrangement by virtue of 9.4.2(2)R of the UK 
Listing Rules. Any beneﬁts under this arrangement will not be pensionable.
Outside appointments for Executive Directors
Outside appointments of Executive Directors of the Company must be approved by the Board. It is the Company’s policy that 
remuneration earned from such appointments may be kept by the individual Executive Director. The external appointments of Nigel

Non-Executive Directors’ fees and contracts
The Company aims to provide Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) with fees that are competitive with other companies of a similar size 
and complexity. The table below sets out the annual fees payable in respect of different roles and responsibilities during 2012. The 
Company reviewed the Non-Executive fee structure in December 2012 and determined to maintain a fee structure with basic fees 
and additional fees for chairing a committee of the Board, and the fees were increased for 2013 in order to maintain a competitive 
market position.
Regular fees applicable throughout 2012
Fee category £
Non-Executive Chairman 164,000
Senior Independent Director 75,500
Basic Member Fee 42,225
Committee Chair Fee (Excluding Nominations Committee) 7 ,000
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s incentive schemes.
Fees are based on a time commitment that is regarded as typical in normal operating conditions for the respective fee category. As a 
result of business performance in 2012 resulting in the CEO, CFO and COO standing down on 3 October 2012, operating conditions 
became atypical and workload levels for certain of the NEDs in the second half of 2012 increased substantially beyond what is 
regarded as the norm.
Based on Mercer guidance, the typical method of addressing a temporary increase in workload is to apply a per diem that recognises 
the additional commitment. Taking into consideration the extraordinary circumstances that gave rise to increased workload during the 
period July to December 2012, the Board agreed to an additional payment of £24,000 to Deena Mattar in recognition of 12 additional 
days’ work at a per diem rate of £2,000.
It was further agreed that, with effect from 1 January 2013, in recognition of the increased projected commitments of each NED, and 
in line with market data, the following fee structure shall be applied:
Regular fees applicable for 2013
Fee category £
Non-Executive Chairman 180,000
Deputy Chairman 88,000
Senior Independent Director 80,000
Basic Member Fee 65,000
Committee Chair Fee (Excluding Nominations Committee) 8,000
It should be noted that the fees payable to the Deputy Chairman, Jonathan Silver, are paid to Mr Silver’s law ﬁrm, Clyde & Co, further 
details of which are set out on page 46.
The NEDs do not have service contracts, but instead have speciﬁc letters of appointment which are available upon request and which 
include amongst other matters, an indication of the time commitment expected from each NED. NEDs are appointed for an initial term of 
three years, terminable by either the Company or the NED at will. In normal circumstances, and subject to performance and re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting, the NEDs can be asked to serve additional three-year terms. Upon termination or resignation, NEDs are not 
entitled to compensation and no fee is payable in respect of the unexpired portion of the term of appointment.

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, management has carried out an exercise to assess the present value of its obligations at 
31 December 2012 and 2011, using the projected unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service beneﬁts payable under 
the UAE Labour Law. Under this method, an assessment has been made of an employee’s expected service life with the Group and 
the expected basic salary at the date of leaving the service. Management has assumed average increment/promotion costs of 2.5% 
(2011: 5%). The expected liability at the date of leaving the service has been discounted to its net present value using a discount rate

Oct-12 49 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Since its founding in 1977 , Lamprell has embraced its commitment 
to be a responsible corporate citizen. This commitment, grounded 
in the belief that good corporate citizenship beneﬁts all our 
stakeholders, was formalised when the Company became public 
with the establishment of systems and policies that state the 
principles by which we seek to conduct our business and manage 
our operations. As a publicly listed company our aim is to ensure 
that how we conduct our business, and the reporting thereof, 
meets all the requisite benchmarks and levels for a company of our 
size and areas of activity. Maintaining our reputation by aligning our 
commercial goals with our ethical standards is an essential part of 
achieving this aim.
As a UAE-based Company, Lamprell is well rooted in its local 
community and for over thirty years has both beneﬁted from,  
and been a contributor to, that community’s development.  
In 2012, one of the most challenging years in Lamprell’s history, 
the Company continued to work closely with these local 
communities, business partners and regulatory authorities to 
make a positive difference within the localities it operates in.
Social initiatives
Lamprell continued to support the “Don Bosco Snehalaya” 
project in India. Don Bosco Snehalaya is a project focused  
on the street children and youth in the city of Vadodara.  
The project’s basic objective is to provide food, shelter, clothes, 
medicines, recreational facilities and general counselling to  
the young living on the railway platforms and in the streets.  
By training the children in trades according to their capacities 
while maintaining contact with their families, the project helps 
them to develop their self-conﬁdence and the realisation that 
they too can contribute to their community. Ultimately, the project 
aims to integrate these street children into mainstream society.
Charity and community service
Each year Lamprell makes a monetary contribution to a worthy 
establishment, such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (“MSF”), 
Rashid Paediatric Therapy Centre and others. These 
contributions are used for supporting the respective charities’ 
core project budgets which include the provision of equipment, 
staff and other items as needed.
The Company also encourages its employees to partake in ad-hoc 
initiatives within the immediate community or in other regions 
representing the cross cultural mix of our employees. Such 
examples include Lamprell’s support, through one of its employees, 
of the 3rd “Bedouin Builders” campaign for the Tabitha Foundation 
in the UK which helps to build houses for the underprivileged in 
Cambodia and the Company’s support of Dubai College’s initiative 
to raise funds to complete the building of an “Eco Farm” home for 
homeless children in Kathmandu, Nepal.
The workplace and our people:
As a key player in the oil & gas and renewables engineering and 
contracting industry, our workforce is a fundamental base on 
which we have built our expertise and strength.
Attracting, developing and retaining talented staff is of paramount 
importance to the success of Lamprell’s business. To achieve 
this, the Human Resources department has developed policies 
and best practices for effective employee engagement to 
capitalise on the strengths of the employees and their ability to 
contribute to the success of the business. Our policy is to ensure 
equal opportunity in career development, promotion, training and 
reward for our employees. With a diverse range of nationalities 
within the Group, we also respect and recognise the value of 
different cultures.
Staff retention is always a challenge in the oil & gas sector so, in 
order to maximise retention of our key employees, we strive to offer 
competitive rewards and beneﬁts whilst maintaining a strong focus 
on the health, safety and well-being of our workforce.
The provision of purpose-built accommodation and transportation 
for the core labour force further enhances our ability to maintain 
good employee relations and improve the quality of life for our 
dedicated and loyal employees. The Company has acquired 
additional accommodation for the labour force which will enhance 
individual personal space and provide further amenities for health 
and recreation. In addition to in-house medics, Lamprell has 
recently introduced “on site” camp doctors at one of its main 
camps. Lamprell provides private medical cover for its workforce 
enabling them to take advantage of locally available medical 
facilities, whilst giving peace of mind to family dependents.  
We aim to provide a safe and supportive work environment to our 
employees and a competitive and cost-effective compensation 
programme. We believe that our overall beneﬁts packages 
continues to be a market differentiator and will strengthen our goal 
of becoming an “employer of choice”.
Health, safety, environment and security summary (“HSES”)
Given the nature and demands of our business, ensuring a high 
level of performance in health, safety, environment and security is 
absolutely essential, and Lamprell has a strong track record in 
these areas. With no room for complacency in HSES, we seek to 
continually improve our performance and ensure we maintain our 
focus on this area of our operations. In 2012, the Company 
continued to build on its “safety culture” throughout the 
organisation through its employee incentive linked in-house 
Safety Observation Audit Programme (“SOAP”).
To monitor incidents and identify trends, the Company continued its 
use of the centralised reporting system for leading indicators under 
a Total Recordable Incident Ratio. This ratio facilitates the analysis  
of all cases as well as Lost Time Incidents (“LTI”). Lamprell has 
established a strong safety track record which is exceptional for  
the oil & gas construction industry; the Group achieved an overall 
performance LTI Frequency Rate of 0.22. Lamprell maintained the 
accreditation with the management system certiﬁcate ISO 14001: 
2004 and the updated Occupational, Health and Safety 
Assessment Series, OHSAS 18001; 2007 .
Environment
Across all our activities we seek to minimise the mark we leave 
on the sites at which we work.
Our policy is to strive to achieve continual improvement in 
environmental performance and to maintain an internal 
management structure for the management with clearly deﬁned 
responsibilities. At all times Lamprell aims to comply with, and 
where possible exceed, applicable legal and other requirements 
relating to the organisation.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of 
Lamprell plc
Report on the ﬁnancial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated and parent 
company ﬁnancial statements (‘the ﬁnancial statements’) of Lamprell 
plc and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise the 
consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 December 
2012 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated and company 
statements of changes in equity and consolidated and company 
cash ﬂow statements for the year then ended and a summary of 
signiﬁcant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Directors’ responsibility for the ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair 
presentation of these ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable Isle of Man law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of consolidated and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial 
statements based on our audit. This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Section 15 of the Isle of 
Man Companies Act 1982 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance whether the ﬁnancial statements 
are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the 
ﬁnancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view 
of the ﬁnancial position of the Group as at 31 December 2012, 
and of its ﬁnancial performance and its cash ﬂows for the year 
then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union;
> the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair 
view of the ﬁnancial position of the parent company as at 
31 December 2012, and its cash ﬂows for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982; and
> the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004.
Emphasis of matter
We draw attention to Note 2.1 of the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements which states that the ability of the Group to continue 
as a going concern is reliant upon the continued availability of 
external debt ﬁnancing and access to bank guarantees for its 
major projects. The deterioration of the Group’s performance in 
2012 arising as a result of the underperformance of certain key 
projects, the majority of which have now been completed, 
caused the Group to seek waivers for certain of its banking 
covenants for the year ended 31 December 2012. These waivers 
were obtained prior to 31 December 2012. The Group is 
currently in discussions with its lenders to restructure its debt 
facilities and agree revised covenants on a long term basis and 
has agreed further covenant waivers to facilitate the continuation 
of the negotiations. The Group expects to conclude discussions 
with lenders in a satisfactory manner and has continued to meet 
all interest and other payment obligations. After reviewing its 
cash ﬂow forecasts for a period of not less than 12 months, from 
the date of signing of these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing its ﬁnancial statements. Our opinion is 
not qualiﬁed with respect to this matter.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report on the following:
The Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931-2004 require us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
> proper books of account have not been kept by the parent 
company or, proper returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
> the parent company’s balance sheet is not in agreement with 
the books of account and returns; or
> we have not received all the information and explanations 
necessary for the purposes of our audit; and
> certain disclosures of directors’ loans and remuneration 
speciﬁed by law have not been complied with.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
> the directors’ statement as set out on page 28 in relation to 
going concern;
> the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our review; and
> the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the six disclosures 
speciﬁed for our review.

1 Legal status and activities
Lamprell plc (“the Company/the parent company”) was incorporated and registered on 4 July 2006 in the Isle of Man as a public 
company limited by shares under the Isle of Man Companies Acts with the registered number 117101C. The Company acquired 100% 
of the legal and beneﬁcial ownership in Lamprell Energy Limited (“LEL ”) from Lamprell Holdings Limited (“LHL ”), under a share for 
share exchange agreement dated 25 September 2006 and this transaction was accounted for in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements using the uniting of interests method (Note 27). The Company was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of 
the London Stock Exchange with effect from 16 October 2006. From 6 November 2008, the Company moved from AIM and was 
admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) plc’s main market for listed securities. The address of the registered ofﬁce 
of the Company is Fort Anne, Douglas, Isle of Man and the Company is managed from the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”). The 
address of the principal place of the business is PO Box 33455, Dubai, UAE.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) are: the upgrade and refurbishment of 
offshore jackup rigs; fabrication; assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewable sector, including 
jackup rigs and liftboats; Floating Production, Storage and Ofﬂoading (“FPSO”) and other offshore and onshore structures; and oilﬁeld 
engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs.
During 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Maritime Industrial Services Company Ltd Inc (“MIS”) through its wholly 
owned subsidiary Lamprell Investments Holding Limited. MIS is registered in Panama and has operations in the Middle East and 
Kazakhstan. The principal activities of MIS are the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs; fabrication; assembly and new 
build construction for the offshore oil and gas sector; engineering and construction; safety and training services and other operating

For the year ended 31 December 2012 61 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and parent company ﬁnancial statements are set 
out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group and the ﬁnancial statements of the parent company have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the Isle of Man 
Companies Acts 1931-2004. In accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982, the Company has not 
presented its own statement of comprehensive income. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. The ability of the Group to continue as a going concern is reliant upon the continued availability of external debt 
ﬁnancing and access to bank guarantees for its major projects. The deterioration of the Group’s performance in 2012 arising as a 
result of the underperformance of certain key projects, the majority of which have now been completed, caused the Group to seek 
waivers for certain of its banking covenants for the year ended 31 December 2012. These waivers were obtained prior to 
31 December 2012. The Group is currently in discussions with its lenders to restructure its debt facilities and agree revised covenants 
on a long term basis and has agreed further covenant waivers to facilitate the continuation of the negotiations.
The Group expects to conclude discussions with lenders in a satisfactory manner and has continued to meet all interest and other 
payment obligations. After reviewing its cash ﬂow forecasts for a period of not less than 12 months, from the date of signing of these 
ﬁnancial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its 
ﬁnancial statements.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting polices below.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated and parent 
company ﬁnancial statements, are disclosed in Note 4.
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning on or after 1 January 
2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 January 2012 
and not early adopted
IAS 19, “Employee beneﬁts” was amended in June 2011. The impact of this amendment will be as follows: to eliminate the corridor 
approach and recognise all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as they occur; to immediately recognise 
all past service costs; and to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability/(asset). This amendment has no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial 
statements and the Group intends to adopt IAS 19 Amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 
2013.
IFRS 9, “Financial instruments”, addresses the classiﬁcation, measurement and recognition of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. 
IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classiﬁcation and 
measurement of ﬁnancial instruments. IFRS 9 requires ﬁnancial assets to be classiﬁed into two measurement categories: those 
measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classiﬁcation 
depends on the entity’s business model for managing its ﬁnancial instruments and contractual cash ﬂow characteristics of the 
instrument. For ﬁnancial liabilities, the standards retain most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the 
fair value option is taken for ﬁnancial liabilities, the part fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other 
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to reassess 
IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2015 (subject to 
EU endorsement).
IFRS 10, “Consolidated ﬁnancial statements” builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the parent company. The standard 
provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difﬁcult to assess. The Group will adopt IFRS 10 for 
the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 12, “Disclosures of interests in other entities” includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, 
including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The Group will adopt IFRS 12 
for the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

IFRS 13, “Fair value measurement”, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise deﬁnition of fair value 
and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely 
aligned between IFRSs and US GAAP , do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be 
applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP . The Group will adopt IFRS 13 for 
the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
2.2 Revenue recognition
(a) Contract revenue
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method. When the outcome of the contract can be reliably 
estimated, revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated costs up to the year end bear to the estimated total 
costs of the contract. When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to 
the extent of costs incurred up to the year end which are considered recoverable.
With respect to new build ﬁxed price construction contracts with an expected contract duration of 18 months or greater, proﬁt on 
such contracts will only be recognised when the contract has progressed to 20% based on the total estimated cost of the contract 
and the ultimate outcome can be reliably estimated.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of 
revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is 
probable that the customer will accept the claim and the amount can be measured reliably.
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated losses, 
including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is ﬁrst foreseen.
The aggregate of the costs incurred and the proﬁt/loss recognised on each contract is compared against progress billings at the year 
end. Where the sum of the costs incurred and recognised proﬁt or recognised loss exceeds the progress billings, the balance is 
shown under trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts. Where the progress billings exceed the sum of costs 
incurred and recognised proﬁt or recognised loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables as amounts due to 
customers on contracts.
In determining contract costs incurred up to the year end, any amounts incurred including advances paid to suppliers and advance 
billings received from sub-contractors relating to future activity on a contract are excluded and are presented as contract work-in-
progress.
(b) Inspection services
Revenue from inspection services is recognised when the services have been rendered; the customer has accepted the service and 
the collectability of the related receivables are reasonably assured.
(c) Products and services
Revenue from sale of products and services is recognised in the accounting period in which the product is sold or the service is 
rendered.
(d) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.
2.3 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and 
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another 
entity. The Group also assesses existence of control where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power but is able to govern 
the ﬁnancial and operating policies by virtue of de-facto control.
De-facto control may arise in circumstances where the size of the Group’s voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings 
of other shareholders give the Group the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies, etc.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date 
that control ceases.
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Financial Statements
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2012 63 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the 
Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date 
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, 
the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations involving entities under common control do not fall within the scope of IFRS 3. Consequently, the Directors 
have a responsibility to determine a suitable accounting policy. The Directors have decided to follow the uniting of interests method for 
accounting for business combinations involving entities under common control.
Under the uniting of interests method, there is no requirement to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities and hence 
no goodwill is recorded as balances remain at book value. Consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the proﬁt or loss and cash ﬂows 
for the entire year (pre and post merger) as if the subsidiary had always been part of the Group. The aim is to show the combination 
as if it had always been combined.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed or adjustments have been made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity jointly controlled by two or more parties by means of contractual arrangement. The results of operations, 
assets and liabilities of the Group’s joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements using the equity method 
of accounting except when classiﬁed as held for sale. Under the equity method, investments in jointly controlled entities are carried at 
cost plus subsequent changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the jointly controlled entity, net of any accumulated impairment 
losses.
The income statement reﬂects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the jointly controlled entity (based on the equity 
method). Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest in that joint venture are not recognised unless the Group has a 
legal or constructive obligation to fund those losses.
(c) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to 
recognise the investor’s share of the proﬁt or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates 
includes goodwill identiﬁed on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition proﬁt or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the 
carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 
including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. 
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate 
and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of proﬁt/(loss) of an associate’ in the income statement.

Statements 64 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
2.4 Investment in subsidiaries
In the Company’s separate ﬁnancial statements, the investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less provision for impairment. Cost is 
the amount of cash paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the investment. Income from such investments is 
recognised only to the extent that the Company receives distributions from accumulated proﬁts of the investee company arising after 
the date of acquisition. Distributions received in excess of such proﬁt, i.e. from pre-acquisition reserves, are regarded as a recovery of 
investment and are recognised as a reduction of the cost of the investment.
2.5 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Group’s activities are primarily carried out from the UAE, 
whose currency, the AED, is pegged to the US Dollar and is the functional currency of all the entities in the Group (except MISCLP 
whose functional currency is Omani Riyal, MISQWLL whose functional currency is Qatari Riyal, MIS Kazakh Branch whose functional 
currency is Kazakh Tenge and EBT whose functional currency is the GBP). The consolidated and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements are presented in US Dollars.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, except when deferred into other comprehensive income as qualifying cash ﬂow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated 
income statement within ‘ﬁnance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gain and losses are presented in the consolidated 
income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
(c) Group companies
The results and ﬁnancial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinﬂationary economy) that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
> assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
> income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and
> all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on sale.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment is the 
purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the 
expected useful economic lives of the assets as follows:
Years
Buildings and infrastructure 3–25
Operating equipment 3–15
Fixtures and ofﬁce equipment 3–5
Motor vehicles 5
The assets’ residual values, if signiﬁcant, and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the ﬁnancial period in which they are 
incurred.
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, capital work-in-progress is transferred to property, plant and 
equipment and depreciated in accordance with Group policies.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount (note 2.21).
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Financial Statements
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2012 65 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within ‘other 
gains/(losses) – net’ in the income statement.
2.7 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over 
Lamprell plc’s interest in the net fair value of the net identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair 
value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”) or groups of CGUs, that is expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which 
the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management 
purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
(b) Trade name
A trade name acquired as part of a business combination is capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of 
acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Amortisation is 
calculated on a straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life of 10 years. The useful life of 
a trade name is reviewed on an annual basis.
(c) Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date 
of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
Amortisation is calculated on a straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life of four years. 
The useful life of customer relationships is reviewed on an annual basis.
(d) Operating lease rights
Intangible assets representing operating leasehold rights are carried at cost (being the fair value on the date of acquisition where 
intangibles are acquired in a business combination) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the leasehold right over its estimated useful life.
(e) Computer software
Work-in-progress in relation to computer software is stated at cost. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the 
software product include the software development employee costs. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are 
not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. When commissioned, work-in-progress is transferred to software and amortised 
in accordance with Group policies.
2.8 Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and consumables which are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost is 
determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition.
2.9 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts receivable from customers for billing in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one 
year or less they are classiﬁed as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculties 
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are 
considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the effective interest rate.

Company

Business 
Review
Corporate 
Governance
Financial 
Statements 66 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement within ‘general and administrative expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off 
against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
‘general and administrative expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.
2.10 Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classiﬁed as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as 
non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.11 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of 
the obligation can be made.
2.12 Employee beneﬁts
(a) Provision for staff beneﬁts
A provision is made for the estimated liability for employees’ entitlements to annual leave and related beneﬁts as a result of services 
rendered by the employees up to the balance sheet date. Provision is also made, using actuarial techniques, for the end of service 
beneﬁts due to employees in accordance with the Labour Laws applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, for their 
periods of service up to the balance sheet date. The provision relating to annual leave and leave passage is disclosed as a current 
liability and included in trade and other payables, while that relating to end of service beneﬁts is disclosed as a non-current liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in assumptions are charged or credited in the consolidated income statement in the 
period in which they arise.
(b) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the shares/options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the shares/options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for 
example, proﬁtability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
shares/options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of shares/options 
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company has granted rights to its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies conditional upon the completion 
of continuing service with the Group for a speciﬁed period. The total amount of the grant over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and is recognised in each period as an increase in the investment in the 
subsidiary with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. In the separate ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiary, the fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity instruments of the Company is recognised as an expense with a 
corresponding credit to equity.
2.13 Leases
Leases in which a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classiﬁed as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current accounts with banks less margin deposits, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in 
current liabilities on the balance sheet.

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the repayment value is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The Group capitalises 
general and speciﬁc borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of 
the cost of that asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
2.16 Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Group’s consolidated and parent company ﬁnancial statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.
2.17 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and accessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identiﬁed as the Executive Directors that make strategic decisions.
2.18 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes 
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if 
they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
proﬁt or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax 
liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax 
liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.19 Financial assets
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets in the following categories: at fair value through proﬁt or loss, loans and receivables and held-
to-maturity. Currently, the Group does not have any available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. The classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for 
which the ﬁnancial assets were acquired. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are ﬁnancial assets held for trading. A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if 
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classiﬁed as current assets.

Review
Corporate 
Governance
Financial 
Statements 68 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Financial assets carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in 
the consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the investments 
have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss’ category are presented 
in the consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’ in the period in which they arise.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classiﬁed as 
non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade receivables (Note 2.9), other receivables (excluding 
prepayments), receivables from related parties and cash and cash equivalents (Note 2.14) in the Group balance sheet and amounts 
due from related parties (Note 24) and cash at bank (Note 25) in the Company balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost less 
provision for impairment. The amortised cost is computed using the effective interest method.
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the counterparty have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership.
(c) Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturities that the 
Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an insigniﬁcant 
amount of held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets, the whole category would be tainted and reclassiﬁed as available for sale. Held-to-
maturity ﬁnancial assets are included in non-current assets, except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the end of the 
reporting period, which are classiﬁed as current assets. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective 
evidence that a held-to-maturity ﬁnancial asset or a group of held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets is impaired.
(d) Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial 
assets is impaired. A ﬁnancial asset or a group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is 
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) 
and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets that 
can be reliably estimated.
2.20 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at 
their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash ﬂow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as 
its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ﬂows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 29. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classiﬁed as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current 
asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Financial Statements
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2012 69 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in the periods when the item affects proﬁt or loss (for example, when 
the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition 
of a non-ﬁnancial asset (for example, contracts work-in-progress or ﬁxed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity 
are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately 
recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of contracts work in progress or in depreciation in the case of ﬁxed assets.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in 
the consolidated income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
2.21 Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to amortisation 
and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less cost to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 
which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows (cash-generating units). Non-ﬁnancial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed 
for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Any material impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement and separately disclosed.
2.22 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The excess of proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs over the par value of the shares are credit to the share premium.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until 
the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders.
2.23 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the ﬁnancial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding 
of the ﬁnancial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the 
signiﬁcance of their nature or amount.
3 Financial risk management
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange and cash ﬂow interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis to assess and manage critical exposures. 
The Group’s liquidity and market risks are managed as part of the Group’s treasury activities. Treasury operations are conducted 
within a framework of established policies and procedures.
(a) Market risk – foreign exchange risk
The Group has foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to commitments in Euro with certain suppliers. To manage the foreign 
exchange risk exposure arising from future commercial transactions and recognised liabilities, the Group uses forward exchange 
contracts (Note 29).
(b) Market risk – cash ﬂow interest rate risk
The Group holds its surplus funds in short-term bank deposits. During the year ended 31 December 2012, if interest rates on deposits 
had been 0.5% higher/lower, the interest income would have been higher/lower by USD 564,000 (2011: USD 483,000).
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash ﬂow interest 
rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. During the year ended 31 December 2012, if interest rates on 
borrowings had been 0.5% higher/lower, the interest expense would have been higher/lower by USD 1,110,000 (2011: USD 668,000).

(c) Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is detailed in Notes 15, 20, 22, 23, 25 and 29. The Group has a policy for dealing with customers 
with an appropriate credit history. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any ﬁnancial institution.
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, held-to-maturity 
investment, ﬁnancial asset carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss, trade and other receivables and derivative ﬁnancial instruments. 
The Group has a formal procedure of monitoring and follow up of customers for outstanding receivables. For banks and ﬁnancial 
institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘B’ are accepted. The Group assesses internally the credit 
quality of each customer, taking into account its ﬁnancial position, past experience and other factors.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had a signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk with nine of its largest customer balances accounting 
for 53% (2011: 58%) of trade receivables outstanding at that date. Management believes that this concentration of credit risk is 
mitigated as the Group has long-standing relationships with these customers.

(d) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufﬁcient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of 
committed credit facilities. The Group is currently ﬁnanced from Shareholders’ equity and borrowings. The borrowings are subject to 
meeting certain banking covenants. The deterioration of the Group’s performance in 2012 arising as a result of the underperformance 
of certain key projects the majority of which have now been completed caused the Group to seek waivers for certain of its banking 
covenants for the year ended 31 December 2012. These waivers were obtained prior to 31 December 2012. The Group is currently in 
discussions with its lenders to restructure its debt facilities and agree revised covenants on a long-term basis and has agreed further 
covenant waivers to facilitate the continuation of the negotiations.
The Group’s liquidity risk on derivative ﬁnancial instruments is disclosed in Note 29.

3.2 Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, or issue new 
shares to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and bank 
balances. Total capital is calculated as “equity” as shown in the balance sheet plus net debt. The net debt to total capital at the 
balance sheet date was as follows:
2012
USD’000
2011
USD’000
Total borrowings 159,323 251,125
Less: cash and bank balances (Note 25) (263,439) (149,377)
Net debt n/a 101,7 48
Total equity 406,067 533,898
Total capital n/a 635,646
Gearing ratio n/a 16%
At the balance sheet date, the Group has no net debt and was therefore un-geared.
The deterioration of the Group’s performance in 2012 arising as a result of the underperformance of certain key projects, the majority 
of which have now been completed, caused the Group to seek waivers for certain of its banking covenants for the year ended 
31 December 2012. These waivers were obtained prior to 31 December 2012. The Group is currently in discussions with its lenders to 
restructure its debt facilities and agree revised covenants on a long-term basis and has agreed further covenant waivers to facilitate 
the continuation of the negotiations.
3.3 Fair value estimation
The table below analyses ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been deﬁned as 
follows:
a. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
b. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) 
or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
c. Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These 
valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity speciﬁc 
estimates. If all signiﬁcant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or 
more of the signiﬁcant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Speciﬁc valuation techniques used to value ﬁnancial instruments include:
a. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments; and
b. Other techniques, such as discounted cash ﬂow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining ﬁnancial instruments.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group makes estimates and assumptions 
concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by deﬁnition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates 
and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next ﬁnancial year are as follows:
Revenue recognition
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the percentage-of-completion 
method requires the Group to estimate the stage of completion of the contract to date as a proportion of the total contract work to be 
performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.2. As a result, the Group is required to estimate the total cost to 
completion of all outstanding projects at each period end. The application of a 10% sensitivity to management estimates of the total 
costs to completion of all outstanding projects at the year-end would result in the revenue and proﬁt increasing by USD 24.4 million 
(2011: USD 32.9 million) if the total costs to complete are decreased by 10% and the revenue and proﬁt decreasing by USD 45.2 
million (2011: USD 24.3 million) if the total costs to complete are increased by 10%.
Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill (Note 17) for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a 
potential impairment. Goodwill is monitored by management at the “cash generating unit relating to upgrade and refurbishment of 
offshore jackup rigs, fabrication, assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors, including 
FPSO and other offshore and onshore structures, oilﬁeld engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs”

The recoverable amount of CGU

 is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates. 
These calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow projections based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by management covering a three-year 
period. Cash ﬂows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated revenue growth rate of 5%. A discount rate of 
12.96% is used to discount the pre-tax cash ﬂow projections to the present value. A change in the assumptions selected by 
management used in the cash ﬂow projections could signiﬁcantly affect the impairment evaluation. If the revenue growth rate used 
was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, there would be a reduction of USD 1.6 million in the headroom if the revenue 
growth rate was lower by 0.5% and the headroom would be higher by USD 1.6 million if the revenue growth rate was higher by 0.5%. 
If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, there would be a reduction in the headroom of USD 
23.6 million if the discount rate was to increase by 0.5% or an increase in the headroom by USD 26.3 million if the discount rate was 
to decrease by 0.5%. If the net proﬁt as a percentage of revenue used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, there 
would be an increase of USD 61.9 million in the headroom if the net proﬁt as a percentage of revenue was to increase by 0.5% and 
there would be a decrease of USD 61.9 million in the headroom if the net proﬁt as a percentage of revenue were to decrease by 0.5%. 
If the terminal value growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, there would be a reduction in the 
headroom of USD 16.7 million if the terminal value growth rate was lower by 0.5% or an increase in the headroom of USD 18.6 million 
if the terminal value growth rate was higher by 0.5%.
Estimated impairment of investment in subsidiaries
The Company tests investment in subsidiaries (Note 18) for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
The recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiaries is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations 
require the use of estimates. These calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow projections based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by 
management covering a three-year period. Cash ﬂows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated revenue 
growth rate of 5%. A discount rate of 12.96% is used to discount the pre-tax cash ﬂows projections to the present value. During the 
year, the Company recorded an impairment charge with respect to its investment in LEL of USD 397 .7 million (Notes 18 and 27). A 
change in the assumptions selected by management used in the cash ﬂow projections could signiﬁcantly affect the impairment 
evaluation. If the revenue growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, the impairment charge would be 
higher by USD 2.1 million if the revenue growth rate was decreased by 0.5% and the impairment charge would be lower by USD 2.1 
million if the revenue growth rate was increased by 0.5%. If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s 
estimates, the impairment charge would be higher by USD 25.5 million if the discount rate was increased by 0.5% and the impairment 
charge would be lower by USD 28.3 million if the discount rate was decreased by 0.5%. If the net proﬁt as a percentage of revenue 
was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, the impairment charge would be higher by USD 67 .1 million if the net proﬁt as a 
percentage of revenue was lower by 0.5% and the impairment charge would be lower by USD 67 .1 million if the net proﬁt as a 
percentage of revenue was higher by 0.5%. If the terminal value growth rate was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, the 
impairment charge would be higher by USD 17 .8 million if the terminal value growth rate was lower by 0.5% and the impairment 
charge would be lower by USD 19.8 million if the terminal value growth rate was increased by 0.5%.
If the investment in LEL was to be further impaired based on the above sensitivity analysis, the impairment loss on the investment in 
LEL will be adjusted from the other reserve (Note 27) in the separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company and accordingly this will 
have no impact on the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Employees’ end of service beneﬁts
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post-employment deﬁned beneﬁt obligation should be based on market yields on high 
quality corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds should 
be used. In the UAE, there is no deep market either for corporate or government bonds and, therefore, the discount rate has been 
estimated using the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy. On this basis, the discount rate applied was 3.00% (2011: 
4.25%). If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5 points from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the employee’s end 
of the service beneﬁts provision at the balance sheet date would be an estimated USD 1.2 million (2011: USD 1.4 million) lower or USD 
1.3 million (2011: USD 1.5 million) higher.
5 Segment information
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker has been identiﬁed as the Executive Directors who make strategic decisions. The Executive 
Directors review the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined 
the operating segments based on these reports.
The Executive Directors consider the business mainly on the basis of the facilities from where the services are rendered. Management 
considers the performance of the business from Sharjah (SHJ), Hamriyah (HAM) and Jebel Ali (JBA) in addition to the performance of 
Land Rig Services (LRS) and International Inspection Services Limited (Inspec).

SHJ, HAM, JBA and LRS meet all the aggregation criteria required by IFRS 8 and are reported as a single segment (Segment A). 
Services provided from Inspec do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8, and the results of these operations are 
included in the “all other segments” column.
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue from the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, fabrication, 
assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors, including FPSO and other offshore and 
onshore structures, oilﬁeld engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs.
Inspec derives its revenue from various services such as non-destructive pipeline testing, ultrasonic testing and heat treatment.
During 2011, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, LIH, acquired MIS (Note 32). The revenue of MIS is mainly derived from the 
upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, fabrication, assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas sector, 
engineering and construction. The Executive Directors consider these services to be similar to the services provided by Lamprell from SHJ, 
HAM, JBA and LRS and hence they have been considered under the reporting segment (Segment A). Additionally, MIS also provides safety 
and training services (Sunbelt) and other operating and maintenance services (O&M). As services provided by Sunbelt and O&M do not 
meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8, the results of these operations are included in the “all other segments” column.

Sales between segments are carried out on agreed terms. The revenue from external parties reported to the Executive Directors is 
measured in a manner consistent with that in the consolidated income statement.
The Executive Directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of gross proﬁt. The staff, equipment 
and certain subcontract costs are measured based on standard cost. The measurement basis excludes the effect of the common 
expenses for yard rent, repairs and maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses. The reconciliation of the gross operating (loss)/

Free share plan
The Company awarded shares to selected Directors, key management personnel and employees under the free share plan that 
provides an entitlement to receive these shares at no cost. These free shares are conditional on the Directors/key management 
personnel/employee completing a speciﬁed period of service (the vesting period). The award does not have any performance 
conditions and does not entitle participants to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The fair value of the share awards made 
under this plan is based on the share price at the date of the grant less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period.

Executive share option plan
Share options are granted by the Company to certain employees under the executive share option plan. This option plan does not 
entitle the employees to dividends. These options are conditional on the employee completing three years of service (the vesting 
period) and hence the options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date and have a contracted option term of ten years. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
The movement in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise price is as follows:
Exercise price 
in £ per share Options Vesting date Expiry date
At 1 January 2009 3.22 105,369 16 May 2010 16 May 2017

Vested and exercised 3.22 (35,253)
Vested but not exercised 3.22 (50,531)
At 31 December 2011 0.57 550,000
Adjustment for the rights issue 0.57 55,048
Vested and exercised 0.57 (605,048)
At 31 December 2012 ––
At 31 December 2012, 13,711 (2011: 50,531) options under this plan were not exercised or lapsed.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2009 determined using a binomial valuation model was £0.28 per option. 
The signiﬁcant inputs into the model were an average share price for a period of one year immediately preceding the grant date of 
£2.91, an exercise price of £0.57 , volatility of 50%, dividend yield of 3.31%, an expected option term of ten years, an annual risk-free 
interest rate of 3.28% and a withdrawal rate of 5% per annum. The risk-free rate is derived from the yield on United Kingdom (UK) 
Government Bonds as detailed by the Bank of England, using a 10-year maturity in line with the life of the option. The volatility 
assumption is based on an analysis of the historic daily share price volatility of the Company since its listing date, capped at 50%. A 
charge of USD 17 ,000 (2011: USD 62,000) is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year with a corresponding 
credit to the consolidated retained earnings. This includes a charge recognised in the income statement of the Company with a 
corresponding credit to retained earnings of USD 17 ,000 (2011: USD 62,000).

Performance share plan
The Company granted share awards to directors, key management personnel and selected employees that give them an entitlement 
to receive a certain number of shares subject to the satisfaction of a performance target and continued employment. The 
performance target related to the growth in the Group’s earnings per share. The fair value of the share awards made under this plan is 
based on the share price at the date of the grant less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period. The details of the

(a) Basic
Basic (loss)/earnings per share is calculated by dividing the (loss)/proﬁt attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held 
as treasury shares (Note 26).
(b) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the free share awards, options under executive share option plan and 
performance share plan, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to outstanding share awards/options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of 
shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share awards/options. Since the Company has incurred a loss from 
continuing operations during the year ended 31 December 2012, all the Company’s existing potential ordinary shares are not dilutive 
as they decrease the loss from continuing operations.

On 19 May 2011, the Company announced a rights issue of three shares for every ten shares held at a discounted price of 232 pence 
per share resulting in the issue of 60,083,792 new ordinary shares. The calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares for the year 2011 was affected by the issue of the new ordinary shares. The Group has treated the discount element of the 
rights issue as if it was a bonus issue, using the theoretical ex-rights price of 324 pence per share.

Trade name represents the expected future economic beneﬁt to be derived from the continued use of the MIS trade name acquired 
on acquisition of MIS.
Customer relationships represent the expected future economic beneﬁts to be derived from the existing relationship with key MIS 
customers acquired on acquisition of MIS.
Leasehold rights represents a favourable operating right acquired upon the acquisition of JIL and LE FZCO in 2008. It was decided 
during the year to cancel this lease and write-off the net book value. The remaining portion includes the leasehold rights acquired on 
acquisition of MIS and existing lease hold rights in the books of MIS on acquisition of Rig Metals LLC in 2008. The value of the 
intangible assets has been determined by calculating the present value of the expected future economic beneﬁts to arise from the 
favourable lease terms (12 to 20 years).
Work-in-progress represents the cost incurred towards the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning software (“ERP 
software”). During the year Management has discontinued the implementation of the ERP . Accordingly USD 1.5 million, the cost 
equivalent to the ERP software in use, was transferred to ERP software and will be amortised over its useful life of 27 months and the 
balance of USD 3.3 million was written off and included in general and administration expenses in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Management reviews the business performance based on the type of business (Note 5). Goodwill is monitored by the management 
at the operating segment level. Goodwill of USD 180.5 million arising due to the acquisition of MIS (Note 32) has been allocated to the 
CGU
1
 within Segment A.
The recoverable amount of CGU
1
 has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow 
projections based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. Cash ﬂows beyond the three-year 
period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate of 5% (2011: 4.3%) for Segment A. A discount rate of 12.96% (2011: 9%) has 
been used to discount the pre-tax cash ﬂows projection to the present value. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.

The Company granted free shares/share options to employees of its subsidiaries under various plans (Note 8). These shares and 
options have a vesting period of eighteen to thirty six months. Accordingly, the proportionate share-based charge for the year of USD 
1.1 million (2011: USD 0.9 million) has been recorded as an increase in investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding credit to 
retained earnings.
The recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiaries is determined based on value in use calculations (Note 4). Based on these 
calculations an impairment charge of USD 379.7 million with respect to investment in LEL is recognised in the Other reserve (Note 27) 
in the separate balance sheet of Company. This relates to the impairment of investment in LEL which was accounted for using the

28 Provision for employees’ end of service beneﬁts
In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, management has carried out an exercise to assess the present value of its obligations at 
31 December 2012 and 2011, using the projected unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service beneﬁts payable under 
the Labour Laws of the countries in which the Group operates. Under this method, an assessment has been made of an employee’s 
expected service life with the Group and the expected basic salary at the date of leaving the service. The obligation for end of service 
beneﬁt is not funded.

During 2012, the Group entered into a forward contract to sell USD for Euros. This derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting and 
is carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss. The notional principal amount at the date of inception of these contracts was Euro 20.8 
million. This contract matures in various instalments within 22 months from the date of inception. The fair value at the 31 December 
2012 of this derivative was USD 1.2 million. The fair value gain on derivative is recorded in ‘other gains/(losses) – net’ in the 
consolidated income statement.
During 2010, the Group entered into three forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure with respect to certain supplier 
commitments in Euros. The notional principal amounts at the date of inception of these contracts were Euro 142 million. These 
contracts matured in April and May 2012.
During 2011, the Group entered into three forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure on expected NOK payments with 
respect to the acquisition of MIS. The notional principal amounts at the date of inception of these contracts were NOK 1,864 million. 
These contracts matured in September 2011.
A proﬁt of USD 1.1 million (2011: USD 13.1 million) was recorded in equity and a proﬁt of USD 0.1 million (2011: USD 4.0 million) was

relation to the three forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure with respect to NOK payments made to the 
shareholders of MIS was recorded as a basis adjustment to the purchase consideration (Note 32). The net movement in the fair value 
reserve during the year was a proﬁt of USD 1.2 million (2011: loss of USD 1.0 million).

During 2011, prior to being acquired by the Group (Note 32), MIS entered into a forward contract to sell Euros for AED. This derivative 
did not qualify for hedge accounting and was carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss. The fair value at the 31 December 2011 was 
USD 272,000.
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts 
and the liquidity of the market. To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties, using the same techniques 
as for other counterparties.

Bank facilities are secured by lien over term deposits in the amount of USD 115.3 million (2011: USD 75 million) (Note 25), the Group’s 
counter indemnities for guarantees issued on their behalf, the Group’s corporate guarantees, letter of undertakings, letter of credit 
payment guarantees, cash margin held against letters of guarantees, assignment of insurance policies over property, plant and 
equipment and over inventories, leasehold rights for land and certain contract-related receivables.
The deterioration of the Group’s performance in 2012 arising as a result of the underperformance of certain key projects, the majority 
of which have now been completed, caused the Group to seek waivers for certain of its banking covenants for the year ended 
31 December 2012. These waivers were obtained prior to 31 December 2012. The Group is currently in discussions with its lenders to 
restructure its debt facilities and agree revised covenants on a long-term basis and has agreed further covenant waivers to facilitate 
the continuation of the negotiations.
The bank facilities relating to overdrafts and revolving facilities carry interest at 3–6 months LIBOR/EIBOR + 2.0% to 4.0% (2011 : 
LIBOR/EIBOR + 2.5% to 4.0%).
The borrowings at 31 December 2012 are stated net of the unamortised arrangement fees and other transaction costs of USD Nil 
(2011: USD 3.5 million).
The carrying amounts of borrowings in the year approximated to their fair value and were denominated in US Dollars or UAE Dirhams, 
which is pegged to the US Dollar.

Acquisition of MIS
During 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in MIS. MIS is registered in the Republic of Panama and has operations in the 
Middle East and Kazakhstan. The principal activities of MIS are the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, fabrication, 
assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas sector, engineering and construction, safety and training services 
and other operating and maintenance services. MIS was listed on the Norwegian Stock Exchange. LIH made a voluntary offer to the 
shareholders of MIS on 19 May 2011 for a consideration of NOK 38 per share. LIH received acceptance from 99.76% of the 
shareholders of MIS before expiry of the offer on 29 June 2011 and announced that the offer was successful on 30 June 2011. 
Further, LIH also issued a cash cancellation offer to the option holders of MIS for cancellation of the options held by them and 
received acceptances from the majority of the option holders before expiry of the cash cancellation offer on 29 June 2011.
LIH settled in cash the consideration payable to the shareholders and option holders of MIS who accepted the voluntary offer and 
cash cancellation offer respectively on 13 July 2011. Further, LIH extended the mandatory offer in August 2011 to the remaining 
shareholders of MIS (0.24%) who did not accept the voluntary offer.
Control of MIS transferred to LIH on 13 July 2011. The consideration for transfer of shares of MIS and cancellation of options (Note 8) 
amounted to approximately USD 337 .9 million. Management has completed the purchase price allocation in accordance with IFRS 3 
(revised) “Business Combinations”.
As a result of the acquisition, the Group is expected to reduce competition and increase its presence in new markets. It also expects 
to reduce costs through economies of scale and synergies. The goodwill of USD 180.5 million arising from the acquisition is 
attributable to the acquired customer base, workforce and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the legacy 
Group and MIS.

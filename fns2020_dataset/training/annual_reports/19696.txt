CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Progress
I am pleased to report that your Company increased total 
Annualised Recurring Revenue by 1% to £28.7 million at 
constant currency (2014: £28.3 million) including a 46% 
increased contribution from StatPro Revolution of £7.8 million 
(2014: £5.4 million). Owing to reduced professional services 
income and currency effects, total revenue decreased 6%  
to £30.2 million (2014: £32.0 million). Adjusted EBITDA 
increased by 1% at constant currency to £4.0 million (2014: 
£4.0 million). StatPro Revolution related recurring revenue 
now amounts to £14.1 million (2014: £11.7 million), representing 
56% of total software recurring revenue (2014: 46%).
Acquisitions
On 21 January 2016, StatPro Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company) acquired the entire share capital of Investor 
Analytics LLC, the US-headquartered, cloud-based risk 
analytics company to hedge funds and asset managers. This 
acquisition brings a complementary cloud-based risk service, 
a highly professional team, new clients and greater market 
penetration into the important US and hedge fund market. 
With effect from 1 March 2016, StatPro South Africa (Pty) 
Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) acquired  
a 51% shareholding in InfoVest Consulting (Pty) Ltd, a South 
African headquartered software provider, specialising in  
data warehouse, ETL and reporting software for the asset 
management industry.
By taking a majority stake in InfoVest, your Company will 
participate in the benefits of the expanding compliance 
management market as well as improving the product and 
services we offer to clients. In addition, InfoVest’s data 
warehouse software is a cost-effective solution for asset 
managers and service providers to manage their internal 
data effectively in order to provide input data to StatPro 
Revolution and other systems. 
Financing
The Group signed a new financing facility with Wells Fargo in 
July 2015 available for acquisitions, share buy-backs and 
general corporate purposes. As part of the acquisition of 
Investor Analytics in January 2016, the financing facilities 
were increased and the key features of the facilities now are:
Carl Bacon
Chairman
• Five year commitment period to July 2020
• £10 million committed revolving credit facility
• US$7 million committed term loan
• US$3 million committed deferred drawdown loan
• £7.5 million uncommitted additional facility 
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.05p per share 
for 2016 payable on 25 May 2016 to all shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 29 April 2016 taking the 
total dividend to 2.9p per share (2014: 2.9p per share). 
Products
In 2015, total research and development expenditure was 
maintained at the high level of £4.9 million (2014: £5.0 million) 
representing 16% of Group revenue. The total cash expenditure 
in 2015 on StatPro Revolution, including marketing and other 
costs, amounted to £5.4 million (2014: £5.5 million).
It has been a long journey but at last your Company is 
positioned in 2016 to deliver the first cloud-based, integrated 
platform for performance, risk and compliance analytics in 
the asset management industry.
People
I would like to take this opportunity once again to 
congratulate our employees for the achievement of 
delivering such a fantastic suite of products and I look 
forward to their continued success selling and implementing 
these products throughout 2016.
Prospects
Asset managers still continue to grapple with increased 
regulation, more complex investment strategies, cost 
reduction and demands for better communication. Front 
office and middle office technology will continue to converge. 
The asset management industry is one year closer to your 
Company’s vision of integrated performance, risk and 
compliance delivered in the cloud.

Chairman
11 March 2016

TRANSFORMING OPERATIONAL PROCESSES WITHIN ASSET MANAGERS
Within asset managers, the middle office serves as  
a go-between for front office trading and back office 
administration. Firms are now focusing on transforming 
the middle office to become a bottom line contributor and  
a strategic business partner.
PwC comments
4
 “Right-sourcing the middle-office 
functions can help asset managers achieve several 
benefits, including maintaining or gaining competitive 
advantage, and enabling them to leverage scarce 
resources to focus on strategic decision support and 
address complex compliance issues.”
The middle office represents an area of focus to drive 
efficiency and growth. The nature of the middle office is 
changing as more demand is placed on it to service more 
internal clients as well as external regulatory demands for 
complex and granular data. If this entire function is not 
efficient, then it has an impact on the entire organisation.
“Under-investment in middle-office functions has resulted 
in an infrastructure that is inflexible and unscalable for 
product, customer, regulatory growth and increasing 
product complexity.”

“AS BANKS SCALE DOWN OTHER 
OPERATIONS, THE LIMELIGHT IS  
FALLING ON ASSET MANAGEMENT.”
ALEX BIRKIN, HEAD OF WEALTH AND ASSET
MANAGEMENT ADVISORY, EY
In StatPro’s view, the industry is only part way through this 
transformation of middle office operations with many still 
struggling with outdated processes and limited technology.
The majority of asset managers are still between the
‘As-is’ and ‘Mid-way’ phase with very few already
at the ‘To-be’ stage 3. 
‘As-is’ •  Middle office services exist in silos
•  Transactional processing requires 
excessive manual effort and attention
‘Mid-way’ •  Middle office collaborates with front office
•  Contains some capacity for analysis
•  Has higher degree of automation 
and better control
‘To-be’ •  Middle office viewed as a strategic partner
•  Relies less on static data, more on 
accessibility of actionable information
•  System integration capacity increases
•  Middle office operations are low 
cost and highly automated
StatPro’s mix of game changing technology and industry 
expertise helps our clients move their middle office 
operations from the ‘As-is’ state to the ‘To-be’ state as 
outlined above. The StatPro Revolution platform is designed 
to make the process of daily performance measurement 
and complex portfolio analytics more efficient, more 
automated and an enabler of strategic value.  Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

REVENUE JOURNEY 
BUSINESS MODEL
The recurring ‘rental’ model has many benefits over 
traditional software licenses and maintenance and provides 
transparency and stability for the business. Our client 
contracts are at least one year in length and are typically 
three years or more. In 2015, over 80% of our clients were  
on multi-year contracts.
Per portfolio and not per user
The StatPro Revolution pricing model is based on the number 
of portfolios the client wishes to analyse within the platform. 
It is also based on the complexity of the analysis and what 
the client requires from each portfolio. There are four 
portfolio types within StatPro Revolution each offering 
increasing levels of analytical capability. 
BRONZE Designed for total level analysis, statistics 
and unlimited reporting.
SILVER In addition to Bronze, provides security level 
analysis with attribution, contribution, allocation and 
risk.
GOLD In addition to Silver, supports complex assets, 
fixed income contribution analysis, advanced 
attribution models and detailed/custom benchmarks.
PLATINUM In addition to Gold, provides advanced risk 
management, risk compliance monitoring and fixed 
income attribution analysis.
There is a minimum annual fee of $18,000 ($36,000 if 
complex asset coverage is required) even if the client only 
loads a single portfolio. 
A key element in this model is the ability for clients to create 
as many users as they wish to access the platform and 
perform analysis and reporting. This differentiates StatPro 
Revolution from many other analytics systems. By allowing 
unlimited users (with a fair usage policy) we encourage our 
clients to share access to multiple people both inside and 
outside their organisation. Advanced user management 
controls allow for secure profiles to be created so clients can 
manage users, content and access. The client is in full control 
of the data and analysis that users can see. 
This innovative approach allows for more people within the 
asset manager to benefit from the analysis being created 
and helps teams create a ‘self-service’ strategy for their 
analysis distribution. It also encourages clients to add more 
portfolios to the system so they can benefit from company 
wide access without being penalised for adding  
additional users.
Another important source of revenue is through our fund 
administrator network. Fund administrators and other 
service providers use StatPro Revolution to provide 
investment analytics to their asset manager clients. Fund 
Administrators can be very large organisations who hold 
accounting data on millions of portfolios that can be then 
analysed in StatPro Revolution. Asset servicing is a very 
competitive marketplace and having the ability to provide  
the right portfolio analytics in a fast, flexible and secure way 
helps providers win new business and maintain existing 
clients. StatPro works with over 34 asset service providers  
in this way.
StatPro has always operated a recurring revenue 
business model for all our software.
This was a pioneering approach before the days of Software as a Service  
and the cloud, but it has allowed us to transition the business from on-premise  
software to cloud-based solutions without adversely impacting revenue streams  
or the revenue profile of clients.
IMPLEMENTATION
CONSULTING
Client signs up for StatPro 
Revolution and accepts 
additional implementation 
consulting services. The level 
of consulting depends on the 
number of portfolios and 
complexity of the securities. 
This can range from a few 
days to hundreds of consulting 
days for a global project.
ADDITIONAL
REVENUE
As the client can provide 
access to as many users as 
they wish, more people can 
benefit from the analysis, 
which encourages the 
business to request more  
of the portfolio estate to  
be loaded into StatPro 
Revolution. 
RECURRING
SUBSCRIPTION
The client typically signs a 
standard three year term. 
Revenue is recognised over 
the length of the contract, 
resulting in the deferral of 
some revenue.
ANALYSIS LEVEL
UPGRADES
Clients can quickly and easily 
upgrade portfolios to gain 
access to more advanced 
levels of analysis. One 
example of this is upgrading 
from Gold to Platinum level 
to provide advanced risk 
management analysis on  
a portfolio. 11
HOW WE GENERATE VALUE
The diagram below shows the 
key drivers behind StatPro’s 
growth and value. It is based  
on four interlinking value drivers.

Our pioneering technology is making advanced 
portfolio analysis easier and more cost effective  
for investment managers of any size. The StatPro 
Revolution platform enables our clients to calculate 
an array of multi-asset class performance, risk and 
compliance analytics for any portfolio. 

Our people are at the heart of everything we do at 
StatPro. Our industry experience and expertise 
combined with our technology is what makes our 
products and services so valuable to clients. Every 
person in each department across 12 global offices  
is working towards the same goal – to make the most 
complete, scalable, secure, and intuitive portfolio 
analytics platform in the market.

When creating our technology we recognise the 
importance of scalability. Our clients are seeing 
enormous pressures placed on their aging 
infrastructure and applications, so we invest heavily 
to ensure our cloud-based solutions are scalable, 
robust, secure and future proof to allow them to 
meet any demand.

By working with partners such as asset service 
providers, industry consultants, data management 
specialists and third party developers we can enrich 
the StatPro Revolution platform making it more 
valuable to a wider audience within our clients.  
A strong partnership base also allows StatPro to 
focus on our core strengths of portfolio analytics.

performance were very strong in 2015. ARR increased by 
46% (2014: 68%), the order book grew by 57% (2014: 70%) 
and the average revenue per client grew 67% (2014: 37%). 
One of the key metrics used by SaaS businesses is to 
estimate the costs of acquiring each customer (Cost of 
Acquiring Customers or ‘CAC’) and compare that with the 
Lifetime Value of the customer contracts (Lifetime Value  
or ‘LTV’). StatPro’s LTV/CAC ratio rose to 16.1 (2014: 11.3).
StatPro revenues were £30.19 million in 2015 (2014: £32.02 
million). As expected, professional services revenue was 
lower in 2015 at £1.64 million (2014: £2.76 million) reflecting 
the lower cost of implementing StatPro Revolution for its 
clients. Whilst revenue from services was lower, the Group 
generated more sales of recurring revenue. 
During 2015, sterling’s strength reduced Group revenues by 
about 5% versus 2014, which impacted the Group’s profit. 
Following the acquisition of IA, about 18% of the Group’s ARR 
is sterling-based and about 36% is US dollar-based, on a  
pro forma basis.
The Board is recommending that the full year dividend is 
maintained at 2.9p per share (2014: 2.9p).

Strategy 
Having positioned StatPro early as a true cloud-based 
service, the Group has developed a significant commercial 
advantage in its market. It is not possible to repurpose 
traditional software as a multi-tenant software service nor  
is it easy to build the vast range of functionality from scratch 
to meet the needs of the increasingly demanding asset 
management industry. 
The Group’s collective knowledge across many markets in 
multiple analytics disciplines has helped build a very broad 
range of highly sophisticated analytics, designed to suit 
the needs of all types of asset managers across all the 
major markets. 
Over the last 20 years, the requirements of the asset 
management industry have expanded hugely, significantly 
increasing the cost of doing business whilst at the same time 
increased competition has applied pressure on fee income. 
This combination of anticipating the market dynamics and 
positioning the Group’s products to offer the most 
productive and efficient services to its clients has always 
been the focus. In common with many rapidly maturing 
markets, the cost of entering the performance and risk 
analytics market is growing. StatPro believes that it has a 
sustainable technology lead in its market and is benefiting 
from its early investment, which has helped provide 
enhanced functionality for its clients.
As part of the Group’s strategy, StatPro also anticipates that 
it will make further acquisitions. Having created StatPro 
Revolution as the upgrade for StatPro Seven, StatPro 
Revolution could also be the upgrade for a number of other 
products in the market. The investment cost of moving to the 
next generation of technology is now so high that it makes 
more sense for some companies to sell their valuable client 
base rather than take the development and investment risk.
The Group has developed a 
significant commercial advantage  
in its market. 13
The unique capabilities of StatPro Revolution Performance 
are its unprecedented scalability and speed as well as
the rich data management facilities.

Current trading and outlook
The Group’s forward order book is now £36.6 million, of which 
£14.7 million is from StatPro Revolution. Trading in 2016 has 
started well and the Group expects another year of good 
growth in sales of StatPro Revolution. 
With the forthcoming release of StatPro Revolution 
Performance, StatPro will continue the process of moving its 
many clients of StatPro Seven onto StatPro Revolution. 
As the Group moves closer towards becoming a business 
with the majority of its revenues derived from the cloud, 
StatPro anticipates that its operating margins and cash 
generation will improve.
Operational review
StatPro Revolution is sold on a per portfolio basis with four 
service levels (Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze). Upsells of 
additional portfolios or higher service levels require little or 
no implementation, demonstrate that the client is happy with 
the service and improve the marginal profitability of each 
client. Upsells to existing StatPro Revolution clients 
represented 44% of new StatPro Revolution sales. 
In 2015, the Group migrated all the functionality of the 
StatPro Seven Risk Management Module (‘SRM’) to StatPro 
Revolution to create the Advanced Risk Management module 
(‘ARM’) and added some significant new functionality not 
available in SRM. As a result, the Group anticipates moving 
most of its SRM clients to StatPro Revolution during the 
course of 2016. 
The acquisition of IA will enhance this move as the Group 
expects that many of its existing clients will see the 
combination of IA and ARM as one of the most complete  
risk services available in the market.
During 2016, StatPro will release StatPro Revolution 
Performance. This is the core module that manages 
transaction-based performance and enables the complete 
conversion of all its StatPro Seven clients to StatPro 
Revolution. The unique capabilities of StatPro Revolution 
Performance are its unprecedented scalability and speed  
as well as the rich data management facilities. 
The release of StatPro Revolution Performance will mark  
the end of an eight-year investment process to redevelop  
all the Group’s performance and risk capabilities in the new 
technology of the cloud. As a result, whilst there will always 
be a need to innovate, StatPro anticipates that its 
development costs as a percentage of revenues will begin  
to reduce over time.
Development in 2015 was focused on delivering the 
Advanced Risk Management module to enable the 
conversion of its SRM clients to StatPro Revolution. The 
Group also added significant functionality to its Compliance 
module for AIFMD and UCITS IV. StatPro will add IA to this risk 
platform during 2016 and in the process create one of the 
most complete and cost effective risk solutions available 
today in the market. This will make risk one of StatPro’s key 
sales themes for 2016.
In addition, StatPro has also been working on the high 
performance Hadoop
®
 platform for StatPro Revolution. This 
new platform will enable the Group to calculate performance 
and risk for the largest of portfolios in much the same time 
as StatPro does for smaller portfolios thanks to parallel 
processing using the ‘map-reduce’ process. This new 
calculation platform will be the basis of the benchmark 
management and fixed income attribution modules. StatPro 
expects to see significant improvement in calculation times 
as a result.
StatPro Revolution Performance remains on track to be 
released to clients in the second half of the year. The Group has 
a number of clients that are working with it integrating their data 
to test the system. These tests are going well and the Group 
expects to be engaged in a number of projects to implement 
StatPro Revolution Performance as soon as it is released.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Sales
StatPro Revolution sales in 2015 have been driven mostly  
by three ‘Sales Themes’: Compliance, Equity Attribution  
and Conversions.
Total Group revenue was down 1% at constant currency. 
EMEAA revenues were up 1%* and North American revenues 
were down 5%*.
2015 KEY SALES THEMES:
Risk compliance
Equity attribution
StatPro Seven conversions
Compliance sales (driven by regulation) remain solid in 
Europe, where we still see a fragmented market and many 
manual and inefficient processes. While UCITS and AIFMD 
regulations are now consolidated, there is still plenty of 
scope to improve automation and efficiency in the processes 
of asset managers.
Compliance is also playing a role in South-East Asia and  
also, in particular, in Australia: during the course of 2015 we 
released a solution targeted to that market, followed by 
sales and a general positive response. Also, the regulators  
in South Africa, a market where we have a strong presence, 
released in 2015 a Hedge Fund regulation, which has many 
traits in common with the EU AIFMD regulation. We have 
already signed up the first client for this functionality and  
the sales pipeline looks promising. We are also following with 
interest the developments in the USA, where the SEC has 
distributed a consultation paper with the objective of 
strengthening risk management procedures for mutual 
funds investing in derivatives. StatPro is confident we can 
develop in a short time a solution that tailors our existing 
offering to the new American rules.
* At constant currency.
Dario Cintioli
Managing Director
 
We are now a specialist in risk compliance, knowledge is 
widespread across the Group and we know how to adapt  
our solutions quickly to the specific requirements for each 
local regulation. In 2016, we expect Compliance to remain  
a leitmotif of our sales.
New equity attribution sales continue to be focused on small 
to medium money managers. In 2016, we will release the 
transactional performance module, StatPro Revolution 
Performance and this will allow us to target larger clients  
and to expand this sales theme. It is worth mentioning that, 
especially in America, the prospects in this area often require 
to associate an equity factor risk solution to performance 
attribution. The acquisition of Investor Analytics delivers  
this component and we expect a mutual benefit in sales to 
equity managers for both equity performance and factor  
risk analyses.
We are now a specialist in risk compliance

In 2016, we will release the transactional performance module 
StatPro Revolution Performance and this will allow us to

www.statpro.com
Client conversions continued to be an important component 
of our sales, securing our StatPro Seven clients and paving 
their way to the StatPro Revolution platform. In 2015, we 
completed the risk functionality of Revolution, empowering us 
to migrate StatPro Seven Risk clients into Revolution. We are 
busy migrating the first few clients and we expect to 
accelerate the process in the coming months.
In 2016, we expect the same sales themes to dominate our 
sales strategy, with an increased emphasis on new clients 
and new sales, supported by the constant growth of the 
product and an increasing functional maturity. We believe 
the release of Revolution Performance to be pivotal for 
increasing the average deal size across the Equity Attribution 
sales theme.
Client Services
The most important achievement of 2015 is the definition of 
a standardised approach to implementations for buy-hold 
performance and risk clients. Learning the lessons of recent 
years, Client Services has worked with Development to 
produce a standard format of inputs (internally called the 
Market Value Data Model) that can yield successful 
implementations independently from the complexity of  
our clients’ positions. This is the result of in-depth work that 
started in the product years ago, abstracting the complexity 
of financial products (especially derivatives) in a generalised 
framework. This new approach simplifies implementations 
and reduces client support calls, yielding increased 
productivity for our Client Services department.
During the year, we have continued increasing the profile of 
our consultants and continued re-enforcing the Pre-Sales 
function, researching more cooperation and combined  
sales efforts between subject matter experts and  
business development.
We still see margins for improving productivity and we 
believe that the accelerating maturity of the product will 
increasingly allow us to transform unbillable support time 
into billable consultancy. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

Product
If 2015 was the year of Risk Management, 2016 will be the 
year of Performance Measurement, when we will release  
the important transactional performance module, StatPro 
Revolution Performance. This module brings to the 
performance industry a new capacity of scaling thanks  
to the elasticity of the cloud and to modern development 
technology. Some large clients and fund administrators 
suffer from a lack of scalability and we are convinced that, 
with StatPro Revolution Performance, the platform solves 
middle office issues that have been hampering scale and 
productivity for larger institutions.
The other innovative aspect of StatPro Revolution 
Performance is the introduction of a superb workflow 
framework, which is designed to facilitate and automate the 
data validation process, and is at the heart of transactional 
performance measurement. We believe that the workflow 
we have designed can significantly reduce the time needed 
to perform data controls and clean transactional data to 
reconcile official fund performance with security-level 
measurement. We will also release a highly scalable 
Benchmark Manager, built on modern database technology, 
for managing an infinite number of client benchmarks in  
a single application.
The acquisition of Investor Analytics (‘IA’) is a gem that  
we have started to integrate. The first objective is to 
integrate data flows from and to the IA module. During  
the course of the year we will introduce single sign-on for 
user management and integrate the product inside the 
StatPro Revolution menu, leading to a single-system 
experience even with separate products, a technology  
that we have also successfully implemented for StatPro 
Revolution Performance.
IA brings factor analysis to StatPro, a front office  
oriented interface, stronger presence in North America  
and another great group of people, highly compatible  
with StatPro’s culture. StatPro gives IA strength in asset  
class coverage, performance analytics and synergies in  
risk functionality. Together, the two systems deliver a 
complete multi-model risk solution, covering all asset  
classes with industry leading functionality. This is  
an exciting achievement for StatPro.
Technology
StatPro continues to work with the latest technology. We 
believe that combining the best technology with our in-depth 
industry knowledge is what makes us special. It is part of  
the ‘secret sauce’ that sets us apart from the competition. 
During 2015, we upgraded many components of our private 
cloud platform including the core network, which is at the 
heart of any system. In 2016, we are replacing the server 
hardware in our datacentres with more compact, more cost 
efficient hardware that will run the analytics engines, 
databases and web servers for StatPro Revolution Analytics.
During 2015, we continued our development in the cloud 
which resulted in some key advancements. This included 
auto-scaling, which allows the StatPro Revolution 
Performance system to automatically scale up to compute 
huge amounts of transactional performance data, producing 
security level weights and returns, the raw ingredient for  
any asset manager to perform portfolio analytics. This 
technological advancement will result in a game-changing 
performance measurement product for the industry in 2016.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
(CONTINUED...)
We remain a leader in our field as we bring a  
new generation of portfolio analytics systems  
to the global asset management industry. 21
In 2016, we will be working even more closely with our cloud 
partners (Microsoft and Amazon) to counter the threat of 
cyber-attacks. We are already working on innovative new 
ways to encrypt client data within the cloud while maintaining 
encryption key management within our private data centres. 
This allows us to work closely with clients and their 
information security teams to ensure we meet all their 
security requirements, including the very stringent 
requirements from global tier 1 asset managers and banks. 
Our technology capability means we remain a leader in our 
field as we bring a new generation for portfolio analytics 
systems to the global asset management industry.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Revenue
Group revenue decreased by 6% at actual rates to  
£30.19 million (2014: £32.02 million), although at constant 
currency the reduction was 1%. Growth of 64% in revenue 
from StatPro Revolution (at constant currency) was offset  
by reductions in revenue from StatPro Seven, data, and 
professional services.
Contracted revenue
The forward order book of contracted revenue for StatPro 
Revolution increased by 57% to £14.66 million (2014 at 
constant currency: £9.31 million). The total forward  
order book of contracted revenue was £36.57 million at 
31 December 2015 (2014 at constant currency: £36.91 million). 
The proportion by value of recurring software licences and 
data clients at the end of 2015 secured to the end of 2016 or 
beyond amounted to 71% (2014: 77%); the weighted average 
length of contracts committed remained unchanged at 16 
months. 
New contracted revenue
New sales of recurring contracts were up 7% to £4.13 million 
(2014: £3.87 million). Professional services revenue was lower 
than prior year at £1.64 million (2014: £2.60 million at 
constant currency) reflecting the lower cost of implementing 
StatPro Revolution for its clients. Approximately 85% of new 
recurring contracted revenue came from existing clients 
(2014: 78%). 
Recurring revenue 
The Group’s business model of Software as a Service 
(‘SaaS’) recurring revenue contracts continues to provide 
excellent visibility of revenue. The ARR from software licences 
and data fees at the end of December 2015 increased by 1% 
to £28.70 million (2014: £28.33 million at constant currency). 
The net growth rate for StatPro Revolution ARR was 46% 
(2014: 68%).
StatPro Seven annualised recurring revenue was resilient 
with a net cancellation rate (at constant currency and 
excluding the impact of conversions to StatPro Revolution  
of £1.56 million) of 3% (2014: nil). With the impact of 
conversions to StatPro Revolution, the ARR for StatPro  
Seven reduced to £17.41 million (2014: £19.52 million).
The ARR for Data (including overage) increased by 1% at 
constant currency to £3.49 million (2014: £3.46 million).
Revenue by region
Revenue increased in the EMEAA region by 1% to  
£19.80 million (2014 at constant currency: £19.59 million).  
In the North American region, revenue decreased by 5% to 
£10.39 million (2014 at constant currency: £10.93 million),  
as shown in table 1 below.
Revenue by service
Cloud revenues (incorporating StatPro Revolution, Risk and

StatPro Revolution revenue
StatPro Revolution recurring revenue made up 27% of the 
Group total (2014: 18%) and has grown at a higher rate than 
other revenues as the service is developed on a highly 
scalable technology platform. On a pro forma basis, the 
Group’s cloud revenues are now 34% of total Group 
revenues, taking into account the two acquisitions in  
early 2016.
The total recurring revenue from clients whose subscription 
includes StatPro Revolution was £14.11 million (2014:  
£11.65 million) representing 56% (2014: 46%) of total software 
recurring revenue.
StatPro continues to focus on increasing the average 
revenue per client. This resulted in losing some lower value 
contracts whilst overall the average revenue per StatPro 
Revolution client in 2015 increased by 67% (2014: 37%).
Operating expenses 
Operating expenses (before amortisation of intangible 
assets and exceptional items) reduced by 7% (3% at constant 
currency) to £23.72 million (2014: £25.53 million). Whilst the 
business continues to invest, the Group benefited from cost 
efficiencies and internal streamlining of processes the Group 
had implemented in 2014. The average number of employees 
reduced to 242 (2014: 251).

Profitability
The adjusted EBITDA was down 7% at actual rates but up 1% 
at constant currency to £4.04 million (2014: £4.02 million at 
constant currency) as shown in table 3 below.
Gross profit margin (see note 3) for the period was 61% 
(2014: 62%).
SaaS-based KPIs
One of the key metrics used by SaaS businesses is to 
estimate the costs of acquiring each customer (Cost of 
Acquiring Customers or ‘CAC’) and compare that with the 
Lifetime Value of the customer contracts (Lifetime Value  
or ‘LTV’), and the results for StatPro are presented in  
table 4 overleaf. 
Generally a value of three or higher for the ratio of LTV:CAC 
is considered acceptable for a successful SaaS business and 
for StatPro it is currently around 16. The Cost of Acquiring 
Customers has increased as the Group is focusing on larger 
contract values, Implied Customer Lifetime has increased 
due to lower cancellation rates and therefore the Customer 
Lifetime Value has also increased significantly in the last two 
years by over 300%.
Finance income and expense 
Net finance expense was £0.29 million (2014: £0.29 million), 
and is mainly due to the finance costs of the Group’s  
credit facility.

Profit before tax 
The impact of currency movements resulted in a reduced 
adjusted profit before taxation by £0.17 million. Profit before 
taxation at constant currency was 14% higher at £2.41 million 
(2014: £2.11 million at constant currency) and up 2% at actual 
rates. Adjusting for amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets and share-based payments, the adjusted profit 
before taxation was £2.56 million (2014: £2.58 million). 
Taxation
The tax charge was £0.79 million (2014: £0.77 million). The 
overall effective tax rate was 33% (2014: 33%). This is higher 
than the prevailing UK rate mainly due to the impact of 
operations in countries with higher tax rates than the UK.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share was 2.6p (2014: 2.7p). Actual 
and diluted earnings per share was 2.4p (2014: 2.4p). 
 
Dividends
The Directors are recommending maintaining the final 
dividend of 2.05p per share (2014: 2.05p) making a total 
dividend for 2015 of 2.9p per share (2014: 2.9p). The final 
dividend will be paid on 25 May 2016 to all shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 29 April 2016. Total 
dividends paid in 2015 amounted to £1.96 million (2014:  
£1.89 million). The dividend cover (calculated as adjusted  
eps: dividends per share) was 0.90 times (2014: 0.93).
Balance sheet
The Group’s net assets at the year end reduced to  
£41.52 million (2014: £45.69 million), the reduction mainly 
being due to currency movements on goodwill values. 
Cash flow and financing
Cash inflow from operating activities of £6.55 million (2014: 
£7.71 million), was lower than the prior year, mainly due to 
adverse working capital movements. The Group ended the 
year with net cash of £1.28 million (2014: £2.68 million). 
Research and development and capex
The research and development team is now focused solely 
on the Group’s cloud-based solutions, the StatPro Revolution 
platform. The level of R&D expenditure was similar to the 
prior year at £4.93 million (2014: £4.99 million) (an increase 
of 5% at constant currency), equating to 16% of Group 
revenue (2014: 16%). The total expenditure on StatPro 
Revolution including marketing and other costs was  
£5.39 million (2014: £5.52 million). Development costs of 
£4.05 million were capitalised in the year (2014: £3.62 million) 
and amortisation on internal development was £3.54 million 
(2014: £3.35 million). Expenditure on other intangible assets 
was £0.08 million (2014: £0.44 million) and total capital 
expenditure on property, plant and equipment was  
£0.88 million (2014: £1.86 million). 
Post Balance Sheet Events

With effect from 1 March 2016, StatPro South Africa (Pty) 
Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) acquired  
a 51% shareholding in InfoVest Consulting (Pty) Ltd, a South 
African headquartered software provider, specialising in data 
warehouse, ETL and reporting software for the asset 
management industry. 
Further details on these acquisitions are provided in note 28.
Principal financial risks 
The principal business risks and uncertainties affecting the 
Group are described on pages 28 to 31. For each category  
of risk, the directors have identified means by which the risk 
can be managed or reduced in a cost effective way, whilst 
accepting that some risks cannot be completely eliminated. 
Details of key financial risks are considered below.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
(CONTINUED...) 27
Financial risk management 
The current and projected financial risks of the Group are 
managed by the Group finance team. The primary risk 
relates to financing facilities and this is mitigated by ensuring 
very tight control of cash and detailed forecasting of 
business cash flows. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash position is closely monitored with weekly 
updates from all overseas operations and daily updates of 
cash collected from customers. Any aged debtor balance 
that is overdue is investigated to ascertain the reason and  
to resolve the situation promptly. Monitoring procedures for 
short-term cash projections allow the Group finance team  
to closely monitor the key liquidity and other financial ratios 
to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity in the business  
at all times and sufficient headroom in relation to the 
banking covenants.
New financing facility 
The Group signed a new financing facility with Wells Fargo  
in July 2015 for acquisitions, share buy backs and general 
corporate purposes. The facility is committed to July 2020, 
subject to compliance with agreed covenants. At 
31 December 2015, the Group had both net cash of  
£1.28 million and committed credit facilities of £10.0 million 
available. As part of the acquisition of Investor Analytics in 
January 2016, the financing facilities were increased and the 
key features of the facilities now are:
• Five year commitment period to July 2020
• £10 million committed revolving credit facility
• US$7 million committed term loan
• US$3 million committed deferred drawdown loan
• £7.5 million uncommitted additional facility available 
The primary financial covenants are linked to recurring 
revenue and adjusted EBITDA while allowing the Group to 
invest for growth. The financing costs will be amortised over 
the five year term. This new facility strengthens the Group’s 
long-term financial structure and therefore the Board 
believes that the Group is well positioned to manage the 
business risks. 
Foreign exchange risk management
The Group is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations given 
that the majority of its revenue is non-sterling based. The 
Group also has a significant proportion of its costs in the 
same currencies as its revenues and therefore there is  
a reasonable degree of natural reduction in overall  
currency risk. 
All material foreign currency transaction exposures (i.e. sales 
and purchase contracts denominated in a different currency 
to the local reporting currency) are hedged through use  
of foreign exchange contracts as soon as the amount  
and timing of the exposure is identified with reasonable 
certainty. The Group’s policy is not to hedge profit and loss 
translation exposures.
As part of our liability management, we have made use of 
currency swaps with a total principal value at 31 December 
2015 of approximately £4.90 million denominated in USD, 
CAD, and EUR, to create synthetic currency hedges in order 
to provide a partial hedge against movements in the fair 
value of investments in overseas subsidiaries. As the Group 
continues to grow and generates increased profits overseas 
in foreign currencies this exchange rate exposure is expected 
to increase. Following the recent acquisition of Investor 
Analytics, the Group has an increased revenue and profit 
exposure to the USD although this is mitigated by an increase 
in USD-denominated costs and debt.
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk and an increase  
in interest rates would increase the interest payable on the 
Group’s banking facility. Given the continued benign outlook 
for interest rates, the Board has decided not to undertake 
any interest rate hedging but will review the position from 
time to time. The risk to rising interest rates (now that the 
Group has returned to a net debt position in 2016) would be 
partly mitigated by an increase in interest income from 
surplus cash and deposits, where the policy is to seek to 
maximise interest return without exposure to inappropriate 
liquidity or counterparty risk.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
By understanding the impact of unfolding 
regulatory changes and updating its products  
in time, StatPro helps clients meet new  
regulatory requirements.
The goal is to maximise value for the  
entire enterprise.
To allay customer concerns regarding their data 
being in the ‘cloud’, StatPro has invested in both 
the ISO 27001 and SSAE16 certifications. 29

Enterprise Risk Management frameworks
An Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM’) framework provides  
a holistic approach that aligns an organisation’s strategic, 
operational, reporting and compliance objectives across all 
levels to manage all key business risks and opportunities.  
The goal is to maximise value for the entire enterprise.
The interaction between business objectives, risk framework 
components and organisational level is best illustrated by  
the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the  
Treadway Commission’s (‘COSO’) ERM Cube. 
The ISO 31000 ‘Risk Management – Principles and Guidelines’ 
standard (published 2009) complements COSO’s ERM 
framework by addressing the management system that 
supports the design, implementation, maintenance and 
improvement of ERM processes.
StatPro has outlined its strategy in this Annual Report.  
Key to the successful outcome is our understanding of 
StatPro’s market drivers:
Transparency
To ensure that StatPro adds the most value possible to its 
clients, it must listen and understand their requirements:
• StatPro uses client ‘new feature’ requests and sales team 
feedback to prioritise product enhancement.
• StatPro also employs suitable financially qualified staff 
(e.g. to CFA level, even on the product development team) 
to ensure that we understand our clients’ needs and  
their issues.
Regulation
By understanding the impact of unfolding regulatory changes 
and updating its products in time, StatPro helps clients meet 
new regulatory requirements.
Competition
StatPro has significant resources to deliver on what is required, 
yet is small enough to react to changing market threats or 
opportunities. Such agility is a key corporate attribute.
Cloud
To allay customer concerns regarding their data being in  
the ‘cloud’, StatPro has invested in both the ISO 27001 and 
SSAE16 certifications. StatPro has embraced the best  
cloud product development and management practices  
for over four years, and has partnered with industry-leading 
IT services suppliers to ensure the best service availability  
and security.
Outsourcing
StatPro has invested in its own products with best-practice 
procedures for its own staff to ensure that clients’ 
requirements are routinely met.

Business strategy fails:
‘StatPro’s business strategy fails to identify new markets and/or products; and/or fails to 
improve on its current offerings.’
CONTEXT
StatPro continues to make considerable investment  
in StatPro Revolution, and will continue to migrate  
its ‘traditional’ asset performance and analytics 
products to the cloud with the launch of StatPro 
Revolution Performance in 2016. If market take-up  
of StatPro Revolution (or StatPro Revolution 
Performance) does not meet expectations, or 
current clients fail to sign up for the planned cloud-
based products over current hosted or installed 
products, the cloud investment won’t have been 
maximised. Indeed, legacy-product clients may  
leave for competitor offerings that they feel more 
comfortable with.
Product design, complemented by a sufficient 
Marketing and Sales effort is key to identifying and 
winning new clients; at the same time convincing 
them of the merits of cloud technology (flexible, 
scalable, lower total cost of ownership, safe and  
online availability).
MITIGATIONS
• Continual investment in Development and Quality 
Assurance.
• Regular monitoring and reporting of project 
development and quality; user-acceptance testing 
of enhancements.
• StatPro actively promotes itself within the asset 
management industry through thought leadership, 
marketing content and regular participation at 
industry events.
• The Board has regular meetings with all teams to 
ensure that products and services meet market 
requirements.
• Continually update market and competitor 
intelligence.
• Continually monitor user feedback and internal KPIs.
2
Sales target not met: 
‘StatPro signing insufficient new contracts.’
CONTEXT
If our externally announced targets are not met by  
new sales or uplifts of existing contracts it could  
cause uncertainty in the marketplace and impact  
our reputation.
Lower revenues could put pressure on our EBITDA  
levels and cash generation.
MITIGATIONS
• Continuous control over the sales process and 
close monitoring of the sales pipeline by regional 
sales directors.
• Targets are set each year and territory 
performance is monitored against them.
• The sales pipeline is managed in Salesforce and  
is updated with reasons for lost opportunities  
e.g. sales performance, functionality, etc.
• Actions are identified in sales strategy meetings 
to meet objectives and sales targets.
• Monthly updates of sales forecasts are made.
• StatPro actively promotes itself within the asset 
management industry through thought leadership, 
marketing content and regular participation at 
industry events.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
(CONTINUED...)
The Group risk assessment has identified 
the following top 4 risks that StatPro must 
manage at the corporate level: 31
3
Clients not satisfied: 
‘StatPro’s reputation suffers if clients’ expectations are not met.’
CONTEXT
New client implementations are critical in setting the 
relationship going forward. StatPro Revolution allows 
for faster implementations than traditional software 
but this process still needs to be managed carefully.
The delivery of new functionality and demonstrating 
its value is an important function of client management. 
Clients need to see value from the platform  
and the client service team are responsible for 
communicating this to clients.
MITIGATIONS
• Ensure a good understanding of clients’ needs.
• Allocated Account Managers to manage the  
client relationship.
• Escalation of issues to director level.
• Proactive account management.
• Multi-year contracts foster client commitment.
4
Cyber-attacks, information security breaches or incidents:
‘StatPro’s reputation is damaged as a provider of cloud-based solutions and/or incurs 
financial penalties if there is a serious data security incident.’
CONTEXT
Loss of service availability due to a cyber-attack on 
the Company’s systems.
Data confidentiality breach in the event of an internal 
or external ‘hack’ leading to the loss of confidentiality 
or integrity of sensitive client or company data.
MITIGATIONS
• StatPro’s internal development, IT and HR 
processes are compliant with the ISO 27001  
and SSAE16 information security standards.
• StatPro is expanding its external audit and 
certification programme to cover all development 
operations during 2016.
• StatPro uses strong data encryption and best 
practice encryption key management for securing 
sensitive data.
• StatPro has dedicated resources responsible for 
data security compliance and technical data 
security practices within the business.
• StatPro conducts penetration tests and 
vulnerability scans on all public facing systems to 
ensure that the risk from known system 
vulnerabilities and cyber threats are minimal.
The principal financial risks of the Group are outlined in the Finance Review. 
The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 31 is approved by the Board.

INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board oversees the Company’s financial reporting, risk 
management and regulatory compliance functions. It also 
sets executive remuneration and oversees executive 
appointments. These roles are fulfilled by the Board and  
its three committees shown below. The Board and its 
committees meet regularly, discuss matters by ‘phone when 
necessary, and circulate minutes and relevant papers in 
advance of each meeting.
My aim as Chairman is to create a diverse, inclusive and 
effective Board, which is fully informed about the business 
and able to provide the executive membership with an 
appropriate balance of challenge and support. My 
relationship with our CEO and our interaction with the 
non-executive directors is of key importance for a climate of 
open communication and constructive debate. I run annual 
Board evaluations, which provide useful feedback to drive 
improvements in the Board’s and committees’ work.
This section of our Annual Report 
explains how the Board and each  
of its committees function. 
Carl Bacon
Chairman 37
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Your Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market 
of the London Stock Exchange (‘AIM’), so the Company is not 
required to adopt the UK Corporate Governance Code, which 
applies only to fully listed companies. Nevertheless, the 
Company is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and the Board is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders. This statement describes how the Company 
applies the principles of good corporate governance. 
The workings of the Board and its committees
The Board
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and  
three other non-executive directors. It is responsible to 
shareholders for the proper management of the Company. 
Directors’ biographies appear on pages 32 to 33 and 
demonstrate their range of relevant experience, bringing 
independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources, industry knowledge and standards 
of conduct. 
All directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is 
responsible for company secretarial matters and compliance 
with relevant statutory obligations. All directors have access 
to training to enable them to comply with their duties as  
a director. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all directors have 
full and timely access to all relevant information. The Board 
meets at least quarterly and has adopted a formal schedule 
of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus 
ensuring that it exercises control over appropriate strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance issues. At its meetings 
the Board reviews trading performance, ensures adequate 
financing, sets and monitors strategy, examines investment 
and acquisition opportunities and discusses reports to 
shareholders. The directors can also take independent 
professional advice as appropriate at the Company’s 
expense. The Chairman meets at least once a year  
with the non-executive directors without the executive 
directors present.
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed 
annually by the non-executive directors. On resignation from 
the Board a non-executive director would be invited to 
provide a written statement to the Chairman for circulation 
to the Board, if he or she were to have any unresolved 
concerns about the running of the Company. The overall 
effectiveness of the Board and its sub-committees is 
reviewed by the Board as a whole through annual completion 
and discussion of a questionnaire. 
The Board believes that the level of sales consulting to 
promote StatPro Revolution provided by Mark Adorian in 
recent years, in addition to his substantial shareholding, 
means that he may no longer be considered independent 
under the UK Corporate Governance code, although the 
Board believes that Mark Adorian is independent of mind 
and continues to act in the interests of all shareholders.
Stuart Clark is the Senior Independent Director and is 
available to the shareholders for any concerns which have 
not been resolved by contact with the Chairman, Chief 
Executive or other executives, or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jane Tozer. The Audit 
Committee also comprises the Chairman (Carl Bacon), Mark 
Adorian and Stuart Clark, and meets at least three times 
annually. The Audit Committee receives reports from the 
Group’s external auditors and its meetings are also 
attended, by invitation, by the Group Finance Director. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Company’s financial 
matters, as set out in written terms of reference, including 
the interim results and the Annual Report and Accounts, 
before their submission to the Board. It monitors the controls 
in force to ensure the integrity of financial information 
reported to shareholders. 
The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of external 
auditors, discusses the nature and scope of the audit and 
reviews the external auditor’s remuneration both for audit 
and non-audit work. The Audit Committee assesses annually 
the qualification, expertise and resources, the independence 
of the external auditors, and the effectiveness of the audit 
process. 
The Audit Committee reviews the whistleblower policy and 
process for staff and receives reports on all issues raised 
through this process.
Remuneration and Nominations Committees
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Stuart Clark,  
and is responsible for determining the contract terms, 
remuneration and other benefits for executive directors, 
including performance-related bonus schemes and 
participation in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme.  
The other members of the Remuneration Committee are 
Carl Bacon, Mark Adorian and Jane Tozer. 
The Remuneration Report, which includes details of directors’ 
remuneration, pension entitlements and directors’ interests, 
together with information on service contracts is set out on 
pages 43 to 46. 
Mark Adorian is the chairman of the Nominations Committee, 
and the other committee members are Carl Bacon, Stuart 
Clark and Jane Tozer. The Nominations Committee reviews 
and nominates appointments to the Board. All such 
appointments are then reviewed and approved by the  
full Board.  38
Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements
Board meeting attendance 
Six scheduled Board meetings were held in 2015. During the 
year, there were three Audit Committee meetings, four 
Remuneration Committee meetings and there was one 
Nominations Committee meeting. The number of scheduled 
Board meetings and sub-committee meetings attended by 
each director during the year are shown in the Attendance 
table below.
Group Executive Board
The Group Executive Board (‘GEB’) is the executive 
committee, which comprises the executive directors and 
other senior executives of the Group who meet at least ten 
times per year to discuss strategic and operational matters. 
Regional executive boards and product-focused committees 
have been established to deal with other executive matters 
within clearly defined terms of reference established by  
the Board. 
The members of the Group Executive Board during 2015  
and their roles and responsibilities are:
Justin Wheatley  Group Chief Executive
Andrew Fabian  Group Finance Director
Dario Cintioli  Managing Director 
Andrew Peddar  Group Chief Operating Officer
Michel Lempicki  Global Accounts Director
Neil Smyth  Marketing and Technology Director
Marc Zandt Global Services Director
In January 2016, Damian Handzy was appointed to the 
Group Executive Board as Global Head of Risk following the 
acquisition of Investor Analytics where he was previously 
CEO. Also, in February 2016, Luca Bortolami was appointed 
to the Group Executive Board as Revolution Director 
responsible for managing the development and data teams 
within StatPro.
The Group Executive Board has the following  
sub-committees:
Regional Boards
EMEAA Region (Europe, South Africa and Asia Pacific)  
and North American Region
Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s strategy, 
including sales and client services strategy and expenditure 
and recruitment plans, are delegated to senior executives in 
the Group’s regions, within clearly defined terms of reference 
and overall budgets established by the Board. 
Product strategy
Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s product 
strategy including development plans and related 
expenditure and recruitment plans are delegated to the 
Product Director who works with other senior executives on 
product-focused committees, within clearly defined terms of 
reference and overall budgets established by the Board. 
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are very important. 
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders 
and market analysts, including presentations after the 
Company’s preliminary announcement of the annual and 
interim results and any other major announcements. 
Internal controls and risk management 
During the year, the Board has formally reviewed the Group’s 
risk profile and reported on the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls and management of Group risk. 
This review addresses internal financial controls and other 
risks and controls of the business. The directors acknowledge 
that they are responsible for the Company’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate business risks and which provides reasonable but 
not absolute assurance against material mis-statement  
or loss.

The Company has established risk management procedures 
which the Board considers appropriate to a group of 
StatPro’s size and complexity. During the year the risk 
management procedures were reviewed by the directors. 
This is achieved through a series of reports and meetings of 
specific committees including the Information Security 
Committee. The Company has a Group Risk Manual, which 
sets out the key risks and the controls in place to manage 
these risks, and identifies actions to be taken to eliminate  
or mitigate risks as appropriate. 
Each senior executive is responsible for managing risks in his 
or her area of responsibility, and making regular reports on 
risk issues to the main Board, Audit Committee and the 
Group Executive Board. This risk analysis is embedded in risk 
review meetings in the Group Executive Board, and covers all 
business risks including commercial, financial, operational, 
legal and environmental risks. These reports include the 
potential impact to the business of each key risk and its 
likelihood of occurrence, plus details of mitigating actions and 
insurance policies including specific cover for the Company 
and/or its directors. 
Recommendations on internal controls and risk improvement 
are reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board. 
A statement of the directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
financial statements is set out on pages 40 to 41 and a 
statement on going concern is below. 
Financial controls
The Group has established written expenditure approval, 
delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation 
of duties and other control procedures including accounting 
policies and procedures.
Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget and key 
risk areas are identified. Performance is monitored and 
relevant action is taken throughout the year through regular 
reporting to the Board of variances from the budget, 
updated forecasts for the year and information on the key 
risk areas.
Investment appraisal 
Major capital and other project expenditure is controlled by  
a budgetary process and authorisation levels set by the 
Board. For capital expenditure above specified levels, and for 
acquisitions and disposals, detailed written proposals must 
be submitted to the Board for approval. 
Internal audit 
The Group currently does not have an internal audit function 
as the directors consider this to be inappropriate given  
the size of the Group. However, this is reviewed by the  
Board annually. 
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries and for the reasons set 
out in the Directors’ Report, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing these financial statements (see note 1). 40

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For these reasons, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s 
financial statements (see note 1).
Future developments 
Future development for the business are covered in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 31.
Research and development 
The Group continues to invest in developing improved 
software products and services. Development expenditure 
incurred during the year was £4.93 million (2014: £4.99 
million). In accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’), development costs are capitalised where 
recognition criteria are met and written off over the useful 
life, currently estimated by the directors to be three years. 
The amount capitalised in the year was £4.05 million (2014: 
£3.62 million) and the total amount of amortisation was 
£3.54 million (2014: £3.35 million). 
Results, dividends and transfers to reserves
The Group’s profit attributable to equity shareholders for the 
financial year was £1.62 million (2014: £1.60 million). A final 
dividend of 2.05p per ordinary share (2014: 2.05p) has been 
recommended by the directors taking the total dividend for 
the year to 2.9p (2014: 2.9p). If approved by the passing of a 
resolution at the 2016 Annual General Meeting, it is intended 
to pay the final dividend on 25 May 2016 to all shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 29 April 2016 (ex-div 
date will be 28 April 2016). The profit for the year has been 
transferred to reserves.
Shares issued in year
During 2015 the Company issued 106,000 shares (2014: 
4,000) as detailed in note 20 to the financial statements. 
There were 225,000 shares held in treasury at 31 December 
2015 (2014: 225,000). At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, the directors are seeking to renew the authority to 
allow the purchase of own shares up to a limit of 10% of the 
Company’s share capital.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, money 
market deposits, banks loans, provisions, derivatives financial 
instruments and various other accounts receivables and 
payables that arise directly from its operations. These 
financial instruments are described in Note 18.
Directors and their interests
The directors who held office during the year were:
Carl Bacon Non-Executive Chairman
Justin Wheatley Group Chief Executive
Andrew Fabian Group Finance Director
Mark Adorian Non-Executive Director
Stuart Clark Non-Executive Director
Jane Tozer Non-Executive Director
All directors are subject to election at the first opportunity 
after their appointment, and then to re-election at intervals 
of no more than three years in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association. The Company’s Articles  
of Association require that one third of the directors, or the 
number nearest to one third, are to retire from office by 
rotation. Stuart Clark has decided not to stand for re-
election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and 
accordingly, Jane Tozer and Justin Wheatley seek re-
election at this year’s AGM. Having each served on the Board 
for more than nine years, Carl Bacon and Mark Adorian are 
also voluntarily seeking re-election at the AGM.
Directors’ interests in the Company’s share capital and share 
options are detailed on pages 45 to 46.
Directors’ interests in significant contracts
Directors’ interests in significant contracts are described in 
note 21 to the financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
The directors present their Annual Report and the 
audited financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2015. 41
directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and the profit or loss of the Group for  
that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
Directors’ indemnity insurance
The Company carries an appropriate level of professional 
indemnity insurance cover for the size of the business and 
also has insurance cover for Directors’ and Officers’ liability.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each director has confirmed that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; 
and
• he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought  
to have taken as a director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and  
to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of  
that information.
This confirmation is given in accordance with Section 418 of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Substantial shareholdings
The Company has been notified of the following disclosable 
holdings of voting rights in the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 26 February 2016:

Employment policies
The Group acknowledges the vital role that all employees 
play in its success through their skills, initiative and 
commitment. All operations are encouraged to provide the 
proper resources to maximise this potential through efficient 
systems of recruitment, communication, training and 
development. It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair 
consideration to the employment and career development  
of disabled persons, commensurate with their aptitudes and 
abilities. The Group’s policy in respect of staff who become 
disabled whilst employed is to make appropriate 
adjustments and to assist them wherever possible to 
continue employment within the Group. The Group is also 
committed to providing equal opportunities regardless of 
age, gender, religion or ethnic origin.
The Group ensures that all employees are kept fully 
informed, as far as it is practicable, with regard to the 
activities of the Group, by circulation of news and regular 
meetings between directors, managers and other 
employees. The London office of StatPro, the Group’s head 
office and base of UK operations, retains its Investors in 
People (‘IIP’) award in recognition of the investment the 
Company has made in its people. The award reflects our 
commitment to and belief in the value of our staff, their 
performance and their contribution to the success of  
the business. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Group made charitable donations for educational 
purposes during the year of £52,000 (2014: £42,000),  
the main component of which related to scholarships and 
sponsorships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds 
to various educational establishments in South Africa.
StatPro’s new London headquarters maintains the Low 
Carbon Workplace Standard under the Carbon Trust  
scheme which encourages businesses to reduce their  
carbon footprint. 
Health and safety
The Group’s policy is to ensure that, as far as is reasonably 
practicable, working environments exist which will minimise 
risk to the health and safety of employees.
Legal form
The Company is a public limited company, incorporated and 
domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s Registration 
number is 2910629.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst and Young LLP as 
independent auditor to the Company will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
(CONTINUED...) 43
REMUNERATION REPORT
Stuart Clark is the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and the other members of the committee are 
Carl Bacon, Mark Adorian and Jane Tozer. The remuneration 
of all executive directors and other senior executives is 
recommended to the Board by the Committee. The 
remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined 
by the Board. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy is to attract, retain and motivate high 
calibre executives by rewarding them with remuneration 
packages which reflect both individual performance and  
the results of the operations under their control. Packages 
consist of basic salary, performance-related bonuses, share 
options, pensions and other benefits, with a proportion  
of potential remuneration based upon achievement  
of demanding performance targets. Details of the 
remuneration package of each director are set out on  
pages 44 and 45.
The Group has implemented a remuneration policy to  
align the executives’ interests with the objectives of all 
shareholders. The current focus is on the execution of the 
cloud strategy, and the achievement of revenue growth  
for StatPro Revolution.
Basic salary and benefits
Salaries are established by reference to prevailing market 
rates, adjusted to reflect individual performance, experience, 
responsibilities and skills. 
Non-executive fees
There were no changes to fee arrangements for non-
executive directors during 2015. 
Annual performance-related bonus scheme
In addition to basic salary, executive directors and other 
senior executives participate in an annual performance-
related bonus scheme. Performance targets are designed to 
both stretch and encourage individuals whilst aligning their 
interests to that of the Group. 
In 2015, the targets for performance-related bonuses for 
main Board executive directors related to the Group’s 
revenue growth rate for StatPro Revolution, combined with 
satisfactory profit generation. The Committee may also 
award individual discretionary bonuses. In 2015, there were 
no discretionary awards. Bonuses do not form part of 
pensionable earnings. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
The committee reviewed the LTIP arrangements in 2014  
for the senior executive team in consultation with external 
advisers and institutional shareholders and, in conjunction 
with professional and legal advice, and as a result, the 
Remuneration Committee implemented a new incentive plan. 
The plan is a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), which consists 
of awards of nil cost options, primarily to executives who are 
on the Group Executive Board. 
There are performance criteria associated with an award, 
linked to eps growth above a certain level (i.e. non-market 
performance criteria). The performance level will affect the 
proportion of shares that are awarded at the end of the 
vesting period. There will be a potential further one year 
holding for a proportion of the award.
The scheme is managed by a third party (Kleinwort Benson, 
Jersey), who has established an Employee Benefit Trust  
and the plan is to buy shares in the market over the vesting 
period rather than issue new shares. The shares held in the 
Trust would not be entitled to dividends.
The PSP was approved by the shareholder general meeting 
on 26 February 2015 and the first awards were made in 
March 2015. The vesting period for the first awards are three 
and four years.
Details of the options outstanding under the schemes are 
provided in note 20 to the financial statements. 
Pensions and other benefits
The Company also operates a defined contribution pension 
scheme for executive directors. Other benefits include 
allowances, life assurance and membership of a private 
healthcare scheme. 
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of 
service, which is terminable by no more than 12 months’  44
Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements
notice. In the event of termination of a service contract, compensation amounting to the notice period would be payable. 
Details of service agreements for each executive director are as follows:
Date of service agreement Notice period on termination
Justin Wheatley 31 December 2012 6 months
Andrew Fabian 10 July 2000 12 months
StatPro International Sarl entered into a new employment contract with Justin Wheatley on substantially the same terms as 
his previous employment contract with effect from 1 January 2013. Justin Wheatley is currently on secondment to StatPro Inc.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts. 
Stuart Clark has decided not to stand for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and accordingly, Jane Tozer 
and Justin Wheatley seek re-election at this year’s AGM. Having each served on the Board for more than nine years, Carl 
Bacon and Mark Adorian are also voluntarily seeking re-election at the AGM. Biographical details of all directors can be found 
on pages 32 to 33.
Performance graph 
  
31 December 2010 = 100
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE™ AIM index is the most appropriate benchmark for total shareholder return 
comparatives. For the five-year period from 31 December 2010 to 31 December 2015 the total shareholder return for StatPro 
was -22%. Over the same period the FTSE™ AIM total shareholder return was -21%.

StatPro operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for Company paid 
pension contributions. Where individuals exchange salary this reduces StatPro’s National Insurance contributions. For 
executive directors, StatPro credits this saving to the individual’s pension. As part of Justin Wheatley’s new service 
agreement, Justin Wheatley has opted to swap pension benefits for other allowances and therefore, he received no pension 
contribution from the Company in 2015 or 2014.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STATPRO GROUP PLC 
We have audited the financial statements of StatPro Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 which comprise Group 
Income Statement, Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, Group Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Group and 
Company Statements’ of Cash Flows, Group Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, Company Statements of Changes 
in Shareholders’ Equity and the related notes 1 to 28. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union  
and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 40, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements
48
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes:
1 The maintenance and integrity of the StatPro Group plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not 
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the 
financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
2 Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1 Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified 
to include the measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. A summary of the significant 
Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous 
policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement  
or statement of comprehensive income. The profit after taxation for the financial year of the Company was £1,743,000  
(2014: £2,612,000). 
The Group and parent Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 
thousand pounds (£’000s) except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of preparation – going concern
The Group operates in the asset management sector of the financial services industry and whilst many of our clients are part 
of banking groups most of them are relatively resilient to the challenging economic backdrop. This is because, like StatPro itself, 
they themselves have recurring revenue business models and, to a large extent, the services and software provided by 
StatPro are reasonably embedded within their core operations. StatPro has a client base of around 500 (2014: 500), which is 
diversified geographically and by product and with no significant client concentration. The largest client group, which comprises 
a number of contracts for a variety of products and in a number of territories, represents less than 6% of recurring revenue. 
StatPro has a level of cancellations each year but most of our contracts are multi-year agreements which roll into subsequent 
commitments unless written notice is given to terminate the contract. For most software contracts the annual licence fee is 
payable in advance and for data contracts the fees are monthly in advance. For these reasons, we have good visibility on any 
potential deterioration in our trading outlook and potential risks to our business.
Renewals occur throughout the year although there is a slightly greater weighting in the fourth quarter. The Board closely 
monitors clients that are potentially at risk of cancellation as well as the pipeline of new business. 
The Group has both cash and undrawn credit facilities available to support its business operations and therefore the Board 
believes that the Group is well-positioned to manage the business risks. In reaching their conclusion the Board has reviewed 
cash flow forecasts. After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, the Board continues to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group and Company financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning 
the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, therefore not necessarily equate to the actual outcome. 
Estimates are made by the directors based on experience and estimates believed to be reasonable expectations of future 
outcomes. Critical accounting estimates and judgements are made in the following areas:
• Impairment of goodwill;
• Carrying value of development assets; and
• Deferred tax recognition. 55
The accounting policies in respect of these items are set out below and further details can be found in notes 11 and 17.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is based on a value in use calculation. 
The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget and 
projections for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or 
significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The 
recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected 
future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the 
recoverable amount for the different cash generating units, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed further in note 11.
Carrying value of development assets
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with Group accounting policy. Initial recognition is based on management’s 
judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has 
reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be 
capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, discount rates to 
be applied and the expected period of the benefits.
Uncertain tax positions
The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by tax authorities of 
the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience 
with previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. 
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the 
likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. 
The level of deferred tax assets recognised and potentially recognisable is disclosed in note 17.
New and amended accounting standards and interpretations
There were no new or amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations effective as of 1 January 2015.
Interpretations and revised standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s future accounting 
but which the Group has not adopted early. Management has not yet fully assessed the impact of these new standards.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement – 1 January 2018;
• IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts – 1 January 2016;
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers – 1 January 2018; and
• IFRS 16 Leases – 1 January 2019.
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings all made 
up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements
56
Revenue 
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods and services, excluding value added tax, of the following: 
a) Licence revenue and related software support contracts 
Licence revenue and software support contract income relating to obligations under contracts is recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of the month in which the licence commences. 
Any balance not relating to the accounting period is carried forward as deferred income on the balance sheet. 
b) Data fees
Data fee income is recognised in the income statement over the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of 
the month in which the contract commences. Any balance not relating to the accounting period is carried forward as deferred 
income on the balance sheet. Data overage revenue on data contracts (data revenue in excess of contracted amount) is 
recognised in the period that the overage was incurred.
c) Professional services revenue 
Income relating to consultancy projects is recognised in the income statement as a right to consideration is established as  
a result of performance.
d) Royalty revenue 
Income is recognised in the income statement as rights to consideration accrues.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Group Executive Board (see note 2).
Research and development 
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software 
programming and development activities. Development costs are capitalised where the appropriate recognition criteria in 
accordance with IAS 38 are met including the asset and related costs being separately identifiable, the use of the asset being 
technically feasible and intended and the asset being expected to generate future benefits. As a result there is an intangible 
asset relating to capitalised development costs (both internally developed and acquired) recognised on the Group’s balance 
sheet where the Board expects the benefits to be recovered through incremental revenue from future sales. The carrying 
values, which are analysed by product, are considered carefully by the Board and are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Intangible assets – customer contracts
Customer contracts acquired with acquisitions are valued based on the net contribution expected to be realised over the 
estimated life of the contracts and discounted at an appropriate discount rate, taking into account any tax effects. The 
carrying values are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. 
Goodwill 
For business combinations before 1 January 2010, goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the 
consideration including all costs relating to the acquisition and the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
of the acquired entity. In accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised), the calculation of goodwill relating to any acquisitions that 
completed after 1 January 2010 will not include any acquisition related costs. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual 
impairment reviews. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 has been frozen with effect from 1 January 2004 
and is no longer amortised but subject to annual impairment reviews. 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
(CONTINUED...) 57
Business combinations
The results and net assets of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included in the Group income statement and balance 
sheet using the acquisition method of accounting from the effective date of acquisition, the date control is gained over the 
subsidiary. The results, and net assets of subsidiary undertakings disposed of, are included in the Group income statement 
and balance sheet using the acquisition method of accounting to the effective date of disposal. Income and expenditure 
relating to transactions between Group undertakings are eliminated on consolidation. 
Amortisation
The cost of other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets  
as follows:
Development costs internally generated – 33% per annum
Customer contracts – over the period of the contracts (between 3 and 7 years) 
Other intangibles – software – between 14% and 33% per annum
Other intangibles – website development costs – 33% per annum 
Other intangibles – trademarks – 10% per annum 
Depreciation
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets 
as follows:
Improvements to short leasehold property – over the period of the lease (between 3 and 12 years)
Office equipment  – between 10% and 20% per annum 
Fixtures and fittings – between 10% and 20% per annum 
Computer equipment – 33% per annum 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost including estimated contingent consideration less any provisions  
for impairment.
Current and deferred taxation 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the 
tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries 
operate and generate taxable income. Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements at the balance sheet date and where 
these transactions or events result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. Temporary 
differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements. Deferred 
taxation assets are only recognised when their recoverability is more probable than not. Deferred taxation is measured at the 
average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Recognised 
deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Leased assets 
Rentals applicable to operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to 
ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease, with a corresponding liability being recognised for 
the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are 
apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and finance charges in the income statement. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

Financial instruments 
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and 
available for sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. The directors 
determine the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of use in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are presented as current assets.
b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They are presented in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the 
balance sheet date, which are presented as non-current assets. 
c) Available-for-sale financial assets
The Company does not hold any assets available for sale (other than investments in subsidiaries which are deemed to be 
assets available for sale).
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of prepaid transaction costs) and the redemption value (including 
interest) is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the facility is committed such that the Group has an unconditional right  
to defer settlement for at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments of less than three months’ maturity (which are considered 
to have insignificant risk to a change in value) to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are excluded from cash and cash 
equivalents and are presented within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that 
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Pensions 
The Group provides contributions on behalf of certain directors and employees to a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Contributions payable in the year are charged to the income statement.
Share-based payments 
In common with many high-growth technology enterprises, the Company has issued a number of share options to executives 
and employees. Under IFRS, the equity-settled share-based payment awards are valued at fair value at inception and this 
cost is recognised over the option vesting period (typically three years). As there is no readily available market price for the 
options the Board has used an independent model to estimate the fair value of the options. There are a number of 
assumptions that affect the value and the Board has carefully considered these assumptions in order to derive an 
appropriate charge for the cost of options (note 20). The financial effects of awards by the Company of options over its 
equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual statements as an 
increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings. 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
(CONTINUED...) 59
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividend becomes a liability of the Company. In the case of an interim dividend this is on the payment date; 
for final dividends this arises on the passing of the relevant resolution at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders.
Exceptional items
Significant items which are separately disclosed on the face of the income statement by virtue of their size or incidence to 
enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences 
are taken to the income statement. The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The profit and loss for the year is translated at the average rate for the year. The 
exchange differences arising on retranslation of opening net assets are taken to other comprehensive income. The difference 
between the profit and loss at the average rate and closing rate are taken to other comprehensive income. All other 
translation differences are taken to the income statement. 
2 Segmental information
The Group’s operating segments have been determined based on the information regularly reviewed by the Group Executive 
Board, which has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’). The Group Executive Board considers the 
business to be split into two primary geographical markets: EMEAA and North America. Central costs relate to the expenses 
related to the Group’s headquarters and costs directly associated with the parent Company, which are managed by the 
Group management team. The external debt is held within Central. 
All revenue, profit/(loss) before taxation and total assets are attributable to the principal activity of the Group, being the 
development, marketing and distribution of software systems and the provision of web-based portfolio analysis and asset 
pricing services to the global asset management industry. Segment assets represent those assets arising from the operating 
activities of those segments. Segment results exclude the impact of any intercompany recharges of revenues or costs. 
Revenue was generated in the UK of £6.6 million (2014: £6.2 million) with non-current assets held by UK entities totalling  
£28.9 million (2014: £30.9 million). Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

d) Gross profit margin analysis
Gross profit margin analysis helps us assess the profitability of incremental revenue as the business evolves into a pure cloud 
business and the costs drivers begin to change. As there are a number of methodologies for allocating costs, we have 
described how we have allocated the cost elements. The cloud segment currently has a lower margin than the non-cloud part 
given the investment that is being undertaken, however, the Board’s view is that, as the business grows, the inherent scalability 
of cloud technology will lead to greater profitability in the future.

8 Non-controlling interests 
The Group exercised its option to acquire a 49% non-controlling interest in SiSoft in June 2010, and in July 2013 we completed 
the acquisition of 55% of the minority interest (i.e. approximately 27% of the shares). Vendors representing approximately  
22% of the shares (i.e. 45% of the 49% minority interest) are disputing certain aspects of the valuation and we are in a legal 
process in the French Commercial Court to resolve the matter. There is therefore a risk that the final consideration 
determined by the Court including related costs will be higher than the amount provided – see notes 16 and 26. We will provide 
a further update if the position changes materially or on the completion of the acquisition.

The directors have recommended a final dividend of 2.05p per ordinary share for 2015 (2014: 2.05p) resulting in a total 
dividend for the year of 2.9p per ordinary share (2014: 2.9p). If the 2015 final dividend is approved at the Annual General 
Meeting in May 2016 the dividend will be paid on 25 May 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on  
29 April 2016 (ex-div date 28 April 2016). In accordance with IFRS, the dividend is not provided for as a liability in the accounts 
until it becomes a legal liability of the Company and will therefore be recorded in the interim and annual accounts for 2016. 
10 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted number 
of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares into ordinary shares. The Company has 
two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: shares to be issued and share options. For the share options, a calculation 
is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average 
annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the 
outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would 
have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The movement on goodwill relates to exchange differences of £4.26 million (2014: £1.20 million). The total goodwill of  
£42.46 million includes goodwill for the North American region of £27.30 million (2014: £30.95 million) and goodwill for  
the EMEAA region of £15.16 million (2014: £15.77 million).
Goodwill impairment review
The carrying value of goodwill arising on acquisition is reviewed at each balance sheet date to assess whether there has been 
any impairment. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) by considering the Group’s share 
of the cash that is expected to be generated by the business or product that was acquired. The evaluation is based on 
management forecasts over the period five years forward and assuming a terminal value based on 3% growth thereafter. 
Discount rates are based upon a prudent risk-adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. The discount rates were 
increased in 2015 following a review of external market data.
2015 2014
Discount rate for CGUs 
EMEAA 11% 9%
North America 12% 10%
To assess for impairment, the value in use of the CGU is compared to the goodwill. If the resultant net present value of the 
discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value for goodwill the difference is written off through the income statement. 
Key assumptions in the projection of cash flows are: levels of new sales, renewal rates, growth in expenses and the discount 
rate. Management base these projections on the latest budgets and forecasts which take into account market conditions and 
economic factors. The headroom is therefore dependent upon sensitivities to these and other assumptions. The directors 
believe that there is no reasonable possible change in estimates that would lead to an impairment of goodwill in the EMEAA 
region. The largest element of goodwill is in the North American region and if EBITDA in the region were 35% below forecast 
then this could result in impairment. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

2015 2014
Sensitivity for North America
Headroom at 12% discount rate (2014: 10%) £9 million £12 million
Headroom at 10% discount rate (2014: 7.5%) £21 million £39 million
Discount rate indicating impairment 15% 13%
The fair value measure is also sensitive to exchange rates, and could have an impact on the goodwill impairment assessment. 
In particular the value of goodwill related to the FRI acquisition is linked to the Canadian dollar, whereas the underlying 
projection of cash flows is linked to exchange rates for several currencies. As a result, a strengthening Canadian dollar could 
have an adverse impact on the measured headroom. The goodwill on all acquisitions has been reviewed and, in the opinion of 
the directors, there is no impairment to the carrying value at 31 December 2015 (2014: nil).

Acquired and internally generated development costs
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software 
programming and development activities. Development costs are capitalised, where recognition criteria are met. As a result, 
there is an intangible asset relating to capitalised development costs (both internally developed and acquired) recognised on 
the Group’s balance sheet where the Board expects the benefits to be recovered through incremental revenue from future 
sales. Development expenditure is amortised over a three year period as, in the opinion of the directors, this is the period over 
which the benefits arise. The carrying values, which are analysed by product, are considered carefully by the Board and if 
there has been any impairment in any development costs then the carrying value is written down accordingly. There was no 
impairment in 2015 (2014: nil). 
Customer contracts
Customer contracts acquired were valued on acquisition by estimating the future cash flows to be derived from those 
contracts over a period varying between three and seven years depending on the type of contract and discounting cash flows 
at a discount rate of 10% (2014: 10%), adjusting for any tax impact. The resultant fair value for the acquired customer contracts 
is amortised over a period of between three and seven years as, in the opinion of the directors, this is the period over which 
the benefits arise. At each balance sheet date the current values of the original contracts are reviewed against the carrying 
values to assess for impairment. The acquired customer contracts have been reviewed and, in the opinion of the directors, 
there is no impairment to the carrying value at 31 December 2015 (2014: nil).

Of the potential deferred tax asset of £1.30 million (2014: £1.47 million), a total of £0.81 million (2014: £0.99 million) was 
recognised. This represents 62% (2014: 67%) of the Group potential deferred tax assets. A proportion of the deferred tax 
asset has been recognised as in the opinion of the directors, it is probable that this proportion of assets will be recovered 
against future taxable profits. Deferred tax has been calculated at an estimated average rate for the Group of  
20% (2014: 20%).

No deferred tax liability has been recognised with respect to unremitted earnings at the balance sheet date as any profits 
distributed to the UK should meet the requirements of the UK dividend exemption and should be exempt from UK corporation 
tax. No deferred tax liability has been recognised with respect of investments in subsidiaries since, in the event of any sale, any 
gain or loss on disposal should meet the requirements of the UK Substantial Shareholders Exemption and should be exempt 
from UK corporation tax. From 1 April 2015, the main UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20%. Further reductions 
were announced in the UK budget on 8 July 2015 which will reduce the standard rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 
2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. These changes in the UK rate were substantively enacted prior to the balance sheet date and 
therefore the impact of the changes are included within the current year tax charge. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

18 Financial instruments and financial risk management
The Company’s and Group’s key financial risks and its approach to managing these risks are described in the Financial Review 
on pages 26 and 27.
a) Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, money market deposits, bank loans, provisions, derivative financial 
instruments and various other accounts receivable and accounts payable, that arise directly from its operations.
Cash and money market deposits, when held, are carried at fair value. All financial assets except derivatives belong to the 
category ‘loans and receivables’ in IAS 39. All financial liabilities except derivatives are held at amortised cost. The only 
derivative financial instruments relate to forward currency contracts which are purchased from banks and are considered 
Level 2 financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 13.
Bank loans are recorded at the value of the proceeds received less any direct issue costs which, due to the short-term nature 
of these instruments, approximates to fair value. They are subsequently stated at cost plus accrued interest, less any 
repayments which, due to the short-term nature of these instruments, approximates to amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. 
Contingent consideration provision is considered a Level 3 financial instrument, further information on contingent 
consideration can be found in note 16.
Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to hedge against various financial risks, such as foreign currency and 
interest rate risk. They are initially recognised at fair value and are designated by the entity at fair value through profit or loss. 
As at 31 December 2015, the Group held forward currency hedging contracts to mitigate the effects of currency exposure 
relating to non-sterling financial assets and liabilities, cash flows and investments. The fair value of forward currency contracts 
relating to commercial transactions is recognised through the income statement, the net unrealised loss in respect of these 
contracts as at 31 December 2015 was £26,000 (2014: £14,000). The fair value of forward currency contracts relating to 
hedging of net investments designated in hedge accounting relationships is recognised through equity, and the net unrealised 
loss relating to these contracts recognised through equity as at 31 December 2015 was £9,000 (2014: unrealised  
gain £26,000).
The Company recognises financial instruments in its accounts when it enters into a binding agreement to receive cash or other 
economic benefits and derecognises them once all parties to the agreement have discharged all of their obligations. 
Interest income and expenses are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis. Realised gains and losses upon 
expiry of derivative financial instruments are recognised on settlement of the underlying contract.

Financial liabilities
Committed facilities
The Group signed in July 2015 a new financing facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance available for acquisitions, share buy 
backs and general corporate purposes. The facility is committed to July 2020, subject to compliance with agreed covenants. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group had both net cash of £1.27 million and committed credit facilities of £10.0 million available. As 
part of the acquisition of Investor Analytics in January 2016, the financing facilities were increased and the key features of the 
facilities are:
• Five year commitment period to July 2020.
• £10 million committed revolving credit facility.
• US$7 million committed term loan.
• US$3 million committed deferred drawdown loan.

Net investment in foreign operations
As part of our liability management, in order to provide a partial currency hedge against movements in the fair value of 
investments in overseas subsidiaries, we have made use of currency swaps to create synthetic currency hedges denominated 
in a mixture of currencies (USD, CAD, and EUR).  At 31 December 2015, the Group had currency swaps in place, with a notional 
principal amount of £4.90 million (2014: £5.11 million) as synthetic loan hedges. The Group recognised a net gain on the hedging 
instrument of £0.20 million (2014: £0.08 million) in equity.

Trade creditors, other creditors and accruals and other taxes of £4.65 million (2014: £6.09 million) have been excluded from 
the above tables and are non-interest bearing. 
Floating rate financial liabilities predominantly relate to bank loans in sterling, Canadian dollars, US dollars and euros. Some 
debt is denominated in currencies in order to provide a currency hedge for profits generated by overseas subsidiaries and the 
investments in those overseas net assets. 
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had no material borrowings and therefore it has not assumed any risk sensitivity to 
reasonably possible changes in interest rates (with all other variables held constant) on the Group’s profit before tax through 
the impact of floating rate borrowings.  The Group did not assume any risk sensitivity in 2014 as it had no material borrowings. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

Currency risk
The Group’s principal exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas net assets and trading 
results into sterling for accounting purposes. The Group has a minimal transaction risk as most of the transactions are 
invoiced by the entities in their local currency. Where there are material exposures, these are covered by taking out currency 
contracts to eliminate the exposure. However, offsetting revenues against costs in the same currency reduces this risk so that 
only the residual accounting profit translation element is at risk. The balance sheet exposures are minimised by reducing the 
net asset exposure, for example, by arranging borrowings in local currency where appropriate. Where the resulting hedge 
qualifies for hedge accounting under IAS 39 the gains and losses on the translation of both the loan and the investment are 
deferred in equity. As the Group continues to grow and generates greater net profits overseas this exchange rate exposure 
will increase. Following the increase in the percentage of the Group’s operations that are overseas, the exposure to US dollars 
and euros in particular has increased. 
The table below shows the estimated sensitivity of the profit before tax and the net assets to movements in the key exchange 
rates to which the Group is exposed. If the US dollar and the euro strengthen/(weaken) against sterling this is expected to 
increase/(decrease) profits as shown below.

The main balance sheet translation exposure is to the revaluation of goodwill denominated in foreign currency; the largest 
component relates to the goodwill arising on the acquisition of FRI, a Canadian business and is denominated in Canadian 
dollars. A depreciation of 10% in sterling against the Canadian dollar would result in a £2.9 million increase in net assets and  
an appreciation of 10% in sterling against the Canadian dollar would result in a £2.3 million decrease in net assets.
The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is approximately equal to book value. The Group has a forward foreign 
exchange facility which allows the Group to hedge foreign exchange exposures. The Group does not permit anyone in the 
Group to trade in financial instruments.
Counterparty credit risk
This is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Credit risks are associated with deposits 
with banks and receivables from customers. The Group takes into account the credit risk of the counterparty to any major 
bank deposits but currently the level of bank deposits is such that this is not considered a material risk. There is no large 
concentration of credit risk with customers as the largest customer group currently represents less than 6% of projected 
Group revenues. The maximum exposure to credit risk comprises the value of the Group’s cash and debtor balances from 
time to time.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
(CONTINUED...) 81
Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its cash obligations when due. The Group manages this risk 
by close monitoring of projected cash collection from customers and cash obligations to suppliers and salary payments to 
staff, as well as all other cash commitments. At 31 December 2015, the Group also had £10 million headroom under its 
committed revolving credit and overdraft facility in addition to cash reserves to reduce the risk that an unforeseen change in 
the Group’s liquidity position will result in a breach of statutory or other payment obligations.

Capital risk
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain further development of the business. The Board monitors the composition of investors as well as the return on capital, 
measured as earnings per share (profit attributable to shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year). The capital managed by the Group comprises equity of £41.52 million (2014: £45.69 million) 
and borrowings of £0.92 million (2014: £12,000) as capital.

Share-based payments
Under the approved and unapproved option schemes the Remuneration Committee can grant options to employees of the 
Group. Options have been granted with a fixed exercise price which is typically issued at a premium to the market price. The 
contractual life is generally ten years from date of grant although occasionally a shorter period has been chosen. Options 
become exercisable after three years although exceptionally the period is shorter. Options issued to directors and senior 
executives carry performance criteria. There are other vesting conditions for options identified in the scheme rules, including 
performance conditions which are in the option terms with typically eps growth above a minimum hurdle, share price growth 
above a minimum level and a vesting period of three years. Options are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model 
and the fair market value after consideration of market based performance conditions has been estimated using the following 
key assumptions: 
There were no share options issued in 2014. Details of options/share awards issued in 2015 were:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
(CONTINUED...) 85
The risk free rate is based on the yield to maturity of a UK government bond for a term consistent with the assumed life of the 
options. The average share price in the year was 77.5p. The expected volatility level was determined by comparing the historic 
and current volatility for the Company and comparing with the average volatility for companies in the same sector to 
determine a reasonable estimate for the future volatility. The total charge in the income statement for the year relating to 
employee share-based payments for the Group was £121,000 (2014: £26,000) and for the Company was £12,000  
(2014: £3,000).
There were 1,230,000 options exercisable at the balance sheet date (2014: 1,003,500), with a weighted average exercise price 
of 124p (2014: 90p). The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding at the balance sheet date is 4.2 
years (2013: 4.9 years).
On 10 March 2015, the Company issued 106,000 shares following the exercise of options under the Approved and  
Unapproved schemes.

25 Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for directors and certain employees. The total costs of 
pension contributions during the year were £418,000 (2014: £447,000). Contributions outstanding at the end of December 
2015 were £42,000 (2014: £60,000). 
26 Contingent liabilities
As is normal for a group of this size and scope of operations, Group companies are involved in a number of potential legal 
claims and disputes from time to time arising from our activities, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s financial results.
The Board expects the remaining contingent consideration payable to the 45% minority shareholder (22% of total shares) in 
Sisoft to be in the range of €0.7 million – €1.1 million (approximately £0.6 million – £0.9 million). It is possible that it will not be 
fully resolved during 2016. There is also a risk that the final consideration determined by the Court including related costs will 
be higher than the amount provided, although the Board’s estimate of the measurement of the liability has not changed 
(allowing for fluctuations in exchange rates).  Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

28 Post Balance Sheet Events
Acquisition of Investor Analytics
On 21 January 2016, StatPro Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) acquired the entire share capital of Investor 
Analytics LLC (‘IA’), the US-headquartered, cloud-based risk analytics’ company to hedge funds and asset managers for a 
cash consideration of US$10 million. There is an additional contingent payment of up to US$6 million, payable after one year, 
which is dependent on securing a number of new contract wins.
Highlights of the acquisition are:
• Complementary Risk Factor and Monte Carlo models to add to StatPro’s Historical Simulation risk model
• Significantly increases StatPro’s US presence, enhancing geographical reach
• Annualised Recurring Revenue (‘ARR’) of US$4.85 million (£3.3 million)
• Increases StatPro’s cloud-based ARR to 34% of total Group ARR from 27%
• Expected to be earnings enhancing in 2016 on a pro forma basis following completion of the integration programme
• 53 client contracts – all new client relationships for StatPro 
• Cash consideration:
• US$7 million on closing
• Two deferred payments – US$2 million after one year and US$1 million after two years 
• Additional contingent payment – up to US$6 million after one year, dependent on securing a number of new contract wins
Based on unaudited results for the year ended 31 December 2015, IA is expected to report revenue of US$5.0 million (of which 
approximately 94% was recurring) and an EBITDA loss of approximately US$0.3 million. Cost synergies are expected to be 
approximately US$1.0 million per annum (£0.7 million) for data feeds, administrative services and other costs. 
Acquisition of majority control of InfoVest
With effect from 1 March 2016, StatPro South Africa (Pty) Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) acquired a 51% 
shareholding in InfoVest Consulting (Pty) Ltd (‘InfoVest’), a South African headquartered software provider, specialising in data 
warehouse, ETL and reporting software for the asset management industry. The purchase has been made via the transfer of 
StatPro Portfolio Control (‘SPC’) licence agreements to InfoVest, which StatPro provides to South African clients and which 
InfoVest currently supports on behalf of StatPro.
Highlights of the acquisition are:
• Acquisition of 51% of InfoVest 
• Purchase settled by the transfer of SPC licence contracts to InfoVest
• Joint marketing agreement signed to promote each other’s products and services
• Justin Wheatley, StatPro CEO and Craig Arenhold, CEO StatPro South Africa will join InfoVest Board, although the business 
will be managed independently
• Deal is expected to be earnings enhancing in 2016 
Given increased regulations there is a growing demand for compliance management solutions such as SPC, which is a module 
of one of StatPro’s products, StatPro Seven. By taking a majority stake in InfoVest, StatPro will benefit from this expanding 
market as well as improving the product and services it offers.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
(CONTINUED...) 89
InfoVest’s data warehouse software is a cost effective solution for asset managers and service providers to manage their 
internal data effectively in order to provide both input data to other systems and for reporting. The success of implementing  
a solution such as StatPro Revolution Performance depends on a client’s ability to provide data in a reliable manner. InfoVest’s 
software is designed to do precisely this.
In addition, StatPro and InfoVest have entered into a joint marketing agreement to promote each other’s products and 
services as part of StatPro. InfoVest products will keep their current branding, whilst benefiting from the marketing reach  
of StatPro.
Based on unaudited results for the year ended 28 February 2015, InfoVest reported revenue of ZAR 18.0 million 
(approximately £0.76 million), including approximately £0.13 million revenue for supporting SPC. 
Additional disclosures under IFRS 3 in relation to the fair value of the consideration, acquisition date assets and acquisition 
date liabilities have not been included in these accounts for either of the two investments as management are in the process 
of assessing these accounting values. Strategic Report  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements

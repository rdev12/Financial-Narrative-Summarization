22% I am pleased to have been asked to join the 
board of Gooch & Housego PLC, a long
established and successful Group with exciting
prospects for the future.  I believe that I can make
a positive contribution and look forward to helping
the Group to achieve its considerable potential.
Although I joined the board after the end of the 2006 financial year I
am pleased to note the encouraging results that follow on from
similar growth in revenues and profits in the previous two years.
The excellent performances by NEOS and CCI are particularly
noteworthy.  Most of the growth has come from core activities and
reflects the strengths the Group has in these areas.  Sustaining this
level of growth in the longer term will require the Group to diversify
its products and markets.  A first step has been made with the
acquisition of CDI and further investment is planned in 2007 to
evaluate the potential of its technology. 
The Group is making a substantial investment in people, facilities and infrastructure in the coming
year to underpin future growth.  I would like to thank all of our employees for their contribution to
an excellent set of results. We clearly have an excellent workforce and top quality products and I
look forward to the continuing success of the Group.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 2006
Dr Julian Blogh – Chairman 03
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Overview
After a slow start, the past year has been characterised by
improving market conditions culminating in strong demand in the
last quarter.  This upturn in demand was felt across most parts of
the business and resulted in increases in revenue and profit before
tax for the Group of 14% and 23% respectively, and very strong
individual performances by NEOS Technologies Inc (NEOS) and
Cleveland Crystals Inc (CCI).
Events of significance during the year include the appointment of
Dr Julian Blogh as Non Executive Chairman, the acquisition of ChromoDynamics Inc (CDI), and the
conferring of a second Queen’s Award on Gooch & Housego’s UK operations.
I am very pleased to be able to welcome Dr Blogh to Gooch & Housego and I am sure that his
extensive experience will prove to be invaluable.
The Queen’s Award is the most significant and widely recognised award that a UK business can
receive.  To be able to add the Queen’s Award for Enterprise: International Trade in recognition of
our recent export performance to our 1994 Queen’s Award for Technological Achievement is an
achievement of which the entire workforce can be very proud.
The development of our new factory and headquarters in Ilminster has suffered delays during the
year due to the scale and complexity of the project, but it is now progressing well, with the first
phase nearing completion and scheduled for occupation in January 2007.  We now expect to have
completed the development and to have relocated all Ilminster operations by the end of 2007.
Earlier in the year we embarked on a major reorganisation of our optoelectronic components
activities.  Going by the project name of ORION, and comprising Gooch & Housego UK Ltd
(G&HUK), CCI, NEOS and Landwehr Electronic GmbH (LE), the reorganisation is aimed at creating
a more efficient and effective integrated global business with greater market presence and extended
reach.  Significant progress has already been made in key areas such as establishing the essential
IT and communications infrastructure, and the project is on target to be completed mid-2007.
Under the new structure, as the boundaries between the individual businesses dissolve, we will
report on the integrated business in terms of its products and markets, rather than by
manufacturing locations as we have in the past.  The increase in inter-company trading is already
distorting individual results and emphasises the need to focus on ORION’s overall performance.
From 1 October 2006 we have also reorganised the corporate structure of the Group, detaching
the UK trading company from Gooch & Housego PLC and establishing a new company, Gooch &
Housego UK Ltd, to carry out UK trading activities.
Gareth Jones – Chief Executive Financial Results
For the year ended 30 September 2006, Group turnover increased by 14% to £25.36m (2005:
£22.32m).  Profit before tax, after charging goodwill amortisation of £0.38m (2005: £0.34m),
increased by 23% to £5.77m (2005: £4.68m).  Profit before tax and goodwill amortisation improved
from £5.02m to £6.15m during the year.  Basic earnings per share increased by 25% to 20.1p
(2005: 16.1p) while basic earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation, rose to 22.2p from last
year’s 18.0p.
The Group’s improved sales results were led by NEOS with sales of £6.38m, an increase over
2005 of £1.20m.  CCI were close to equalling this performance with sales in the year of £5.61m
(2005: £4.46m).  G&H maintained last year’s exceptional performance with sales of £7.52m (2005:
£7.61m) and LE recorded sales of £2.54m (2005: £1.99m). 
Outside of the ORION companies Optronic Laboratories Inc (OLI) increased sales to £3.32m
(2005: £3.08m). 
Operating profits for the Group improved by 21% to £5.74m (2005: £4.76m). ORION companies
contributed a total of £6.08m to total operating profits. NEOS reported profits of £2.31m (2005:
£1.62m), G&H trading profits of £2.40m (2005: £2.41m) and CCI at £1.36m (2005: £ 0.78m). 
OLI returned a 14% increase in operating profits to £0.43m (2005: £0.38m) while LE returned
operating profits of £19,000 (2005: £85,000).  Costs incurred from the new developments at CDI
since its acquisition in February, totalled £0.16m.  Head office costs totalled £0.61m (2005: £0.51m)
The Group’s financial position remains strong with net funds inflow of £0.53m (2005: £2.04m).
This is after financing the acquisition of CDI at a cost of £0.69m.  At 30 September 2006 the
Group had total net funds of £2.90m (2005: £2.37m).
An overall tax rate of 37% for the year (2005: 38%) is as a result of higher rates of US tax and the
effect of the non-allowable charge for goodwill amortisation.
Dividends 
Reflecting the Group’s improved performance, the Directors are proposing a final dividend of 2.8p
making a total for the year of 4.2p.  This represents an increase of 8% over last year’s total of 3.9p
and is covered 4.8 times by post-tax earnings.  The shares went ex-dividend on 6 December
2006, and following approval at the Annual General Meeting on 14 February 2007, the dividend
will be paid to Shareholders on 15 February 2007.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 05
OPERATIONS – UK
Gooch & Housego UK Ltd (G&HUK)
G&HUK performed strongly in the year, despite the figures indicating flat sales and profits
compared with the previous year.  A significant increase in inter-company sales, which are taken at
reduced margin, has had a negative impact on profits.  With sales progressively being managed by
local offices, an increasing proportion of goods manufactured in the UK is now being sold via other
group companies, rather than directly as before.
The market for Q-switches, still our most significant single product, was soft during the first quarter
of the year, but picked up in the second quarter and was strong throughout the second half.  With
the rise in demand threatening to push lead times to unacceptable levels, measures were put in
place to increase capacity by two thirds
by the end of the year.  The Super Q-
switch has been one of our success
stories this year, demonstrating that there
are major advances to be made in what
might be thought of as mature
technology.  G&HUK continues to be the
world leader with this product.
In precision optics we have continued to
focus on those aspects of the business in
which we excel.  In the areas of crystal
optics and thin-film coatings we have
demonstrated world-class capabilities and
as a result have been able to win increased
export business and improve our margins.
By extending our reach as part of the new
integrated components business and by
leveraging the market presence we already
have in acousto-optics and electro-optics
we expect to continue to increase optical
component sales. The Acousto-optic Q-Switch Optronic Laboratories, Inc. (OLI)
OLI has a highly specialised product range that addresses 
a niche market.  Several key developments that will open up
opportunities for OLI in new market sectors are currently
underway, with the first of these scheduled for launch in 2007.
The expertise of OLI in instrument design and engineering is
being used to enable CDI to bring its hyperspectral imaging
instrument to market more rapidly than would otherwise be
possible. OLI and CDI have also benefited from sharing market
information and is a good example of how we are able to exploit
synergies between members of the Group.
Cleveland Crystals, Inc. (CCI)
CCI has returned an exceptional performance with revenues up
by a quarter and profits almost doubling when compared with
the previous year.  Growth has been experienced in both of the
main sectors of the business, and CCI has been successful in
responding to demand and increasing output at modest
additional cost.  This is reflected in the strong bottom-line
performance.
CCI has continued to incrementally improve its Pockels cell product range and as a result has
reinforced its leading position in this market.  To meet the increase in demand for crystals for
inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications, production facilities in Cleveland are currently being
expanded.  The extended manufacturing facility will benefit from substantial external investment in
additional equipment in the coming months.
NEOS Technologies, Inc. (NEOS)
NEOS has once again been a star performer, with revenues up
nearly a quarter and profits by almost half when compared with
2005.  The team at NEOS in their new facility constitutes a highly
efficient manufacturing unit.  New product and process
developments in the past year have improved quality and
increased capacity, enabling NEOS to respond to the mid-year
upturn in demand and increase output significantly. 
OPERATIONS – OVERSEAS
06
Hyperspectral Imaging equipment
Neos product assembly
Cleveland Crystals Landwehr Electronic GmbH (LE)
Sales at LE increased by nearly a third compared with the previous year and demonstrate their
success in channelling group products into the German market.  The product mix continues to be
dominated by acousto-optic devices and RF electronics, but sales of crystal optics and precision
optics have shown encouraging growth this year and illustrate the potential of this large market.
Margins were adversely affected by the increase in inter-company sales and the recruitment of
additional senior technical staff.  There is now a strong team in place at LE and the benefits of this
investment are already being felt. 
LE’s core RF electronics business continues to be a key element of the Group’s wider acousto-
optics capabilities, and several important new developments in the past year are aimed at
increasing RF driver sales, and as a consequence, overall margins.
ChromoDynamics, Inc. (CDI)
The development of CDI’s hyperspectral imaging engine is
progressing well. A new software team at CDI, engineering
support from OLI and optical and electronic design and
manufacturing support from across the group have combined to
keep hardware and software development on schedule for a
product launch in the second quarter of 2007.  Initial
applications will be in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.
In parallel, CDI is investigating applications in diagnostics.
07
Biomedical Imaging Sector Analysis
In the light of our reorganisation of the Group into what are in effect two divisions –
Optoelectronic Components and Materials and Instrumentation I would like to comment briefly on
the Group’s activities over the past year in our principal product sectors.
Acousto-optics is our largest product sector, served by NEOS, G&HUK and LE.  Demand was
initially slow at the start of the year but strengthened progressively as reported above.  The
greater coordination that now exists between NEOS, G&HUK and LE as we take a more global
approach to the acousto-optics business has enabled us to be more responsive, to provide
optimum solutions to our customers and to maintain the
Group’s leading position in this market.
Precision optics and crystal optics (G&HUK), the original
business on which Gooch & Housego was founded
nearly sixty years ago, will become an increasingly
important part of the Group’s product offering as
applications such as industrial, medical and research
laser systems and semiconductor lithography demand
more sophisticated optical solutions that play to our
strengths.  Historically focussed on the UK market, we
have been successful in winning optics business in the
USA and Europe in the past year.
Electro-optic Q-switches, or Pockels cells, (CCI) is another product sector in which we have a
leading market position that has been reinforced over the last year. 
Optical instrumentation (OLI and CDI) has been a more difficult market for us with OLI serving a
relatively small and highly specialised market, and with CDI yet to begin trading.  New
developments at OLI and some exciting prospects for CDI point to this sector growing in
importance in the coming years.
08
OPERATIONS – OVERSEAS
Laser machining Prospects
With market conditions improving during 2006 and demand continuing to be strong at the start
of our new financial year, prospects for continued revenue growth are favourable.  We will
continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing and infrastructure for
sustained long-term growth.  These initiatives will begin to make a positive contribution in 2007,
but the full benefits are unlikely to be felt until 2008.  In the short term, Project ORION, CDI and
the new UK factory will contribute to increased costs in 2007. 
A key element of project ORION is the creation of a new global sales team for the optoelectronics
business.  In place of four separate teams, each supporting a narrow range of products on a
worldwide basis, we will have a single team capable of supporting all of our products in each of
our principal markets.  We have already demonstrated that sales can be increased by taking our
current products to a wider audience but the benefits have been limited to date by lack of sales
resource and coordination.  In parallel with our investment in sales, the creation of a strategic
marketing capability will enable us to form a clearer picture of our markets and their dynamics
and help us develop a better understanding of our customers’ current and future requirements. 
We have been active in research and development in the past year, with four patent applications filed
and several more in the pipeline.  Some of our development activities will reach the market in the
coming year, including a new product family at OLI and the first CDI hyperspectral imaging system.
We are not expecting these products to make a significant contribution to revenues until 2008.
Continuing to develop the core components and materials activities is central to our strategy,
while we also recognise the potential of the instrumentation business to deliver significant growth
in new markets.  In addition to the organic growth that will follow from the development of new
products and capabilities, we will look for acquisitions that will enable us to deliver our strategy
more quickly. 
In summary, the Gooch & Housego group is well placed for continued growth by virtue of its
unique combination of products and capabilities and its skilled and dedicated workforce.

10 DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2006. 
Principal Activity
Gooch & Housego is a manufacturer of acousto-optic and electro-optic devices, precision optical
components, crystals, optical instruments and imaging systems.
Business Review
A review of the development and performance of the Group during the year, including details of key financial
performance indicators and a review of the financial position of the Group at the year-end, is provided in the
financial highlights summary on page 1 and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 3 to 9.  A description of the
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is provided below.
Dominance of existing markets - The Group currently holds a significant share of the market for a number
of key products.  In response to the risks presented by this position the Group undertakes an extensive level
of research and development aimed at developing new products in different markets and new applications
for existing products.  In addition, it continues to review potential acquisition opportunities which are
consistent with the established strategy of the Group.
Foreign exchange - The Group’s principal currency exposure is in respect of the trading results generated
in US dollars by its US subsidiaries.  The Group originally hedged its investments in its US subsidiaries by
part financing them with US dollar loans, although these loans have now been repaid.  As a result, the
Board is considering changes to the structure of the US subsidiary Group to further reduce the Group’s
currency exposure.
Retention of key personnel - The Group recognises the importance of retaining and developing its highly-
skilled management team and workforce in order to achieve its strategic objectives.  As a result, the Group
has an established development and reward scheme in place to encourage individuals to play a long-term
role in the future development of the Group.
Quality - The Group prides itself on the highest standards of product quality and customers satisfaction.  In
doing this, it recognises that a failure to maintain such standards would be detrimental to its future trading
performance.  As a result, an ongoing emphasis is placed on quality control and customer communication.
Dividends
During the year under review a final dividend of £504,000 (2005: £468,000) was proposed and an interim
dividend of £252,000 (2005: £234,000) was paid.  This final dividend has not been accounted for within
the current year financial statements as it has yet to be approved.  The Directors propose that the retained
profit for the year of £2,906,000 (2005: £2,233,000) be transferred to reserves.
11 DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Directors
The Directors in office during the year and their beneficial interests in the issued shares of the Company
were as follows:-
Ordinary shares of 20p each
30 September 30 September
2006 2005
G C W Jones 8,000 8,000

In addition, Dr J Blogh was appointed as Non Executive Chairman on 2 October 2006 and T Scribbins was
appointed as Operations Director on 29 November 2006.  Neither Dr J Blogh or T Scribbins held shares of
the Company at 30 September 2006.
There were no changes in Directors’ interests between 1 October 2006 and 10 January 2007.
For details of Directors interest in options to subscribe for shares of the Company, see page 17.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Dr J Blogh and T Scribbins, who were both
appointed since the date of the last Annual General Meeting and G C W Jones who are subject to
retirement by rotation, retire at the Annual General Meeting, and being eligible offer themselves for 
re-election.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 10 January 2007, the undermentioned had notified the Company that they were interested in 3% or
more of its issued ordinary share capital:
Number % holding
Gooch/Virgin Family Trusts 5,551,279 30.8%
Insight Investment Management 1,804,690 10.0%
F&C Asset Management 1,544,000 8.6%
Active Capital Trust 1,210,733 6.7%
Merrill Lynch Investment Management 756,515 4.2%
Montanaro UK Smaller Companies Investment Trust PLC 550,327 3.1%
Save for these interests, the directors have not been notified that any person is directly or indirectly
interested in 3% or more of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
Research and Development
Group policy is to actively develop new technologies and capabilities that will become the mainstay of
future group products.
12 Supplier Payment Policy And Practice
It is the Company’s policy to comply with the payment terms agreed with suppliers providing it is satisfied
that the supplier has provided the goods and services in accordance with agreed terms and conditions.
Trade creditors outstanding at 30 September 2006 represent 38 days as a proportion of the total amount
invoiced by suppliers during the year (2005: 32).
Financial Risk Management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign
currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Group operates a central treasury function, headed by the Group Finance Director, responsible for all
debt and liquidity management, foreign exchange and interest rate management. The Group does not
undertake speculative financial transactions or utilise off balance sheet financing vehicles.
Credit risk - The Group regularly monitors the credit status of its customers and applies appropriate credit
limits to each of them to ensure that exposure to any particular customer is not excessive. 
Liquidity risk - The Group activity maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance that is
designed to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned strategic expansions.
Foreign currency risk - The Group’s principal currency exposure is in respect of the trading results
generated in US dollars by its US subsidiaries.  The Group originally hedged its investments in its US
subsidiaries by part financing them with US dollar loans, although these loans have now been repaid.  As a
result, the Board is considering changes to the structure of the US subsidiary Group to further reduce the
Group’s currency exposure.
Interest rate risk - The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest
bearing assets comprise cash deposits, all of which earn interest at variable rates. The Group has a policy
of using a mixture of fixed and variable rate debt instruments which allows it to ensure it is able to consider
the most commercially suitable financing options whilst exercising control over future interest payments.
Donations
The Group made donations of £4,080 (2005: £5,077) to various local charities during the year. No political
donations have been made during the current or previous year.
Employees
The Group is committed to including all employees in the performance and development of the business.
An established employee appraisal and reward scheme is in operation and employees are appraised
regularly with relevant development support provided by the Group.
The Group attaches considerable importance to informing and involving its employees on matters which
concern them and in the achievement of its business objectives.  The Group has a formal employee
communication plan involving regular meetings between management and employees and the provision of
a comprehensive employee handbook.
Employment of Disabled Individuals
It is the policy of the Group that disabled individuals, whether registered or not, should receive full and fair
consideration for all job vacancies for which they are suitable applicants. Employees who become disabled
during their working life will be retained in employment wherever possible and will be provided help with any
necessary rehabilitation and retraining. The Group is prepared to modify procedures or equipment,
wherever this is practicable, so that full use can be made of an individual’s abilities.
13 DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Corporate Governance
The Board recognises the importance of good corporate governance and has, after taking into account the
size and stage of development of the Group, put in place procedures it considers appropriate. The Group
now has a Non Executive chairman and two Non Executive Directors who advise the Board on business
and corporate governance issues.
The Audit Committee, which consists of the two Non Executive Directors, is responsible for ensuring that
the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored, controlled and reported on.  The Committee
has met with the auditors on two occasions during the year to review issues relating to the financial
statements and internal financial control systems.
The Remuneration Committee, which consists of the two Non Executive Directors, has met during the year,
and a summary of the committee’s report is on page 16 and 17.  Following the appointment of the
Chairman he will also become a member of the Remuneration Committee.
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s system of internal financial control.
The system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatements and
losses.  Among the procedures designed to maintain an appropriate control environment are the following:
• Annual budgets are prepared for each company.  Monthly reports enable the board to compare 
performance against budget and to take action where appropriate.
• Procedures are in place to identify any major business risks and evaluate their potential 
financial effects.
• Internal financial controls are in existence which provide reasonable assurance of the maintenance 
of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information used within the business.
The Board is also aware that it is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal control, not just those
relating to financial controls.  The Board regularly assesses the controls in place, taking into account the
size and stage of development of the Group.
14 Directors’ Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for
that period.  In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting polices and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Company and the Group will continue to operate; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial
statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.  They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware. Each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken in his duty as a director to
make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are
aware of that information.
International Financial Reporting Standards
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will apply to the consolidated financial statements of the
Group for the year to 30 September 2008. The Directors are in the process of devising an appropriate IFRS
conversion strategy and as part of this process have undertaken a preliminary review of the key areas that
are likely to be impacted by the new standards. The key areas of impact are expected to include the
approach adopted to accounting for business combinations, research and development expenditure and
share-based payments.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial
statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the company will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting.
Approved and signed on behalf of the Board of Directors by:
G C W Jones
Director

REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee members at 30 September were G C W Jones, E G Arthurs and J A Melles.
Following his appointment as Chairman, Dr J Blogh will also become a member of the committee.
Policy on Directors’ Remuneration
It is an objective of the Group to attract and retain executives of high calibre and reward them in a way
which encourages the creation of value for shareholders.  The committee undertakes the determination of
executive Directors’ annual remuneration packages and these are reviewed with effect from 1 October each
year.  No executive Director plays a part in the discussion about his own remuneration.
Executive Directors are paid a basic salary together with annual bonus payments based on the
achievement of  Group earnings per share related targets.  In addition, certain executive Directors receive
benefits in kind, including medical expenses, insurance and also participate in a share option scheme.
Non Executive Directors are paid a salary to attend board meetings and to serve as members of the Audit
and Remuneration committees.  Further payments may be made in respect of further services provided at the
request of the Company, although no such payments have been made during the current or previous year.

31,250 272.5p 8 December 2009 to 22 April 2014 
The options may be exercised on the achievement of certain financial performance criteria. 50% of each
allocation of options may be exercised from the earliest exercise date if the earnings per share figure for the
Group, based on the most recent audited annual financial statements, has improved by a rate equivalent to
the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3%. The remaining 50% of each allocation of options may be
exercised from the earliest exercise date if the earnings per share figure for the Group, based on the most
recent audited financial statements, has improved by a rate equivelant to the growth in the UK Retail Prices
Index plus 6%.
Based on the prior year Group financial statements, both conditions were satisfied and as a result 
G C W Jones and I W Bayer now hold the right to exercise the first and second tranche of options. None of
the Directors have exercised options during the current or previous year.
Options over a total of 421,850 new ordinary shares have also been granted to the Presidents of each of
OLI, CCI and NEOS all of which are also subject to specific performance criteria, namely that the audited
pre-tax profits for the relevant year will be not less than 95% of the agreed budget and that audited pre-tax
profits for the relevant year will be at least $500,000. These options are also exercisable at 133.5 pence
per share.
In addition, on the 8th December 2005 options over a further 125,000 new ordinary shares have been
granted to a senior employee of the Group in addition to the 125,000 granted to T Scribbins at the same
date that are shown above.  These options are exercisable at 272.5 pence per share. 18

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we

whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we

financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.

Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the
revaluation of certain fixed assets, and have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting
standards and the UK Companies Act 1985.
The Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 21, ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ (FRS 21) in
preparing these financial statements.  The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting
policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly. FRS 21 requires that the Group only
recognise a liability for a dividend at a balance sheet date if it has either been paid during the period or
proposed and approved by Shareholders at the balance sheet date.
The effect of this change in accounting policy was to recognise the final proposed dividend of £467,978 for
the year ended 30 September 2005 in the current financial year.  The proposed final dividend for the
current year of £503,977 will be recognised in the financial year to 30 September 2007 as it has yet to be
approved.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements deal with the results and the state of affairs of the Group. Intra-Group
sales and profits are fully eliminated upon consolidation. The results of acquired subsidiaries are included
from the date of acquisition. 
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented as the
Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover
Turnover is the total income receivable by the Group in the ordinary course of business for goods supplied
as a principal and for services provided, exclusive of applicable sales taxes. Turnover is recognised upon
transfer of substantial risks and rewards to the customer.
Turnover on long term contracts reflects costs incurred to date plus an estimate of profits attributable to the
work performed to date. For this purpose the estimate of attributable profits will include a proportion of the
total  profits anticipated to be made on the contract. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of
the acquired entity’s assets and liabilities. Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and
amortised on a straight line basis over the Directors’ estimated useful economic life of the goodwill.  This is
individually assessed for each acquisition, but does not exceed twenty years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the implementation of FRS 10 has been written off against the profit
and loss reserve. On disposal of such businesses, goodwill previously written off against reserves is
charged in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Fixed assets
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost or valuation of the fixed assets, over their expected useful
lives, at the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings 2-3% Straight line
Short leasehold improvements Over term of lease Straight line
Plant & machinery 10-20% Straight line
Fixtures, fittings & computers 10-33% Straight line
Motor vehicles 25% Reducing balance
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work-in-progress.
Share Options
The exercise price of options granted over shares of the Company is set at the market price at the date of
grant and hence no charge to the profit and loss account is recognised.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
01 Accounting Policies 
For the year ended 30 September 2006 Stocks and Work In Progress 
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net resalable value. Cost includes all costs
incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, including a reasonable proportion of
manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Long term contract balances included in work in progress comprise costs incurred on long-term contracts,
net of amounts transferred to trading expenditure, after deducting foreseeable losses and related payments
on account. Costs include all direct material and labour costs incurred in bringing a contract to its state of
completion at the year-end, including an appropriate proportion of indirect expenses. Provisions for
estimated losses on contracts are made in the period in which such losses are foreseen. Long-term
contract balances do not include attributable profit.  The amount by which customer billings exceed the
turnover recognised on a contract is shown as a payment on account.
Deferred Taxation 
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised
where their recovery is considered more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been
discounted.
Pension Schemes
The Company operates three money purchase schemes for directors and staff.  The assets of the
schemes are held separately from those of the Group in separately administered funds.  The pension
charge represents contributions payable to the funds during the year.  All US subsidiaries operate a 401(k)
profit sharing plan covering substantially all employees.  Expenses under the plan are charged to the profit
and loss account as incurred.
Research and Development
Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Foreign Currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates
ruling at the balance sheet date.  Exchange differences which arise on the settlement of other transactions
and on the translation of other monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The results of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange
prevailing during the year.  The balance sheet of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the
rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses arising from foreign currency loans taken
out to finance overseas investments are offset against the gains and losses arising on the retranslation of
the subsidiaries opening net assets. The net exchange difference is taken to reserves.
Leased Assets
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets.
Assets acquired by finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
Assets acquired by hire purchase are depreciated over their useful lives.  Finance leases are those where
substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are assumed by the Group.  Obligations under such
agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods.  The finance
element of the rental payment is charged to the profit and loss account so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Financial Instruments
Finance costs associated with debt instruments are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of
the instruments.  Issue costs are accounted for as a deduction against the gross debt received and are
amortised over the period of the instrument.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value. Investments in
overseas subsidiaries are retranslated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.

The analysis of turnover by destination is as follows:
During the current year the Group has embarked upon a major reorganisation of its optoelectronic components activities under the
project name Orion. The new Orion sub-group comprises G&H UK, NEOS, CCI and LE and is aimed at creating a more efficient
and effective integrated global business with greater market presence and extended reach. As a result of this development, the
segmental disclosures below have been realigned to be more consistent with the revised structure of the Group.
As at 1 October 2006 the corporate structure of the Group has also been reorganised, detaching the UK trading company from
Gooch & Housego PLC and establishing a new company, Gooch & Housego UK Ltd, to carry out UK trading activities.
As detailed in note 25. The Group also acquired a 100% interest in ChromoDynamics Inc., a developer of hyperspectral imaging
systems based in the United States, on 6 February 2006.
United Kingdom sales include indirect exports sold through UK based European agents amounting to £176,000 (2005: £279,000).

Basic and diluted earnings per share before goodwill amortisation has been shown because, in the opinion of the Directors, it
more accurately reflects the trading performance of the Group.
The calculation of earnings per 20p Ordinary Share is based on the profit on ordinary activities after taxation using as a divisor the
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.  For 2006 and 2005, the actual number of Ordinary Shares 
in issue throughout the year was 17,999,162.
All share options in respect of which the related performance criteria have been met as at 30 September 2006 and 2005 and
which have an exercise price lower than the average market price of the Group’s share price in the period since issue have been
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
The weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, taking into account the dilutive effect of the share options was
18,435,688 (2005: 18,201,870).

Freehold land and buildings includes a property which was revalued to £360,000 from an historical cost of £52,290. The
revaluation was as at 30 September 1988 by independent qualified valuers, Greenslade Taylor Hunt, on an open market basis for
existing use. Under the transitional rules of FRS 15 ‘Tangible fixed assets’ the revaluation has not been updated. If the property
had not been revalued then its carrying value at the balance sheet date would have been £37,000 (2005: £38,000)
Other than the revalued property referred to above, which has a net book value of £230,400 at the balance sheet date, the
remainder of the freehold land and buildings are carried at cost.

The net foreign exchange gain on foreign currency denominated borrowings for the period was £182,000, all of which has been
offset against the loss on foreign currency net investments.
Prior to the implementation of FRS 10 “Goodwill and Intangible assets”, the Group’s policy was to write off Goodwill directly
against reserves. A cumulative total of £1,335,000 has been taken to reserves under this policy.

Goodwill (see note 13)
Total consideration
On 6 February 2006, the Group acquired the entire share capital of ChromoDynamics Inc. (CDI), a developer of hyperspectral
imaging systems.  The company is based in the United States and was acquired for a cash consideration of £655,556
(US$1,180,000) plus acquisition expenses of £34,135.  
The acquisition accounting approach has been adopted in respect of the acquisition.
Prior to its acquisition, CDI had a 30 June year end.  For the year to 30 June 2005, CDI reported a loss after tax of US$50,924
and for the period to 5 February 2006, reported a profit before tax of US$17,800.
The book values of CDI’s assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition along with the directors’ provisional assessment of their
fair value at the balance sheet date are shown below:
The goodwill recognised in respect of the acquisition is to be amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life,
which has been assessed by the directors to be ten years from the date of acquisition.

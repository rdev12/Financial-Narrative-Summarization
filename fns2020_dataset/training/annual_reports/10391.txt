Chairman’s statement
We are delighted to announce that 
MITIE has delivered another year of 
double-digit earnings growth, against 
a backdrop of unprecedented market
conditions. Revenues have grown by
8.2% to £1,521.9m, operating profit before
amortisation* (EBITA) by 11.5 % to £80.5m
and cash conversion stands at 97.5%. 
This result is particularly pleasing in a year
where economic conditions have been
extremely challenging and demonstrates
the resilience of the MITIE business, 
which is well diversified in terms of its 
client base and market sector exposure. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to deliver stakeholder value
through a focus on sustainable profitable
growth. To achieve this we have to
anticipate changes in our markets and
react quickly. Currently our clients are
increasing levels of outsourcing and seeking
supply chain efficiencies through larger
integrated contracts. In response to 
our clients’ changing needs, we have
improved our operating structure, invested
in additional specialist resources and while 
we are experiencing slowing in some areas,
we are seeing record levels of opportunity
and are securing many exciting long-term
integrated contracts.
Acquisitions remain a key part of our
strategy. With no gearing at the year end,
we are extremely well positioned to take
advantage of value creating opportunities.
We look for quality companies with strong
management teams that complement or
fit within our existing business and operate 
in growth markets.
Results
Our performance during the year, 
saw revenues grow by 8.2% to £1,521.9m
(2008: £1 ,407 .2m) . Operating profit before
amortisation* (EBITA) increased by 11.5% to
£80.5m (2008: £72.2m), reflecting an enhanced
margin of 5.3% (2008: 5.1%) with profit before
tax rising by 11.8% to £75.9m (2008: £67.9m).
Adjusted earnings per share grew by 15.4% 
to 17.2p per share (2008: 14.9p per share). 
The business remains very cash generative
and has reported a cash inflow from
operations of £94.4m (2008: £78.2m) for the
year, which represented cash conversion 
of 97.5% (2008: 90.3%). The balance sheet 
is extremely strong with net funds at the year
end of £10.9m (2008: net debt £15.6m). 
We have secured bank facilities of £230.0m,
which are in place to January 2012, of which
£10.0m was utilised at the year end. This leaves
the Group well positioned to take advantage
of acquisition opportunities as they arise.
We are pleased to report growth of 11.4% in
our order book during the year, which now
stands at an impressive £4.9bn (2008: £4.4bn).
Dividend
On the basis of our strong performance
during the year and our solid prospects for
the future, the Board is recommending an
increased final dividend of 3.6p per Ordinary
share adding up to a total dividend per
share for the year of 6.9p, a 15.0% increase
on 2008 in line with our dividend policy to
maintain dividends in line with underlying
earnings growth at a cover ratio of 2.5 times
adjusted earnings. Subject to shareholder
approval at the Annual General Meeting,
the dividend will be paid on 7 August 2009 to
shareholders on the register at 10 July 2009.
Main Board
There were a number of changes to the
Board during the year. David Ord and
Cullum McAlpine both retired from the
Board on 31 July 2008. As a result, I was
appointed Non-Executive Chairman and
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
and David Jenkins was appointed Senior
Independent Director and Chairman of the
Audit Committee. The Board is extremely
grateful for the leadership and valuable
contributions from David and Cullum during
their six years on the Board and wish them
every success in the future.
We are delighted that Terry Morgan has
agreed to join the Board on 1 July 2009 as a
Non-Executive Director. He will, immediately
following the conclusion of the AGM on the
10 July 2009, assume the role of Chairman
of the Remuneration Committee from
Ishbel Macpherson. Terry is currently Chief
Executive of Tube Lines and will become
Chairman of Crossrail later this year. 
Terry has extensive experience of change,
strategy and operations across a number 
of large, complex organisations and he will
make a valuable contribution to our Board.
People
Since becoming Chairman, I have been
extremely impressed by the strength, 
depth and positive attitude of the MITIE
team. As part of my induction programme,
I visited all of our divisions and the quality 
of our people is self-evident.
The effective day-to-day management 
of our business is critical. It requires the skill
and expertise that comes only with hard
work, commitment and experience. 
MITIE’s financial results and strength have
only been possible due to the hard work 
of its people, whose expertise and
dedication remain our most important
assets. We would therefore like to thank
them all for their contribution to another
excellent set of results.
Outlook
We have entered the new financial year 
in a positive position, with a strong order
book and bid pipeline, committed banking
facilities and no debt. 
We recognise the economic challenges
that are facing our own business and that
of our clients, but see continued opportunities
for sustainable profitable growth for MITIE
through our ability to enhance efficiency 
in extended scope outsourced solutions
and the introduction of innovation in asset
management for our clients. We look forward
to another good year of growth for MITIE.

Business review
A review of our strategy by the Chief Executive
06
MITIE is in a strong position. We have an
excellent track record, an experienced
management team, a strong balance
sheet and a broad client base.
Overall the Group is performing very well
and making strong progress. We are seeing
a clear trend for increased outsourcing 
and a drive for efficiency as client budgets
come under pressure during this stage of
the economic cycle. We expect to benefit
from this trend, and see opportunities for
growth as we contribute to our clients’
cost and operational efficiency through
extended scope outsourced solutions 
and the introduction of innovation in 
asset management. Our financial strength,
strategic consultancy, management
experience and broad range of services
mean that MITIE is an attractive partner 
for both new and existing clients alike.
Against this backdrop of opportunity
however, certain areas of our business 
such as our interior fit-out, retail engineering
and our plumbing business with its exposure
to the new build housing market have been
affected by the recession. These areas of
our business are continuing to experience
challenging conditions. However, as markets
improve they should be some of the first 
to benefit. 
As an organisation that deals with change
on a daily basis for our clients, we also
continually assess the efficiency of how we
work. The current market conditions have
reinforced this behaviour and we are 
taking a responsible approach to the
review of our activities, with the long-term
future of the business our priority. We have
considered the ways we engage with our
clients, our management structure and 
our risk profile. 
We are being cautious about the credit 
risk that we take on at the moment. 
This could have an effect on our top line
growth in certain markets but our client
acceptance criteria will give us stability 
in the long term. Our margins are under
pressure, but this is not a new trend 
and we are skilled at focusing on the
maintenance and development of our
margin performance. Naturally, we protect
our margins by ensuring that we always
have an efficient cost base.
As part of this process, we have 
made changes to the structure of our
business. With effect from 1 April 2009 
our Engineering Services division has 
been renamed Asset Management to
demonstrate the move away from the
traditional contracting environment 
to a total asset lifecycle approach 
which will include consultancy, design, 
installation and maintenance and we 
will be enhancing our asset maintenance
capability going forward through the
combination of Engineering Maintenance
and Services. Property Services becomes
Property Management to show the wider
range of property management and project
management abilities that we now offer,
whilst Facilities Services becomes Facilities
Management to reflect the shift in emphasis
towards total facilities management and
multiple services contracts as clients look for
better value and improved levels of service. 
Our teams are highly motivated, focused
on supporting our clients in these very
uncertain market conditions, and are using
their experience and fresh thinking to give
us a competitive edge. We are pleased
that we are dealing with the current
climate really well and are securing some
great new contracts.
Our strategy: 
To deliver stakeholder value 
through a focus on sustainable
proﬁtable growth.
Strategy achieved by:
1. Clients
Deliver value to our clients by providing world-class service;
2. People
Recruit, motivate and retain the best talent in the industry;
3. Risk

4. Responsibility

our brand to all stakeholders;
5. Integration
Leverage our strong position to secure more integrated 
and larger scale contracts;
6. Proﬁtability
Focus on growing a proﬁtable business, maintaining margins;
7. Acquisitions
Supplement our organic growth with selective acquisitions.

3. Risk
We take risks everyday as part of our daily
life. In business it is our duty to understand
the risks we face, appreciate the impact
that those risks may have on our people,
clients or wider stakeholders and to 
devise appropriate strategies to manage,
mitigate or eliminate these risks. MITIE 
does all of that and we then ensure that
everyone in the business understands their
role in our risk management process and
can behave accordingly.
Having an appropriate risk management
process does not mean that we are so
measured in our approach that we lose
competitive advantage. We classify our
risks into four areas, strategic, operational,
ﬁnancial and compliance. Strategic risks
are those that could affect our long-term
strategic objectives. Operational risks 
arise from our day-to-day activities which,
if not managed, could affect business
performance. Financial risks have a 
direct impact on our ﬁnancial position
and compliance risk covers risks that
relate to legal and regulatory sanctions
and damage to goodwill arising from
failure to comply with applicable laws
and regulations.
The assessment of risks is part of our 
culture. Every MITIE business has a risk
register that identiﬁes the particular issues
relating to that part of our operations
and activities. These are consolidated 
into the overall MITIE Group risk register,
which considers our high-level risks and is
reviewed and considered by our Board.
Our risk management team conducts
regular reviews and assessments
to ensure that our risk identiﬁcation and
management processes remain relevant
to the shape of our business, the wider
market conditions and most importantly
that any risk mitigation strategies are
being followed.
2. People
It is easy to say that our people are 
our greatest asset but they really are. 
We are only as good as the people that
prepare our client strategies, manage
projects and facilities, and deliver services.
As they are so important to us, we have 
a three part people strategy.
Firstly, we make sure that each employee
has the best possible career journey with
MITIE. We have a consistent approach
that reinforces our culture and values. 
We evaluate skills, identify gaps and
provide appropriate training and support
to ensure success. We use a performance
management process so that we can be
fair in our measurement of performance
and appraisal. This encourages good
levels of performance and minimises
employment risks. 
Secondly, we have an integrated
Human Resources (HR) team structure 
to provide a professional and efficient
service that meets the needs of our
people and the future requirements 
of the business. We employ specialists in
key areas including the management 
of TUPE, pensions and employment law.
The third part of our people strategy
makes sure that we will have the right
talented people for the future. We have 
a structured approach to succession
planning, reward and incentivisation,
leadership, management development
and professional development. It gives 
us a motivated MITIE team that is
determined to outperform the market.
The result is that we have a very people
centric business with a strong leadership
and management style but with the
ﬂexibility to drive the Group forward.
People
Our MITIE Stars awards recognise
people who show true passion for 
their work, going above and beyond
the call of duty.
Risk Management
We empower our people to stop 
and think before doing their work.
Safety is part of our culture.
Clients
We apply strategic thinking,
management skill and an unrivalled
range of services to meet our 
clients’ needs.
1. Clients
Our clients are at the centre of everything
that we do. If we do not have satisﬁed
clients who are prepared to make a
positive recommendation about MITIE 
we do not have a sustainable future. 
From their ﬁrst day with us, our people 
are trained to think about our clients’
objectives. What does the client want
from MITIE? How can we contribute to
their business and organisational issues?
Our clients expect us to deliver value
for money. In this economic climate,
we continually evaluate our cost base 
to ensure that we are deploying resources
efficiently. This applies to all areas of 
our business and we run a lean business
to make sure that our clients feel the full
beneﬁt from our efforts. 
Our clients represent the future of our
business so we make sure that we have
the best possible relationships with them,
understand the issues that affect them
and regularly engage with them at all
levels. To make sure that we are getting 
it right we conduct client satisfaction
surveys to check that we are providing 
a quality service and are in tune with our
clients’ strategic direction.

4. Responsibility
Corporate Responsibility (CR) has always
been at the core of the way we work at
MITIE and is an essential part of our culture. 
Our success for over 21 years has come
from having a responsible business model
that has responded to the ever-changing
requirements of an increasingly wide
group of stakeholders. CR is part of our
business strategy because it helps us 
to deliver sustainable proﬁtable growth.
We have ﬁve pillars in our CR framework.
Health and Safety is critical. We employ
over 50,000 people and good health 
and safety performance is vital for 
their wellbeing and improves business
performance.
Community engagement is also important.
Our people want to work for a company
that is recognised for helping to make 
a difference to the lives of others, 
whether that is through our volunteering
programmes or charity work.
The environmental agenda makes it
imperative for us to manage and reduce
our impact on the Environment. We also
support our clients to improve their energy
efficiency, reduce waste streams and
improve cost efficiency. 
Focusing on our People helps to improve
business results. We train, develop and
reward our people well, which improves
retention, motivation and stability. 
We develop our Service Delivery
capabilities to support the needs and core
businesses of our clients and the changing
market. This helps to maintain our long-
term relationships and contributes to the
successes of our respective organisations.
5. Integration
MITIE is an integrated business. Integration 
is important for efficiency and supports 
our client proposition of seamless service
delivery. All of our businesses use common
systems and processes and are transitioning
to a common ﬁnancial and HR platform.
This is important because as clients ask us 
to provide a wider range of services they
want to be dealing with just one MITIE 
team that operates the same way.
Integration however, is more than 
systems; it is also about attitude, 
ownership and leadership. 
Increasingly, our clients want us to be
integrated with their own operations 
so that we can help them to achieve 
their business and organisational goals. 
They want a seamless service that
reinforces their corporate image,
so that their employees and clients 
can’t tell where they stop and we start. 
This is crucial and allows them to maintain 
a complete focus on their core business 
areas and activities. 
6. Proﬁtability
Ultimately, the objective of any commercial
organisation is to be proﬁtable. MITIE has 
a 21-year track record of continuous
proﬁtable growth. We have a total ﬁnancial
focus on proﬁts and cash. In these markets
with changing risk proﬁles it is still important 
to achieve revenue growth through taking
market share, but it is crucial to maintain
proﬁt margins and be paid on a timely 
basis for the work we have performed. 
Our cash conversion target is 90%.
We manage our ﬁnancial performance
with a series of key performance indicators 
that are consistent and applied throughout
the business. 
Responsibility
We invest in seven MITIE Construction
Skills Centres in secondary schools
around the UK, providing over 1 ,000 
14-16 year-old boys and girls and 
their communities with access to
construction skills and qualiﬁcations,
career advice and work experience.
Proﬁtability
We recognise that focusing on
proﬁtability rather than top line growth
is a key factor in creating value for 
our stakeholders, so we have always
based the senior team’s incentives 
on proﬁt-related performance. 
The results? A 21-year track record 
of continuous growth in earnings.

Acquisitions
We have a track record of 
delivering and integrating selective
acquisitions to support our strategic
growth objectives.
We monitor our progress towards
meeting our strategic goals through
our ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial key
performance indicators, which are
set out on pages 12-13. 
7. Acquisitions
We have a low market share in all of our
markets. We expect to grow organically 
by taking market share from competitors
but we are also well positioned to create
stakeholder value through acquisition. 
At 31 March 2009, we had no net debt
and undrawn committed funding facilities
of £220.0m out of a £230.0m total facility.
This gives us the financial capacity 
and flexibility to make selected, value
enhancing acquisitions should the Board
consider this to be appropriate. 
Our approach to acquisitions remains
conservative. We are looking for quality
businesses with strong management teams
that complement or fit within our existing
business and operate in growth markets.

Market overview
We have a wide range of clients, 
and exposure to many market sectors. 
This provides us with a balanced portfolio 
of market conditions and protects our
earnings from fluctuations. This is particularly
important in the current economic climate
where we are seeing uncertainty in some
sectors that is likely to continue in the 
short-term. 
Currently our business demonstrates 
a 59/41 private/public sector split in its
revenues and we believe that this remains
an appropriate split for our business and 
mix of services. It is possible that this may
change in the short-term as a higher
proportion of GDP is represented by
government spending, but is appropriate 
in the longer-term.
We target our sales and marketing
resources at those sectors that we 
believe offer the greatest opportunity 
and our sector focus varies as economic
conditions change. Our business model
gives us the flexibility to take advantage 
of opportunities as they arise.
Education and healthcare are 
good areas to be established in
During the year, we have been
successful in increasing our penetration
of the education and healthcare
markets. We have secured key
contracts in the Building Schools for 
the Future scheme to provide facilities
management to schools in Derbyshire
and Kent. In the healthcare market, 
we have secured more work with
Great Ormond Street and new work
with North Middlesex Hospital and 
St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust.
Summary of key sectors
Education
Education is a solid long-term market 
for both capital and operational
expenditure. There is a trend towards 
the procurement of integrated FM services
which counteracts the diverse nature of
sector funding. Both the Building Schools 
for the Future and PFI programmes are
major drivers of growth. MITIE is the largest
PFI FM education service provider in UK.
Target market size is £13.0bn pa and 
our market share is 1.0%.
Government (central and local)
Government spending is forecast to 
remain stable in the short-term. In the
medium-term, budgets will be under
pressure as tax revenues decrease.
Government departments and local
authorities such as existing clients: the
Department for Communities and Local
Government; the Department for Culture
Media and Sport; and The Department 
for Education and Skills will require greater
efficiencies from service partners. 
Overview
Public sector spending is likely to take 
an increasingly dominant position 
as UK economic conditions remain
uncertain.
Key facts:
– Spending committed until 2012 in
areas such as education, housing
and healthcare;
– Capital and maintenance expenditure
split 50:50;
– Trend towards consolidation 
of suppliers and procurement 
of integrated FM services; and
– Pressures on public purse likely 
to encourage further outsourcing, 
more commercial procurement 
and increased spend on FM services.
Private sector
Summary of key sectors
Finance and professional services
MITIE has a significant presence in the
finance services sector with all businesses
having major contracts. We are very well
placed to work in partnership with clients
such as PwC, Standard Life, and Barclays 
to increase cost effiency and to provide
facilities management and service delivery
across the UK. The current impetus for
change is creating an unprecedented
number of opportunities. Target market size
is £5.0bn pa and our market share is 4.3%.
Transport and logistics
Transport is a key sector for MITIE. It is 
a long-term growth sector where our
specialist services and sector focus 
are highly attractive to clients. We are
having a high degree of success in this
sector, extending existing and securing 
new contracts with BAA, FirstGroup and 
Eurostar. Target market size is £11.0bn pa
and our market share is 0.7%.
Overview
We have a high quality private sector
client base with strong representation
across many sectors. However, most
private sector businesses are expected to
be cutting back on expenditure over the
next 12–18 months as economic conditions
remain uncertain. Clients are focused on
optimising the efficiency of their cost base.
This means that outsourcing contracts 
are becoming larger, covering more
services and wider geography.
Consolidation, particularly amongst our
clients, creates uncertainty, but also
provides an opportunity to increase
market share.
Key facts:
– Construction sector will be challenging
for at least 18 months;
– More opportunity in FM where 
MITIE provides essential services;
– Availability of labour should improve;
and
– Selectivity of opportunities is crucial.

Looking forward
We are delivering a strong and consistent
ﬁnancial and operational performance.
Our business is growing well and we 
are experiencing a very strong sales
pipeline. Clients’ budgets in both the 
public and private sector are under
pressure, supporting demand for efficiency
and value for money, which in turn leads 
to more outsourcing. 
We know that the global economic
environment is going to remain challenging
for some time but we operate in a market
where contracts are becoming more
sophisticated, larger and longer term in
duration. This gives us conﬁdence in our
business model as we expand our strategic
offering to our clients.
We have a ﬂexible business, which can
easily adapt to meet our clients’ changing
needs. With the signiﬁcant level of current
opportunities, we are conﬁdent that our 
future performance will remain strong.
We are encouraged by the contracts that
we have recently secured and anticipate
continued strong growth in the years ahead.

Chief Executive
Healthcare
Healthcare is a market with considerable
potential for increased levels of outsourcing
with spending driven by the UK’s ageing
population demographic. The sector 
offers stable revenue streams and low
credit risk with clients such as: St George’s 
and North Middlesex Hospital in London;
Hull Hospital; and Great Ormond Street
Hospital. Target market size is £11.0bn pa
and our market share is 0.8%.
Local Government Strategic Partnerships
will leverage private sector skills and
ﬁnance to improve efficiency. There will 
be a trend towards larger contracts with 
a broader range of management and
service provision. Target market size is
£7.0bn pa and our market share is 3.9%.
Social housing
Social housing is a key public policy area
with the need for sustainable communities
high on the agenda. The development 
and maintenance of high quality public
housing stock is a core part of government
strategy. Decent Homes programmes and
repair and maintenance contracts offer 
us considerable opportunity. Government 
has ambitious plans for affordable housing
through the Homes and Communities
Agency to support local governments 
and communities. This sector, with 
clients such as Birmingham City Council, 
Dacorum Borough Council and Milton
Keynes District Council offers good 
growth potential with long-term contracts. 
Target market size is £10.0bn pa and 
our market share is 1.2%.
Utilities
The utilities companies represent an
attractive market for MITIE with dependable
cash ﬂow and spending commitments. 
In common with many other sectors the
drive for improved operational efficiency 
is leading to larger, longer term contracts.
Sustainability and renewable energy are 
key areas. We have a good presence in this
market with major contracts with RWE npower
and Thames Water. Target market size
is £8.0bn pa and our market share is 1.0%.
Technology and communications
Our focus in this area is in data centre 
and infrastructure support and regular
maintenance and support activities. 
MITIE supports the capital and revenue
expenditure streams in this market. 
Target market size is £4.0bn pa and 
our market share is 2.3%.
Manufacturing
An important sector for MITIE and one 
where we are actively supporting our clients
in these challenging times. Our focus is to
develop our long-standing relationships with
key clients such as Rolls-Royce. Target market
size is £5.0bn pa and our market share is 2.7%.
Retail
The majority of the retail market is 
focused on cost reduction. We are 
working closely with our clients to meet
their business needs. Target market is 
£5.0bn pa and our market share is 2.1%.
Property management
This market is heavily inﬂuenced 
by property occupancy levels. 
Traditionally, contracts are single service.
There is little trend towards multi-service 
or FM contracts. Target market size is
£6.0bn pa and our market share is 1.8%.
Leisure
As a high proportion of leisure spend is
discretionary we are introducing innovation
for our clients to improve efficiency. 
Target market size is £2.0bn pa and our 
market share is 2.3%.

7. Acquisitions
Acquisitions remain a key part of our
strategy as detailed on page 9. We seek
to acquire quality companies with quality
management that complement or fit
within our existing business.
We have completed the successful integration 
of the acquisitions that we made in March 2008: 
– The acquisition of Catering Partnership has
expanded the scale and capability of our
catering offering and has enabled us to bid 
for signiﬁcantly larger contracts in this market. 
– The DW Tilley rooﬁng business acquisition has
been successfully integrated with our existing
rooﬁng business to form a truly national rooﬁng
refurbishment company.
4. Responsibility
Description:
We are conscious of the impact of our operations
on the environment. Our CO2 emissions are
calculated using DEFRA conversion factors
following a review of our fuel and utilities usage. 
The rate of CO2 emissions per MITIE employee is
calculated using the average number of people
employed during the year.
Objective:
Understand and minimise the environmental
impact of our operations.
Comment:
Our normalised CO2 emissions per employee 
are consistent with the prior year. 
5. Integration
Description:
With 67% of our revenue being generated 
through single service contracts, we have a great
opportunity for growth through expanding our
relationships with existing clients by providing other
services. We have seen a trend in the markets
towards multi-service and FM contracts over the
past few years and we are well positioned to meet
the demands of this trend due to our broad range
of services. 
We measure the percentage of revenue that is
generated by these types of contracts in order to
measure how well we are performing in this arena.

Description:
It is important that we continue to target a progressive
dividend policy that provides an appropriate return 
to shareholders and that provides a dividend which
grows in line with the underlying earnings of the Group. 
Dividend cover is calculated by reference to our
underlying, cash-based earnings which we measure
using our basic EPS before amortisation of intangibles,
imputed interest charges relating to acquisitions and
material non-recurring charges. There were no material
non-recurring charges in 2009 or 2008. The adjusted
EPS after these items is 17.2p (2008: 14.9p) giving rise
to underlying growth of 15.4%.
Target range:
At least in line with underlying earnings growth 
at a cover rate of 2.5 times adjusted earnings.
Comment:
Our dividend growth for the year is 15.0 %, 
giving cover of 2.5 times adjusted earnings.

Financial performance of the business
could be adversely affected by uncertain
economic conditions. Loss of clients,
a reduction in services taken by clients,
and failure to adhere to credit terms as
a result of changes in their own financial
position could affect the Group.
Committed banking facilities of £230.0m
are in place until 2012 in addition to £35.0m
of overdraft facilities to support day-to-day
operations and strategic growth targets.
Operational cash ﬂow is prioritised through
a set of KPIs and the Group had net funds
of £10.9m at 31 March 2009.
Trustees manage the pension liabilities and
the required contribution rates are set on
the basis of independent actuarial advice.
The Group’s own deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
is well funded, and we aim to maintain
a broadly neutral funding position in the
medium-term.
Management of pension risk on contracts
requires the support of independent advisers
and the approval of the Group Finance
Director, and in certain cases, the Board.
Financial trading performance compared
to budget is reviewed on a monthly basis.
Cash performance is monitored daily.
Systems are in place to monitor and
manage credit risk exposure across the

and business disruption.
Responsibility for Health and Safety rests
with the Chief Executive who is supported

of the contract will be affected, leading to
pressure on service delivery and potentially
loss of business over time.
Greater opportunities to secure new 
work in the current climate as potential
clients focus on cost efficiencies and 
look to outsource their non-core services.
The internal control environment includes 
a strict bid and contract review process

Operating review
On 1 April 2009 we took a decision to
rebrand our three operating divisions 
to Facilities Management (previously
Facilities Services), Property Management
(previously Property Services) and Asset
Management (previously Engineering
Services). Further , we elected to enhance
our Asset Management proposition 
through its combination with our
Engineering Maintenance business, 
which had previously been a part of our
Facilities Services business. The commentary 
and ﬁnancial data below reﬂects the
performance of our three divisions in the
organisational structures that applied during
the period to 31 March 2009, and reﬂects 
the new branding. A proforma analysis 
of the ﬁnancial results of the business for 
the year ended 31 March 2009 in the new
organisation is set out in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Facilities Management
Our Facilities Management division delivers
facilities consultancy, management and
service delivery to our clients. Within the
division, during the year ended 31 March
2009 we recognised five principal business
lines which were: facilities management,
which comprises our managed services,
business services, client services and 
PFI businesses; cleaning and environmental,
which encompasses our cleaning,
landscaping and pest control businesses;
Security; engineering maintenance; 
and catering. 
The division has had a good year securing
many new contracts and expanding 
many existing contracts by providing
additional services adding to our order
book which has increased to £4.2bn 
(2008: £3.6bn).
Revenue in the division increased by 
14.8% to £942.2m (2008: £820.4m) with
operating profit growing by 10.8% to 
£54.2m (2008: £48.9m). Operating profit
margins decreased to 5.8% (2008: 6.0%) 
as we have enhanced investment in 
our business development capabilities.
Results summary
During the year , we have focused on
developing our facilities management 
(FM) and multi-service offerings and on
increasing the integration between our ﬁve
business lines in the bidding and operation
of our contracts. We have improved 
our processes for managing customer
relationships and co-ordinating our sales
process to promote cross selling by
enhancing the management information
shared across the division.
We are seeing opportunities as well 
as challenges from the effects of the
recession as clients look for innovative
solutions to reduce costs and exposure 
to risk. During the year , we have seen 
an increasing number of opportunities 
in bidding for new contracts within the
division as well as an increase in existing
clients looking to reduce costs. Our ability 
to work together with clients through 
multi-service and FM contracts,
consolidating their supply chains 
and internal management structures, 
along with our efﬁcient processes and
technology, helps them to create savings
and efﬁciencies. Where appropriate, 
we have also been able to support clients
by proactively identifying temporary cost
reduction measures to existing services. 
Our national coverage and wide range 
of capabilities means that we are one 
of a limited number of service providers 
that can deliver full scope FM contracts. 
The economic climate is providing an
impetus for clients to move towards larger
multi-service and FM contracts in order 
to consolidate their supply chains and 
save costs. 
In order to take full advantage of the
opportunities within this market area, 
which provides signiﬁcant potential 
for MITIE, we have invested in our FM
capabilities during the year , recruiting 
key individuals to the business to provide
enhanced strategic leadership that will
complement our proven service delivery
capability in this area. 
During the year , we have secured new
work in both the private and public sectors
as all organisations look to outsourcing 
non-core services to create efﬁciencies.
Our work to identify key market sectors
during the year has been supported by
notable successes including:
Within the education sector , MITIE has
solidiﬁed its position as the largest provider
of FM services to PFI schools in the UK
following success in the government's
£45.0bn Building Schools for the Future
(BSF) programme to rebuild or refurbish 
all schools in England. 
In December , we secured preferred bidder
status on the Derbyshire County Council 
BSF project. The contract will total £65.0m
for MITIE, running over a period of 25 years 
and will see MITIE providing FM services to
46 schools across the county. The contract
forms part of the Equitix consortium, 
which has been selected as preferred
bidder working in partnership with 
Derbyshire County Council as part of the 
ﬁrst phase of their £750.0m transformation 
of secondary education.  
Standard Life
At Standard Life’s headquarters in
Edinburgh, our ‘ingredients’ food
service team has achieved a catering
sales increase by introducing a 
new food and signage concept. 
The concept reflects the high quality
fresh food offer and provides clear
labelling and communication to 
help Standard Life employees with 
their food and beverage choices. 
Our continued commitment and 
focus on enhancing the customer's
experience is aimed at improving 
the perception of workplace catering
as a real employee benefit.

Think
MITIE has proved itself as a valuable multi-skilled
partner to BAA, helping to assist it with its objective 
of reducing its supplier base whilst delivering a
quality service to meet the needs of its passengers
and airlines. Through careful planning we were able
to recruit, train and obtain airside security clearance
for 400 new cleaners for the opening of Terminal 5 
to ensure that the service at the UK’s largest free
standing building could start on schedule. We have
also assisted BAA to develop a robust new service
for its passengers with restricted mobility (PRM) 
after new legislation required the airport operator 
to provide a uniﬁed service instead of individual
airlines taking care of their own passengers. 
This has enabled MITIE and BAA to standardise 
the PRM service making it easier for passengers 
with disabilities to travel through Stansted Airport 
and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 4.
Manage
MITIE now manages more than 1,200 people on the
BAA contract coping with the peaks and troughs 
in seasonal demands and supplying extra people
depending on the security alert status. Our specialist
cleaners work at height, especially at Terminal 5
where it is essential that the ﬂoor to ceiling glass 
walls and the departure lounge’s single-span,
waveform glass roof are clean in order to let the
natural light in and enhance the amazing views 
of the world’s busiest international airﬁeld.  
By investing in the latest heavy duty cleaning
technology, we have been able to increase 
the productivity of our people and increase the
efﬁciency of the service, reducing costs. We have
also invested in the PRM service and are the only
company in the UK to own ambulifts that can lift
passengers with restricted mobility on to the new
Airbus A380 plane. 
Deliver
MITIE delivers a range of services at different airports
for BAA including delivering the waste management
at Heathrow Terminal 5, the cleaning at Heathrow
Terminals 1, 5 and at Gatwick’s North and South
Terminals and the PRM service on behalf of BAA at
Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 4 and at Stansted Airport.
We also provide people to help passengers comply
with liquid restrictions before going through security
at Heathrow Terminals 1 and 2.
BAA
Our work with BAA has grown from 
a cleaning contract at Terminal 5 
to one of our largest multi-service
contracts working at all of BAA’s
London airports.

We have been steadily expanding 
our relationship with Barclays for 
the last 12 years to make it one of 
our largest multi-service contracts.
Business review
Operating review
Think
As one of Barclays’ top facilities providers, we have
worked together to ﬁnd different and joined up
ways of providing our services, maximising the 
cost savings provided to Barclays whilst consistently
raising our standards across the services to meet 
and exceed increased service level targets of 90%.
Manage
We have implemented our leading IT systems to 
help us manage the contract efﬁciently, including
our Tracker system, which monitors the 1,500
cleaners that clean the Barclays retail branches 
at night. The system allows us to track lone workers
and teams, making sure that they are safe and that
the branches will always be clean and tidy for their
customers each morning. In order to make sure that
standards are being met, our Vision IT system allows
us and the client to view live audit data on cleaning
standards. We also manage mobile cleaning and
engineering teams, who are always on-hand to be
on-site within two hours, to react to any emergency
calls from our 24-hour Customer Support Centre.

MITIE has more than 2,400 people involved in the
Barclays contract, providing the cleaning, security,
pest control and waste management services 
to Barclays Corporate ofﬁces as well as the 
cleaning at 1,340 of its retail branches and
mechanical and engineering maintenance to 
400 of its retail branches around the UK. We have
also recently secured the contract to provide front

We have also signed a 31-year contract 
to deliver total facilities management to
three new PFI schools in Kent. MITIE will be
working for Telereal Trillium who is leading 
a consortium of partners in a £600.0m 
deal to completely rebuild or substantially
refurbish the first ten secondary schools in
Kent’s extensive BSF programme. This initial
contract award for MITIE is valued in 
excess of £40.0m, and, with a further eight
PFI schemes likely to be added to the
contract, it is expected that the overall
contract value will increase substantially
over the term. MITIE has the exclusive rights
to deliver FM to the schools, which will
include the overall management and
helpdesk, engineering and building fabric
maintenance, security and all soft services
comprising caretaking, cleaning, catering
and grounds maintenance. 
In the utilities sector , we have been 
made preferred bidder for a six-year
integrated facilities management contract
with Thames Water Utilities Ltd (TWUL). 
The estimated total value of the contract
for MITIE is over £100.0m, which will cover
TWUL’s entire estate, including their head
office and laboratory as well as operational
buildings throughout the Thames region. 
MITIE will have responsibility for managing
and delivering a variety of expertise and
services, which will include a tailored asset
management strategy, enabling the client 
to identify and target effective capital
investment, reducing annual operational
expenditure. This will be combined with a
range of other services, driven through a
dedicated helpdesk system.
In the technology and communications
sector , our contract with Cable and
Wireless continues to grow, having secured
new catering and security contracts with
the telecommunications company. The
three-year catering contract includes the
provision of staff restaurants, cafés, deli bars
and hospitality at seven Cable and Wireless
offices around the country, including its
Europe, Asia and US business head office 
in Bracknell. The new security management
contract, over three years, will include the 
provision of manned guarding, electrical
security and response services to more than
900 Cable and Wireless sites in the UK and
more than 15 sites in Europe. 
Our original FM and mechanical and
engineering contracts with Cable and
Wireless have also been expanded to
include its acquisition of telecommunication
company THUS in 2008, meaning that the
total value of work that we perform for
Cable and Wireless is now in excess of
£20.0m per annum. 
We have secured a new integrated FM
contract with Syngenta, a world-leading
agribusiness, following a tender process
that aimed to consolidate their supply
chain and improve the management of
their international research centre estate
near Bracknell. The three-year contract
includes maintenance, helpdesk, cleaning,
landscaping, waste, mailroom and
reprographics services.
In the healthcare sector we have secured
a multi-service contract with St George’s
Healthcare NHS Trust, whose main site in
Tooting, South West London, is one of the
UK’s largest teaching hospitals. The seven-
year contract will result in the employment
of 500 people providing cleaning and
catering services across the Trust’s estate. 
Our healthcare team has also successfully
retained its domestic and portering services
contract with North Middlesex University
Hospital NHS Trust, which it has held since
2003. The new contract will run for a further
three years, with an enlarged scope, 
which includes the provision of on-site
security services. 
MITIE has had a very successful 
year increasing our presence in the
transport and logistics sector , securing
several signiﬁcant, high-proﬁle contracts.
Our new contract with Eurostar will see 
MITIE providing security services at their 
St Pancras International, Ebbsﬂeet
International and Ashford International
terminals as well as taking responsibility 
for security at their Temple Mills engineering
base. MITIE’s specialist transport security
team will work alongside Eurostar’s own
team to support them in providing a safe,
secure environment for travellers and staff.
The team of over 330 ofﬁcers will undertake
a variety of roles including customer service
support, searching of trains, passengers and
baggage, and 24-hour control of access in
and out of all sites. 
In other areas of the transport and logistics
sector , we have secured a ﬁve-year
contract with FirstGroup plc valued at
£26.0m over ﬁve years to provide support
services to their bus division. MITIE will be
cleaning, moving and refuelling all of
FirstGroup’s buses as well as cleaning their
premises and workshops in the London 
and Berkshire areas. We have also secured
a new security contract with the Port of
Felixstowe adding to our existing three-year
catering contract which was secured 
in May 2008 to provide staff catering,
hospitality and vending services.
The last 12 months have been challenging
ones for the ﬁnance and professional
sector , and just as the sector was one of 
the ﬁrst to feel the effects of the credit crisis,
it has also been one of the ﬁrst sectors to
look to outsourcing to try to reduce costs. 
We have been steadily extending the
scope of our relationship with Standard 
Life. MITIE was already working with
Standard Life, providing them with
engineering and interior ﬁt-out services on
several of their new developments around
the country. In turn, this led to MITIE securing
a ﬁve-year cleaning contract last year. 
In June 2008, we furthered our relationship
by securing our largest ever catering
contract to provide Standard Life with staff
restaurants, café bars, delis, retail shops,
hospitality and ﬁne dining for the next 
ﬁve years. This success has been built 
on the back of expanding the scale and
capability of our catering business through
the acquisition of Catering Partnership 
in March 2008, which now allows MITIE 
to bid competitively for signiﬁcantly larger
catering contracts. 
We have secured several new contracts 
in Canary Wharf including a new contract
with Citigroup to provide front of house
reception and security services at their
Canary Wharf UK headquarters. We have
also secured a three-year contract with
Credit Suisse, to provide cleaning and
washroom services at their offices in Canary
Wharf and Pall Mall (valued at £6.1m).

Property Management
Our Property Management division
provides property maintenance and
project management services, including 
a complete range of repair , refurbishment,
redecoration and ﬁt-out expertise for both
the private and public sectors with a focus
on social housing.
During the year Property Management
increased revenue by 4.3% to £297.9m
(2008: £285.7m). The integration of the 
DW Tilley rooﬁng business, which was
acquired in March 2008, was successfully
completed in the period. Operating proﬁt
grew by 19.3% to £17.9m (2008: £15.0m)
with operating margins up at 6.0% 
(2008: 5.3%).
In the current volatile market, Property
Management is following a dual strategy: 
to deliver services that are cash generative
in the immediate term; and secondly,
through longer term relationships and forms
of partnering agreements that can deliver
beneﬁts for both our clients and MITIE, 
whilst adding to our forward revenue
visibility. Our forward order book for the
division remains at £0.5bn (2008: £0.5bn).
Results summary
Property Management is focused on
providing services that support everyday
lives, creating and maintaining better
working and living environments. 
Whether this is in social housing, healthcare,
education, industry or commerce, 
our ability to satisfy our markets will stand 
us in good stead to maintain growth, 
both now and in the future. 
The successful integration of our latest
acquisition, national roofing specialists 
DW Tilley Ltd, has increased our national
coverage and strengthened our presence
in the roofing market where we focus on
renewal and repair in both the public and
private sectors. 
Our enlarged roofing business, together
with the national footprint of our other
niche services in decoration, specialist
coatings and fire protection has resulted 
in generating further value to clients who
are now able to draw on a wider range 
of services. Aligning our services even 
closer to the needs of our clients through
our multi-service offering is helping to drive
organic growth. 
In the commercial property management
market, we have seen a shift away from 
the development of new space towards 
an increase in the reconfiguration of
existing space to accommodate change.
This stabilising effect is creating opportunity
for our refurbishment teams. At the same
time, clients have a need for increased
property maintenance to enable the
building and businesses within them 
to continue to operate effectively and
efficiently. Property Management is 
well placed to benefit from these market
changes. Indeed we have recently
secured a significant contract as part of
MITIE’s facilities management contract with
Thames Water , a large proportion of which
is capital work refurbishment. 
In the public sector , we will benefit from 
the government’s Fiscal Stimulus Package,
following the announcement to bring
forward £3.0bn of capital spending from
2010/11 to 2009/10. In a sector that is
benefiting from government spending 
and where healthy competition is driving
innovation, we are confident of our ability
to grow and will continue to make further
investments in this area.

A key objective of the project was to ensure that 
the absolute minimum amount of waste was sent 
to landﬁll. An extensive consultation exercise
enabled us to establish a number of opportunities 
to re-use and recycle a broad range of materials
resulting in us achieving a recycling rate for the
project of more than 99%. With the building fully
occupied throughout, we also carried out extensive
planning in order to refurbish the building with
minimal disruption to tenants. We were able to
create extra space and improved lighting on the
main ofﬁce ﬂoor by removing the screed ﬂooring 
to maximise ﬂoor to ceiling height and by
introducing 26 roof lights to ensure the maximum
amount of daylight is achieved. Each roof light 
was equipped with electric solar controlled blinds 
to reduce heat gain and solar glare. 
Manage
Our management of the project has not only 
led to us delivering a tailor-made service to 
satisfy all our clients’ requirements, but also 
resulted in the project consistently achieving 
a score in excess of 35 out of 40 in the Considerate
Contractors Scheme. Removing the screed ﬂooring
from the main ofﬁce ﬂoor meant that we had 
to remove 520 tonnes of screed with pneumatic
breakers with a noise window of only two and 
a half hours a day. 
Deliver
Work included a full strip out of both the reception
and the main ofﬁce ﬂoor areas to create better
working conditions. We transformed the reception
area to reﬂect the client’s corporate image. 
This included the installation of new reception 
desks, marble ﬂooring and audiovisual equipment.

In line with Sentinel’s customer objectives, we have
questioned and challenged our overall approach 
to ensure all customers receive a prompt and
efficient service that offers real benefits. We have
worked with Sentinel to undertake value engineering
workshops to streamline key service processes. 
One example of this is the introduction of the 
repair time allocation system. Working with Sentinel, 
we devised a system that detailed the different
types of repairs and the average time it takes to
complete the job. It also included the operatives
available for the repair along with their trade
expertise. This system has enabled the customer
service centre to predict the time it takes to
complete the repairs as well as making sure 
the right person is allocated to the right job. 
As a result, Sentinel’s customers benefit from a 
direct appointments system and a more efficient
and cost-effective repairs service.  
Manage
We understand the importance of reducing 
the turnaround times for empty houses in order 
to save costs for our clients and increase the 
number of available homes. We have worked 
with Sentinel to rationalise workﬂow to avoid
duplication and waste by adopting ‘lean thinking’
methods. By managing the voids process as 
a whole, and communicating with all parties
concerned we can reduce the time wasted before
and after our involvement. As a result, we have
signiﬁcantly reduced the key to key turnaround 
time for void properties.

MITIE now repairs and maintains more than 
7,300 homes in the North Hampshire area for 
Sentinel and will be delivering Decent Homes,

to create sustainable communities and pride
ourselves on providing better standards of living 
for our customers.

Our work in the social housing sector
includes response, repair , cyclical
maintenance and Decent Homes
contracts. Our principal focus within the
sector is to secure repair and maintenance
works, which provide better long-term
opportunities. However , we have also been
successful in securing a number of new
Decent Homes contracts during the year 
as we have seen an increasing number 
of opportunities, with funding being
released by the government in order 
to try to accelerate the progress of the
Decent Homes programme to meet 
the government’s target to upgrade 
3.6m homes in the UK.
Amongst the new repairs and
maintenance work secured during the
year , we will be providing day-to-day
responsive repairs to 6,500 properties
throughout Hampshire, Wiltshire and
Berkshire in a four-year contract with
Wessex Housing Partnership with a total
value of £9.2m. We have also signed 
a contract with Origin Housing Group,
valued at £7.2m over four years, to deliver 
a responsive repairs, voids and adaptations
service to the tenants of 5,300 homes across
North London and the Home Counties. 
In North Hampshire, we have renewed and
expanded our repairs and maintenance
contract with Sentinel Housing Association.
The contract, valued at £50.0m over five
years started, in April 2009 and will see us
delivering services to 7,300 homes. We have
also been successful in securing a five-year
painting contract with Gloucester City
Homes valued at £3.0m, which will involve
painting the outside of all 4,700 of the
organisation’s homes as well as communal
areas in a number of buildings. In Essex, 
we successfully achieved a contract
extension from Thurrock Council to paint 
an additional 2,600 of their properties.
Decent Homes projects secured during 
the year include a five-year contract 
with Bracknell Forest Homes, which has 
a total value of £17.5m. This newly formed 
not-for-profit housing association owns and
manages 5,600 ex-council properties and
the contract will see us fitting new kitchens
and bathrooms in half of these homes 
as well as carrying out electrical work. 
We have secured an £8.0m Decent Homes
contract with Redbridge Homes to replace
kitchens, bathrooms, heating and electrics
in approximately 1,200 homes. 
We have also entered into a five-year ,
£12.5m Decent Homes agreement with
Knightstone Housing Association. We will 
be replacing kitchens, bathrooms, windows,
doors and central heating in approximately
3,000 Knightstone homes across the 
South and West of England. In Liverpool, 
we secured a framework contract to deliver
Decent Homes works to Liverpool Mutual
Homes where MITIE is one of eight partners
who will be allowed to bid for £350.0m of
improvement works over the next four years.
Within the government sector , we secured
a £9.0m, three-year contract with Walsall
Council to deliver response and planned
maintenance to civic buildings across the
borough. The contract will involve working
at about 800 properties in Walsall including
schools, leisure centres, libraries, museums
and other council-owned buildings, 
and will see us engaging the local supply
chain from the outset.
Earlier in the year , we succeeded in
securing several new fit-out projects 
within the ﬁnance and professional sector.
These include a £2.0m refurbishment
project for Scottish Widows at 24 Hanover
Square. The project included upgrading 
the building's infrastructure and refurbishing 
all seven floors of the building. The work
included installing new power , data and
heating and cooling systems, updating the
core areas with new lavatories and
installing a new lift as well as carrying out
decoration and floor finishes throughout.
We also secured a £3.0m interior fit-out
contract with FirstRand Bank, which will 
see us fitting out their newly consolidated
London office. This involves transforming
27,000 sq ft of the building, which includes
creating a new client reception area, 
as well as fitting out meeting, conference
and breakout areas.
As expected, we have experienced a 
slow down in some niche areas of Property
Management during the year. This has
affected both our plumbing and heating
work with new-build housing projects and
our interior fit-out work within the private
sector. Our exposure to both these areas is
minimal and in the second half of the year ,
we have focused on deploying these
transferable skills into public sector work.
Dudley Council  
As a partner to Dudley Council
delivering a cyclical interior and
exterior painting programme to help
improve its 23,000 properties, MITIE has
enabled maximum efficiency and 
use of resources for our customer by
combining interior works programmes
with exterior , focusing on exterior
painting from March to December ,
and concentrating our resources on
interior painting programmes between
December and March. Dudley Council
receives a service that doesn’t peak 
or trough, and what’s more, tenants
benefit from improved scheduling 
and a better consultation process. 
Both MITIE and Dudley Council share
office accommodation, and the
success of delivering our service 
from a joint working environment has
justified our client’s decision to invest 
in similar shared arrangements on 
all of its other partnering contracts.
Even better , our work won a ‘very
highly commended’ award from the
Painting and Decorating Association,
which speaks volumes about what 
we do.

Our Asset Management division provides
the integration, management and
maintenance of technical assets to meet
the demands of the low-carbon economy
including; energy design, generation 
and certiﬁcation, infrastructure projects,
building services and mechanical and
electrical engineering. On 1 April 2009, 
our Engineering Maintenance business 
was combined with Asset Management 
to further enhance our market proposition 
in this area.
The Asset Management division continued
its transition to a new business model 
with a lower risk work mix, resulting in 
an expected drop in revenue for the 
year of 6.4% to £281.8m (2008: £301.1m).
Operating proﬁt for the division increased
by 1.2% to £8.4m (2008: £8.3m) and
operating margins grew by 0.2% to 3.0%
(2008: 2.8%).
Results summary
Asset Management has continued 
to evolve its business during the year to 
meet the changing requirements of our
clients as they respond to government
legislation on energy generation and
carbon output. Energy performance and
efﬁciency are now evaluated on a different
set of criteria and we are working with
many clients to achieve demanding 
new objectives.
Within this context of accelerating 
change, we have made signiﬁcant
progress towards our aim of building more
long-term partnerships with our clients.
Public and private sector organisations 
alike are incorporating the drive to reduce
energy consumption within their strategic
plans for upgrading their estates, regardless
of the economic environment. Framework
agreements already in place are yielding
substantial beneﬁts for our clients and for
MITIE, and valuable new business contracts
have been secured during the year.
Our order book has decreased slightly 
to £0.2bn (2008: £0.3bn).
Organisations that support large estates 
are turning to us for our knowledge 
and expertise to help them mitigate the 
impact of legislation and comply with
measures such as the Carbon Reduction
Commitment, while optimising efﬁciency
and returns on investment. Our strength
here is being able to approach the 
project holistically, from establishing the
right energy procurement mix to designing
and integrating the electrical and
mechanical equipment. 
Asset Management operates broadly
across public and private sector markets,
ensuring a secure business base in
uncertain economic times. 
The public sector market has remained
strong and focused primarily on health 
and education. In the healthcare sector ,
we are helping our clients reduce costs,
direct more resources into their core clinical
and welfare objectives and work towards
wider NHS efﬁciency targets. 
We provided Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital
with two embedded generation systems
that will generate signiﬁcant savings by
enabling electricity to be produced on-site,
while using the waste heat for space
heating and hot water. It will also reduce
the hospital’s dependence on traditional
forms of energy supply. 
During the year we have provided 
further support on the enabling works 
for the 10-year redevelopment at 
Great Ormond Street Hospital. Again, 
we have demonstrated our effectiveness 
in providing operational continuity in 
mission critical situations. In this fully
occupied site, meticulous planning and
proactive communications are essential, 
to ensure minimum disruption to patients
and staff and complete resilience for
clinical activities. Our experience of working
in live environments has ensured that each
section of the enabling works has been
successfully achieved to tight timescales.
University Campus Suffolk
MITIE has engineered a new-build
state-of-the-art energy efficient
building for University Campus Suffolk.
The design provides energy cost
savings for the client by minimising 
the energy footprint of the building
utilising a combination of technologies
including low energy cooling systems,
intelligent lighting and a heat 
recovery system. MITIE was instrumental
in ensuring the design concept was
developed to a successful outcome
and working with the architects 
and other contractors, delivered 
the building in time for the new 
2008 university intake against a very
challenging programme. The building
was awarded an ‘excellent’ rating 
by BREEAM (Building Research
Establishment’s Environmental
Assessment Method), the leading 
and most widely used environmental
assessment method for buildings.

of an integrated team, we have established strong
relationships with the learning facilities and estates
Departments, other university staff, main contractors
and consultants making us a trusted and reliable
source of expertise. Our professionalism and
commitment to ﬁnish each project on time and 
to budget has ensured that the relationship with 
the University of Plymouth has gone from strength 
to strength with beneﬁts of our ongoing relationship
resulting in quicker response times, knowledge of
university procedures and better integration with 
all members of the team.

To date, MITIE has managed 17 projects for the
University in the last eight years with a total value 
of more than £20.0m. Our work for the University has
included heating, lighting, air conditioning, cabling,
wiring and other mechanical and electrical works.
Projects have included work on residential units and
academic buildings including the University’s striking
Roland Levinsky building.

Operating review
Think
In this fully occupied site, MITIE has demonstrated 
its effectiveness in providing operational continuity 
in mission critical situations. Meticulous planning 
and proactive communications have been 
essential to ensure minimum disruption to patients
and staff and complete resilience for clinical
activities. Our experience of working in live
environments has ensured that each section 
of the projects that we have undertaken has 
been successfully achieved to tight timescales.
Manage 
Working at height, the projects have involved 
large crane lifts of heavy equipment into and 
out of the centre of the site, and MITIE has 
worked closely with the GOSH Estates department 
and the hospital’s project consultants to minimise 
the impact of these and all other activities on the 
daily operation of the hospital.  
Deliver
The engineering projects that MITIE has delivered 
to GOSH include chiller replacements, infrastructure
works and other work totalling more than £6.2m.
Added to this, MITIE also provides the cleaning in 
the hospital and event services within the hospital’s
roof garden.
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH)
MITIE provides a range of services

Sainsbury’s  
MITIE has helped Sainsbury’s to pilot
new ways to reduce the retailer’s
carbon footprint at its new store on 
the outskirts of Dartmouth by installing
two quiet revolution wind turbines 
that will provide renewable energy 
that will be used on-site. The store has 
been specifically designed to reduce
the amount of CO2 emitted into the
atmosphere and it is expected to 
save about a third on its energy bills.
In the education sector , we are working
with schools, colleges and universities to
upgrade existing facilities and develop 
new ones. Two of our projects, at University
Campus Suffolk and Penryn College in
Cornwall, have been awarded an Excellent
BREEAM rating – the world’s most widely
used environmental assessment method 
for buildings. The technologies deployed 
to achieve this include biomass boilers, 
solar hot water collection, rainwater
recovery and wind turbines. At Barnet
College, a ground-source system is now
bringing natural heat from 100 metres
below the earth’s surface. Under our
ongoing framework agreement with the
University of Plymouth, three prestigious new
buildings were completed in 2008, two of
them general academic buildings and the
third an accommodation block, together
with substantial refurbishment works. 
We continued to undertake a large
amount of work in the government sector.
Debut, Regional Prime Contractor in the
South West for Defence Estates, has
responsibility for the delivery of novel and
complex capital works projects through
their supply chain partner. We have been
working under this framework agreement
for over ﬁve years and continue to
undertake a variety of large projects
characterised by highly collaborative
methods and a pricing structure that
provides certainty for each project for 
all concerned.
The private sector market has been
affected by the economic downturn but,
despite this, MITIE has continued to develop
its business. Property owners and occupiers,
driven by changing legislation, are focusing
on the need to develop new models for
managing their estates and on ways to
redirect capital expenditure away from
non-core activities. We are providing
innovative solutions that will deliver greater
returns on investment through major gains
in efﬁciency that will also meet government
targets on energy and carbon. 
At 200 Aldersgate, a challenging City site
comprising two linked blocks on a major
roundabout at the end of London Wall, 
we are providing infrastructure
refurbishment, Category A ﬁt-out and the
replacement of 19 separate plant areas. 
This year we have undertaken further 
work in the ﬁnance and professional sector
for Standard Life Investments, a client that
MITIE works with across all three divisions. 
In planning their new ofﬁce in Guildford, 
the company employed us to develop a
bespoke energy solution that would meet
government legislation that at least 10% 
of all new buildings’ energy should come
from renewable sources. We evaluated 
the potential of numerous technologies 
to achieve the necessary compliance,
optimise efﬁciency and provide a sensible
pay back period within the life cycle
model. The ground-source system we
speciﬁed delivers substantial savings against
a traditional system of a similar scale. 
In technology and infrastructure, we have
extended into framework agreements 
with several major banking institutions and
continue to work with data centre owners
and operators within the technology and
communications sector. Some of our
projects involve providing huge amounts of
resilient power and cooling to data centre
spaces, for clients including Global Switch.
The work we undertake is targeted at
increasing the effective use of power and
providing continuity and stability for critical
data systems in the most efﬁcient and
sustainable way. 
Our work with EDF Energy in the utilities sector
has successfully demonstrated our expertise
in the management of energy. MITIE has
established a strategic partnership with 
EDF Energy, one of the UK’s largest energy
companies, to assist them in developing
embedded, on-site electricity generation
schemes to meet the obligations of the
Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT).
This came into effect in April 2008 and
requires suppliers to help redirect energy
generation away from national networks 
to local schemes. In addition, we extended
our involvement in the provision of 
efficient energy generation by securing 
a partnership to distribute and deploy
Proven wind turbines.

Financial review
MITIE has delivered another set of strong
results for the year , building on our 21-year
track record of growth. Our business 
model continues to show resilience despite
economic uncertainties and our earnings
continue to be backed by solid cash flows
and good future visibility.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
MITIE is committed to delivering sustainable
profitable growth which consistently 
delivers stakeholder value. Our results have
reflected this through year-on-year growth
in revenues, earnings and dividends over 
a 21-year period and our strategy is geared
to ensure this continues. 
We have carefully selected our financial
KPIs to ensure that the overall financial
performance of the Group is measured,
reported and aligned to our strategy. 
Our financial KPIs focus on the level and
quality of our earnings and cash flows, 
the control of capital expenditure and the
sustainability of dividends. The Group has
performed strongly against these measures
during this and previous years and we 
are satisfied that the historic trends in 
our KPI performance demonstrate our
continued commitment to a profitable 
and sustainable business model.
We are pleased to report another 
year of double-digit earnings and
dividend growth.

Sustainable profitable growth 
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2009
increased by 8.2% to £1,521.9m. Our revenue
streams are supported by a diverse portfolio
of clients, exposure to a wide industry 
sector base and supported by a strong
order book which now stands at £4.9bn.
Looking forward, revenue for the year
ended 31 March 2010 is now 74% secured
(2008: 78%).
Operating profit before amortisation 
of acquisition related intangible assets
(EBITA) increased by 11.5% to £80.5m 
(2008: £72.2m). We monitor and manage
EBITA profit margins for the Group as one of
our financial KPIs and are pleased to report
an increase in the Group’s EBITA margin 
to 5.3% (2008: 5.1%) in the year. This reflects
the strengthening of margins in Property
Management to 6.0% (2008: 5.3%) and
Asset Management to 3.0% (2008: 2.8%)
offset by a small reduction in Facilities
Management to 5.8% (2008: 6.0%) 
where we have enhanced investment 
in our business development capabilities 
in that area.
The charge in respect of the amortisation 
of intangible assets arising on acquisitions
remains consistent with the prior year at
£1.9m (2008: £1.9m) reflecting the absence
of acquisitions in the year. Operating profit
after the amortisation of intangibles relating
to acquisitions was £78.6m (2008: £70.3m).
Investment and finance charges for the
year increased to £2.7m (2008: £2.4m). 
This charge includes the non-cash finance
charges of £0.6m (2008: £0.8m) relating to
the unwinding of the discounted deferred
contingent consideration in respect of
acquisitions made in prior years and £0.6m
(2008: nil) in respect of the mark to market
of three callable interest rate swaps.
Excluding the non-cash finance charges,
investment and finance charges for the
year reduced to £1.5m (2008: £1.6m).
The tax charge for the year was £21.5m
(2008: £20.6m) representing an effective
rate of tax on our profit on continuing
operations of 28.3% (2008: 30.3%). 
These results generated profit after tax 
for the year of £54.4m (2008: £47.3m), 
an increase of 15.0% on the prior year. 
After minority interest charges of £1.3m
(2008: £2.3m), £53.1m (2008: £45.0m) 
is attributable to the shareholders of 
MITIE Group PLC.
Cash flow and liquidity
The underlying cash performance of the
Group remains excellent and is a key focus
area for our financial and operational
teams around the Group.
The conversion of EBITDA to cash is a
financial KPI for the Group. In the year
ended 31 March 2009, we converted 
97.5% of our EBITDA to cash (2008: 90.3%),
continuing our track record of consistently
achieving our KPI target level of 90%. 
Strong operating cash of £94.4m, up 20.7%
on the prior year has helped to reduce 
our net debt. At 31 March 2009, we had 
no net debt (2008: £15.6m), and instead
held net funds of £10.9m comprising cash
balances of £28.5m (2008: £42.6m), loans 
of £10.0m (2008: £50.0m) and loan notes
and obligations under finance leases of
£7.6m (2008: £8.2m). Deposits held by our
captive reinsurance company which are
not readily available to the Group but 
are included in our cash balance totalled
£7.3m (2008: £12.4m) at 31 March 2009.
The Group’s committed banking facility,
which expires in January 2012, remains
unchanged from the prior year end at
£230.0m. The principal covenants in respect
of this facility require that the maximum
level of debt must not exceed 3.5 times
EBITDA and that the minimum profit to
interest cover ratio for the Group is 3:1. 
The Group has operated within these
covenants throughout the year. 
The average borrowing rate on drawn
funds under the facility during the year 
was LIBOR + 40 basis points. Our overdraft
facilities total £35.0m (2008: £40.0m).
Stakeholder value
Our track record of delivering stakeholder
value through earnings and dividend
growth continued this year with basic 
EPS before other items increasing by 15.4%
to 17.2p per share (2008: 14.9p per share).
Basic EPS before acquisition-related
amortisation increased by 16.3% to 17.1p
per share (2008: 14.7p per share) while
basic EPS was 16.7p per share (2008: 14.3p
per share), an increase of 16.8%. Our fully
diluted basic EPS measure rose to 16.5p 
per share (2008: 14.1p per share).
Our basic EPS result continues to support
our commitment to dividend growth in line
with our adjusted earnings per Ordinary
share after excluding other items. This policy
ensures that our dividends continue to 
track our underlying earnings and are 
not distorted by non-cash accounting
adjustments relating to amortisation and
imputed finance charges arising from
acquisitions. This has resulted in a full year
dividend of 6.9p per share (2008: 6.0p per
share), an increase of 15.0% for the year
and reflects a dividend cover of 2.5 times
on our adjusted EPS measure. Our final
dividend for the year ended 31 March 
2009 will be paid, subject to shareholder
approval, on 7 August 2009 to shareholders
on the register as at 10 July 2009.
Pensions
The strength of our balance sheet 
and hence our future financial stability 
is supported further by the strength of 
our pension scheme funding despite the
significant recent decline in pension asset
values. This places the Group in a position 
of strength in the market. During the year ,
we completed the triennial valuation 
of the Group’s own defined benefit pension
scheme which was scheduled to take
place as at 31 March 2008. No material
actuarial surplus or deficit arose on the
completion of this valuation.
13012_R&A08_p28-35.qxd:Layout 1  28/5/09  12:15  Page 29 MITIE Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
The net position of all the pension schemes
included on the Group’s balance sheet 
is a small net deficit of £0.4m (2008: £7.5m
surplus). The main MITIE Group defined
benefit scheme continued to show 
a small surplus of £3.0m (2008: £9.9m). 
The Group also contributes to a 
number of defined contribution pension
schemes as well as making contributions 
to its customers’ defined benefit 
pension schemes under Admitted Body
Local Government status and other
arrangements in respect of certain
employees who have transferred to the
Group under TUPE. The Group’s defined
benefit pension obligations in respect 
of schemes in which the Group is
committed to funding amounted 
to £3.4m (2008: £2.4m).
Employee incentivisation
MITIE is a people business and it is 
essential that we continue to offer structures
that allow our management teams to
participate in the success of the Group
which in turn delivers value to our
stakeholders. The opportunity for certain 
of our management teams to own an
equity stake in some of our subsidiary
businesses has been key to the success 
of the Group. 
This year we elected to acquire some 
or all of the minority interests in the equity
share capital of seven of our subsidiaries.
The total maximum consideration payable
in respect of these acquisitions is £13.3m,
being satisfied by £0.9m in cash and £10.0m
by the issue of 4.6 million new 2.5p Ordinary
shares valued at 218.75p per share. 
The balance of £2.4m of the consideration
is deferred and will be paid in new MITIE
shares by 30 September 2010 subject to 
the attainment of specified profit targets 
by the relevant companies in the financial
years to 31 March 2010. 
In addition, we settled deferred
consideration totalling £0.5m in respect 
of the acquisition last year of part of the
minority shareholdings in MITIE Technology
& Infrastructure Limited which was satisfied
by the issue of 0.2 million new MITIE shares.
£0.7m of deferred consideration in respect
of the purchase last year of Catering
Partnership Holdings Limited was settled 
in cash. During the year £1.2m of loan notes
in respect of the acquisition of MITIE Pest
Control Limited (formerly Eagle Pest Control
Services UK Limited) were also redeemed.
Summary
MITIE has delivered another set of strong
results for the year , building on our 21-year
track record of growth. Our business model
continues to show resilience despite
economic uncertainties and our earnings
continue to be backed by solid cash flows
and good future visibility.
We retain our focus on growth going
forward, and will utilise our financial 
strength to support that growth objective
be it acquisitive, organic or through 
the use of our start-up model. Overall, 
our balance sheet is strong, and with low
gearing and committed facilities we have
a sound platform for future sustainable
profitable growth.

Corporate responsibility
MITIE Group PLC endorses the Business for
Social Responsibility deﬁnition of Corporate
Responsibility as; ‘achieving commercial
success in ways that honour ethical 
values and respect people, communities,
and the natural environment.’ The national
recognition we have received and the
numerous achievement awards we have
won to date demonstrate our commitment
to implementing CR.
Stakeholder engagement is central 
to our CR practices; motivating and
rewarding our people, working with clients,
developing a responsible and proﬁtable
business for investors, and interacting with
local communities.
We are proud of our public profile in 
CR and are particularly pleased to have
increased our score of 81.5% and retained
our Silver status in the Business in the
Community (BitC)/Financial Times
Companies that Count index. We are
pleased to announce that our Real
Apprentice scheme and Construction 
Skills Centres have also been reaccredited
in The BitC Big Tick Awards for Excellence
2009. Our 2009 report on CR activities has
been published and is available on our
website at www.mitie.co.uk.
The key CR (social, economic, ethical 
and environmental) business risks and 
the material impact that these may 
have on the business have been 
identiﬁed and assessed. MITIE has carefully
considered these risks and has realised
opportunities and implemented initiatives 
to mitigate them.
Health and safety
We recognise that for effective
management of health and safety 
to occur throughout MITIE, ownership 
and engagement begins at the highest
level. Responsibility for health and safety 
is led at main board level by Ruby
McGregor-Smith, Chief Executive. 
Ruby is supported by the management
team of each business, MITIE’s Head of
Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), 
and a network of experienced and
dedicated HSE professionals. 
During the year we commenced the first 
phase of a health and safety leadership
programme aimed at enhancing the
knowledge of MITIE’s senior managers 
in modern health and safety risk
management. The first phase of the
programme was targeted at the operating
board of each MITIE business. 117 senior
managers have since taken part in the
workshops; actively participating and
committing to an improved re-focus 
on risk management. Our significant
investment of time and resource in this 
area is a demonstration of our commitment
to achieving continual improvement in
health and safety management.
Effective management systems
We are wholly committed to improving 
our health and safety performance 
via a management system approach. 
To this end it is a requirement for every MITIE
business to be certified to the internationally
recognised standard for health and safety
management systems – OHSAS 18001.
During the year , our Property Management
division achieved certification in full to
OHSAS 18001 and, in addition, two newly
acquired businesses (one in Property
Management, the other in our catering
business) were subject to a rigorous
integration programme into the health 
and safety management system. Both new
businesses achieved certification to OHSAS
18001 during April 2009. We are happy to
report that 98% of MITIE businesses have
now achieved 18001 certification.
We are pleased to have retained 
our Silver status in the BitC/Financial
Times Companies that Count index
with a score of 81.5%.

Health and Safety training
At MITIE our people are our greatest asset,
and as such we place the highest priority 
in ensuring our people have the right
competencies to carry out their work safely.
We have developed a prioritised approach
to managing health and safety risks, 
with significant training focus and resource
directed at key risks to the business, such 
as work at height, occupational road 
risk, slips and trips and manual handling. 
Our formal training programmes in support

People
MITIE is dedicated to implementing a
comprehensive and proactive Human
Resources strategy with policies to ensure
that all employees are treated equally,
fairly and in a responsible manner. 
We’re committed to providing an
environment that enables our people 
to reach their full potential. 
Employee development and training is
essential for us to maintain our competitive
edge in our challenging market sectors. 
We offer a comprehensive range of career
and personal development programmes. 
During the year we spent over £3.4m 
on training courses providing over 35,000
delegate days across 445 different courses.
Our training centre at Frimley Green, 
Surrey was used on 200 days during the
same period, hosting training courses 
and meetings for over 2,600 people
including six Corporate Responsibility
Awareness seminars.
Skills Pledge
In our Corporate Responsibility report 
2008 we reported our commitment 
to the UK Government’s Skills Pledge. 
Over the past year we’ve established 
a dedicated Skills Pledge team drawing 
on the knowledge and expertise of our 
HR, Training, and Communications
specialists from across MITIE. The team
has developed the framework, established
the relationships, and implemented the 
policies to offer our people some excellent
learning and development opportunities. 
MITIE’s Facilities Management division 
is the first to implement the Skills Pledge.
Working in conjunction with our delivery
partner Jigsaw Training, we now offer 
our people a number of Skills for Life 
courses to help them brush up on their
Maths and English skills, as well as access 
to National vocational qualifications 
(NVQs) and apprenticeships. 
Our challenging target is to deliver 
8,700 National V ocational Qualifications 
by 2012. This investment will enable 
us to have a better skilled and qualified
workforce, bringing tangible business
benefits and competitive advantage 
as well as enhancing the literacy,
numeracy and employability potential 
of our people.
Talent management
Our award-winning Real Apprentice
Scheme is now in its fourth year and has
recently been reaccredited in the BitC
Awards for Excellence 2009. In the last 
four years, the scheme has also won the
2006 Premises and Facilities Management 
(PFM) Partners with People Award and 
the Greater London Training Award. 
In particular , we’re very proud that four 
of the original seven apprentices who
joined MITIE following the pilot scheme 
in 2005 are still with us today. 
The Real Apprentice scheme has 
an 80% retention rate after six months’
employment. The 77th apprentice to
successfully complete the programme 
has recently been offered a full-time job
with us. The East London Business Alliance
now cites the scheme as a blueprint 
for other employers to follow and has 
rolled out Real Apprentice programmes
with ten other employers across three 
East London boroughs.
MITIE respects the rights of its people 
and those of our supply chain partners 
by endorsing the tenets of the International
Labour Organisation Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work and the Ethical Trading Initiative 
‘Base Code’. Our investment and
commitment to equality and diversity 
has increased signiﬁcantly during the 
past year and will continue to develop as
we implement new initiatives and training
opportunities to support our people. 
Service delivery
MITIE is committed to proactively
developing mutually beneﬁcial trading
relationships and promoting corporate
responsibility with our commercial
stakeholders, based upon a foundation 
of trust and co-operation. 
In 2007, we established a Supplier
Improvement Programme to ensure that
our signiﬁcant suppliers are aligned with 
our CR principles and are accountable 
for their own supply chains. The supplier
improvement programme includes CR
audit reviews of signiﬁcant suppliers
undertaken by professionals from our
Sustainable Procurement Forum. This has
proven to be invaluable in sharing best
practice and also in identifying areas 
where room for further improvement 
can be made.
MITIE’s Sustainable Procurement Forum 
was established to:
– Adopt and share best practice
purchasing and supply standards;
– Develop mutually beneﬁcial collaborative
trading relationships; and
– Promote sustainable and ethical 
trading practices.
Our clients expect us to be able to
demonstrate high levels of CR performance
and because of our commitment to 
CR, we are able to respond positively to
their increasingly tougher prequaliﬁcation
and tender requirements. We also utilise 
our considerable environmental
experience and capabilities by providing
sustainability related guidance for our
clients, helping them to reduce their
carbon footprint.

Corporate responsibility
Environment
We are aware of the impact that our
business operations may have on the
natural environment and we endeavour 
to minimise and mitigate such effects
where possible by utilising environmentally
benign materials and practices. We respect
our environment and share best practice
with all of our stakeholders as we strive to
achieve our environmental targets.
Vehicle fleet management
Between April 2008 and March 2009 we
have purchased 150 low CO2, emission, 
fuel efficient vehicles as part of our vehicle
replacement programme – helping to
decrease the impact on the environment.
We have achieved our aim to reduce 
our average vehicle fleet CO2 to below
160 CO2 g/km. Our fleet average emissions
for 2009 are nearly 4% lower at 154 CO2 g/km. 
This has seen a reduction of around 14% 
in CO2 emissions compared to the vehicles
they replaced. 
We will continue to reduce the average
vehicle fleet CO2 emissions by purchasing
another 100 low emission vehicles as 
part of our replacement programme 
and by investing in on-board telematic
tracker systems.
We constantly seek to improve the
environmental performance of our vehicle
fleet by investigating alternative fuels and
lower emission engine types. 
V ehicle fleet fuel consumption accounts 
for around 90% of our CO2 emissions and
improvements in fleet management to
reduce this impact have been prioritised
with immediate improvements realised.
New fleet vehicles purchased have 
the latest Euro V compliant engines and
lower emissions ratings. Changes to fuel
procurement, the introduction of car
sharing schemes and the installation of
telematic vehicle trackers to optimise 
travel distances have reduced fuel
consumption and emissions. 
During the year we also made further
investments in telephone and video
conferencing facilities to help reduce
business related travel.
Sustainability strategy 
MITIE is a member of the Renewable Energy
Certification Scheme, British Wind Energy

Community
MITIE’s community investment strategy 
is not simply about making financial
donations to causes and charities. 
We pride ourselves on committing our 
time, resources and specialist skills to
supporting the communities we serve. 
In return we create long-term 
relationships with future MITIE clients,
suppliers and employees.
At the cornerstone of MITIE’s community
investment strategy is our extensive
volunteering programme. During the 
year professionals from every level of 
MITIE participated in seven World of 
Work days across the UK. The days are 
a great way to share our experiences,
knowledge and offer advice to the 
bright young minds of the future, 
all while raising the profile of our business
and promoting career opportunities 
with MITIE to people from a diverse 
range of backgrounds.
During the year our people participated 
in seven World of Work events at schools
throughout the UK; a number of schools,
including Stoke Newington School, 
are home to MITIE’s Constructions Skills
Centres where we offer vocational 
training to pupils. “MITIE’s volunteers 
always go above and beyond the 
call of duty. The pupils find their passion
infectious and they play an integral role 
in showing them that there is a whole 
world of jobs out there for the taking”, 
Les Prior , Work Related Learning Project
Officer , Ealing and Hillingdon Education
Business Partnership.
Research underpins our own experiences
that clear business benefits result 
from employee supported volunteer
programmes. Clients increasingly expect
their suppliers to ‘add value’ above 
and beyond their contracted service
commitments and our community
investment programme is clearly 
able to demonstrate that we do this.
In total, we spent 458 days on volunteering
projects during the year.
Construction Skills Centres
MITIE’s Construction Skills Centres at seven
schools throughout the UK are providing
craft skills and vocational education to
about 500 students each year – significantly
improving their employment prospects. 
We were proud to host a ‘Seeing is
Believing’ visit at our Skills Centre at Castle
V ale School, Birmingham in 2008. This event
demonstrated the value of employer
engagement and helped to increase
understanding of social issues among
business leaders and educationalists. 
The Skills Centre visit inspired action by
encouraging other business leaders to 
work together to address serious issues
facing society such as skills shortages 
and low aspiration levels. Our example 
was commended by HRH Prince Charles 
at St. James Palace in February 2009.
We feel our direction echoes the BitC
statement: ‘Education, employability 
and economic renewal are serious issues
across the UK which impact on both
business and society. They need to be top
of the corporate agenda – it’s never been 
more important’.

charities (21.7%) and match-funding (57.5%) respectively are the most notable differences reported for this period.
Our actions speak louder than words and we’re committed to embedding our corporate responsibilities into everyday operations,
policies, procedures and practices, while remaining true to the core MITIE value that defines the business: providing opportunities for
people to develop to their full potential.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ and governance report
Introduction
The Directors submit their report together with the audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the MITIE group of companies (Group)
for the year ended 31 March 2009. The Directors’ and governance report is comprised of the Directors’ report, the corporate governance
report, the report of the Audit Committee, the Directors’ responsibility statement, all other parts of this Annual Report and Accounts
and those documents that are referred to within this report and are available at www. mitie.co.uk/investors_corporate-governance.
Compliance with the Code
The Board recognises that the manner in which the Group is governed is critical to the long-term success of the business and 
is committed to the principles of corporate governance, for which the Board is accountable to shareholders, as detailed in the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (Code). This report, together
with the Directors’ Remuneration Report, provides details of key aspects of MITIE’s corporate governance environment and explains
the manner in which the Board has applied the principles and provisions of good governance as set out in Section 1 of the Code. 
The Board conﬁrms that throughout the year ended 31 March 2009 the Group has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 
of the Code with the exception that:
– the Board did not consist of at least an equal number of independent Non-Executive and Executive Directors (Code A.3.2) between
1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009 – further details relating to this non-compliance are provided on page 39 – this non-conformance will
be rectiﬁed upon the appointment of Terry Morgan; and,
– the Audit Committee did not consist of at least 3 independent Non-Executive Directors (Code C.3.1) between 31 July 2008 and 
31 March 2009 – further details relating to this non-compliance are provided on page 42 – this non-conformance will be rectiﬁed
upon the appointment of Terry Morgan; 
– the Nomination Committee did not consist of a majority of independent non-executive directors (Code A.4.1) between 31 July 2008
and 31 March 2009 if the Chairman is included in such calculation – further details relating to this non-compliance are provided on
page 41.
These non-compliances have principally arisen following the retirements of David Ord and Cullum McAlpine as Directors of the
Company and the appointment of Roger Matthews to the role of Chairman (having previously been an independent Non-Executive
Director). During the reporting period the Board has been conducting an extensive search for an additional Non-Executive Director
and is pleased to announce that Terry Morgan will be joining the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2009.
Further details of this search process and appointment are given on page 39.
Basis of report
This report (together with the other parts of this Annual Report and Accounts and other documents incorporated by reference) has
been prepared, and is published, in accordance with, and in reliance upon, applicable English company law and the liabilities of 
the Directors in relation to this report are subject to the limitations provided by such law.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ and governance report
Business review
Principal activities
MITIE Group PLC (the Company) is the holding company of the Group. The principal activity of the Company is to provide
management services to the Group. The Group’s activities are focused on the provision of strategic outsourcing and asset
management services in support of the buildings, facilities and infrastructure of its clients. Further details of the subsidiary 
undertakings of the Company principally affecting the proﬁts or net assets of the Group in the reporting period are listed in 
Note 36 to the ﬁnancial statements. 
Business review
The Company is required to set out a fair review of the business of the Group during the reporting period (including an analysis of 
the position of the Group at the end of the reporting period and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group). Details of 
this review are contained in this Directors and Governance Report and the following sections of this Annual Report and Accounts: 
– the Chairman’s statement on page 5; 
– the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 to 11; 
– the operating review (including the statement of principal risks and uncertainties) on pages 14 to 27; and
– the ﬁnancial review on pages 28 to 30.
Proﬁt and dividends
The proﬁt before taxation for the ﬁnancial year is £75.9m (2008: £67.9m). The Directors have declared / recommended dividends 
as follows:
– paid (on 5 February 2009) an interim dividend of 3.3p per Ordinary share £10.7m
– recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 3.6p per Ordinary share £11.6m 
– total Ordinary dividend 6.9p per share (2008: 6.0p) £22.3m
The ﬁnal dividend, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, will be paid on 7 August 2009 to ordinary shareholders on the register
on 10 July 2009. The Company operates a Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP). 
Going concern
The Directors acknowledge the Financial Reporting Council guidance on going concern issued in November 2008. The Group beneﬁts
from a well diversiﬁed portfolio of service offerings providing stability in the current economic climate. In addition the Group has a
broad, diverse customer base with a good balance between public and private sectors underpinned by a large number of long-term
contracts contributing to a forward order book of £4.9bn. MITIE beneﬁts from a very strong balance sheet; the Group has available
£230.0m of committed funding lines, of which £220.0m remained undrawn at 31 March 2009, which are not renewable until 2012 and
the Group currently operates well within the ﬁnancial covenants associated with this facility. As a consequence, the Directors believe
that the Group is well placed to manage its business risk successfully and accordingly the Group continues to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing its annual report and accounts.
Corporate governance
Board of Directors
The membership of the Board as at 31 March 2009 and biographical details of the Directors (including details of committee
chairmanships and other positions held) are given on pages 36 and 37. During the year two Non-Executive Directors retired from 
the Board (David Ord and Cullum McAlpine). David Ord was succeeded as Chairman by Roger Matthews (a Non-Executive Director
of the Company since December 2006) on 31 July 2008. Roger Matthews consequently stepped down from the Audit Committee.
Cullum McAlpine was succeeded as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and as Chairman of the Audit Committee by 
David Jenkins on 31 July 2008. David Jenkins consequently stepped down as Chairman of the Nomination Committee and was
replaced by Roger Matthews. These retirements and Board changes occurred in accordance with the Board’s pre-existing orderly
succession planning. 
Directors are appointed and may be removed in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and the provisions 
of the Companies Acts. All Directors are subject to re-election at intervals of no more than three years in accordance with the Articles
of Association and the Code. The Notice of AGM contains details of those Directors who are retiring by rotation and are proposed for
re-election. As part of the formal Board evaluation, the Board has considered the performance of each Director seeking re-election
and is satisﬁed that they continue to be effective and demonstrate clear commitment to their role.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Governance
Director independence
During the year , Non-Executive Director independence was considered by the Board. The Board determined that all Non-Executive
Directors as at 31 March 2009, with the exception of the Deputy Chairman Ian Stewart, were independent in mind and judgement,
and free from any material relationship that could interfere with their ability to discharge their duties effectively. Speciﬁc consideration
was given to David Jenkins’ prior role with Deloitte LLP (previously Deloitte & Touche LLP), MITIE’s external auditors. The Board
determined that David is independent given that he had not been involved in the provision of services to MITIE and the passage 
of time since his departure from Deloitte LLP.
Board and committee composition and balance
As part of the ongoing review of Board performance (as set out below) the Nomination Committee and the Board speciﬁcally
reviewed the roles of Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director , and the composition and chairmanship of each of 
its committees. The Board and the Nomination Committee recognised that, partly as a result of the changes in Board composition
detailed above, there was an imbalance in the number of non-independent Directors and independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board was broadly satisﬁed that its composition was appropriate having regard in particular to the integrity, skills, knowledge and
experience of its Directors and the size and nature of the business, and having regard to its desire that the Board does not become too
large and unwieldy. However , it was mindful of the need to maintain a balanced board and consequently announced the initiation of
a search process for an additional independent Non-Executive Director to serve on the Board and the Audit Committee. The
Nomination Committee reviewed the skills, knowledge and experience required to ﬁll this additional position and provided a detailed
speciﬁcation to the external search consultancy engaged to conduct the search process. This detailed search process 
was concluded on 30 March 2009 when the Board was pleased to announce that Terry Morgan will be joining the Board as an
independent Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2009. Terry will serve on the Audit Committee and will Chair the Remuneration Committee
with effect from 10 July 2009. Further details in relation to Terry Morgan are provided in the notes to the Notice of AGM. Following Terry’s
appointment the board will consist of four independent Non-Executive Directors, a Non-Executive Director deemed non-independent
as a result of his prior role as CEO of the Group, the Non-Executive Chairman and four Executive Directors. This will 
not result in absolute compliance with Code A.3.2 of the Combined Code and whilst the Board remains broadly satisﬁed with the
composition and balance following Terry’s appointment, it will continue to keep the matter under careful review. 
Director appointment, induction and training
The Board has a general policy that: all new Directors are subject to election by the shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM after their
appointment; that each new Director receives a tailored induction suitable to their role; and, that all new Directors receive a tailored
information pack which includes a copy of MITIE’s Memorandum and Articles of Association, latest Annual Report and Accounts,
committee terms of reference and copies of recent Board minutes and supporting papers. 
Review of Board performance
The Board is committed to effective and rigorous review of its performance and that of the committees and individual Directors and
accordingly a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its committees and of each Director is performed
annually. Director performance evaluation for the current year has been carried out using a combination of formal appraisal
questionnaires completed by all Board members and through informal meetings and discussions. The results of these reviews are
reported to the Board and used to improve the Board’s performance. Results of the prior year appraisal process identiﬁed an overall
level of satisfaction with the performance of the Board and that of its committees and Directors. Notwithstanding this, several further
improvements in board operation have been implemented during the reporting year including the restructuring of reporting format
and content, the greater use of board brieﬁngs by non-Director executive board members, and the rotation of Board meetings around
various Group operational locations.
Directors’ interests and rights
Details of the beneﬁcial and non-beneﬁcial interests (including share options) of each Director and connected persons in the Ordinary
share capital of the Company are provided in the Remuneration Report. None of the Executive or Non-Executive Directors has a
service contract with a notice period greater than 12 months. All Directors have access to management and the operating businesses
of MITIE at their request and have secure remote access to Board and other relevant papers held on a dedicated online facility.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company maintains Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance providing appropriate cover for any legal action brought against 
its Directors and/or ofﬁcers. The 2007 AGM approved various amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the
Company to extend the protection provided to Directors in respect of any litigation against Directors relating to their position as a
Director of the Company. These changes were made possible by recent amendments to company law. The amended Memorandum
and Articles of Association speciﬁcally provide that the Company may indemnify Directors against any liability incurred in connection
with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company and that the Company may fund defence
costs. Individual Directors would still be liable to pay damages awarded to the Company in any action against them by the Company
and to repay their defence costs (to the extent funded by the Company) if their defence was unsuccessful.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Director conﬂicts
The Board has a formal policy on the declaration and management of director conﬂicts in accordance with the amendments to the
Articles of Association approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM. Any potential situation or transactional conﬂict must be reported as
soon as possible to the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary. Where a potential conﬂict is authorised (under the
statutory powers and powers granted under the Articles of Association to the Board), such conﬂict is kept under ongoing review.
Board responsibility
Matters that are exclusively dealt with by the Board include: setting Group objectives and strategies; approving business plans and
budgets and monitoring performance against these; approving material tenders, acquisitions, disposals, and business start-ups;
approving the Group’s Half-yearly and Annual Report and Accounts; appointing and removing the Chairman, Directors and
Company Secretary; and monitoring the Group’s corporate governance arrangements. These matters are set out in a schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board which was approved by the Board on 19 March 2009 and which is available at 
www.mitie.co.uk/investors_corporate-governance.
Chairman and Chief Executive: division of responsibility
There is a clear division between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive as formally set out in the terms of reference for each of
these roles. These terms of reference have been reviewed as part of the review of the job speciﬁcation of the Chairman. The Chairman
is responsible for the effective running of the Board. This includes ensuring that the Non-Executive Directors contribute effectively 
and that the Board is aware of the views of major shareholders. He is also responsible for ensuring that the Board addresses major
challenges faced by MITIE and for the effective performance of the Board and its committees. The Chairman is available to consult
with shareholders throughout the year and will be available at the AGM. The Chief Executive is responsible for all aspects of the
operation and management of the Group and its business within the authorities delegated by the Board.
The role of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors
The Executive Directors are collectively responsible for proposing strategy and for making and implementing operational decisions.
Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising their independent skill and judgement and contributing to the formulation 
of strategy, policy and decision making. The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors’ and the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered ofﬁce, the head ofﬁce and at the AGM. The Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director is available to shareholders should they have concerns which have not been resolved through the normal
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance Director or for which such contact is inappropriate in the circumstances.
External appointments and commitments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept appointments outside the Group providing permission is sought from the Chairman and
the Chief Executive and that the additional appointments do not interfere with the Directors’ ability to effectively discharge their duties.
The commitments outside the Group of the Executive Directors are detailed in the remuneration report on page 58. Executive Directors
are entitled to retain any fees earned from these external appointments.
Board meetings
Directors are supplied with an agenda and supporting papers for all Board meetings on a timely basis. This ensures that each Director 
is appropriately briefed and able to properly discharge their duties. Papers submitted regularly for the Board’s review include reports
on: current trading and performance; corporate development activities; health and safety; and, matters relating to corporate
governance. The Board will also receive, from time to time, detailed presentations from non-Board members on operational 
matters. The Board, its committees and its Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and, where
appropriate, external independent legal advice funded by MITIE. In addition to scheduled Board and committee meetings during 
the year , the Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors on several occasions without the Executive Directors being present.

All Directors are expected, where possible, to attend all Board meetings and the AGM. During the year ended 31 March 2009, 
there were 6 scheduled Board meetings. Additional unscheduled Board meetings were held to deal with administrative matters,
predominantly for the approval of the issue of shares. Dedicated budget review meetings have also been held. Directors’ attendance

The Board has four formally constituted committees: the Audit Committee; the Executive Committee; the Nomination Committee; 
and the Remuneration Committee. The duties and responsibilities of each committee are set out in its terms of reference which are
available at www. mitie.co.uk/investors_corporate-governance. Further details in relation to the composition, role and functioning of
each committee are set out below. In addition the Group operates an Executive Board. It is not a formally constituted committee of
the Board, operating solely under the delegated powers of the Chief Executive, but is charged with supporting the Chief Executive in
the operational management of the Group. 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee members are Ruby McGregor-Smith; Suzanne Baxter; Roger Goodman and Bill Robson. It functions primarily
as an approval and signing committee and meets on an ad hoc basis, as and when required, with powers speciﬁcally delegated to it
on a case by case basis by the Board in respect of speciﬁc matters.
Nomination Committee
As at 18 May 2009, the members of the committee are: Roger Matthews (committee Chairman); Ishbel Macpherson; David Jenkins;
and Ruby McGregor-Smith. During the year the Nomination Committee’s members were: David Jenkins and Ishbel Macpherson, both
of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors; Cullum McAlpine who was an independent Non-Executive Director prior to his
retirement as a Director; David Ord, who was the Chairman prior to his retirement as a Director; and Ruby McGregor-Smith, who is 
a non-independent Executive Director. The committee is compliant with the Code in that throughout the reporting period there has
been a majority of independent directors if the Chairman is excluded for the purposes of this calculation. If the Chairman is included,
and deemed non-independent, for the purposes of this calculation then the committee was not compliant with Code A.4.1 for 
the period from 31 July 2008 to 31 March 2009. During the year four meetings of the committee took place. A key function of the
committee is to evaluate the balance and composition of the Board and ensure that new Directors bring the requisite skills, knowledge
and experience required for the role being considered. During the year the committee oversaw the Board succession planning as
described more fully above.

Remuneration Committee
As at 18 May 2009, the members of the committee are: Ishbel Macpherson (committee Chairman); David Jenkins; Roger Matthews;
and Graeme Potts. During the year the Remuneration Committee’s members were Ishbel Macpherson; David Jenkins and Graeme
Potts, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors; Cullum McAlpine who was an independent Non-Executive Director prior
to his retirement as a Director; and, Roger Matthews, who was independent prior to 31 July 2008 and upon appointment as Chairman,
but who is no longer deemed independent under the Code, following his appointment as Chairman. The committee held four meetings
during the year. The Board has previously reported that a search has been initiated to recruit an additional Non-Executive Director to
join the Board and on 30 March 2009 announced the appointment of Terry Morgan with effect from 1 July 2009. Upon appointment
Terry will serve on both the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee and will assume the role of Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee from Ishbel Macpherson with effect from 10 July 2009. 
The key duty of the Remuneration Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the individual remuneration packages 
of Executive Directors. As a part of this process the committee oversaw the administration of the Group LTIP , ESOS and SA YE schemes
(as further detailed in the Remuneration Report) and the benchmarking and review of Executive Director remuneration. During the
year the committee has been advised by the external remuneration consultant Kepler Associates in relation to Executive Director
remuneration through formal benchmarking with market and industry comparators. Kepler Associates do not have any connection
with the Group other than their formal appointment as advisers by the Remuneration Committee. The Board is responsible for reviewing
and setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors. Further details on Executive and Non-Executive Director remuneration are
given in the Remuneration Report.
Audit Committee
Role of the Committee
The Audit Committee is generally responsible for:
– monitoring and reviewing the integrity of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements and of any formal announcements relating to the Group’s
ﬁnancial performance, and for reviewing any signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgements therein;
– monitoring and reviewing the independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditors, the objectivity and effectiveness of the
audit process and the effectiveness and implementation of the Group policy on the provision of non-audit services (the Non-Audit
Services Policy);
– monitoring and reviewing the integrity and effectiveness of the Group’s internal ﬁnancial controls environment, internal audit function
and business risk management structures;
– making recommendations to the Board on shareholder resolutions for the appointment of, and remuneration for , external auditors.
The terms of reference of the committee are available at www.mitie.co.uk/investors_corporate-governance and include the
requirements of Rule 7.21 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) and the Code that the Company has a formally constituted
audit committee comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The chairman of the committee will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the work of the committee.
Committee composition
The committee consists entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors and is currently chaired by David Jenkins. During the year the
Audit Committee comprised David Jenkins; Ishbel Macpherson; Roger Matthews; and Cullum McAlpine. Cullum McAlpine ceased to
be a member of the committee upon his retirement from the Board on 31 July 2008. David Jenkins succeeded Cullum McAlpine as
Chairman of the committee on 31 July 2008. Roger Matthews left the committee immediately upon his appointment as Chairman 
of the Company on 31 July 2008. 
All members of the committee are considered as being appropriately experienced to fulﬁl their duties, whilst David Jenkins and Ishbel
Macpherson continue to be deemed, as at the date of this report, by the Board to have signiﬁcant, recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience through their qualiﬁcations and their previous appointments. 
The committee ordinarily consists of at least three members and requires two members to be present to be quorate. Between 
31 July 2008 (the date of retirement of Cullum McAlpine and Roger Matthews ceasing to be a member of the committee upon his
appointment as Chairman) and 31 March 2009 the committee comprised only two members (contrary to Code C.3.1). As mentioned
above, the Board has previously reported that a search has been initiated to recruit a suitably qualiﬁed additional Non-Executive
Director to join the Board and serve on the Audit Committee and on 30 March 2009 announced the appointment of Terry Morgan with
effect 1 July 2009. Upon appointment Terry will serve on the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee.

Meetings of the committee
During the year the Audit Committee held 3 meetings (see above summary). The Audit Committee invited the external auditors, 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Head of Business Risk to attend relevant parts of the meetings of the committee. 
The matters under consideration at these meetings included:
– generally monitoring the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting process and the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated group accounts;
– the Half-yearly Financial Report and Annual Report and Accounts;
– critical accounting policies and judgements;
– the review of the external auditors’ audit plan, nature and scope of work and overall summary of key issues and judgements;
– the re-appointment of the external auditors;
– the approval of fees for the external auditors;
– the effectiveness of the external auditors including the appropriateness and skills of the audit team;
– compliance with the Non-Audit Services Policy by the external auditors and maintenance of auditor independence;
– the approval of the Group risk assurance framework and the internal audit plan for the year ending 31 March 2009 and for the year
ending 31 March 2010;
– the review of key internal audit reports and ﬁndings; and, 
– generally monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control, audit and risk management systems and functions.
The committee also met separately with the external auditors and the Head of Business Risk without the presence of the 
Executive Directors.
External auditors
The Audit Committee is committed to ensuring the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and conﬁrms that the
requirements of the Non-Audit Services Policy have been met throughout the year. The Audit Committee has approved a Non-Audit
Services Policy that ensures that the Audit Committee has visibility over the levels of non-audit work performed by the Auditors and
requires the consent of the chairman of the Audit Committee for any non-audit spend with the auditors that, on an annual basis
cumulatively exceeds 50% of the annual audit fee and/or where any item, regardless of amount, is considered signiﬁcant. The Audit
Committee is satisﬁed that this policy provides sufﬁcient control over the levels of non-audit spend with the Auditors whilst providing
sufﬁcient ﬂexibility for the Group Finance Director to approve expenditure on advice below those levels. This policy generally restricts
the external auditors from performing work which will result in them auditing their own work, making management decisions for the
Group, creating a conﬂict of interest, ﬁnding themselves in the role of advocate for MITIE or creating any potential threat to their
independence. Additionally, the external auditors will only be considered for the provision of non-audit services if they are best suited
to perform the work in question. Deloitte LLP also maintains its own internal controls designed to safeguard its independence. 
A summary of the fees paid to the external auditors is given in Note 4 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Internal audit
The remit of the Audit Committee also includes monitoring the internal audit function (as reported above) and the arrangements by
which employees may raise concerns regarding any matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other perceived improprieties across the Group.
During the year ‘whistle-blowing’ activity has been communicated to the committee along with the results of investigations carried out.
These investigations have not identiﬁed any risks that result in a material, unmitigated exposure to the Group.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Internal control
Internal control and risk management
The Board recognises that it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is
designed to support the Group’s pursuit of achieving its objectives and strategies and also the identiﬁcation and management of risks
that may impact upon MITIE and upon the environment in which the Group operates. The system of internal control is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve these objectives and strategies and it will only provide reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance against material misstatement and loss.
Internal audit function
The Group operates an internal audit function which reports directly to the Group Counsel and the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
During the reporting period the size of the internal audit function has been doubled in recognition of the increasing size and complexity
of the Group and the increasing emphasis placed upon remediation, rectiﬁcation and re-audit of issues identiﬁed through the internal
audit programme.
Internal control systems: culture, responsibility and accountability
The Board and senior management are responsible for maintaining and developing a culture of integrity, competence, fairness and
responsibility throughout the Group. Essential to this is the recruitment and retention of highly skilled individuals who promote the 
highest standards of integrity, competence, governance and ethical behaviour. Group policies and procedures support the business
by providing an operational internal control framework for the Group, each division and operating business to work within. This
framework is designed to balance the need for Group-wide consistency and control with the autonomy that local management
require to develop and manage each operating business successfully. In order to delegate responsibilities clearly and effectively to the
Group’s operating businesses, and to ensure compliance with the matters reserved for the Board, a formal delegated authorities matrix
is issued to all operating subsidiaries that includes both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial authorities and matters relating to strategy, contract
approval, recruitment, capital expenditure, banking transactions and speciﬁc Group policies. Each operating subsidiary is headed by
a managing or regional director who has authority to manage their business within this framework of delegated authorities and Group
policies and procedures outlined above. To support the business further , the Group has a team of specialist resources with individuals
responsible for speciﬁc functions including legal, health and safety, IT , insurance, human resources, tax, pensions, purchasing, ﬁnance
and business risk. Regular dialogue between these functions and the operating businesses provides additional support and forms a key
part of the system of internal control.
Internal control systems: information and communication
The Group maintains a number of systems and processes that report relevant information to Group executive management and the
Board as necessary. This includes ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information regarding business performance, compliance with policy 
and procedure, relevant regulations and business critical matters. At an operational level each division and business holds regular
executive board meetings. To maintain and develop relationships between separate divisions and to address speciﬁc matters, regional
meetings are also held and are attended by regional representatives of each division. Senior Group management also regularly
attend these meetings.
Internal control systems: risk management
The Board conﬁrms that there is a continuing process for identifying, evaluating and managing signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. 
The Board also conﬁrms that this process has been in place throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the
Annual Report and Accounts, and that this process is monitored by the Board in accordance with the revised guidance on internal
control issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The process for identifying, evaluating and managing principal risks requires the
Group and its principal businesses to consider strategic, operational, ﬁnancial and compliance risks and the effectiveness of the
mitigating controls based on a pre and post controls risk evaluation. The principal risks identiﬁed from this process are recorded on the
Group’s risk register which is maintained by the Group’s Business Risk function. This register is reviewed periodically (at least twice per
year) by the Board.
Monitoring the system of internal control
The Board is responsible for monitoring the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Monitoring is carried out
throughout the year via the receipt and review of various reports, presentations and discussions with management, as set out above.
Speciﬁcally, the Audit Committee supports the Board by monitoring and guiding the activities of the internal audit function, including
approving the internal audit programme, reviewing regular internal audit reports from the business risk function and via meetings with
the Head of Business Risk. The internal audit programme is designed to provide a level of assurance over key risks as identiﬁed in the
Group risk register and is developed by the Head of Business Risk who reports to the General Counsel and independently to the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from the external auditors who contribute a further independent
perspective on certain aspects of the internal ﬁnancial control systems arising from their work. As necessary, the Audit Committee will
have dialogue with the Executive Directors on their control responsibilities and in particular , those relating to speciﬁc matters reported
by internal or external audit.

Governance
Reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control
The Board performs a formal annual assessment of the operation and effectiveness of the system of internal control and updates this
assessment prior to the signing of the Annual Report and Accounts. This includes consideration of reports on principal risks, controls 
and their effectiveness from the heads of each central team function and an independent report from the Head of Business Risk
summarising key audit ﬁndings. The Board also holds discussions with senior management and reviews the results of a formal internal
controls review and system effectiveness conﬁrmation from each operating subsidiary. The Board conﬁrms that management has
taken steps during the year to improve further the system of internal control, embed effective controls further into the operations of 
the Group and to address improvements as they come to management’s attention. These steps are monitored to ensure they are
implemented appropriately and that ultimately they are effective.
Auditors
Disclosure of information to the auditors
Each of the Directors in ofﬁce as of the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts conﬁrms that:
– so far as he/she is aware, there is no relevant audit information (being information required by the auditors in the preparation of their
report) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
– he/she has each taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of such information.
This conﬁrmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance with Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Re-appointment of auditors
On 1 December 2008, Deloitte & Touche LLP changed its name to Deloitte LLP. Deloitte LLP has expressed their willingness to continue 
in ofﬁce as auditors and the resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Share capital and shareholder matters
Capital structure and powers of shareholders
Details of changes to the Company’s share capital are given in Note 27 to the ﬁnancial statements. The Company has a single class 
of shares – 2.5p Ordinary shares – with no right to any ﬁxed income and with each share carrying the right to one vote at general
meetings of the Company. Under the Company’s Articles of Association holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to participate in any
dividends pro rata to their holding. The Board may propose and pay interim dividends and recommend a ﬁnal dividend for approval
by the shareholders at the AGM. A ﬁnal dividend may be declared by the shareholders in a general meeting by ordinary resolution,
but such dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Board. 
Certain shares that are issued as consideration upon acquisition by the Company of the shares of minority shareholders in MITIE 
Model companies have restrictions placed upon them that prevent the transfer of such shares for periods of up to two years 
following allotment. Otherwise, there are no speciﬁc restrictions on the size of any shareholding or on the transfer of shares, which are
both governed by the provisions of the Articles of Association of the Company (available at www. mitie.co.uk/investors_corporate-
governance) and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between Company shareholders that may
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital.
Details of employee share schemes are set out below and in Note 33 to the Accounts. Shares held by the MITIE Employee Beneﬁt 
Trust 2007 and the MITIE Employee Beneﬁt Trust 2008 abstain from voting.
The 2008 AGM authorised:
– the Directors to allot (under s80 Companies Act 1985) up to 118,691,000 shares (representing 37.5% of the issued share capital as 
at the date of the Notice of AGM) – during the reporting period, the Directors utilised this authority (and the preceding authority) 
to allot 6,194,836 shares;
– the dis-application (under ss94-95 Companies Act 1985) of pre-emption rights over allotted shares up to a total of 15,841,116 shares
(representing 5% of the issued share capital as at the date of the Notice of AGM); and
– the Company to make market purchases of its own shares up to a total of 31,682,321 shares (representing 10% of the issued share
capital as at the date of the Notice of AGM).

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Further details of these authorisations are available in the notes to the 2008 Notice of AGM (available at www. mitie.co.uk/investors).
Shareholders are referred to the 2009 Notice of AGM (which accompanies this report and/or is available at www. mitie.co.uk/investors)
which contains similar such provisions. During the year to 31 March 2009 there have been no purchases by the Company of MITIE
shares. The exact amount and timing of future purchases will be determined by the Company and will be dependent on market
conditions and other factors. It is the Company’s present intention to cancel any shares it buys back, rather than hold them in treasury,
but this policy will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Further details on the proposed renewal of powers for share buyback and the
allotment of shares in the Company are provided in the Notice of AGM.
With regards to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Code, 
the Companies Acts and related legislation. The Articles may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of the
Directors are described in the Matters Reserved to the Board (available at www. mitie.co.uk/investors_corporate-governance) and as
set out above.
Under the terms of certain shareholder agreements relating to MITIE Model companies and the articles of association of those
companies, certain minority shareholders in such companies may provide an option for the purchase by the Company of their minority
shares. The mechanism for calculating the price to be paid in respect of such transfer is transparent, on an arms-length basis, and in
accordance with the pricing structure generally applicable for other transfers under the MITIE Model. Details of these structures are
generally available (to the extent incorporated into the articles of association for individual MITIE Model companies) from Companies
House at www.companieshouse.gov.uk. There are also a number of other agreements with provisions that take effect, alter or
terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as bank facility agreements, property lease arrangements and employee
share plans. None of these are considered to be signiﬁcant in terms of their likely impact on the business or the Group as a whole. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its directors or employees that provide for compensation
for loss of ofﬁce or employment that occurs solely because of a take-over bid.
Substantial interests in share capital
As at 15 May 2009 the Company has been notiﬁed of the following signiﬁcant holdings of voting rights in its shares under the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules: 
Number of 
Ordinaryshares % of
of 2.5p each share capital
Majedie Asset Management Limited 16,327,802 5.05%
Invesco Limited 16,135,005 4.99%
Mirabaud Investment Management Limited 15,673,517 4.95%
Legal & General Group PLC 12,666,918 3.92%
Fidelity International Limited 10,065,118 3.22%
Shareholder communications
The Board is committed to an ongoing dialogue with institutional and private investors. The principal method of communication
between the Board and shareholders remains news announcements, the Half-yearly Financial Report, the Annual Report and
Accounts, the Corporate Responsibility Report and MITIE’s website, www.mitie.co.uk. A full programme of formal and informal 
events, institutional investor meetings and presentations are also held following the Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary 
Results announcements which are led by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The Chairman and Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director , are available for additional meetings with shareholders upon request. The Company believes that such
meetings should be at the instigation of shareholders and should not be at the active solicitation of the Company. During the reporting
period, no such requests were received by the Company, although all the Non-Executive Directors were present at the 2008 AGM 
and entered into direct discussions with shareholders both with, and without, Executive Directors present. Latest Group information,
ﬁnancial reports, corporate governance and CR matters, Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary Results presentations, major
shareholder information and all announcements are made available to shareholders via the MITIE website (www.mitie.co.uk) which
has a speciﬁc area dedicated to investor relations. 
Signiﬁcant importance is attached to investor feedback on the Group’s performance, and as such the Executive Board receives 
an investor relations report at each meeting detailing corporate news, share price activity, investor relations activity and major
shareholder movements. The Board is updated by the Executive Directors on these matters and receives detailed analyst feedback
following the Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary Results presentations. The AGM also allows shareholders to address and
discuss any issues surrounding the Group directly with the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.

Electronic communications
The Directors remain committed to improving and extending the methods in which the Company communicates with its shareholders
and wish to move towards an increase in electronic communication. At the 2007 AGM, shareholders approved certain amendments
which aligned the Company’s Articles of Association with the new provisions of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to electronic
shareholder communications. The Board has been disappointed with the level of uptake by shareholders to date and would wish 
to encourage all shareholders to register to receive communications from the Company electronically thus realising the environmental
and cost beneﬁts of reduced printing and carriage of hard copy reports and other communications. Details on how to register are
provided on the inside back cover of this report.
AGM
The 2009 AGM will be held at the ofﬁces of UBS, 2 Finsbury Avenue, London EC2M 2PP at 2.30pm on 10 July 2009. The Notice of AGM will
be available at www. mitie.co.uk\investors on 8 June 2009.
Operational matters
Employee involvement and employee equity-based incentivisation
The Board remains committed to fostering and developing a culture of employee involvement in the business through communication
with employees and equity involvement whereby employees are enabled to build a stake in the Company through the Company’s
various equity-based incentive schemes. 
Direct communication with employees continues to have a high priority. The Group communicates with employees through the use 
of: Group-wide mailings and updates; employee-focused initiatives; the use of Group-wide and business speciﬁc intranet sites; and,
provision of access to broadcasts of periodic ﬁnancial presentations. Through the use of their own communication processes each of
the Group’s businesses is encouraged to ensure that employees are kept informed on Group and individual business developments.
The Group continues to operate its Group-wide MITIE Stars programme to recognise and reward exceptional performance by its
people and in 2008 launched MITIE’s Got Talent as a Group-wide talent contest to encourage employee engagement and
recognition. The Group CR Report contains further details of these initiatives. Employees remain actively involved in the Group’s
activities via an employee forum. This year the forum held two meetings chaired by the Group HR director. The Board will continue to 
seek increasing involvement and activity of the employee representatives. 
The Board believes that the Group’s culture of employee equity involvement is a signiﬁcant driver in the Group’s growth performance
and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees. During the year the Group has continued to operate
its Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to incentivise and reward senior members of the MITIE management team and its Executive Share
Option Scheme (ESOS) for certain other employees below Board level. During the reporting period shareholders approved
modiﬁcations to the Group’s SA YE Scheme (SA YE) to reduce the savings contract period from ﬁve years to three years with the aim of
increasing employee uptake. The Board is pleased to report that uptake in the subsequent SA YE award increased against uptake in
2007. The Board will continue to review and, where appropriate, recommend amendments to equity-incentive schemes, in order to
maximise the effectiveness and incentive value of such schemes.
The LTIP and the ESOS are both discretionary schemes and are therefore not open to application by all employees of the Group. 
The SA YE, an Inland Revenue approved scheme, is open to all UK employees. The ESOS, established in 2001, has been approved by
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and options over shares to an individual limit of £30,000 can be awarded under the
approved element of the scheme. Options have in the past been awarded under this scheme to Executive Directors but, following the
introduction of the LTIP , the ESOS has been focused on employees below main Board level. Under the ESOS, there is a limit on the grant
level set at 100% of an individual’s base salary and the scheme has, following changes to the scheme approved by shareholders at
the 2007 AGM, a single performance threshold for vesting of the options – average growth in earnings per share over the three-year
vesting period must exceed inﬂation (measured as RPI) plus 4%. The scheme permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the
settlement of outstanding unapproved options with share appreciation rights. Further details of grants under the three equity-based
incentive schemes are provide in Note 33 to the ﬁnancial statements.
The Group has historically grown by giving entrepreneurial managers the opportunity to create wealth by taking the risk of starting a
new business, taking equity stakes at fair value in those new businesses in conjunction with MITIE and then, dependent on a pre-agreed
pricing structure, offering to sell that stake to MITIE predominantly in exchange for MITIE shares, at the option of MITIE. This incentivisation
scheme typically provides for such managers to elect to offer their stake in their business to MITIE between the ﬁfth and tenth years 
from the date of establishment of the business. Recipients of shares under this incentivisation scheme are generally restricted from
selling the MITIE shares received as consideration for a minimum of two years. The Board believes that this is a unique business model
that has driven MITIE’s past performance and continues to ensure a close alignment of interest between MITIE shareholders and the
management and employees of the Group. It is the Board’s current intention to continue to utilise such structures.

Employee involvement, disability and opportunities
The Board remains committed to developing further a culture that encourages the inclusion and diversity of all of the Group’s
employees through respecting and appreciating their differences and to promoting the continuous development of employees
through skills enhancement and training programmes. The Group’s employment policies are designed to attract, retain, train and
motivate the very best people, recognising that this can be achieved only through offering equal opportunities regardless of gender ,
race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other aspect of diversity. Applications from disabled persons are always fully
considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career
development and promotion of disabled persons (including those who become disabled whilst employees of the Group) should, 
as far as reasonably possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Financial instruments
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise bank loans, ﬁnance leases, overdrafts and performance guarantees. In addition, various
other ﬁnancial instruments such as trade creditors and trade debtors arise from its trade. The use of interest rate swaps and currency
swaps are used to manage interest and currency risk when necessary or material. The principal objective of these instruments is to raise
funds for general corporate purposes and to manage ﬁnancial risk. Further details of these instruments are given in Note 22 to the
ﬁnancial statements.
Payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to comply with the terms of payment agreed with suppliers, preferably on the Group’s standard purchasing terms
(as notiﬁed to suppliers), or otherwise to adhere to the suppliers’ standard terms. At 31 March 2009, the Group had 34 days’ purchases
outstanding (2008: 40 days).
Fixed values
The Board does not believe that there is any material difference between the book value and the current open market value of the
Group’s interests in land and buildings.
Events after the balance sheet date
There have not been any signiﬁcant events since the balance sheet date.
Future developments
The operating review sets out the Board’s view on likely future developments of the Group.
Research and development
Given the nature of the Group’s activities it does not carry out any material research and development work.
Donations
Donations to charity and community projects made during the year amounted to £184,018 (2008: £151,154). It is the Group’s policy 
not to make political donations, and during the reporting period no political contributions were made (2008: £nil). The total value of
community investment as disclosed in more detail in our CR Report 2009 was £603,659 (2008: £592,132).
Branch ofﬁces
The Group does not operate any registered branch ofﬁces outside of the UK but does have subsidiary companies in Guernsey and
Jersey and operates outside of the UK on a client-speciﬁc basis. Further details of the Group’s principal subsidiaries are given in Note 36
to the ﬁnancial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors are required to prepare the ﬁnancial
statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS) and have
chosen to prepare Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(UK GAAP).
In the case of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounts, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial
statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the Company’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires
the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the deﬁnitions and
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework 
for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by
compliance with IFRS where applicable. The Directors are also required to: properly select and apply accounting policies; present
information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
and, provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc IFRS requirements is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance. 
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the Directors are required to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial
statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and, state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for: keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company; safeguarding the assets; taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities; and, the preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration report which comply with the relevant requirements
of the Companies Acts. 
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Financial statements published by the
Company on this website are prepared in accordance with UK legislation which may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
To the best of each Director’s knowledge: the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting
standards and contained within this Annual Report and Accounts, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position
and proﬁt or loss of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and, the management report,
which is incorporated into the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with the description of the
principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Executive remuneration explained
General remuneration policy
The remuneration policy for the Company’s Executive Directors and other Group senior executives is shaped by the need to align the
interests with the interests of MITIE’s shareholders. The policy has particular regard to the Company’s and the Group’s long-standing
culture of encouraging equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment. The Committee, and the Board, continue to believe that
the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the past success of the Group and that consequently, in order to
maintain and develop further MITIE’s performance culture, the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and other Group
executives should continue to contain significant performance-related equity-based elements.
Ongoing assessment
The Committee is advised by its external remuneration consultants, Kepler Associates; in addition, the Group Human Resources Director
provides guidance to the Committee members. Kepler Associates provide no other services to the Company.
The Committee tests the remuneration structure regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately
positioned relative to the market. Benchmarking is conducted against sector and size comparators, in respect of base salary, total
cash and total remuneration, provided by our external remuneration consultants. The Committee also takes account of a range of
other factors when determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills of the individual
Directors. The Committee believes that the executive team should be motivated by the success of the Company and as such upper
quartile performance should be rewarded with an upper quartile package. 
At the time of signing this report the Committee is reviewing the structure of the Executive Director remuneration package to ensure 
it remains appropriate for 2009. The Committee will confirm the agreed structure following consultation with the Company’s major
shareholders, and disclose any changes in the 2009/10 Remuneration report.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Remuneration package
The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element (salary and certain benefits) and a variable element (annual
performance-related bonus and long-term equity-based incentives). The balance between these fixed and variable elements is set
out in this Remuneration Report. 
Base salary – Reviewed annually, as described above.
Beneﬁts – The benefits package for the Executive Directors consists of private healthcare and the provision of a company car
allowance. 
Annual bonus – V ariable remuneration is designed to drive further MITIE’s performance. The annual bonus scheme is structured to align
a significant element of the remuneration of Executive Directors with short-term Company performance. Bonuses to Executive Directors
are awarded at a maximum of 100% of base salary, dependent on the achievement of Group budgeted performance levels or
performance against the budget of the respective areas of the business within the individual Director’s direct control. Targets were
achieved in the year ended 31 March 2009, resulting in the payment of maximum bonuses at a rate of 100% of salary.
The Committee is currently reviewing the structure of the 2009 annual bonus and will finalise the plan following consultation with the
Company’s major shareholders.
Share based incentives – The LTIP and the Executive Director Share-ownership Policy are designed to engender long-term decision
making and sustainable growth:
LTIP
Historically, Executive Directors and senior executives were incentivised through a mix of options granted under the ESOS and 
through shareholdings in the Company acquired through equity participation in subsidiary companies of the Group that were
structured in accordance with the MITIE Model. In 2007 this policy was replaced by the sole use of awards granted under the LTIP.
Certain Executive Directors still retain options granted under the ESOS and details of this scheme can be found on page 55. There is no
re-testing of performance conditions for any incentive programme.
The LTIP was established in 2007 and is the principal equity-based incentive scheme for Executive Directors. Awards may be granted,
under a joint-ownership structure or through direct grants, in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares. 
The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based
awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so. An award may not be granted after 26 July 2017. No payment (other
than in respect of any individual recipients electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where appropriate) is required for the
grant of an award. 
In 2008, with the approval of shareholders, the upper limit on the market value (as at grant) of awards that an individual Executive
Director may receive in any ﬁnancial year was raised from 100% to 200% of annual base salary in that ﬁnancial year. The Committee
only intends to use this upper limit in respect of awards to Ruby McGregor-Smith the Chief Executive and Suzanne Baxter the Group
Finance Director and the previous upper limit of 100% of annual base salary will continue to be applied to other Executive Directors. 
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, the rules currently allow for this limit to be increased to 250% of any
employee’s annual base salary. As part of its review of the change in the upper grant limit, the Committee considered the introduction
of a second performance target for awards of over 100% of an Executive Director’s base salary. The Committee decided against this
believing it would dilute the clarity and simplicity of the scheme, and that a single target is more in keeping with the other successful
equity-based incentive schemes that operate within the Group. 
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable. The scheme rules, in line with standard industry practice,
contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability, and/or death. In the event of a change-of-
control, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the discretion of the Committee.
The Committee continues to believe that EPS is the most appropriate long-term performance measure for MITIE. It brings the advantages
of simplicity and visibility of the value of the award which the Committee believes enhances the LTIP’s effectiveness as an incentive
tool. Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met. All awards are subject 
to performance conditions that require adjusted EPS, less inflation (measured by the retail prices index – RPI), to exceed certain
performance thresholds over a three-year period. Where EPS growth is less than inflation plus the lower performance threshold 
per annum none of the awards will vest. Awards vest in full for EPS growth equal to inflation plus the upper performance threshold.
V esting is on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels. For LTIP awards made in 2008, the lower and upper performance
thresholds were RPI+5% p.a. and RPI+14% p.a. respectively. The Committee is currently reviewing the EPS targets that will apply to 2009
LTIP awards to ensure that these remain stretching and achievable in the current economic climate.

Share ownership policy
A share-ownership policy for Executive Directors was introduced in 2007 at the same time as the LTIP. Under this policy, all Executive
Directors are required, over time, to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary. During 2008, 
this requirement was increased to 150% in respect of any Executive Director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of their
base salary. The Committee recognises that the principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards
and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected to retain no fewer than
50% of shares (net of taxes) that vest under the LTIP. For the coming year , we do not propose to amend the share ownership policy.

Non-Executive Director remuneration
The remuneration for the Chairman is recommended by the Committee for approval by the Board and reﬂects the responsibilities 
and commitment of this role. The remuneration level for the role was last reviewed in 2007, following receipt of advice from external
remuneration consultants in relation to market comparators, and was maintained at the level paid to the previous Chairman on the
appointment of Roger Matthews on 31 July 2008.
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and they are reviewed annually. 
The fee level is designed both to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the experience
and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the Group. The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic
fee with an additional fee for chairmanship of committees, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf 
of the Company. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s share schemes or the annual 
bonus scheme, nor do they receive pensions or ancillary beneﬁts. Fee levels for the reporting year were maintained at 2007 levels.
Further details of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are provided in the audited section of this report.

Equity-based incentive schemes
As set out above, the Group operates four formal equity-based incentive schemes. The interests of Directors’ in each of these schemes
is set out in Tables 4 and 5. No options have been issued to any Directors under the MITIE Group PLC SA YE Scheme. There has not been
any variation in the terms and conditions governing any of the grants listed below since the relevant grant date. No price is payable
upon award in respect of ESOS or LTIP awards (other than income tax and National Insurance in respect of certain LTIP awards).
Applicable exercise prices for options awarded are set out in Table 4. The performance conditions relating to the awards to Directors
detailed below are the same as for any other member of the schemes who received awards at the same time.
The share options detailed in Table 4 were granted under the ESOS and the performance conditions that applied at the date of 
grant require a percentage growth in the Company’s earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over 
the period from the date of grant of the option to the date on which the option ﬁrst becomes exercisable. Since the grant to Ruby
McGregor-Smith and Suzanne Baxter detailed in Table 4, there have been no grants to Directors under the ESOS (both the unapproved
part and the HM Revenue & Customs approved part), and it is the Company’s policy that equity-based incentives for Directors in the
current reporting period will be based solely upon LTIP awards.
The LTIP awards made in 2007 and 2008 (detailed in Table 5) are subject to the performance conditions that require adjusted EPS, 
less inﬂation (measured by the retail prices index – RPI), to exceed certain performance thresholds over a 3-year period. Where EPS
growth is less than inﬂation plus 5% per annum, none of the awards will vest. Awards vest in full for EPS growth equal to inﬂation plus 
14% per annum. V esting will be on a straight line basis for performance between these levels.

*The Directors acquired a conditional joint beneficial interest with the MITIE Employee Benefit Trust 2008 in the shares awarded under the LTIP scheme in 2008. 
The full beneficial interest will only transfer to the Director if the performance criteria applicable to the award are met.
Share dilution
The Company has stated its intent to manage dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect
of both all-employee schemes and discretionary schemes (the ESOS, LTIP and SA YE) and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes (the
ESOS and the LTIP). In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available ‘headroom’ on a ten-year ﬂat-
line basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital. Options granted under the LTIP
are satisﬁed through the market-purchase of shares held by MITIE Group PLC EBT 2007 and the MITIE Group PLC EBT 2008. The potential
dilution of the Company’s issued share capital is set out in Table 6 in respect of all outstanding options granted under the Company’s
equity-based incentive schemes and which are to be satisﬁed through the allotment of new shares.

Total shareholder return performance
Table 7 shows the total shareholder return performance of MITIE shares compared with the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 Support Services
indices over a 5-year period to 31 March 2009. The Committee is of the opinion that these comparators provide a clear picture of the
performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable size as well as a speciﬁc group of companies within the same
sector. Total shareholder return is calculated according to the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and assumes that all
dividends are reinvested. 
The market price of the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2009 was 187.00p. The highest and lowest prices during the year were
245.00p and 158.25p respectively.

Directors’ interests in shares 
Tables 8 and 9 detail the beneﬁcial interests of the Directors (who were in ofﬁce on 31 March 2009) in the share capital of the Company
and in the share capital of certain of the Company’s subsidiary companies respectively. The interests of Directors in these subsidiary
companies were acquired under the MITIE Model, further details of which are given in the Directors’ and governance report on page 47.
No such interests have been acquired by Directors since 2004 and it is the Company’s policy that Directors will not be entitled to
participate in any MITIE Model investments in the current reporting period.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of MITIE Group PLC  
For the year ended 31 March 2009 
We have audited the group financial statements of  
MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009  
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement and the related notes 1 to 36. These group financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information  
in the Directors' Remuneration Report that is described  
as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended  
31 March 2009.  
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no  
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do  
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors' Remuneration Report and the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as  
adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement 
of Directors' Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements  
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial 
statements give a true and fair view, whether the group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the directors' 
remuneration report described as having been audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with  
the group financial statements. The information given in the 
Directors' Report includes that specific information presented  
in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review,  
the Operating review, Financial review and the Corporate 
Governance statement that is cross referred from the Business 
Review section of the Directors' Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding director's 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the company's compliance with the nine provisions  
of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report  
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the 
board's statements on internal control cover all risks and 
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the  
group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether  
it is consistent with the audited group financial statements. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware  
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies  
with the group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
group financial statements and the part of the Directors' 
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made 
by the directors in the preparation of the group financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group's circumstances, consistently  
applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all  
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to  
give reasonable assurance that the group financial statements  
and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be 
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion  
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation  
of information in the group financial statements and the part  
of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
– the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and  
of its profit for the year then ended; 
– the group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985  
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; 
– the part of the directors’ remuneration report described  
as having been audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
– the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the group financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 31 March 2009 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 are prepared in accordance with International Accounting 
Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board  
and as adopted for use in the European Union.  
As more fully detailed in the Directors’ and governance report, the Group’s financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the 
preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 except for the adoption of new standards 
and interpretations, noted below. Adoption of these standards and interpretations did not have any significant effect on the financial 
position or performance of the Group. 
– IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’; and 
– IFRIC 14 IAS 19 ‘The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’;  
The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective;  
– IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’;  
– IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’; 
– IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’; 
– IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners’; 
– IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’; 
– IAS 1 (Revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’; 
– IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’; 
– IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’; and consequential amendment to; IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’, IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ and IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’; 
– IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’; 
– Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 ‘Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation’; 
– Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’;  
– Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 ‘Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate’; 
– Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’;  
– Amendments resulting from May 2008 Annual Improvements to IFRSs; and 
– Amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to IFRSs. 
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material financial impact on the 
Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application, except for the treatment of acquisition of subsidiaries when IFRS 3 comes 
into effect for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after 1 April 2010. 
Significant accounting policies under IFRS 
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group’s IFRS financial information are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of MITIE Group PLC and all its subsidiaries. The financial 
statements of the parent Company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(UK GAAP). Adjustments are made in the consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist 
between UK GAAP and IFRS. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated  
in full. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
Interests of minority shareholders are measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent  
liabilities recognised.  MITIE Group PLC

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate  
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non Current Assets Held 
for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the 
cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Cost of acquisition includes 
all deferred amounts that become payable in the future. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. It is 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination  
of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to 
being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and  
is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.  
Development expenditure relating to software is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, if it is probable 
that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that they may be impaired. Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over its useful life.  MITIE Group PLC

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue represents fee income recognised in respect of services provided during the period (stated net of value 
added tax) and is earned almost exclusively within the United Kingdom. 
Revenue from multi-service contracts consists of various components which operate independently of each other and for  
which reliable fair values can be established. Each component is accounted for separately as if it were an individual contractual 
arrangement. 
Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and estimates in respect 
of amounts to be invoiced after the year end. Profits are recognised on long-term contracts where the final outcome can be assessed 
with reasonable certainty. In calculating this, the percentage of completion method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred  
to the total estimated cost. Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays. Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each 
contract immediately such losses are forecast. 
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less amounts billed  
on account. To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in creditors as gross 
amounts due to customers. 
Variations in contract work and claims are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable,  
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s  
net carrying amount. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated before investment revenue and finance costs.  
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which 
they are incurred. 
Leasing 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve  
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.  
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Any lease incentives are amortised over the lesser of the life of the operating lease or to the first opportunity for termination. 
Foreign currency 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.  
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the  
date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency  
are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit  
or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit 
or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are 
recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly  
in equity.  MITIE Group PLC

Retirement benefit costs  
The Group operates and participates in a number of defined benefit schemes. In respect of the schemes in which the Group 
participates, the Group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of its participation which is for a fixed  
period only. 
In addition, the Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees. 
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-
line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation 
is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity,  
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.  MITIE Group PLC

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is charged 
so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property – over 50 years 
Leasehold improvements    – period of the lease 
Plant and vehicles     – 3–10 years 
Annually the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would  
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location.  
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and estimated selling 
costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the contractual rights  
and obligations are discharged or expire. 
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective 
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, the number  
of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable changes in national or local economic 
conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade receivables, where  
the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is 
written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance 
account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at amortised cost. Appropriate allowances  
for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge and manage risks associated with interest.  
The Group does not currently designate any derivative financial instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting. Such derivative 
financial instruments are stated at fair value through profit and loss (through investment revenue and finance costs) with fair value 
determined by reference to market rates.  
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the 
income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arise. 
Trade payables are measured at fair value. There are no financial liabilities classified as held for trading. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  MITIE Group PLC

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an 
insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The 
expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost. 
Pre-contract costs 
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award (or full recovery of costs) is virtually 
certain. Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within trade and other receivables. On the contract award these bid costs 
are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair 
value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only  
to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 April 2005. 
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management has made the 
following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity. This is measured 
by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs except where this would not be 
representative of the stage of completion. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill  
has been allocated. The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of cash-generating units and also the 
selection of appropriate discount rates to use in order to calculate present values. The carrying value of goodwill is £201.2m (2008: 
£203.3m) at the balance sheet date; see Note 11. Management do not consider that any reasonably foreseeable change in the key 
assumptions would result in an impairment.  
Retirement benefit obligations 
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, future 
returns on assets and future contribution rates. The present value of defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is £126.1m 
(2008: £129.4m); see Note 34.  
The sensitivity of defined benefit obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown below:

3. Business and geographical segments 
Business segments 
The Group manages its business on a service division basis. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary  
segmental information. 
On 1 April 2009 we took a decision to rebrand our three operating divisions to Facilities Management (previously Facilities Services), 
Property Management (previously Property Services) and Asset Management (previously Engineering Services). Further we elected to 
enhance our Asset Management proposition through its combination with our Engineering Maintenance business, which had previously 
been a part of our Facilities Services business. The financial data below reflects the performance of our three divisions in the 
organisational structures that applied during the period to 31 March 2009, but reflects the new branding. A proforma analysis of the 
financial results of the business for the year ended 31 March 2009 is also set out below.

The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the 
period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs  
are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five 
years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2% (2008: 2%) per annum. This rate 
does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs are as follows:

Before accepting new customers, the Group uses external credit scoring systems to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and 
defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring are updated as appropriate. The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade 
receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base 
being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance 
for doubtful debt. The average credit period taken on sales of services was 33 days (2008: 38 days). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

 28.5 42.6
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months  
or less. The carrying amount of the assets approximates their fair value. 
Included in cash and cash equivalents are deposits totalling £7.3m (2008: £12.4m) held by the Group’s insurance subsidiary, which are 
not readily available for the general purposes of the Group. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned 
by recognised international credit-rating agencies and are managed through regular review.

All borrowings are in sterling. The Directors estimate that the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings approximates their fair value. 
During the year £1.2m of loan notes in respect of MITIE Pest Control Limited (formerly Eagle Pest Control Services UK Limited)  
were redeemed. 
Included in non-current liabilities are £2.9m (2008: £2.1m) of obligations under finance leases (see Note 24) and £1.6m (2008: £1.6m)  
of unsecured loan notes which are repayable between 2009 and 2013. 
During the year, the Group entered into a series of callable swaps, which represented good value at the time, to convert from a 
variable rate to a fixed rate of interest. As a result of the dramatic fall in interest rates these swaps had a negative mark to market value 
of £0.6m at 31 March 2009 which will reverse as the mark to market valuation tends towards zero as the swaps approach maturity or 
cancellation. The contracts in place have a weighted average strike price of 4.4% and a maximum maturity of 2011.

At 31 March 2009, the Group had available £220m (2008: £180m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all 
conditions precedent had been met. The facilities have an expiry date of January 2012. The loans carry interest rates which are currently 
fixed at 1.2% and are currently determined at 0.4% over LIBOR. The secured loan notes are backed by a bank guarantee. Details of the 
Group’s contingent liabilities are provided in Note 31.  MITIE Group PLC

23. Financial risk management objectives 
The Group’s Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. These risks include credit 
risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and market risk. 
Credit risk  
The Group’s credit risk to all of its banks and financial counterparties is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally reported quarterly. 
The value of business placed with financial institutions is reviewed on a daily basis. 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. In addition, where appropriate, certain debts are 
subject to credit insurance. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group has very limited trading transactions in foreign currency and currently there is no hedging of these exposures. Any material 
transactions would be appropriately hedged. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the Group’s assets 
and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations. Bank facilities which allow for appropriate headroom in the Group’s daily 
cash movements are then arranged.

Financial liabilities 289.9 3.7 293.6
Financial assets at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008 have a maturity of less than one year. 
Market risk  
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates. The Group’s Treasury function reviews its risk management strategy 
on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate risk. Group policy is 
not to trade in financial instruments. 
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended  
31 March 2009 and reserves would decrease/increase by £0.1m (2008: £0.1m).  
Capital risk management  
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group consists of net funds/(debt) per 
Note 25 and equity per Note 28.  
The Group’s capital structure is reviewed regularly. The Group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements with 
the exception of those applicable to the Group’s captive insurance subsidiary.  MITIE Group PLC

The average remaining lease term is 33 months (2008: 23 months). For the year ended 31 March 2009, the average effective borrowing 
rate was 5.8% (2008: 5.8%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements 
have been entered into for contingent rental payments. All lease obligations are denominated in sterling. 
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are 
secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

During the year £0.5m of deferred contingent consideration in respect of the purchase last year of part of the minority shareholdings  
in MITIE Technology & Infrastructure Limited was settled by the issue of new MITIE shares giving rise to a merger reserve of £0.5m; 
furthermore £0.7m of deferred consideration in respect of the purchase last year of Catering Partnership Holdings Limited was settled  
in cash.  
Provision is made for deferred contingent consideration, which may become payable from 2009 – 2013 subject to profit targets being 
attained, at the best estimate of the Directors. A total of £2.4m was provided for deferred contingent consideration to the minority 
shareholders of MITIE Interiors Limited, MITIE Property Services (Eastern) Limited and MITIE Technology & Infrastructure Limited. 
In addition, £11.7m of deferred contingent consideration has been released through goodwill.  
The provision for insurance claims represents amounts payable by MITIE Reinsurance Company Limited in respect of outstanding claims 
incurred at the balance sheet dates. These amounts will become payable as each year’s claims are settled.  MITIE Group PLC

Cash and cash equivalents (which are presented as a single class of assets on the face of the balance sheet) comprise cash at bank 
and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. 
31. Contingent liabilities  
The Company is party with other Group companies to cross guarantees of each other’s bank loans, commitments and overdrafts of 
£265m (2008: £270m). 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims that are in the ordinary course 
of business. The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. 
Deferred contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been accrued at the Directors’ best estimate of the likely future obligation  
of £11.0m (2008: £20.9m) per Note 26. The actual amounts payable may vary up to a maximum of £31.0m (2008: £31.2m) dependent 
upon the results of the acquired businesses. 
In addition, the Group and its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance, issued by financial 
institutions on its behalf, amounting to £20.6m (2008: £9.2m) in the ordinary course of business. These are not expected to result in any 
material financial loss.  MITIE Group PLC

33. Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share option schemes 
The Company has four share option schemes: 
The MITIE Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP was introduced in 2007. The awards of shares or rights to acquire shares (the awards) are offered to a small number  
of key senior management. Where offered as options the exercise price is nil. The vesting period is three years. If the awards remain 
unexercised after a period of four years from the date of grant, the awards expire. The awards may be forfeited if the employee  
leaves the Group. Before the awards can be exercised, a performance condition must be satisfied; the number of awards that  
vest is determined by a sliding scale above the Retail Price Index per annum compound growth in earnings  per share over a  
three-year period. 
The MITIE Group PLC 1991 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day period 
immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years 
from the date of grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group. No options have been granted 
under this scheme since August 2001. 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day period 
immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years 
from the date of grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group. Before options can be exercised, 
the performance condition that must be satisfied is that the percentage growth in the earnings per share over a three-year period must 
be equal or greater than 10.0% per annum compound in respect of awards prior to July 2007 and 4.0% above the Retail Price per 
annum thereafter.  MITIE Group PLC

33. Share-based payments continued 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 Savings related share option scheme 
The Savings Related share option scheme is open to all employees. The exercise price is not less than 80.0% of the market value of  
the shares on the day preceding the date on which invitations to participate in the Scheme are issued. For options granted prior to 
September 2008, the vesting period is five years. For options granted in September 2008 and thereafter, the vesting period is three years. 
If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the date of vesting, the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group.

(i)  Included within this balance are 0.6m (2008: 0.8m) options that have not been recognised in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 as the options were 
granted on or before 7 November 2002. These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with 
IFRS 2.

Long Term Incentive Plan share options 1.1 0.4
2001 Executive share options 0.6 0.5
2001 Savings Related share options 0.7 0.6
 2.4 1.5
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 201p (2008: 264p). The options 
outstanding at 31 March 2009 had exercise prices (other than nil in the case of the LTIP) ranging from 95p – 254p (2008: 58p – 254p) and 
a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.7 years (2008: 5.1 years). In the year ended 31 March 2009, options were granted in 
June, July and September 2008 in respect of the LTIP, Executive and Savings Related share option schemes. The aggregate of the 
estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is £4.0m. In the year ended 31 March 2008, options were granted in July and 
August 2007 in respect of the LTIP, Executive and Savings Related share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of 
the options granted on those dates is £3.0m. 
The fair value of options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 
 2009 2008 
Share price (p) 133–230 133–230
Exercise price (p) 0–254 0–254
Expected volatility (%) 27–30 27–30
Expected life (years) 3–6 4–6
Risk-free rate (%) 4.17–5.25 4.17–5.25
Expected dividends (%) 1.43–3.15 1.43–2.29
Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes. The expected life is based upon 
historical data and has been adjusted based on management’s best estimates for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.  MITIE Group PLC

34. Retirement benefit schemes  
Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes 
are held separately from those of the Group in funds controlled by the scheme providers. The Group paid employer contributions of 
£2.9m (2008: £3.2m) during the year. 
Defined benefit schemes 
Group defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme where MITIE Group PLC is the 
principal employer following the merger of the MITIE Group PLC Passport Pension Scheme with the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme  
in May 2008.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the Group. Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement  
so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees’ working lives with the Group.  
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0 and 66 % of final salary on attainment  
of a retirement age of 65. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The schemes are funded schemes. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group scheme’s assets and the present value of their defined benefit obligations was carried 
out at 1 April 2008 by Mr Chris Bamford, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. 
Other defined benefit schemes 
Grouped together under ‘Other schemes’ are one (2008: three) scheme in which the Group is a participating employer and a  
number of schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers’ defined benefit schemes  
in respect of certain TUPE employees. These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each balance sheet date. The present values  
of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the Projected Unit  
Credit Method. 
For the Admitted Body Schemes (principally the West Midlands Pension Fund), which are all part of the Local Government Pension 
Scheme, the Group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts. The Group is required to pay regular 
contributions as decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes’ Schedule of Contributions. In a number of 
cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess recovered from the body that the employees transferred 
from. In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the Group will be required to pay any deficit (as determined by the 
Scheme Actuary) that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme.

Future pension increases  3.00 3.30  3.00 3.30
The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return of each asset class. The expected 
return on equities is the sum of dividend growth and capital growth net of investment expenses. The return on gilts and bonds is the 
current market yield on long-term bonds. The expected return on property has been set equal to that expected on equities less a 
margin. The expected return on other assets is the rate earned by the scheme on cash and alternate assets. 
The sensitivity of defined benefit obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown in Note 2. MITIE Group PLC

Independent auditors’ report to the members of MITIE Group PLC  
 
We have audited the parent company financial statements  
of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009 which 
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes  
37 to 50. These parent company financial statements have  
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the group financial statements  
of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009 and on the 
information in the directors' remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state  
to the company’s members those matters we are required to  
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or  
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report  
and the parent company financial statements in accordance  
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)  
are set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  
We also report to you whether in our opinion the Directors' Report  
is consistent with the parent company financial statements.  
The information given in the Directors' Report includes that specific 
information presented in the Chairman’s statement, Chief 
Executive’s Review, Operating Review, Financial Review and 
Corporate Governance Statement that is cross referred from  
the Business Review section of the Directors' Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company  
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit,  
or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report  
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited parent company financial statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware  
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent 
company financial statements. It also includes an assessment  
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors 
in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the company's circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent company financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent 
company financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
– the parent company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company's affairs as at 
31 March 2009; 
– the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
– the information given in the Directors' report is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
For the year ended 31 March 2009 
37. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by company law. They have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.  
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the  
preceding year. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.  
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is charged so as to 
write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Plant and vehicles   – 3–10 years 
Software and development costs – 5–10 years 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, 
the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets is the 
greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which 
they are incurred. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount  
of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, 
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any 
provision is charged to the profit and loss account, net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.  
Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to 
pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences 
arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are 
included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where 
there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit 
these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.  MITIE Group PLC

37. Significant accounting policies continued 
Financial instruments  
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the profit and loss account where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,  
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit 
and loss account and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in  
which they arise. 
Trade payables are measured at fair value. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options and awards,  
the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding expense is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Options over the Company’s shares awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries  
are accounted for as a capital contribution within the carrying value of Investments in subsidiary undertakings. 
Pensions  
Pension costs represent amounts paid to one of the Group’s pension schemes. For the purposes of FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ the 
Company has been unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group defined benefit pension scheme  
on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore the Company is accounting for contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined 
contribution scheme. Note 34 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the details of the IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ net pension 
liability of £0.4m (2008: £7.5m asset).  
38. Profit for the year 
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account  
for the year. MITIE Group PLC reported a profit after taxation for the financial year ended 31 March 2009 of £53.1m (2008: £27.0m  
before an exceptional unrealised gain of £187.7m which arose on the insertion of intermediate holding companies within the Group). 
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £45,000 (2008: £40,000).  
The average number of persons employed, being full time equivalents, by the Company during the year, including Directors, was 111 
(2008: 107). 
The costs incurred in respect of these employees were:

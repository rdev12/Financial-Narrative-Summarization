Introduction
What is Ultra?
The Ultra Electronics Group manages a wide range of specialist capabilities, generating highly-differentiated
solutions and products in the Defence & Aerospace, Security & Cyber, Transport and Energy markets,
by applying electronic and software technologies in demanding environments and critical applications
to meet customer needs.
Ultra’s business model
The business model, pictured above,
describes how Ultra operates to achieve its
strategic objective. Investment in portfolio
strength and innovative technologies, whilst
developing tailored solutions focused on
customer need, ensures long-term value
creation and informs inward investment.
Ultra’s business model is further explained on
pages 8 and 9, while the Group’s strategies for
growth are set out on pages 10 and 11. The
strength of Ultra’s broad capability portfolio is
set out under the eight market segments
described on pages 12 to 21. The key to
delivering a sustainable business is rooted in
Ultra’s responsible values and behaviours,
embedded in our people and embodied
within Ultra’s culture, described on pages 
44 to 48. Good corporate governance and
effective risk management are at the heart 
of Ultra’s compliance framework and are
described on pages 36 to 41 and 52 to 83.

Ultra’s place in the market
Ultra continues to focus on its main markets
of Defence & Aerospace, Security & Cyber,
Transport and Energy. To explain its wide
portfolio of capabilities more effectively, the
Group have adopted the market segmentation
shown opposite. Each of the eight segments
generate highly differentiated, cost-effective
and proven technologies at the system, 
sub-system and component level. These
technologies are often fundamental to the
performance, safety or mission success of the
platforms in which they are incorporated,
making Ultra a critical supplier on many
complex platforms, enjoying long-term
positions. To sustain this advantage the Group
harnesses both internal and customer-funded
research and development to tailor solutions
to changing customer needs and budgets.
This sustains its reputation as an exceptional
supplier of enabling technology. This is based
upon the development of a deep
understanding of individual customer
requirements through open dialogue and
long-term relationships.
The segment structure allows Ultra to harness
the capabilities of its 24 businesses to
provide technical expertise and domain
knowledge to deliver the more complete,
comprehensive and cost-effective solutions
they demand. Where needed, the Group
partners seamlessly with best-of-breed
suppliers to offer a more complete solution
and will happily “lead or follow” as a 
non-threatening mid-tier company in order 
to completely satisfy customer need. Equally,
individual businesses continue to develop and
supply the speciﬁc, high-end technologies for
which they are well known, providing the
agility and responsiveness of a smaller,
autonomous business unit. The Group
maintains its development focus on the eight
segments that it understands well while
reviewing markets for new opportunities
where Ultra can apply its existing technology
edge or explore a sensible adjacency. 
Where we operate
Ultra’s core regional markets remain North
America and the United Kingdom. In mainland
Europe the Group focuses on technologies
that are unavailable from indigenous suppliers
(e.g. sonobuoys). Elsewhere in the world the
Group has developed its strategic positioning
on its target regions of Australia, the Middle
East, India, Turkey and (for non-defence
products) China, while continuing to pursue
individual opportunities and business
relationships in many other nations. These
core markets and target regions allow Ultra to
access the largest addressable defence and
security budgets in the world, positioning for
long-term growth through well-considered
partnerships and government relationships.
Given Ultra’s relatively low exposure to
mainland Europe, a potential UK Exit from the
EU (Brexit) is not expected to have a
significant specific impact on the Group,
notwithstanding any global macroeconomic
impact.
Ultra’s customers
This market position, together with Ultra’s
independence, allows it to work very
effectively with the world’s prime contractors
in the Group’s chosen markets. The graphic
below shows the major customers for the
Group’s 2015 revenue. Within these top
customers, such as the US Department of
Defense (DoD), the UK Ministry of Defence
(MoD) and BAE Systems, the Group supplies
to a wide range of different project ofﬁces,
integrated project teams and platform teams.
Therefore, Ultra deals with a larger number of
different partners and customers than the
graphic might at ﬁrst suggest, executing
against tens of thousands of contracts and
production orders on an annual basis.

04 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Introduction
As we entered 2015, the continuing
uncertainty in our core defence markets led us
to adopt a prudent view of annual performance
against which we have delivered. While it
seems a long time ago, you will recall in those
early months the UK was in its normal pause
during the general election and resolution of
US government spending plans were far from
certain. Uncertainty of this nature inevitably
translates into caution at the contract ofﬁcer
level, which we saw reﬂected in the 10%
year-on-year reduction reported in US defence
outlays in the ﬁrst half of 2015. This caution led
us to take the early measures necessary to
control costs across the Group and ensure
performance in line with market expectations.
By the close of the year we were in a very
different place. A surprise election victory by
the Conservative Party in the UK led to a
comprehensive and well-considered Strategic
Defence & Security Review by ministers and
ofﬁcials familiar with the challenges. A 
real-term increase in defence spending
coupled with a commitment to maintain
spending at 2% of GDP was a responsible
reaction to the increase in global instability,
security threats and conﬂicts. In the US a
similar appreciation of the broad range of
potential threats that the nation’s armed
forces may need to respond to, contributed
to a welcome two-year budget agreement.
These outcomes provide greater clarity for
the future UK and US defence procurement
programmes, with real opportunities in Ultra’s
areas of strength, including submarine build,
ISTAR and Communications. My remaining
caution would be that both the US and UK
defence procurement programmes remain
highly ambitious and funding pressure will
inevitably continue. Improved efﬁciency in
the supply chain will be an increasing
demand made by both governments but one
to which we are already responding.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
The Group’s development of secure positions
on a range of aerospace opportunities
through long-term development investment
will transition to production revenue over the
next few years. The majority of the value that
this unlocks lies beyond the current order
book value in multi-year positions and
agreements. Our nuclear business is
increasingly focused on commercial
opportunities as long-term investment plans
clarify. As an example, the excellent
relationship we have developed with EDF in
the commercial nuclear market is now
physically reﬂected in the delivery of the ﬁrst
reactor core neutron ﬂux detectors from the
£5m joint Ultra/EDF facility.
Positioning for future growth
During the year we reorganised into three
new divisions (pages 30 to 35) which reflect
the eight market segments we now use to
better connect our organisational structure to
end markets. The divisions drive performance
and delivery through the organisation,
controlling costs and instilling the behaviours
we seek. The segments allow businesses from
across the Group to collaborate in the
presentation of their collective capability to
end customers and allow Ultra to offer the
more comprehensive solutions the market
increasingly demands. Importantly, the 24
individual businesses retain a high degree
of autonomy, allowing them the agility to
respond quickly to emerging opportunities
and changing customer needs without the
need to seek permission from a dense,
hierarchal structure. It also ensures our people
feel responsibility towards every aspect of
delivery to the customer and the performance
of their individual business. 
Challenging markets and a deflationary
economy demand increasing efficiency. In the
year we have taken further manpower
reductions to match changes in revenue and
keep our businesses lean. We have also
announced the Standardisation & Shared
Services S3 programme which will bring
together non-differentiating activities
(including HR, IT and Finance) from across the
Group into regional hubs where we can deliver
the services to the businesses more effectively.
S3 is on track to start to cover its costs in 2016
and make substantive savings thereafter.
Entry into new markets requires careful
assessment accompanied by appropriate
relationships. Ultra builds such positions
gradually so as to test assumptions and grow
confidence in new partnerships. During the
period we made two key moves which
position us for future growth:
• In June we signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with Mahindra in
India to support defence and security
opportunities, initially in sonar systems and
radio equipment. Mahindra is a $17bn
multinational group that is responding to
the signiﬁcant changes that have followed
the election of Prime Minister Modi’s BJP
party to enter the defence sector. In
partnership we have been selected to
supply £30m of torpedo defence systems to
the Indian Navy with further orders
expected. Mahindra have already
demonstrated their ability to build the
system’s countermeasure launcher in
country to the required levels of quality.
• In September we announced a strategic
partnership with NuScale Power in the US
to produce the ﬁrst commercial Small
Modular Reactor (SMR). Ultra will provide
the reactor control and instrumentation
systems for a new kind of nuclear plant
that is a safer, smaller and scalable version
of the pressurised water reactor technology
we are already familiar with from our
submarine propulsion experience.
Incorporating natural safety features, this
safe, reliable, carbon-free power source
takes away many of the issues surrounding
larger nuclear installations. The US and UK
governments are very supportive and Ultra
is ﬁrmly on board at the outset.

Operational highlights 
• The award of an £18m contract for 
the design and development of reactor
control and cooling systems for the
next generation of Royal Navy nuclear
submarines. This continues our close
involvement in the UK submarine
programme supplying critical electrical
and control systems to the Vanguard,
Astute and Future Deterrent platforms. 
• An £18m contract award for the supply
of sonobuoys for the Royal Navy’s
Merlin Maritime Patrol Helicopter ﬂeet.
This contract covers technical design,
development, manufacture and logistic
support of a range of passive and active
buoys capable of detecting modern
conventional and nuclear submarines.
The capability supports forecast export
sales over the next two years to France,
Germany, Sweden, Poland, Turkey, UAE
and Australia.
• The award of engineering development
contracts for the Mitsubishi Regional Jet
(MRJ) landing gear and steering gear
control units, adding another long-term
position to our aerospace business.

directly inﬂuenced the Group’s decision in June
to make its largest ever acquisition of the
Electronic Products Division of Kratos Defense
& Security Solutions for $258m, now known
as Ultra Electronics Herley (Herley). Acquisition
of Herley established a major presence in the
Electronic Warfare (EW) market at a time of
strong growth in this sector, correcting an
underweight position. The business comes
with long-term contracts as a specialist
component and sub-system provider to several
major US programmes. Since joining Ultra the
business has been successful in winning new
positions, most recently on the US Navy’s
Surface EW Improvement Programme (SEWIP).
Herley is now part of the Communications &
Security division.
In October the Group acquired Furnace Parts
LLC for $12m, a developer and supplier of
thermocouple-based temperature sensors for
demanding applications in the nuclear and
process control markets. Furnace Parts has
been integrated into Ultra’s existing Nuclear
Sensors & Process Instrumentation (NSPI)
business based in Round Rock, Texas.
Ultra continues to invest between 5% and
6% of revenue in internal development to
refresh and develop new offerings. Segment
analysis and collaboration has allowed the
prioritisation of this development spending to
better match customer interests and funding.
We are also more carefully aligning
development activity across the Group.
Customer needs
Ultra’s underlying behaviours focus heavily on
meeting customer need. By remaining with
technologies and markets we understand
well, and through sustained internal
development investment, we are able to offer
leading technology solutions tailored to
customer need. Our through-life and service
provision supports the Group’s systems,
products and components so we understand
how to deliver successfully. Meeting our
commitments and sustaining our position as
an excellent strategic supplier to our
customers is at the forefront of our
behaviours. These guiding principles are
underpinned by our LEAP and LAUNCH
behaviours (more information on page 45).

Summary
Ultra’s objective remains to outperform the
market in terms of annual increases in
shareholder return. Our long-term
performance is illustrated by the graph below.
In the prevailing markets the Executive Team
must maintain a careful balance between
meeting performance during the year while
investing and positioning for longer-term
growth. I believe that the changes we have
made in our market approach, the improved
management of our portfolio of capabilities
and the new positions we are achieving,
through acquisition, investment and
partnership, will deliver that longer-term
growth. Improved efﬁciency, through delivery
of the S3 programme and through
continuing cost control, will keep Ultra lean
and ﬁt. Balancing this with continuing
autonomy in our individual businesses will
maintain our innovation, sense of ownership
and agility. 
2016 should see stabilising defence and
security budgets in the face of increased
tensions and threats but the impacts will take
time to reach our mid-tier position. Wider
ﬁscal volatility, in oil revenues and reducing
demand from emerging markets, will impact
some of our markets. That said, it is an
improving picture and there are promising
indications of a new growth cycle for defence
and security. 
Increasing efﬁciency and portfolio
rationalisation, together with the beneﬁts 
of sound acquisition, will add to this
improving position. Over the next few years
the acceleration in aerospace production 
will further improve revenue. As a result a
slow but steady reversal of recent declines
can now be anticipated.
None of this happens without a huge
amount of hard work and commitment by
every one of the Group’s 4,843 employees.
At all levels of management, engineering,
production, marketing, HR and ﬁnance
people have gone the extra mile to ensure
we met our market guidance and delivered
for our shareholders. I could not be more
proud of the sustained levels of enthusiasm,
commitment, dedication and resolve that I
see on a daily basis within Ultra. In the ﬁnal
analysis it is this resolve that gives me
conﬁdence in the Group’s future success.

Business model
08 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The value Ultra creates through its business model
enables it in achieving its primary objective:
To outperform the market in terms of annual
increases in shareholder return. 
Ultra constantly innovate 
to meet customer need
Focus on tiers 2-4.
Ultra has no strategic aim to be a tier 1, 
top-level platform provider. The Group is,
therefore, non-threatening to the tier 1
prime contractors such as BAE Systems or
Boeing and counts them amongst its key
customers. They can rely on Ultra to provide
the specialist capabilities at which the Group
is expert. Ultra concentrates on tiers 2, 3
and 4, rather than aiming to be a tier 1
platform provider. 
Ultra’s specialist capabilities are mainly at
tiers 3 and 4, supplying equipment and
components to support tier 1 and 2
systems and programmes. The Group does
undertake tier 2 system integration, but
does this mainly when integrating its own
tier 3 offerings. Ultra, therefore,
understands the tier 3 detailed interfaces
and so is able to manage the risk inherent 
in system integration activities.
Ultra invests 5% of revenue into R&D to
develop new offerings and its customers
invest a further 15%.
Ultra has consistently invested 5% or more of
its revenue in innovation, new products and
business development. In addition, over 15%
of Group revenue is customer-funded product
development. In total over 20% of revenue
spend is focused on augmenting the portfolio
of capabilities and programme positions
which underpin further growth.
Where the Group has a number
of complementary capabilities, it
can also combine these to offer
more comprehensive solutions.
In other words, Ultra’s products,
capabilities and the associated
domain expertise uniquely
position the Group to be able to
meet more complex sub-system
and system requirements.
Tier 1. Platform provider
Responsible for being the prime contractor
of the platform in question, examples being
a naval or a terminal at an airport.
Tier 2. Sub-system integrator
Responsible for integrating equipment or
components that will make up a functional
element of the platform. Examples of
system integration Ultra has completed
include integrated sonar systems and wing
ice protection systems.
Tier 3. Equipment supplier
Ultra has a large presence at this level of the
supply chain, supplying equipment such as
data links, cryptographic equipment and
large electrical transformers.
Tier 4. Component supplier
Ultra also provides a broad range of smaller
components for many programmes
worldwide, including sensors for measuring
the performance of a nuclear reactor and
joysticks to control UAVs.
Ultra faces the market 
with portfolio strength
Eight distinct and wide-ranging 
market segments.
Market segments are the natural evolution
of Ultra’s business model, supporting a shift
from individual products to allow more
complex offerings. This approach establishes
a framework that aligns resources to greater
effect across each market-facing segment.
This in turn supports the development of
coherent strategies against particular end
markets, based upon collective market
research and opportunity capture. The
market segment approach provides the
Group with improved analysis at an
appropriate level of fidelity. This allows Ultra
to better manage and prioritise the Group’s
investments, including R&D alignment and
acquisition strategy.
Acquisition and divestment to position
in growth markets.
Ultra invest in targeted acquisitions to
further strengthen its portfolio and will
dispose of capabilities that no longer ﬁt.
Ultra invests to develop and apply its
domain expertise, capabilities and technical
synergies in common end markets. 
Ultra’s deep understanding of the users’
domain, its enduring customer
relationships and its outward-facing nature,
inform the Group’s investment decisions.
Innovative solutions focused on
customer need.
Ultra creates value by generating innovative
solutions from across its portfolio and by
becoming a key partner in its customers’
design process.
Ultra businesses innovate constantly to 
create solutions (often through highly
specialised disruptive technological
innovation) to customer requirements
which are different from, and better than,
those of the Group’s competitors.

Form external partnerships to develop
the best solution for customers.
Ultra has an established ability to partner and
team (internally and externally) in order to
offer the best-of-breed technologies which
best meets customers’ requirements. The
Group is agnostic as to the source of
technology which is required to deliver
solutions. Where proven technology that
meets customers’ requirements exists outside
the Group, Ultra is happy to form external
teaming partnerships to access it. Ultra sees
these teaming arrangements as a source of
competitive advantage, allowing it to deliver
differentiated solutions which meet customer
needs efficiently. By working together, the
team members are able to win opportunities
which would not be possible in isolation.
Ultra is continually evolving its approach 
in response to:
• changing customer demands
• anticipating the direction of travel of 
the markets
• the Group striving to be the first to
bring new solutions to market
In its specialist capability areas, Ultra’s
understanding of the:
• customers’ domains
• demanding operational environments
• projected capability gaps which
customers would like addressed
This is a key differentiator for the Group. In
short, Ultra’s understanding of the customers’
need allows it to get to the heart of the
customers’ requirements and develop effective
and innovative solutions.
We achieve world class
performance
Agility through a devolved organisation.
A key differentiator for Ultra is the agility
businesses in the Group exhibit in their
dealings with customers.
The Board provides effective leadership 
and direction in delivering the key corporate
objective of reliable and consistent growth 
in shareholder value. At the operational 
level, the Executive Team has responsibility
for running the Group and for delivery 
of strategy, financial performance and 
team development.
Ultra’s individual businesses have a high
degree of operational autonomy, so that
they provide the exceptionally agile and
responsive support to customers and
partners, normally associated with a smaller
business. These benefits of customer focus
and agility are augmented by the access to
wider and complementary technologies and
expertise that lie elsewhere in the Group
(collaborative autonomy) or with partners
and by Ultra’s strong financial position.
Ultra is an excellent and strategic
supplier to its customers. To enable 
this Ultra’s businesses are focused on
helping customers identify their true
needs whilst developing long-term
relationships.
Ultra’s LAUNCH is a behaviour which the
Group has developed to facilitate customer
engagement and relationship building.
LAUNCH is a way for Ultra’s businesses to
generate long-term customer relationships
that leads to a better pipeline of
opportunities and ultimately, enables
growth. This approach ensures Ultra
understands the real needs of its customers
and encourages a long-term strategic
relationship where Ultra’s businesses
become part of the customers’ extended
enterprises, to mutual benefit.
Operational efﬁciency through engaged
competent people with domain expertise.
Ultra believes that the right people, who
embrace and sustain Ultra’s culture and
who have the domain expertise, are its
most important asset in successfully
enabling the Group to deliver value to 
its stakeholders.

Market segment deﬁnition
Ultra Electronics is now making its internal
sophisticated cyber defence capability (see
page 38) available to customers on a
commercial basis under the trading name
of CORVID. Increasing recognition of the
growing threat from internet enabled
cyber-attacks is driving new market
demands that lie well beyond the realms of
normal IT security techniques. Managed
security from CORVID provides advanced
prevention, detection and incident analysis
beyond that which is achieved by typical
Security Operations Centres (SOCs).
CORVID focuses  on reducing an attacker’s
window of opportunity and articulating
exactly what impact a security incident has
to a business, in order to assess damage
and restore operations promptly. CORVID
operates remotely through bespoke and
commercial off the shelf (COTS) software
to allow specialist forensic analysis at a
central location, supported by a uniquely
generated intelligence base. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 13

Market overview
Commercial aerospace remains a vibrant
sector with predictions of worldwide
passenger growth doubling over the next 
15 years. Large aircraft manufacturers are
buoyed by record order backlogs that exceed
12,000 aircraft. This growth in platform
numbers is driven by the demand for new
aircraft in the developing regions while the
more established markets need new aircraft
to replace ageing aircraft as well as to capture
the greater efficiencies in fuel, emissions and
system reliability. The military aerospace
market continues to see growth driven
predominantly by the production ramp up of
the existing major military aircraft
programmes. There are few new military
aircraft programmes, with the market focused
on technical insertion and capability upgrades
of existing airframes.
Market outlook
In the civil aerospace sector the twin aisle
market continues to grow and will remain
dominated by Airbus and Boeing for the
foreseeable future. Ultra provides unique
electrical wing ice protection systems and
position sensing electronics to the Boeing 787
and provides specialist harnessing, landing
gear service panels and a new Electrical
Ground Door Opening system to the new
Airbus A350. The single aisle market is also in
growth and, while currently dominated by
Boeing and Airbus, is seeing new entrants
from China and Canada. The regional aircraft
market is highly competitive and in this sector
Ultra has secured content on the Japanese
Mitsubishi Regional Jet and also the new
Chinese MA700 regional turboprop. Growth
in the business jet market is focused on larger
aircraft, where Ultra has secured business on
the new Gulfstream G650, G600 and G500
as well as the Cessna Citation Longitude. In
the rotary wing market the large reduction in
energy prices is reducing orders from the oil
and gas rig servicing businesses and key
requirements in this market are minimising
aircraft through-life costs. In the military
aerospace sector, the fixed wing combat
aircraft market will be dominated for the next
20 years by the increasing build rate and
entry-into-service of the F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter and its F-135 engine. Ultra provides
significant content to this aircraft/engine
combination including precision pneumatics
(HiPPAG) for weapons ejection and the engine
inlet ice protection system controller. The air
transport market is seeing a number of
competitors looking to fill the niches left by
C-17 and C-130. In this sector Ultra has
secured positions on the Embraer KC-390 and
on the Airbus A400M. The UAV market
remains attractive however, it is still crowded
and relatively immature.
Ultra’s portfolio strength
Ultra’s CORE capabilities include:
• Ice Protection and Detection
• Position Sensing and Control
• Active Noise & Vibration Control
• Health & Usage Monitoring
• Fuel System Solutions
• Ground Handling Equipment
• Pilot Controls
• Data and Power Transfer
• Stores and Gas Management
Strategy in action
In 2015, Ultra’s ICE business in Kansas,

Market overview
Transportation, including airport systems and
rail, remains an area of strong investment
worldwide. The increase in global air traffic
and national prestige projects is driving
investment in airport infrastructure, although
competition in this sector is also growing. Rail
infrastructure, globally, is also growing rapidly
as a key commercial and national enabler in
both established and emerging economies. 
In established economies infrastructure
investment is focused on upgrading existing
capabilities and driving economic recovery. In
emerging economies, such investment is
being used to secure growth and build
national capacity. Increasing global demand
for energy has led to the power generation,
power distribution, secure power
management and renewables markets also
witnessing increased investment. Energy
dominates the global trend in smart
infrastructure, with Smart Grid and secure
energy management lying at the heart of
Smart Cities and Critical National
Infrastructure. Whilst global infrastructure
demand is largely being driven by China,
India and the Middle East and North Africa
region, at least 50% of the global market for
smart solutions lies in Europe and the US.
Market outlook
In the airport sector, the market for Airport
Master Systems Integration continues to
experience growth, especially in the demand
for tier 2 airports. This is particularly so in
South America, the Middle East and Asia,
where there are number of key capital
projects. The Airport & Airline Information
Management market is also forecast to see
investment grow, although many of the
operational systems are becoming increasingly
commoditised. There is growing polarisation
between global commoditised offerings and
those with more localised niche expertise, so
Ultra has continued to focus upon market
intimacy, customer relationships and
comprehensive solutions over individual
products. The Rail Transit Power Conversion &
Control market is also anticipated to see
significant growth. However, with the
exception of the Rail Control sector and the
drive toward Smart Digital solutions, the
market is becoming increasingly price-sensitive.
In the Power Management & Renewables
sector, the growing need for compact, power
dense solutions plays to Ultra capabilities with
power resilience, energy storage and fast
switching all being key drivers for growth. The
Secure Energy Management sector is forecast
to see substantial investment, particularly in
areas related to secure monitoring, analysis
and control. The emergent Smart Grid market
relies on the ability to securely identify each
connected device and, in September, Ultra
launched a cyber-hardened critical
infrastructure management system to improve
site management and performance without
the need to replace legacy equipment. Whilst
the Smart Grid market is likely to remain
fragmented until the appropriate regulatory
frameworks are established, Ultra’s broader
secure communication and data portfolio
places it in a strong position with the Group
able to offer the highest level of assurance
that can be gained for the storage of unique
digital keys and identifiers of devices.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Market overview
There are over 440 commercial nuclear power
reactors operating in 31 countries. They
provide over 11% of the world’s electricity as
continuous, reliable base-load power and
remain an important part of the low carbon
energy mix. In addition 56 countries operate
around 240 civil research reactors, with many
of these in developing countries. Globally
there are over 65 new reactors under
construction. Many of the new builds are
proceeding within emerging economies and
in those countries where there is substantial
state backing. The emphasis in established
western markets has, however, largely shifted
to a shorter-term focus on safety system
upgrades, life extensions and emergency
management and plant sustainment
programmes. In addition to this, the UK is
proceeding with a new commercial model it
pioneered in support of new nuclear build
ambitions. The nuclear market is generally
very conservative and supported through
large multinational organisations; however,
there remain several complex niches served by
smaller specialist companies. It is a highly
regulated market, with high barriers to entry,
and as such is dominated by a number of
well-established global players. The
qualification of sensors and products across
multiple standards and platforms is extremely
expensive and offers further barriers to entry
once established.
Market outlook
Although the nuclear market is a long cycle
one, with plants taking several years to come
to completion, the outlook is positive. Much
of the current global fleet of plants will need
life extensions and upgrades. These plants
are largely older analogue Instrumentation
and Control (I&C) designs, with the biggest
market by far being the US. The new build,
digital I&C market that is currently dominated
by China, India and Russia, is of a similar
order of magnitude. Ultra has invested
significantly in new facilities for the test,
development and manufacture of sensors.
This has shown its value through further
contract wins with EDF for the provision of
specialist sensors and with the Strategic
Partnership announcement with NuScale to
develop a suite of reactor and plant
instrumentation and control systems 
for their Small Modular Reactor (SMR). The
Group currently provides equipment to over
190 reactors across 16 countries, plus
another 32 reactors currently under
construction. Furthermore Ultra is uniquely
qualified on eight new types (as well as many
legacy plants), meaning that it is well
positioned for the future.
The Fukushima accident prompted further
growth in the nuclear emergency
management market, where there has been a
global reassessment of post-accident
response and support needs. Plant safety is
now increasingly reliant on secure data and,
as such, cyber security is now a key part of
meeting the formal safety requirements.
Security concerns around proliferation and
the threat of terrorism are also driving the
growth in new deployable security and
surveillance systems for nuclear plants and
enhanced border security. Ultra’s domain
knowledge, through its suitably qualified and
experienced personnel (SQEP), coupled with
its extensive security and surveillance
capabilities (as described in C2ISR segment
on page 18), position Ultra well in this sector.
Through its established relationships with Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEMs), the domain knowledge of its Suitably

Market overview
The military and security communications
market is seeing a greater demand for
interoperability, mobility and rapid
deployment solutions, alongside an increased
desire for smaller, faster, easier to use
technology that is less complex to configure.
Many nations have a plethora of
communications systems in service and there
is a drive to streamline these to achieve
coherency and cost-effectiveness, which is
translating into the gradual modernisation of
legacy equipment and systems. The
customers’ desire to maintain interoperability
throughout these modernisation programmes
is resulting in small evolutionary changes, as
opposed to step changes, an approach that
allows customers to exploit commercial and
modified commercial off the shelf (COTS)
technology. In particular, there is a shift
towards using software defined solutions that
enable fast cycle upgrades to capability and
the use of open and commercial standards. 
The other key factor driving the market in the
exploitation of COTS technology is the
reduced funding that military customers have
to develop bespoke solutions. Many nations
wish to procure low risk and proven systems,
rather than being the first adopters or having
to fund the development. Additionally,
overseas customers want the ability to
implement their own waveforms and
cryptographic algorithms. Globally, there is a
growing reliance on Machine-to-Machine
(M2M) communications, especially in critical
national infrastructure. With the rising
prevalence of connected devices and the
growth in the “Internet of Things” (IoT), the
secure low power communication market is
also experiencing a considerable increase.
Market outlook
In general, the demand to deliver secure
voice, data and video communications will
increase, driving the requirement for faster
performance using lower cost platforms.
More specifically, the data link market, in
which Ultra is well placed with its wide range
of advanced data link and airborne gateway
solutions, will see a growing demand for
secure full motion video and C2 links to
deliver real time situational awareness to the
smallest platforms at the tactical edge. This, in
turn, will continue to drive the demand for
more bandwidth and broader connectivity,
and thus for higher performance tactical
communication systems such as the Ultra
Orion multi-mission radio. In the satellite
earth station market, the move to smaller,
more portable and mobile solutions that
deliver higher bandwidth X and Ka band
solutions will accelerate over the next five
years, driven by the rapid expansion of High
Throughput Satellite (HTS) capacity and the
migration of users to Ka band services. Ultra
has a strong pedigree in this sector and is
positioning to capitalise on this development. 
Looking at the encryption market, there is a
general move to smaller form factor products
and from link to Internet Protocol (IP)-based
cryptographic solutions, coupled with a shift
from paper-based key to electronic key
distribution and management systems. Ultra,
with its proven next generation of end
cryptographic products and strong position in
both UK and US cryptographic programmes,
allied to the Group’s electronic key
distribution and management solutions, is
well positioned in this sector. Finally, with the
vulnerabilities of M2M communications
becoming increasingly apparent and a
growing recognition of the need for solutions
to secure such systems, the secure M2M
market will continue to grow. Here again
Ultra’s proven certified security solutions, that
are tailored to meet critical national
infrastructure and industrial needs, position
the Group well. Similarly, the increasing
secure low power communication market will
enable Ultra to build on its reputation as a
trusted supplier of wireless network solutions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Market overview
Budgets for security remain ring-fenced or
are growing substantially in the face of
terrorism, organised crime and drug
trafficking. Border security and Critical
National Infrastructure (CNI) protection
opportunities are increasing, driving the
requirement for surveillance and security
solutions. The market is seeing a growing
demand for interoperable and mobile
networks that deliver a single integrated
picture for timely situational awareness. With
a growing number of devices capable of
collecting sensor data operating across
multiple communications networks, integrated
surveillance systems continue to increase in
complexity and scale. Solutions need to be
tailored to customer need, comprehensive and
able to draw on“best-of-breed” , established
and clearly differentiated technologies. 
The reliance on air power as the principal
mechanism for early or urgent delivery of
military effect is driving the demand for
airborne intelligence, surveillance, target
acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR). In this
regard, there has been a significant growth in
the use of unmanned air vehicles and the
associated intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance payloads. The challenge
remains to be the timely and secure
dissemination of such data, typically video,
around the battlespace.
Market Outlook
In the civil security market, political,
economic and social factors will continue to
drive growth in the border surveillance and
security market. This is seeing a move from
more traditional approaches to high tech
networked solutions, and Ultra has all the
necessary elements to deliver these for
multiple applications. The CNI protection
market is also expected to see significant
growth and here Ultra is well positioned to
provide complete cyber-physical security
solution drawing on its advanced secure
communications and surveillance capabilities.
The communications and intelligence
surveillance market will also continue to see
demand, but remains politically sensitive in
some countries.
In the defence market, the demand for
precision strike, reduced collateral damage
and extended stand-off ranges will continue.
There will also be more emphasis on
intelligence and surveillance assets, together
with the ability to fuse or correlate these data
streams into a single real time integrated
picture that can be disseminated down to the
lowest level. This will continue to drive the
growth in real time ISTAR (for both manned
and unmanned platforms) and the connectivity
between assets in the battlespace. Ultra’s
leading data fusion, situational awareness and
visualisation systems play well to this growing
need. Electronic Warfare (EW) is also gaining in
prominence. The worldwide EW market is
forecast to grow significantly over the next few
years and Ultra, with the acquisition of Herley
last summer, is well placed to strengthen and
widen its EW offerings and grow its share of
the EW market.

Market overview
The proliferation of the modern submarine
threat is driving increased opportunity in the
underwater warfare market. Submarines are
strategic assets, fulfilling a range of roles from
intelligence gathering to area denial operations.
The growth in the number of submarine
platforms, coupled with the increasingly
capable Russian submarine force and the
growing threats in the Middle and Far East, is
seen to be challenging the traditional
western underwater technological superiority.
Investment in ASW is growing rapidly as
nations react to counter these threats.
Global financial pressures coupled with
increased capital platform costs mean that
nations can typically no longer afford
platforms dedicated to a specific role.
Instead, they are generally moving to use of
more, smaller multi-role platforms, of frigate
or offshore patrol vessel size. As a result,
ASW solutions now need to be modular with
reduced footprints to fit on these smaller
vessels. Other key factors in this growing
ASW market are the desire for short to no
development times, requiring investment in
advance of contract awards. Ultra has
positioned itself well in both of these areas,
with continued investment in ASW
technologies including multi-static active
systems and sonobuoys for use with
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). A key
export market driver is the increasing
requirement for indigenous technology
transfer to overseas customers, another area
where Ultra has a strong pedigree with
recent export contracts.
Market outlook
The US continues its strategic rebalancing
towards Asia (the “pivot to the Pacific”). As a
result, despite the wider US government
funding pressures, ASW and submarines
remain areas of preferential spend with
increased budget allocation. Specifically, the
US Secretary of Defense has directed the
Navy to adjust their budget to prioritise
acceleration of submarine combat system
upgrades, torpedo production and next
generation torpedo countermeasures. Ultra’s
Underwater Warfare segment has leadership
positions for these specific areas in and
beyond the US market, particularly with
torpedo warning systems, torpedo
countermeausres and small arrays. More
broadly in the addressable Asia-Pacific
market, spend related to ASW systems,
including towed torpedo defence solutions, is
projected to rise to almost £0.5bn. India
intends to award three major ASW-related
programmes totalling in excess of £100m
over the next five years. Ultra is well placed
to address these needs based on its
continued investment in integrated sonar
systems and surface ship torpedo defence
system technologies, both of which have
enabled recent contract wins in the UK and
New Zealand patrol aircraft requirements.
Ultra’s world-leading domain knowledge, acoustic technical expertise
and ability to provide leading technology Anti-Submarine Warfare
(ASW) performance through rapidly delivered, scalable, affordable
and reliable solutions means that it is well positioned to exploit this
growing market.
Ultra’s portfolio strength
Ultra’s CORE capabilities include:
• Full understanding of acoustic
performance in the maritime domain
• Multi-Static Active processing

Underwater Warfare 20 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Market overview
In Ultra’s established defence markets
customers are now generally looking to 
re-establish balanced force presence and
intervention capabilities without the risk
exposure of a forced land footprint. As such,
after a decade of land-based operations, the
focus on spending has now moved towards
maritime, air and Special Forces. Ever-present
budget pressures mean new build maritime
programmes have generally reduced either in
number or scale. As a result, existing
platforms are typically now being extended
beyond their original service lives and
customers are seeking more cost-effective
ways of increasing the capabilities of their
navies. Consequently the demand for
system/sensor upgrades and technology
insertion programmes on existing hulls is
growing, particularly for navies in emerging
nations. For the export market in general,
new build maritime platform programmes are
often dominated by the industrial politics of
the nation concerned, especially if they have
indigenous capabilities. As a result,
technology transfer is an increasingly
important factor enabling business in the
export market.
Market outlook
The power products segment in the US
market remains stable with Virginia Class
Submarine (VCS) production funding well
protected. Longer-term growth opportunities
for Ultra specialist power products will come
with the Ohio Replacement Programme (ORP),
projected to provide 12 new hulls beginning
in 2021. The use of common subsystems with
VCS will help lower the cost growth risk that
currently exists on ORP . The US Navy is
investing in technical refresh of Arleigh
Burkeclass guided missile destroyers (DDG-
51), Ohio class submarines, landing platform
dock (LPD-17) and replenishment naval vessel
(T-AKE class) that provides further
opportunities for growth of the Group’s
advanced power management and signature
management products.
With the protection of maritime resources
rising in importance in areas such as the
South China Sea, there are increasing
requirements for submarines with extended
patrol times. The advent of air independent
propulsion capability is expected to increase
demand for power conversion and
degaussing products. Incumbent positions on
the UK Successor submarine development
programme will enable the high probability
of production follow on for main static
converters, electric cruise propulsion and
signature management. Clean Power
requirements of DoD and aerospace
specifications will continue to drive the need
for Ultra’s specialty components highlighted
by power filters and multi-phase
transformers. The Group’s specialist signature
management capabilities will see growth
opportunities in the next five years through
the US Navy’s Ohio Replacement Programme,
replacement new fleet oilers (TAO-X) and
DDG-51 upgrades. There is also increased
focus on electric field signature management
due to the growing awareness of influence
mine threat.
More broadly, the continuing demand for
surface platform system and sensor upgrades
plays well to Ultra’s strengths in naval combat
systems and electro-optics and the Group’s
pedigree in partnering with local industry.
Combining open architectures and niche electronic solutions, 
Ultra provides affordable, reliable solutions to meet customer 
needs in power and electronics for maritime platforms.

Market overview
In general the focus of military forces is to
reset away from the “hold and build”
operations of the last decade, back to
building more balanced and full spectrum
capable forces. This has seen a shift in
spending away from the Land sector, which
has resulted in a reduction in the number of
new land vehicle programmes in Ultra’s
established markets. Instead there has been a
significant growth in the number of major
capability enhancements and life extension
programmes for land platforms. This plays to
Ultra’s strengths in electronic vehicle
architectures. Land platforms are now
increasingly complex, with multiple sensors,
weapons and communication systems. These
complex electronics are driving the increased
electrical generation capacity and
management within the platform.
Market outlook
In the UK and European markets the
reduction in the number of new vehicle
programmes has been partially offset by a
significant increase in the number of platform
life-extension and technical insertion
programmes. Further, there are also upgrade
programmes as a number of platforms’
procured to meet urgent operational
requirements over the last decade of
operations, are now being absorbed back into
core service. Ultra, as a provider of specialist
capabilities, is well positioned to be able to
support such upgrade programmes. In the
UK, the Group has teamed with Morgan
Advanced Materials to provide the through
life support of the UK Mastiff platforms. In
the US, despite the budgetary pressures that
led to the cancellation of several large new
vehicle programmes, the DoD has funds for a
number of platform upgrade programmes,
that offer opportunities for Ultra given the
Group’s electronic architecture capabilities.
More broadly, the export market place is
growing with a number of prospective new
vehicle and upgrade programmes being
initiated. This includes the established markets
of India and Australia and the emerging
markets in the Middle and Far East. In the
Middle East, Ultra is working in partnership
with an indigenous platform provider to
support the upgrade of the existing vehicle
fleet. Combined, these potential programmes
offer significant opportunities and volumes.
Military forces are beginning to look at how
they can integrate soldiers and their associated
systems into the wider land battlespace. Ultra
is actively exploring opportunities with a
number of customers regarding how it can
apply its advanced power management
technologies to the soldier.
With defined open architectures and niche electronic solutions,
Ultra has a growing position in the provision of innovative,
affordable and reliable solutions to meet customer needs in power
and electronics for the land environment.

Land systems Ultra’s 2015 results
The order book at the end of 2015 was
£753.8m compared to £787.3m in the prior
year. Acquisitions, primarily Herley, contributed
7.3% and there was a foreign exchange
beneﬁt of 0.9%, however, there was an
underlying order book decline of 12.5%. This
reﬂected the delay into 2016 of over £100m
of orders, a substantial number of which are
expected to be secured in the ﬁrst half of the
year. This includes the UK sonobuoy partnering
and India torpedo defence orders. 
Revenue
The revenue of £726.3m represented an
increase of 1.8%, or £12.6m, on the prior year
(2014: £713.7m). A 5.9% increase reﬂecting
the impact of acquisitions, together with a
beneﬁt from the positive impact of foreign
exchange on overseas revenues, was partially
offset by an organic decline of 8.1%, 2.1% of
which related to the Oman Airport IT contract
which was terminated on 9 February 2015.
With approximately 50% of revenues sold in
US Dollars, Ultra was impacted by the
reduction in the US Dollar rate to 1.53 (2014:
1.65) which increased revenues by 4.0%.

“
” Acquisitions contributed 5.9% to revenue,
primarily reﬂecting the impact of Herley
together with Furnace Parts, acquired during
2015, as well as contributions from 3 Phoenix,
Forensic Technology, Ice Corporation and 
Lab Impex Systems all of which were acquired
during 2014. 
Excluding the impact of Oman, the organic
revenue decline of 6.0% comprised
reductions across all three divisions.
Aerospace & Infrastructure sales were
impacted by the termination of the Oman
contract, as well as a reduction in revenue
from the A400M NIM programme, reﬂecting
contract phasing. However, these were
partially offset by an increase in Aerospace
sales, in particular on the MRJ and the JSF
programmes, and in revenues from Airport
Systems including the Orange County
contract in the US. Revenue from vehicle
programmes, including the Warrior, Scout
and Middle East NIMR, also increased.
Communications & Security was impacted by
the repeal of the US Patriot Act that
signiﬁcantly reduced domestic legal intercept
revenues in the SoTech business; however,
this was offset by an increase in revenue from
security and surveillance products and from
the ECU RP programme. This division saw the
beneﬁt of the acquisition of Herley in 2015
together with the prior year acquisition of
Forensic Technology.
In Maritime & Land there was an increase in
sales of US and international sonobuoys
reﬂecting the pivot to the Paciﬁc, and also in
revenue on the Sonar 2050 programme for
the UK MoD. This was offset by the impact 
of funding delays on the Torpedo Warning
System in the US and by a reduction in rail
power management revenue. The acquisition
of 3 Phoenix in the prior year contributed to
divisional sales.
Operating proﬁt and margins*
Underlying operating proﬁt* was £120.0m
(2014: £118.1m). Acquisition growth
contributed 4.9% and foreign exchange
1.9%, which was partially offset by an organic
decline of 5.2%. The Group’s businesses
maintained their focus on restructuring their
cost bases which sustained an underlying
operating margin of 16.5% (2014: 16.5%). 
Following the securing of a number of new
orders to develop products for the aerospace
sector, Aerospace & Infrastructure margins
have been impacted by increased R&D
investment and lower margins during the
engineering phases of projects. There were
also restructuring costs at the CEMS business.
This was partially offset by higher margins as
vehicle programmes enter the production
phase. In Communications & Security, there
were higher margins as the CIS ECU RP
programme completes its production phases.
This more than offsets the impact of both the
loss of high margin revenue and the associated
restructuring costs in the SoTech business. In
Maritime & Land, margins reﬂected the release
of some contract risk reserve in the prior year. 
Acquisitions contributed an additional £5.8m
to proﬁt, primarily in Communications &
Security, reﬂecting the acquisition of Herley in
2015 and Forensic Technology during 2014.
The integration of Herley is on schedule, with
$1m of the acquisition case synergies already
actioned and a further $0.5m planned. In
addition, Herley’s future position is improved
by its selection for more than expected of the
modules in the major US Surface Electronic
Warfare Improvement Programme (SEWIP),
securing signiﬁcant revenue opportunities
over many years.
Ultra continues to invest in research and
development to support future opportunities;
this investment, at £36.0m, represented 5.0%
of Group turnover.
The Group’s Standardisation & Shared
Services programme (S3) is on track. The UK
Shared Service Centre will be set up during
2016, and the ERP strategy phase will identify
the ERPs to be used across the Group. c£3m

Interest and proﬁt before tax*
Net ﬁnancing charges*, excluding the
unwinding of discounts on provisions, fair value
movement on derivatives and the net interest
charge on deﬁned beneﬁt pensions, were
£7.6m (2014: £6.1m). The increase reﬂected
higher debt balances as a result of the
acquisition of Herley during the year, partially
offset by the impact of lower rates following
the renewal of the £100m revolving credit
facility during the year. The interest on bank
debt was covered 16 times (2014: 20 times) by

KPI IFRS proﬁt before tax
Ultra’s IFRS proﬁt before tax increased from
£21.5m (2014) to £34.8m. In the prior year an
exceptional non-underlying charge of £46.9m
relating to the termination of Oman Airport IT
contract was recognised in proﬁt before tax. In
2015, the deemed disposal of Ithra resulted in
a non-cash, non-underlying IFRS accounting
charge. It arises from the liquidation of the
Ithra contract vehicle following the termination
of the Oman contract. Proﬁt before tax also
includes a £2.7m charge reﬂecting the sale of
Ultra’s minority shareholding in the Al Shaheen
joint venture, following a review of activities in
the Middle East and a £5.7m charge to impair
the intangible ﬁxed asset impacted by the
repeal of the US Patriot Act. The prior year
included the impairment of the acquired
goodwill relating to Al Shaheen.
The £9.4m of acquisition related costs
primarily reﬂected costs incurred on the
acquisition of Herley during the year. In the
prior year, £4.5m of acquisition related
adjustments included the release of an £8.4m
provision relating to the GigaSat earn out
agreement for which the 2014 target was
not met.
The start-up costs of the S3 programme,
include onerous lease costs relating to
facility consolidations. 
Tax, EPS and dividends
The underlying tax rate* reduced slightly to
22.8% (2014: 23.2%) reﬂecting lower UK
tax rates.
Underlying earnings per share* were 123.9p
(2014: 123.1p), an increase of 0.6%. A ﬁnal
dividend of 32.3p (2014: 31.1p) is proposed. If
this is approved at the Annual General Meeting,
this will give a full year dividend of 46.1p (2014:
44.3p) and will be covered 2.7 times.
Operating cash ﬂow
Underlying operating cash ﬂow* was £81.3m
(2014: £83.1m) and the ratio of cash to
underlying operating proﬁt was 68% (2014:
70%). Excluding outﬂow of £10.8m relating
to the Oman airport IT contract cash
conversion would have been 77%.
The cash to underlying operating proﬁt ratio
over a rolling ﬁve-year period is 77%. 
Depreciation and disposals were slightly higher
than last year reﬂecting the sale of an airport
systems building in the UK.
Capital expenditure, including on systems, was
lower than last year, at £4.6m (2014: £10.7m)
as we scheduled ERP upgrades into 2016 in
order that they can be implemented through
the S3 programme. The net outﬂow on
intangible capital expenditure reduced
reﬂecting capitalised development of £0.9m
compared to £5.0m in the prior year.
Working capital increased by £40.0m (2014:
decrease £12.2m), reﬂecting a reduction in
creditors and an increase in debtors, partially
offset by a reduction in inventory. 
Included in creditors was a £10.8m impact
relating to settlement of sub-contractors
following the termination of the Oman airport
IT contract. There was also an £20m impact
relating to the unwind of a number of
advanced payment balances including on the
ECU RP contract and on the US sonobuoy
IDIQ. Debtors increased reﬂecting the timing
of delivery on vehicle programmes. This was
partially offset by a £6.6m reduction in
inventory, resulting from the Company-wide
initiative targeting working capital.
The other outﬂow primarily represents the
pension deﬁcit reduction payments of £8.5m
agreed with the trustees. 
Finally during the period we received an £5.3m
dividend from Al Shaheen.

Financial review (continued) Non-operating cash ﬂow
With underlying operating cash ﬂow* of
£81.3m (2014: £83.1m), the Group funded
various non-operating items with net debt
increasing to £295.6m (2014: £129.5m). 
The main non-operating items were:
• cash tax of £17.3m (2014: £22.9m) 
• acquisition spend of £179.1m (2014:
£107.5m) including acquisition fees and
other acquisition related payments, with
the majority of the spend in respect of the
two acquisitions completed in the year
• dividend payments of £31.3m (2014:
£29.7m)
Effect of acquisitions
The two acquisitions made in the year, Herley
and Furnace Parts, were made at a total
purchase consideration of £176.3m, including
related acquisition fees of £5.3m. The
purchase consideration includes cash acquired
of £0.7m. In addition, £3.5m was spent on
prior year acquisitions and fees.
Banking facilities
Ultra’s current banking facilities amount to
£451.8m in total, together with a £15.0m
overdraft. They are provided by a small club of
banks, led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, and
comprise three tranches all of which are due
to expire in August 2019. The ﬁrst two
tranches comprise £200m and £100m
revolving credit facilities, that can be drawn
down in any major currency. During the
period, the £100m facility, that was due to
expire in December 2017 was extended and
amended to match the favourable interest
pricing of the £200m facility. The third tranche
is a $225m term loan which was put in place
at the time of the Herley acquisition. The
covenants match the revolving credit facilities.
The Group also has a “shelf” facility with
Prudential Investment Management Inc
(‘Pricoa’). This agreement effectively gives 
the Group access to the US private placement
market on a bilateral basis. The facility is 
non-committed, but is for up to $195m. At 
31 December 2015, $70m of loan notes had
been issued, that will mature in 2018 and
2019. By using the Pricoa facility, Ultra has
been able to extend the term proﬁle of its
debt at a competitive rate.
As well as being used to fund acquisitions,
the ﬁnancing facilities are also used for other
balance sheet and operational needs,
including funding day-to-day working capital
requirements. The US Dollar borrowings also
represent natural hedges against assets
denominated in that currency. 
At the year end, the total borrowings drawn
from the revolving facilities were £140.2m
(2014: £122.0m), giving headroom of
£159.8m (2014: £178.0m) in addition to the
£15m overdraft. £47.2m (2014: £44.8m) of
Pricoa loan notes had been issued. The
Group also held £45.5m of cash, which was
held for working capital purposes and to
fund acquisitions.
The Group’s balance sheet remains resilient,
with net debt/EBITDA of 2.2 and net interest
payable on borrowings covered around 16
times by underlying operating proﬁt.
Interest rate management
Much of the Group’s current ﬁnancing has
been taken on to fund acquisitions in North
America. To reduce the risks associated with
interest rate ﬂuctuations and the associated
volatility in reported earnings, Ultra has
issued a total of $70m of ﬁxed-rate, seven-
year notes to Pricoa. Consequently, the
Group has extended the term proﬁle of its
debt and has also ﬁxed a substantial
proportion of its interest for the same 
seven-year period. The amount of ﬁxed-term
debt and the associated interest rate policy is
kept under regular review. During 2015,
interest rate hedging was put in place to
ensure that 40% of forecast debt was at a
ﬁxed rate at year end.

” Pensions
Ultra offers Company-funded retirement
beneﬁts to all employees in its major countries
of operation. Many UK staff with longer
service still participate in the Ultra Electronics
Limited deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, which was
closed to new entrants in 2003. This is a
contributory scheme in which the Company
makes the largest element of the payments,
that are topped up by employee
contributions. The scheme was actuarially
assessed, using the projected unit method at
31 December 2015, when the net scheme
deﬁcit, calculated in accordance with IAS19,
was £68.1m, compared to £68.6m in 2014.
The present value of the liabilities rose by
£1.2m in 2015. The increase in the scheme
liabilities was more than offset by a £3.7m
increase in the value of the scheme assets.
There was a full actuarial assessment carried
out as of April 2013, the result of which was
a funding deﬁcit relating to past service of
£99.8m before tax, representing an increase
of £36.2m from the previous funding deﬁcit.
Following the completion of the assessment,
Ultra reached agreement with the pension
scheme trustee board to eliminate the deﬁcit
through additional deﬁcit payments over a
10.5-year period; it was £8.0m in 2014, rising
to £8.5m in 2015 and £9.0m per annum for
the following 8.5 years. The next valuation
will take place as of April 2016.
During 2015 a consultation took place with
the members on a proposal to close the
scheme to future beneﬁt accrual from 5 April
2016. Following the end of the consultation
and discussion with the Trustee, it was
announced to members on 1 February 2016
that the Company had agreed with the
Trustee the terms under which the scheme is
to be closed and that the proposed closure
would go ahead. 
The scheme has a statement of investment
principles which includes a speciﬁc declaration
on socially responsible investment. This is
delegated to the investment managers.
Pension management and governance is
undertaken by the pension trustees on behalf
of the members. The trustees include both
Company-nominated and employee-elected
representatives.
All staff who have joined Ultra in the UK since
the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme was closed in
2003, have been invited to become members
of the Ultra Electronics Group Personal Pension
Plan and since April 2011, the Ultra Electronics
Group Flexible Retirement Plan. Under the
terms of this deﬁned contribution scheme,
Company payments are supplemented by
contributions from employees.
Certain employees at TCS in Canada
participate in a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. This
scheme is closed to new employees and had
an IAS19 net deﬁcit of £0.6m at the end of
the year (2014: £0.9m). Regular payments
continue to be made, with both Company
and employees making contributions, so as to
maintain a satisfactory funding position. The
Group’s remaining Canadian employees
participate in a number of deﬁned
contribution pension plans. In the US, Ultra
offers a deﬁned contribution 401(k)
retirement beneﬁt plan to all full-time
employees. Under this plan, Ultra provides
participating and contributing employees with
matching contributions, subject to plan and
US Internal Revenue Service limitations.
Certain employees at the Swiss subsidiary of
Forensic Technology, acquired during 2014,
participate in a deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme. The scheme had an IAS19 net deﬁcit
of £0.7m at 31 December 2015 (2014: £0.2m).

“
” Foreign exchange risks
Ultra’s results are affected by both the
translation and transaction effects of foreign
currency movements. By their nature, currency
translation risks cannot be mitigated, but the
transaction position is actively managed. 
The majority of sales made by Ultra’s
businesses are made in local currency, thus
avoiding any transaction risk. However, this
risk does arise when businesses make sales
and purchases which are denominated in
foreign currencies, most often in US Dollars. 
To reduce the potential volatility, Ultra
attempts to source, in US Dollars, a high
proportion of the products sold in US Dollars.
For the remaining net expense, the Group’s
policy is to hedge forward the foreign currency
trading exposure in order to increase certainty.
The expected ﬂows are reviewed on a regular
basis and additional layers of cover are taken
out so that, for 2016, 100% of the expected
exposure is covered, reducing to 80% of the
exposure for 2017, 50% for 2018 and 30%
for 2019. Exposure to other currencies is
hedged as it arises on speciﬁc contracts.
Statement of going concern
Ultra’s committed banking facilities amount
to £451.8m in total, together with a 
£15.0m overdraft. They were established in
three tranches. 
The ﬁrst tranche comprises £100m of
revolving credit, denominated in Sterling, US
Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars or
Euros. This facility was signed in December
2012, amended and extended in July 2015
and expires in August 2019. The facility is
provided by a group of ﬁve banks. 
The second tranche provides a further £200m
of revolving credit in the same currencies. This
was signed in August 2014 with seven banks
and expires in August 2019. Both facilities
have the same covenants.
The third tranche, agreed in May 2015, is a
$225m term loan with a group of four banks
from our existing lending group. This loan,
denominated in US Dollars, was drawn in full
in August 2015 to complete the Herley
acquisition. The covenants match the revolving
credit facilities.
The Group has a “shelf” facility with Pricoa.
This agreement gives the Group access to the
US private placement market on a bilateral
basis. The facility is non-committed but is for
up to $195m. At the year end $70m of loan
notes had been issued, which mature in 2018
and 2019.
As well as being used to fund acquisitions, the
ﬁnancing facilities are also used for other
balance sheet and operational needs,
including the funding of day-to-day working
capital requirements. The US Dollar borrowings
also represent natural hedges against assets
denominated in that currency. Details of how
Ultra manages its liquidity risk can be found in
note 23 – Financial Instruments and Financial
Risk Management.
Though global macro-economic conditions
remain uncertain, the long-term nature of
Ultra’s business and its positioning in attractive
sectors of its markets, taken together with the
Group’s forward order book, provide a
satisfactory level of conﬁdence in respect of
trading in the year to come. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group has adequate resources for a
period of at least 12 months from the date of
approval of the ﬁnancial statements and have
therefore assessed that the going concern
basis of accounting is appropriate in preparing
the ﬁnancial statements and that there are no
material uncertainties to disclose.
Long-term viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the
2014 revision of the Code, the Directors have
assessed the viability of the Company over a
longer period than the 12 months required by
the going concern basis of accounting. The
Board conducted this review for a period of
three years to December 2018, to coincide
with its review of the Group’s ﬁnancial
budgets and medium-term forecasts from its
Strategic Plan. The certainty is lower in later
years due to the inherent uncertainties in
forecasting future performance. The Strategic
Plan is underpinned by the regular Executive
Team reviews of business unit performance,
market opportunities and associated risks. The
assessment has taken into account the
Group’s current position and the potential
impact of the principal risks documented in
the Strategic Report. Based on this
assessment, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company will be able to
continue in operation and meet its liabilities
as they fall due over the period to December
2018. In making this statement the Directors
have considered the resilience of the Group,
taking account of its current position, the
principal risks facing the business in severe
but reasonable scenarios and the effectiveness
of any mitigating actions. This assessment has
considered the potential impacts of these risks
on the business model, future performance,
solvency and liquidity over the period. The
Directors have determined that the three-year
period to December 2018 is an appropriate
period to provide its viability statement. In
making their assessment, the Directors have
taken account of the Group’s robust balance
sheet, its ﬁnancial covenant headroom, its
ability to raise new ﬁnance in different
ﬁnancial market conditions and its key
potential mitigating action of restricting
dividend payments.
This conclusion is based on a review of the
resources available to the Group, taking
account of the Group’s ﬁnancial projections
together with available cash and committed
borrowings, ﬁnancial covenants and any
material uncertainties. In reaching this
conclusion, the Board has considered the
magnitude of potential impacts resulting from
uncertain future events or changes in
conditions, the likelihood of their occurrence
and the likely effectiveness of mitigating actions
that the Directors would consider undertaking.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The indicators shown below have been identiﬁed by the Board as
giving the best overall indication of the Group’s long-term success in
improving its FTSE ranking by outperforming the market.
Comment
Revenue increased by 1.8% or
£12.6m to £726.3m. A 5.9%
increase reﬂecting the impact of
acquisitions, together with a
4.0% beneﬁt from the positive
impact of foreign exchange on
overseas revenues was partially
offset by an organic decline of
8.1%. 2.1% (or £14.9m) of the
decline related to the Oman
Airport IT contract which was
terminated in February 2015. 
Comment
Underlying proﬁt before tax was
£112.4m (2014 £112.0m). This
contributed to an underlying
operating margin of 16.5%
(2014: 16.5%).
Comment
Underlying operating earnings
per share in the year were
123.9p (2014: 123.1p), an
increase of 0.6%. A ﬁnal
dividend of 32.3p (2014: 31.1p)
is proposed. If this is approved
at the Annual General Meeting
it will give a full year dividend of
46.1p (2014: 44.3p) and will be
covered 2.7 times.
Comment
Underlying operating cash ﬂow*
in the year was £81.3m (2014:
£83.1m) reﬂecting the expected
Oman impact and other working
capital movements, leading to a
cash conversion of 68% (2014:
70%). Excluding the impact of
Oman, cash conversion would
have been 77%. Through the
cycle, the Group targets average
cash conversion of 80% to 85%.

divisional revenue increased by 3.4%
compared to 2014, as the prior year
included £11.7m of sales from the Oman
Airport IT programme, whereas no
revenue was recognised in 2015.
The division saw an increase in Aerospace
sales, in particular on the Mitsubishi Regional
Jet (MRJ) and the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)
programmes, and in revenues from Airport
Systems including the Orange County contract
in the US. Revenue from vehicle programmes,
including the Warrior, Scout and Middle East
NIMR also increased. As well as the impact of
the Oman contract, revenue from the A400M
Network Interface Module (NIM) was lower
reﬂecting contract phasing.
Following the securing of a number of new
orders to develop products for the aerospace
sector, the division’s margins have been
impacted by increased R&D investment and
lower margins during the engineering phases
of projects. There were also restructuring costs
at the CEMS business. This was partially offset
by higher margins as vehicle programmes
enter the production phase. The acquisitions
of Ice Corporation in 2014 and Furnace Parts
in 2015, provided a positive contribution to
both revenue and proﬁts as did the impact of
foreign exchange. The resulting divisional
margin was 14.9% (2014: 14.9%). 
The change in the order book reﬂects
increased orders for aerospace products and
services, offset by the trading of the Lockheed
Martin Warrior contract.
Strategy in action
In October 2015, Ultra’s Precision Air & Land Systems business was awarded the next three
Low Rate Production phases for the engine harnesses for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. This
contract, worth in excess of £10m, marks the end of Low Rate Production, with the aircraft
scheduled to move towards Full Rate Production by 2020. Ultra also supplies missile cooling
and pneumatic stores ejection to the F35 Lightning II programme which in totality is forecast
to be worth in excess of £500m to Ultra through its life.

Throughout 2015 Ultra NSPI accelerated its win of new contracts across a number of nuclear reactor
new build programmes around the world. The projects included the design, qualiﬁcation and
manufacture of multiple new temperature and pressure sensor designs for Generation III and SMR
reactors. The resulting expansion in Ultra’s portfolio of sensors and the opening of a new sales ofﬁce
in Beijing during the year, positions the business well for the next wave of new build opportunities in
that region.
3 Communications & Security saw the
beneﬁt of the acquisition of Herley in
2015, together with the prior year
acquisition of Forensic Technology.
Against this, the division was impacted 
by the repeal of the US Patriot Act which
signiﬁcantly reduced domestic legal
intercept revenues in the SoTech
business. This was partially offset by an
increase in revenue from security and
surveillance products (and from the ECU
RP programme) and a positive impact
from foreign exchange.
There were higher margins as the ECU RP
programme completes its production phases
and Herley improved the mix. This more than
offset the impact of both the loss of high
margin revenue and associated restructuring
costs in the SoTech business and took
divisional margin to 16.9%.
The order book reﬂected the trading of the
ECU RP Crypto contract and the reduction 
in US contract placement over the last 
12 months.
Strategy in action
In November 2015, Ultra’s CIS business was awarded an initial contract to upgrade the
radios on the RAF’s Typhoon aircraft, with further orders to follow in 2016 and beyond.
Over the life of the programme this could be worth in excess of £20m.

programme for the UK MoD. This was
offset by the impact of funding delays
on the Torpedo Warning System in the
US and by a reduction in rail power
management revenue. The acquisition 
of 3 Phoenix in the prior year
contributed to divisional revenues, 
as did foreign exchange.
Margins at 17.3% (2014: 17.7%) reﬂected
the release of some contract risk reserve in
the prior year comparative, and the product
mix within the sonobuoy businesses.
The order book declined as a result of the
trading of major contracts, including
Fatahillah and UK sonobuoy partnering.
There was also a delay into 2016 of some
large orders, including the 2017 UK
sonobuoy partnering contract extension and
India torpedo defence.
Strategy in action
In February 2015, Ultra’s Sonar Systems business was awarded an £18m contract to supply
sonobuoys for the Royal Navy’s Merlin maritime patrol helicopter. The contract will be
executed over the next two years with options for a further two years. The contract, between
Ultra and the MoD, for sonobuoy engineering, manufacture, logistics and support, ensures
the Royal Navy maintains a persistent Anti-Submarine Warfare surveillance capability against
hostile submarines.

How we analyse and manage risk
36 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Ultra encourages its businesses to challenge
the market through innovation and to exhibit
audacity. Profitable growth cannot be
achieved without accepting some degree of
considered risk. Review of business activity
and the management of risk is an integral
part of Ultra’s processes. Risks are considered
and managed as business decisions are made,
then collated so that the Group’s collective
exposure is well understood and controlled. 
The implementation of a revised Risk
Management Framework in 2015 (see pages
61 and 62) resulted in a refresh of Ultra’s
principal risks. This has had a direct impact
on the risks disclosed in this Annual Report
and Accounts in that previously reported risks
have been separated out to provide more
granularity, and other risks have been
escalated to principal risks status. The
development of the revised Risk Management
Framework was undertaken with engagement
from the Executive Team, the Audit Committee
and the Board to ensure a robust assessment
of the principal risks facing Ultra, including
those that would threaten its business model,
future performance, solvency and liquidity. 
A programme of continuous monitoring and
reporting (as outlined in the Risk Management
Framework) has been undertaken to ensure
Ultra’s risk profile reflects the current risk
exposure and improvements in management
activity.
The Board has developed risk appetite
statements against each of the principal risks,
clearly setting out the Board’s perspective on
its willingness to accept risk in pursuance of
its strategic objective – “to outperform the
market in terms of annual increases in
shareholder return” (see page 10). In
addition, metrics have been established to
support the Board’s ability to identify when its
tolerance for risk is being reached.

The business environment in which the Group operates presents a number of risks and uncertainties
which continue to be the focus of the Board’s attention. Ultra’s approach to risk management and
internal controls is designed to achieve the Group’s business objectives whilst mitigating risk to within 
an acceptable risk appetite. The Group has implemented mitigation strategies to manage the overall 
risk exposure in line with the Board’s risk appetite.
A programme of
continuous monitoring
and reporting has been
undertaken to ensure
Ultra’s risk profile reflects
the current risk exposure
and improvements in
control activity.
The Group’s principal risks 
are identified below and 
on the following pages,
together with:
• A description of the risk and its 
potential impacts.

Description
Ultra’s core markets continually change as
government budgets come under fiscal
strain and/or geopolitical events affect the
Group’s operations. 
Understanding and effectively responding to
these changing market dynamics is key to
delivering future organic growth.
Potential impacts:
• Reduced business opportunity through an
inability to adapt our offerings and approach
quickly enough
• Inability to match the full range of customer
requirements
• Loss of market share 
Mitigations (examples):
• Cleary deﬁned and consistently applied
approach for setting strategies for each of 
the eight segments (see page 12)
• Dedicated Regional Marketing Directors
focused on creating local networks,
understanding the market and
culture/procurement regime 
• LAUNCH principles embedded to understand
customers’ requirements (see page 45)
• Ultra has a diversiﬁed portfolio of businesses
that mitigates exposure  
Risk 01. Strategy and market environment Trend: No signiﬁcant change
Description
Underpinning the overall success of the Group
is its ability to win new business and manage/
deliver against contracted customer
commitments (on budget, on time and to the
agreed quality).
Potential impacts:
• Customer dissatisfaction and reputational
damage
• Loss of future order book opportunities 
• Ultra may need to provide for unrecoverable
additional costs incurred until the end of a
programme 
• Contract disputes/litigation
Mitigations (examples):
• The Group Operating Manual sets out the
policies and procedures for major bids 
• The monthly review process of the Business
Performance Reports provides oversight and
challenge on the order book and delivery
status of signiﬁcant contracts
• Commercial Directors support their Divisional
Directors in reviewing major bids and assist
collaboration across the divisions
• A country risk assessment process has been
implemented to evaluate jurisdictional
contracting risks 
Risk 02. Contract win/delivery Trend: No signiﬁcant change
Description
Effective delivery of major change programmes
with minimal effect on business as usual (BAU)
is a key component of Ultra’s continual
programme of operational improvement.
The introduction of two major change
programmes in the year (market-facing
segment strategies (see page 12) and S3 (see
page 5)) resulted in the escalation of this to a
principal risk.
Potential impacts:
• Identiﬁed beneﬁts of change not realised

• Senior management distraction from BAU
• Reduction in employee morale
Mitigations (examples):
• All major change programmes are monitored
on a monthly basis by the Board
• An Executive Team sponsor for all major
change programmes 
• Recruitment of specialists in designing 
and delivering change programmes to 
support delivery
• Employee communication and engagement

Description
The Group continues to look at acquisitions to
add capabilities, market access and critical
mass. The effective selection, due diligence
and/or integration of acquisitions is critical to
making this a success.
The acquisition of the Electronic Products
Division of Kratos Defense & Security
Solutions was the largest the Group has
done, which resulted in the escalation of this
to a principal risk. 
Potential impacts:
• Destruction of value through overpayment 
for acquisitions
• Non-delivery of synergies and/or economies 
of scale
• Senior management focus diverted away from
delivering BAU
Mitigations (examples):
• The Group acquisition process and procedures
are led by the M&A Director and include due
diligence, the use of professional advisors and
appropriate and enforceable representations
and warranties
• Detailed post-acquisition integration plans are 
in place and led by an Executive Team sponsor
• Formal two and ﬁve-year post-acquisition
reviews are undertaken by the Board
• Medium-term integration milestones and plans

Description
The Group’s information systems, personnel
and facilities are subject to security risks. The
incidence and sophistication of cyber security
crime is on the rise. Breach of security could
cause controlled or critical data to be lost,
made inaccessible, corrupted or be accessed
by unauthorised users.
Potential impacts:
• Reputational damage to Ultra as a highly
regarded provider of secure data systems
• Loss of business opportunity with removal of
government approval to work on classiﬁed
programmes 
• Reduced product differentiation with loss of
intellectual property
• Disruption to business activity as systems are
cleansed and restored
Mitigations (examples):
• Dedicated Cyber Protection Group (CPG)
providing Group-wide monitoring, incident
response and continued enhancement of Ultra’s
IT systems and processes
• Security clearance process for all employees
• The Group Information Security policy classiﬁes
all information assets 
• Established physical security processes
implemented at all sites
• Training provided on IP awareness, IP
management and IP exploitation
Risk 05. Intellectual property/information security Trend: No signiﬁcant change
Over the last three years Ultra Electronics
has made a signiﬁcant investment in
internal cyber defence to ensure that the
Group’s sensitive information is
appropriately secured against the increasing
threats that are taking advantage of the
internet as an attack-vector. The Ultra
Cyber Protection Group (CPG) provides
comprehensive pro-active defence using
advanced techniques to prevent, detect and
respond to security incidents. Operating
from a UK base, the CPG uses advanced
and often uniquely designed software
techniques to remotely monitor and protect
all of the Group’s network operations at
sites in several different countries. The CPG
is led by senior network security specialists
with long experience from highly sensitive
national and multinational organisations,
supported by some very carefully selected
and highly capable graduates. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 39

Description
Ultra must continue to distinguish itself from 
its competitors through product and service
innovation/development. This needs to
address changing customer preferences and
deliver highly-differentiated solutions.
The market conditions throughout the year
have continued to have a direct impact on the
availability of customer funding for new
product development.
Potential impacts:
• Loss of key customers
• Signiﬁcant loss of revenue, proﬁts and or
market share
• Ultra’s portfolio of specialist capabilities is
eroded through commoditisation
Mitigations (examples):
• A culture that focusses on ensuring a 
deep understanding of customer need 
and delivering innovation
• Market and competitor analysis to support
technology and product roadmaps
• Segment focussed R&D prioritisation to avoid
duplication and maximise advantage 
Risk 06. Innovation and development Trend: Increased risk
Description
Attracting, developing and retaining the right
people who embrace and sustain Ultra’s
culture, and who have the domain expertise is
critical to delivering the Group’s strategy and
business plan.
Potential impacts:
• Ultra could lose key staff or capabilities and 
be unable to fulﬁl its contractual obligations
• Reduction in staff morale results in a rise of
employee related issues (e.g. grievances 
and sickness) 
• Talent within the business is not developed to
its full potential
Mitigations (examples):
• Clearly deﬁned and implemented recruitment
processes
• Annual Organisation, Succession and
Development Process
• The Chief Executive meets high potential
employees to assess performance, skills and
competencies ﬁrst-hand
• Quarterly review by the Executive Team and
annual review by the Nomination Committee
of the succession planning and career
progression of senior employees
• Engagement with potential recruits at an early
stage through links with schools and universities
by offering apprenticeships, work placements
and graduate training (see page 46)
• Monitoring and reviewing salary and beneﬁts
surveys
Risk 07. People Trend: No signiﬁcant change
Description
The preservation of Ultra’s culture (innovation,
agility and accountability) as the Group
expands through organic growth, natural staff
turnover and acquisitions is a key driver for
future success.
In 2015, the Group completed its largest
acquisition (Ultra Electronics Herley);
introduced a new market segment structure;
and launched S3. Preserving Ultra’s culture in
light of this has resulted in the escalation of
this to a principal risk.
Potential impacts:
• Reduction in the quality and consistency of
service delivery to customers
• Reduction in staff morale results in a rise 
of employee related issues (e.g. grievances 
and sickness)
• Loss of high potential employees
Mitigations (examples):
• Delivery and follow-up analysis of the
YOURviews employee survey (which is
reviewed annually by the Board) 
• Implementation of LEAP and LAUNCH
behaviours across the Group
• Group culture expectations is a key part of 
the HR induction process
• Culture transition requirements are included 
as part of the formal integration plans for all 
new acquisitions

The Group operates in a highly-regulated
environment across many jurisdictions and is
subject to regulatory and legislative
requirements. There is a risk that the Group
may not always be in complete compliance
with laws, regulations or permits.
Potential impacts:
• Debarment from government contracts
• Regulatory ﬁnes and/or penalties
• Legal disputes 
• Reputational damage 
Mitigations (examples):
• Implementation of the Group Operating
Manual that sets out policies and procedures
for legislative and regulatory requirements and

Risk 10. Legislation/regulation Trend: No signiﬁcant change
Description
Maintaining corporate governance standards
and an effective and efﬁcient risk management
and internal control system is critical to
supporting the delivery of the Group strategy.
As a result of the re-fresh of the principal risks 
in 2015, governance and internal control has
been separated out from the legislation/
regulation risk to provide greater granularity
and to reﬂect the continued focus of the Board
in this area. This has resulted in the escalation
of this to a principal risk.
Potential impacts:
• Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss (e.g. fraud, theft,
material errors)
• Loss of investor conﬁdence
• Loss of business opportunity with removal 
of government approval to work on classiﬁed
programmes
Mitigations (examples):
• Implementation of the Group Operating
Manual as the overall policy and procedures
framework
• Effective internal controls and Risk
Management Framework 
• Year end disclosures by the businesses on the
effectiveness of accounting and internal
control systems
• Terms of reference for Board and Committees
are reviewed and updated annually
Risk 11. Governance and internal control Trend: Escalated to a principal risk
Description
The Group places signiﬁcant reliance on key
suppliers/sub-contractors for the delivery of its
customer commitments and therefore, there is
a need to ensure the continuing effectiveness
of the supply chain. The Group’s manufacturing
facilities are exposed to natural catastrophe
risks and the Group is affected by the social,
economic, regulatory and political conditions in
the countries in which it operates.
Continued funding pressures on US and UK
defence procurement programmes has led to
increasing demands for improved efﬁciency in
the supply chain. This has resulted in the
escalation of this to a principal risk. 
Potential impacts:
• Failure to deliver against customer commitments
• Signiﬁcant product quality defect 
Mitigations (examples):
• Pre-contract audits of key suppliers and 
sub-contractors and continuing review of 
their performance 
• Business continuity and disaster recovery plans
are in place and tested
• Single-source supplier risks are identiﬁed
through risk management process and, where
possible, key materials or components are 
dual-sourced
• The Group has business interruption, property
damage and product liability insurance

Operating across a number of countries adds
complexity to managing currency exchange
rate and interest rate ﬂuctuations that can
directly impact on Ultra’s business performance. 
As for all companies, Ultra is exposed to
changing tax legislation in the territories in
which it operates including as an international
business, changes that may arise due to local
legislation arising from the OECD’s current Base
Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting project. 
Potential impacts:
• Ultra’s revenue and earnings could be adversely
impacted by the weakening of a currency in
which it generates sales 
• The impact of foreign exchange could either be
through translation of the balance sheets and
proﬁts of foreign operations or UK businesses
transacting in a foreign currency
Mitigations (examples):
• The translation impact cannot be mitigated;
however, the Group Finance Director 
ensures that analysts and investors are aware
of the impact
• Transaction impact is mitigated through the
Treasury policy of hedging forecast cash ﬂows
and, where possible, through ensuring that
contracts provide protection against exchange
movements, and cost and revenue currencies
are matched
• Ultra is committed to complying fully with the
laws in the countries in which it operates from
a tax perspective. It seeks to achieve a
competitive tax rate by maintaining established
ﬁnancing structures where appropriate. We
manage these risks by monitoring international
developments, participating in pro-legislative
consultations where appropriate and adapting
our approach where necessary and practical 
Risk 14. Treasury and tax Trend: No signiﬁcant change
Description
A continued focus on: ensuring high standards
of health and safety of employees and visitors;
and maintaining our commitment to minimise
the environmental impact of our activities is of
paramount importance to support the
achievement of Ultra’s business objectives. 
As a result of the refresh of the principal risks in
2015, health, safety and environment has been
separated out from the legislation/regulation
risk to provide greater granularity and to reﬂect
the continued focus of the Board in this area
(see page 50). This has resulted in the escalation
of this to a principal risk.
Potential impacts:
• Harm to people’s well-being
• Serious business interruption
• Reputational damage 
Mitigations (examples):
• Annual self-assessment of health, safety and

for each business
• Quarterly review of health, safety and
environment by the Executive Team and
annual review by the Board
Risk 12. Health, safety and environment Trend: Escalated to a principal risk
Description
The Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme needs to be managed to ensure it
does not become a serious liability for the
Group. There are a number of factors
including investment returns, long-term
interest rate and price inﬂation expectations,
and anticipated members’ longevity that can
increase the liabilities of the scheme.
The planned closure of the Group’s UK
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme will
contribute to reducing the overall risk
exposure (see page 26).
Potential impacts:
• Any increase in the deﬁcit may require
additional cash contributions and therefore
reduce the available cash for the Group
Mitigations (examples):
• The Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme is closed to new members 
• Formal annual reviews of the Group pension

Making a difference
Ultra recognises that the
success and sustainability of 
the business is enhanced by
positive relationships with
stakeholders and continues 
to focus on value creation for
ALL its stakeholders: local
communities, shareholders,
customers, employees, the
environment and suppliers.
In the community:
Ultra’s businesses remain active in their local
communities, building positive links by
engaging with local people and local issues.
Many businesses form special relationships
with education establishments in the
surrounding communities providing interview
practice sessions, supporting lessons, careers
events and school science fairs, as well as
offering work placements and visits to
businesses as part of AS level courses. Ultra
also takes part in the nationwide initiatives on
STEM* education at a national level and
offers Arkwright scholarships, a scholarship
that sponsors students looking for a career in
engineering through their A-level education.
Ensuring a long-term supply of talent to the
business is essential and Ultra dedicates itself
to developing the talent pipeline in schools
and higher education institutions. This is
exempliﬁed by the PALS business winning a
regional Partnerships with Education Award
as part of the EEF Future Manufacturing
Awards 2015. Sonar Systems was a runner up
in the same category. Each business manages
its own charitable budget, that it directs to
maintain and grow connections with local
communities. Fundraising and voluntary work
in the local community or at a national level is
something the Group is keen to encourage
and actively supports employees who
undertake voluntary activities. Some
noteworthy examples in 2015 include:
• Ultra’s Nuclear Control Systems business
sponsored the Dorset Enterprise and Skills
Company “Enterprise Challenge” awards.
This is a local schools programme where
small teams of students set up and run a
business over the course of four months to
help develop essential skills in business and
entrepreneurship in a practical, fun and
innovative way. 
• Sonar Systems is supporting a local Code
Club, which is a charity that was set up to
establish a nationwide scheme to teach
children between the ages of 9 and 11
how to write software. Each Code Club
runs weekly for one-hour during term time
and teaches programming by having the
children write games and create
animations and websites. 
• During 2015, Ultra CIS launched a 
“CIS in the community” policy enabling
employees to take time out to work in 
the local community and providing
matched sponsorship for events.

…Shareholders:
Ultra aims to extend its long track record of
delivering above-average shareholder
returns. The Group’s primary objective is to
outperform the market by delivering above-
average increases in total shareholder return
and by communicating effectively, through
various means, with shareholders and the
financial community.
…Customers:
Ultra aims to be an excellent, strategic
supplier to its customers. To enable this,
Ultra’s businesses are focused on helping
customers identify their true needs whilst
developing long-term relationships, based on
performance excellence and meeting its
commitments. Ultra’s businesses have built
long-term, mutually beneﬁcial relationships
with their customers and have become part
of the customers’ extended enterprises.
Examples from 2015 that highlight Ultra’s
commitments to its broad customer base are:
• USSI’s joint venture, ERAPSCO, has been
recognised by the US Navy as a Tier 1
Superior Supplier. This honour is awarded
to the top DoD suppliers in the nation who
provide the greatest overall value to the
Department in terms of cost, schedule,
performance, quality and business relations. 
• Ultra’s Controls business was complimented
when one of its major customers, MITAC,
recommended that its senior management
team visit the Controls production site in
Greenford to observe what MITAC
considered to be best practice following
the maiden ﬂight of the Mitsubishi Regional
Jet (MRJ). 
• In Australia, Ultra’s Avalon business
received a written statement of recognition
from the Royal Australian naval vessel
HMAS Melbourne for its support in the
preparations for its deployment for
operation MANITOU.
…Employees:
Ultra believes that the right people are its
most important asset; the capabilities of its
employees allow the Group to innovate
continually and meet customer need. Ultra
has a strong commitment to developing
people and securing the talent pipeline,
details of which can be found in the section
Developing Ultra’s People. The Group believes
that, to ensure its continuing growth and
success, these initiatives for talent
development and people retention are
essential. However, ultimate responsibility for
individual talent development and employee
retention resides within each of Ultra’s
businesses, a number of which have launched
unique initiatives to ensure continuing
employee development and engagement.
Examples include:
• In 2015, 3eTI rolled out its “Making 3eTI a
Great Place to Work” initiative aimed at
helping employees enjoy happy and
healthy lifestyles while maintaining a good
balance between life and work. Programmes
included ﬂexible summer work weeks,
quarterly social hours and project-swap
education projects.
• Forensic Technology continues its efforts
towards maintaining its status as an
employer of choice in Canada and
benchmarked its employee engagement
related practices against those of other
Employers of Choice. Employee
engagement is a signiﬁcant part of the
businesses overall business plan and it is
currently revisiting the performance
management process and tools,
incorporating feedback from both
managers and employees. 
• Ultra Electronics US was presented with 
the Gold Wellness Award by the Business
Council of Fairﬁeld County, Connecticut
that recognised Ultra as a leading
company in promoting a healthy
workplace for its employees.
…the Environment:
Ultra is committed to implementing and
enforcing effective measures to minimise the
environmental impact of its activities. All
businesses are audited biennially. In the US in
2015 ProLogic, 3Phoenix, 3eTI, ATS, Flightline
and NSPI all achieved 100% in the audit.
Additionally in the UK, CIS, ID, Sonar Systems,
PMES, PALS and Controls all maintained the
ISO14001 environmental standard. 
Ultra continues its commitment to investing in
manufacturing facilities to offer increased
efﬁciencies and reduce energy consumption,
while improving productivity across the
Company. The Group also looks for its
suppliers to reduce their environmental impact.
Initiatives that have taken place within the
Group include:
• 3eTI continued its “Go Green Campaign”
encompassing two separate recycling
programmes and the use of sensor lighting. 
• Controls introduced an Environmental
Newsletter. 
• Maritime Systems switched to reusable
packaging for many of its plastic parts 
and installed variable frequency air
handling units and an air compressor to
reduce its carbon footprint. 
• NCS updated its personal development
review process to include a “Health, Safety
and Environment” section to encourage
staff to engage. 
• TCS installed charging stations for 
electric cars. 
• Ocean Systems constructed an
environmentally-controlled transducer and
encapsulation room.
…to Suppliers:
Ultra views its suppliers as an extension of
the Ultra enterprise as many businesses rely
on these suppliers for delivery of their
products and services. These are safety- or
performance-critical in their end markets so
working together is crucial. Partnership with
suppliers and customers generates innovative
and differentiated solutions which are at the 
core of Ultra’s business model. Many Ultra
businesses work with their suppliers to
enable them to operate more efﬁciently.
This year Ultra’s Ocean Systems business
mentored a new supplier of energetics on a
shared contract to enable them to fulﬁl their
commitments to the contract and deliver the
product in time.

The right people
Ultra is successful in innovating to meet
customer needs due to the broad range of
skills and capabilities held by the Group’s
employees. As such the Board has recognised
that the right people are the Group’s most
important asset. Therefore people and their
development are key initiatives for the Group
as it strives to achieve an efﬁcient organisation
with engaged and committed people.
Domain expertise
The key factors in delivering innovative
solutions to meet customers’ needs are Ultra’s
deep understanding of its specialist capability
areas, combined with knowledge of the users’
environment. Ultra maintains its domain
expertise by ensuring that employees maintain
expertise in their respective ﬁelds. The Group
ensures it has the right people to work with
customers to support their needs by
understanding and creating winning solutions.
How Ultra manages its people
Ultra values the autonomy of its businesses
and believes a high degree of operational
autonomy enables businesses to focus on
delivering agile and responsive solutions to
its customers.
The Managing Directors and Presidents of
Ultra’s individual businesses and their
management teams are given as much
authority and responsibility as possible. This
allows these teams to maintain the agility
and sharp focus that is typical of owner-
managed businesses.
Sustainability
Developing Ultra’s people 
Without the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of its staff, 
Ultra would not be able to deliver value to customers.
People in action 
Carly Nettleford a trainee engineer at
Ultra’s CIS business recently won the title
of Apprentice of the Year in the West
London Business Awards. Here she talks
about her time at Ultra. 
Why did you choose Ultra?
I chose Ultra Electronics because I could
see there would be many opportunities for
me to learn and grow as an engineer. I
have deﬁnitely been able to do this while
working at Ultra. 
What have you done here?
The great thing about doing an
apprenticeship is that you’re able to move
around different departments; therefore
I’ve had the opportunity to work on many
different projects with elements of both
electronic and mechanical engineering
principles. I have had the chance to learn
electronic CAD, radio frequency theory
and many different software and
programming packages. With all of these
skills I was able make a difference to the
projects being worked on. 
How much have you 
enjoyed your time at Ultra?
Being on the apprentice training scheme
gave me the chance to work with many
different people and learn a lot from
them, which I have enjoyed the most. I
have built a rapport with many of my
colleagues and it has made my time at
Ultra enjoyable. 
What have you learnt?
I have learnt a lot while working at Ultra
from my colleagues and my mentor, Andy
Cambridge. I have been able to take the
theoretical knowledge that he has taught
me and from studying my HNC/HND and
apply this in the working environment. 
How do you feel about 
winning this award?
I am still in shock about winning the
award. I feel overwhelmed to achieve
something of such a high magnitude. I am
very happy that I could win it on behalf of
Ultra and make my parents very proud.
Being on the
apprentice training

Culture
Ultra is committed to keeping its culture
strong as the Group expands through organic
growth, natural staff turnover and
acquisitions. The Group believes culture is
what drives Ultra’s success and that this
includes values, role models, processes and
the behaviours of its employees. The Group’s
culture, values and behaviours are shaped by
the guiding principles, in particular the call
for “an efﬁcient organisation with engaged
and committed people”. 
To achieve this, Ultra has identiﬁed four
cultural behaviours of its people that are
highly valued and encouraged. These are:
Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Audacity and
Paranoia. Together, they are known within
the Group as LEAP.
What people mean to Ultra
The broad range of skills and capabilities of
Ultra’s employees support the Group’s
success in innovating to meet customer
needs. Ultra’s aim of delivering an efﬁcient
organisation, with engaged and committed
people to meet the Group’s business
commitments, is a goal all managers work
towards and is a measure of their success.
The quality of Ultra’s leadership teams is
constantly reviewed and improved as this is
essential to the continuing growth and success
of the Group. Many companies state that
their people are the company’s most important
asset. Ultra varies this slightly: the right
people are the Group’s most important asset.
Growth through engagement
LAUNCH is a set of behaviours which the
Group has developed to facilitate customer
engagement and relationship building.
L Listen to customers
A Ask the right questions
U Understand what their “pain”is
N identify the customers’ Needs and get
their agreement
C Create a relationship, opportunity 
and solution
H Holistic. Examine the bigger picture; 
how can Ultra maximise the scope and
value of the opportunity?
This approach ensures Ultra understands 
the real needs of its customers; in addition,
LAUNCH is a way for Ultra’s businesses to
generate long-term customer relationships
which leads to a better pipeline of
opportunities and to, ultimately, enable
growth. LAUNCH is aligned with the 
Group’s approach to systems engineering 
and project management.
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Ultra is committed to securing the talent pipeline and developing people to ensure the continued
growth and success of the Group. Focus is placed on ensuring that the right people are in the right
roles. Furthermore businesses are responsible for and encouraged to develop their teams and
individuals continuously, which will enable people to grow with the business and not become a
constraint on the development of the Group.
Leadership: Good leadership is
extremely important to Ultra and a
number of models of leadership are
incorporated in the development and
training programmes that are delivered
around the Group.
Entrepreneurship: Being entrepreneurial
is a behaviour which underpins the
Group’s strategy. All Ultra businesses seek
to provide customers with solutions
which are different from, and better
than, those of competitors. Ultra’s
entrepreneurial culture seeks to maximise
the capability to generate excellent ideas
and the business skills needed to bring
them successfully to market.
Audacity: Audacious thinking is the
difference between incremental
improvement and business
transformation. It takes the idea of
innovation, one of Ultra’s core values, and
invites employees to think about issues in
ways which are unconstrained by existing
norms, making use of creative approaches
in every aspect of the Group’s business.
Paranoia: Paranoia, in the business
sense, is a concern and fear about
competitors and what they may do. It
also relates to concerns and fears about
things which can go wrong internally. For
Ultra, paranoia is important in focusing
its staff on maximising their knowledge
of the competitive landscape, by
constantly asking questions of the
Group’s individual businesses, customers,
teaming partners and suppliers. 46 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Securing the talent pipeline
Ultra has been committed to developing
people ever since it was formed in 1993.
There are a number of programmes which
help the Group to attract the best people, as
well as encouraging students to develop
careers in engineering or business.
SCHOOLS
Ultra engages with local schools near many
of its businesses. Relationships with schools
and sixth form colleges take a variety of
forms: from work experience, longer work
placements, visits as part of AS level courses,
interview practice sessions, careers events
and Ultra employees supporting both lessons
and after school clubs. Examples include: 
• Ultra’s Forensic Technology business
continues to run their “CSI for a day”
programme in local schools; this has been
a huge success, with one school stating it
has improved interest in science lessons as
well as encouraging more collaboration
between students. 
• Businesses at the Head Ofﬁce site in
Greenford welcomed teachers from the
local Greenford High School to tour the
site as part of an initiative to inform
teachers about careers in engineering and
science, furthering the businesses
commitment of helping to encourage
students into STEM* studies and jobs. 
• 3 Phoenix is an advocate of the STEM*
programme in the local North Carolina
public school system, encouraging careers
in technical ﬁelds. It has undertaken site
tours for students at local schools and also
mentored an intern doing research with
engineering staff at the facility. 
Ultra’s focus is mainly engineering but also
includes other STEM* subjects, ﬁnance and
commercial disciplines. Ultra also sponsors
students through their last years at school via
the Arkwright Scholarship. This provides
students with support and mentoring during
their studies and has led to students electing
to undertake STEM degree courses. Ultra is a
recognised major sponsor of the scheme and
currently has eight scholars.
APPRENTICESHIPS
Many Ultra businesses have well-established
and successful apprenticeship programmes,
which have also historically provided the
Group with engineering leaders. The Group
runs apprenticeship schemes at most of its UK
businesses and currently has 48 apprentices in
training in the UK.
There have been a number of notable successes:
• Carly Nettleford, based at CIS, won
Apprentice of the Year at the West London
Business Awards. 
• Lakjit Chand, from Sonar Systems, was
presented with an Apprentice Ambassador
award from the Mayor of Hillingdon in
recognition of his hard work as an
Apprentice Ambassador. 
• Three apprentices from Ultra’s NCS
business were awarded honours for their
ﬁrst year at the Engineering Trust
Apprentice Awards. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES
In addition to traditional career fairs, Ultra
actively engages with lecturers and faculties
during degree courses as the Group
maintains excellent links with universities
around the world. This allows Ultra access to
leading research and enables the Group to
form relationships with students well before
graduation. The Group beneﬁts from working
with universities as it can collaborate on
innovation and recruit students who can
make a difference. Ultra currently has 10
sponsored university students and also
provides a number of work placements as
part of degree courses (49 in the UK and US
in the last year).
Ultra businesses provide opportunities for
students to work on real projects via work
placements, co-operative programmes and
internship schemes; all internships are paid
for, to promote access to all. The Group also
works with SEPnet to provide summer work
placements to students to help advance and
sustain physics as a strategically important
subject for the UK economy.
SUCCESS STORIES
• PALS was ﬁrst introduced to Nick Roberts
through the Arkwright Scholarship Trust.
Following the award of his scholarship PALS
offered him work experience during every
holiday. On completion of his A Levels PALS
sponsored him at Nottingham University. This
came with a small bursary and the guarantee
of paid work during the holidays. PALS also
set his ﬁnal year project and supported him
through this. The amount of work Nick did
during his degree negated the need for him
to undertake an intern year. Nick graduated
in 2015 with a MSc in Mechanical
Engineering and started working at Ultra
full-time in September 2015.
• Ocean Systems supported a Northeastern
University student involved in the “Gordon
Institute of Engineering Leadership”
programme in which corporations sponsor
aspiring young talent, engaging them with
business-relevant “challenge” projects. 
The student successfully led a small team 
of Ultra employees to demonstrate initial
risk reduction activities for countermeasure
mobility. Following his graduation he was
offered and accepted a position as a full-
time employee.
• Ultra PALS won the regional Partnerships
with Education award at the 2015 EEF
Future Manufacturing Awards. This award
goes to the manufacturer that has made
the biggest strides or found new ways to
work with education providers to promote
engineering and manufacturing careers. 
INSTITUTIONS
Ultra’s businesses are members of
Engineering UK, Cyber Challenge UK and
other bodies which research and develop
new ways to attract people into engineering
careers, as well as helping to forecast future
trends in the sector. Ultra businesses
worldwide have a variety of links with their
local business forums and chambers of
commerce members, helping to encourage
STEM* activities.

Training and development
Ultra actively invests in and supports the
training and development of its employees.
Each business is responsible for identifying
the training needs of its employees and
managing its own training budget. Employee
performance and development reviews are
held annually, at a minimum, and are used to
identify the development needs of
individuals. Ultra has invested in its Learning
Academy, which is an online portal, and is
available to all of the Group’s businesses to
support training.
Many of these are courses tailored to the
speciﬁc requirements of Ultra, and the
trainers have an intimate knowledge of how
the Group operates across all of its
businesses. These training events include
programmes on leadership and management,
along with workshops on Ultra’s successful
competitive strategy, strategic selling,
programme management and systems
engineering. Speciﬁc training programmes
are provided for individuals as necessary.
Businesses also look for further opportunities
to develop training outside their training
budget. For example, Ultra’s NCS employees
have used their contacts to gain experience for
the businesses apprentices that would not
usually be available. A group was taken to the
MoD site in Davenport and shown the
operations and maintenance of the submarine
as well as seeing how the Ultra equipment is
deployed. Another group visited the Advanced
Manufacturing Resource Centre (AMRC) at
the University of Shefﬁeld which focuses on
machining and materials research and provides
skills training. Here they engaged in a tour and
spent the afternoon doing practical challenges
using the practice equipment. 
To give students access to real life current
work challenges, and to enable Ultra
employees to develop their management and
leadership skills, there are opportunities to
participate in national schemes, such as the
Engineering Education Scheme (run by the
Engineering Development Trust) and
competitions promoting STEM* careers. Ultra’s
businesses have also developed corporate
partnerships with engineering institutions,
including the Institution of Engineering and
Technology, in order to support and encourage
employees to pursue professional recognition
(in the form of CEng, IEng or EngTech status)
for both their current and previous work and
academic achievements.

This year Ultra employees were invited to
attend a meeting to offer an industry
perspective to the government on the
development of nuclear skills in
preparation for nuclear policy statements
in the run up to the general election. 
Following an announcement by David
Cameron on 11 March 2015, the Nuclear
Trailblazer employer group, led by
Sellaﬁeld Sites Ltd and facilitated by the
National Skills Academy for Nuclear
(NSAN), was established to develop
standards for the nuclear sector and make
apprenticeships more attractive to
employers. Lesley Fewell, Head of Human
Resources at Ultra Electronics Nuclear
Control Systems, was invited to join the
Group representing the interests of UK
supply chain companies. 
Following the review, NSAN reported that
two new apprenticeship standards for
nuclear, as developed by the Nuclear
Trailblazer employer, had been approved.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Succession planning and retention
Each of Ultra’s businesses prepares an annual
“Organisation, Succession & Development
Plan” to ensure that Ultra has the right people
in the right place in the organisation. The plan
assesses individuals’ performance in their
current role and their potential to perform a
larger role in the short or longer term.
Assessments are recorded in Ultra’s Talent &
Succession system and give a performance
versus potential rating for each employee.
The system is used by businesses to ensure a
supply of suitable talent is available when
required and recognises that any role within
Ultra may become more challenging as the
business grows. The performance categories
consist of “exceed” , “meet”, “partially meet”
or “does not meet” the required performance
level. Equal attention is given to enhancing
the performance and retention of those who
meet and exceed standard performance
levels and to addressing the challenges of the
people who fall into the “partially meet” or
“does not meet” categories. Where an
individual is not meeting the standard
performance level, it often means that they
need to be placed in a role more suited to
their talents in which they can start to
perform to the required standards. 
The Group is able to create its next
generation of business leaders, through
developing and retaining those employees
identiﬁed as having high potential who will
be able to take up the challenge of
continuing the growth and expansion of
Ultra. The Group has a high retention rate of
those individuals in the businesses’ senior
management teams who continually meet or
exceed expectations in terms of their
performance, or who are high-potential and
still developing in their new role.
Ultra has been able to appoint a high
proportion of its leaders at Board, divisional
and business levels through internal
promotion. This is because the succession
planning element of the process aims to
ensure that there are always suitable
successors for all the management team roles
across each business and for other senior
level roles.
As well as the people listed as successors,
each business also identiﬁes people with high
potential. The combined list represents Ultra’s
“high-potential” talent pool and is used
regularly to ﬁnd the right people to ﬁll
internal vacancies via the Group’s Talent &
Succession system. Ultra businesses attend
graduate and undergraduate fairs, utilising
current graduates as the Group’s
ambassadors. Attendance has seen
applications for graduate schemes increase,
and this in turn helps to ensure that there is a
future supply of engineers for the Group. In 
a typical year, Ultra recruits over 600 new
employees and acquisitions bring additional
new people into the Ultra family.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Ultra is committed to maintaining high
standards of business ethics as part of being a
responsible business. The Group endeavours
to uphold the rights of its employees as well
as creating an honest and transparent
business both internally and externally. The
Group’s corporate responsibility initiatives are
focused in the following key areas:
Human rights
The Group recognises and respects the rights
of its employees and all stakeholders and the
communities that it encounters. As such, Ultra
adheres to all relevant government guidelines,
designed to ensure that its products are not
incorporated into weapons or other equipment
used for the purposes of terrorism, internal
repression or the abuse of human rights. Ultra’s
Board requires that the Group should, at all
times, be a responsible corporate citizen and,
as such, the Group complies with all applicable
legislation in the countries in which it operates.
In 2016, the Company will review its supply
chain management processes in light of the
Modern Slavery Act 2015 and publish a slavery
and human trafﬁcking statement on the
Company’s website. 
Ethical business conduct
Ultra is committed to ethical business conduct.
MEETING LEGAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS
Ultra requires all employees, businesses and
third parties, who act on Ultra’s behalf, to
comply with the applicable laws and
regulations of the countries in which it does
business.
Ultra is committed to operating in
accordance with all legislative requirements,
including those pertaining to anti-bribery and
corruption practices, competition and anti-
trust laws and relevant national export
control regulations.
Ultra has a corporate ethics code, which
encompasses a gifts and hospitality policy. 
All Ultra businesses are required to report on
compliance with the corporate ethics code
monthly and the Board reviews compliance
with the code twice a year.
Ultra’s ethics code can be found within Ultra’s
Policy Statement on Ethics and Business
Conduct along with as its policies on anti-
corruption and bribery, competition compliance
and gifts and corporate hospitality. All of these
policies can be found on the Group website: 
http://www.ultra-electronics.com/about-
us/corporate-responsibility.aspx
PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND TRAINING 
TO EMPLOYEES
The Group continues to promote and
strengthen its policies, processes and training
to ensure employees have the clear guidance
they need in identifying and managing
ethical matters.
Ultra uses EthicsPoint in all of its businesses.
EthicsPoint is Group-wide independent,
conﬁdential web- and telephone-based
hotline, which enables all employees to
report concerns anonymously about possible
improprieties and other compliance issues. 
All reports registered through EthicsPoint are
reviewed and responded to in a timely and
appropriate manner. The responsibility for
handling reports rests with Ultra’s Senior,
Independent Non-Executive Director (with the
exception of US security related issues that are
routed to the Chairman of the Security
Committee of either Ultra's Special Security
Agreement company or Ultra's Proxy Board
company, as appropriate). No retaliatory
action is taken against employees for making
reports in good faith through EthicsPoint. Any
employee found to be in breach of the Policy
Statement on Ethics and Business Conduct is
subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
INDEPENDENT ETHICS OVERVIEW COMMITTEE
The Ethics Overview Committee was formed
to provide independent advice and scrutiny of
Ultra’s business activity, giving assurance that
the Group’s current and planned undertakings
are conducted in a manner consistent with
the legislative environment and are
transparent. The Committee comprises six
permanent members, three of whom,
including the Chairman, are independent.
To maintain the highest degree of impartiality,
the independent members of the Committee
are self-selecting with the appointment of 
the Chairman exclusively within the remit of
the independent members. The Committee
meets quarterly and provides assurance that
Ultra’s business is being conducted in line
with the Group’s policies, processes and
relevant legislation. This is ascertained
through discussions with senior managers,
receiving reports and visiting Ultra’s
businesses. During these reviews, the
Committee undertakes a formal review of
business activities and the independent
members provide advice and guidance on the
appropriateness of target markets and
customers and on potential teaming partners.
The Committee also considers the reports that
come through EthicsPoint.

Corporate and social responsibility
Ultra believes that a successful and sustainable business is built 
on more than just ﬁnancial results. Ultra has built a reputation for
meeting its commitments. 50 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Diversity and inclusion
These values are embedded into the
organisation to ensure each business is truly
representative of the environment in which it
operates. It is essential to the Group that all
employees feel fairly treated and are not
discriminated against in any way. To enable this,
Ultra complies with all applicable employment
rights and legislation in the countries in which it
operates. In addition the Group is strongly
committed to maintaining a work environment
which provides equal opportunities for all
employees, regardless of nationality, gender,
ethnic background, sexual orientation, religious
beliefs, marital status, disability or age. 
Ultra uses rigorous recruiting practices to
ensure the best candidate is selected, based
on objective requirements and assessments.
Ultra monitors gender and age diversity.
Disabled employees 
Applications for employment by disabled
people are always fully considered, bearing in
mind the aptitude of the applicant concerned.
In the event of a member of staff becoming
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that
their employment with the Group continues
and that appropriate training is arranged. It is
the policy of the Group that the training,
career development and promotion of
disabled people should, as far as possible, be
identical to that of other employees.
Health and safety
The health and safety and well-being of the
Group’s employees and visitors is of the
upmost importance to Ultra. A healthy,
committed and engaged workforce, working
in a safe environment, is necessary to achieve
superior business results. The businesses
manage a wide range of safety risks, from
ofﬁce and manufacturing employees to
employees providing services at customer
sites, including military bases and platforms.
The Group is committed to upholding and
improving health and safety across the Group
and engages in continuous safety
improvement activities.
The safety of the products and services provided
to users and customers is a key priority to Ultra.
Each business ensures the appropriate legal and
ethical levels of safety are met across a product’s
life cycle, with particular emphasis on the
manufacturing, in-service and disposal phases.
All operating businesses are required to have
a written health and safety policy, which is to
be upheld at all times. Within each business,
Managing Directors and Presidents are
responsible for health and safety and for
providing adequate resource to meet the
requirements of the health and safety policy.
Independent external audits, which take place
biennially, assess compliance. Overall health
and safety responsibility at Board level resides
with the Chief Executive.
Each business is required to submit an annual
report on health and safety performance.
Annually the Board receives a report which
summarises the health and safety performance
of the Group. 
The reportable/recordable accident rate is
shown in Figure 1. Lost time accident data
per 200,000 hours has been recorded for the
whole Group since 2010 and is shown in
Figure 2.
The reportable/recordable accident rate per
employee for 2015, remained steady at 0.52%.
Environment 
Ultra is committed to putting effective
measures in place to minimise the
environmental impact of its activities. This is
important both for its employees and the
communities in which it operates, as it will help
to secure the long-term future of the Group.
These measures include both the operational
business environment and the products and
services that the Group provides.
PRODUCTS
Environmental considerations are taken into
account throughout a product’s life cycle,
from concept through to disposal; each
individual business ensures its practices and
processes consider this. Businesses work with
their suppliers to reduce the impact of their
products and to maximise the use of
environmentally-acceptable components.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Ultra ensures the full co-operation of all
employees to minimise environmental impact
and maximise the conservation of materials.
OPERATIONAL
The Chief Executive is the main Board
member with overall environmental
responsibility and the Managing Directors
and Presidents of the operating businesses
are responsible for the implementation of the
environmental policy. 
Ultra’s formal environmental policy addresses
compliance with environmental legislation,
conformity with standards for air, waste
disposal and noise, the economical use of
materials and the establishment of
appropriate environmental performance
standards. Progress is monitored through
annual reporting and a biennial external audit
process, the most recent of which took place
in 2015. Where it is appropriate, individual
businesses have ISO14001 accreditation.
Each site plans and manages compliance with
environmental requirements and the
processes for the storage, handling and
disposal of hazardous or pollutant materials
are reviewed on a continuous basis. Ultra
caused no contamination of land in 2015,
continuing the excellent track record of the
previous ﬁve years.
In addition, there were no environmental
incidents reported in the year.
Ultra measures and reports on its packaging
waste annually and this is shown in Figure 3.
In the UK, businesses are encouraged and
incentivised to reduce the net amount of
waste they produce.
The Group continues to address energy
conservation and emissions. Energy
consumption is measured annually and the
data compared with previous years.
As part of the Carbon Reduction Commitment
(CRC) programme Ultra, in the UK, is
registered with the Environment Agency. The
Group’s compliance emissions reported for
2014/15 were 8,178t CO2. Historic
performance data is shown in Figure 4.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Ultra is committed to the systematic reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions. In compliance
with the 2013 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Regulations, Ultra collects and consolidates
information on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
from across its portfolio of 24 businesses;
2013 was the ﬁrst year this was undertaken
and serves as the baseline year.
Ultra’s Greenhouse gas emissions 
– tonnes of CO2 (tCO2)
Total tCO2 emitted by all 
Ultra businesses 19,094

Methodology
In 2015, each UK business reported on the
appropriate greenhouse gas metrics. These
metrics were aggregated to produce the
ﬁgures reported above to which standard
DEFRA conversion factors were applied.
Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme
The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme
(ESOS) is a new piece of legislation introduced
by the UK Government that applies to Ultra.
The scheme is run by the Environment Agency
(such as CRC) and its focus is to reduce the
demand for energy. The ﬁrst qualiﬁcation
phase ended on 31 December 2014. Ultra has
since successfully demonstrated compliance
with the requirements using ESOS-compliant
energy audits and notiﬁed our compliance to
the Environment Agency in January 2016. The
opportunities for energy savings identiﬁed
during the ESOS assessment will be addressed
as part of the S3 programme.
Additional environmental initiatives
All businesses are audited biennially. In the US in
2015, ProLogic, 3 Phoenix, 3eTI, ATS, Flightline
and NSPI all achieved 100% in the audit.
Additionally in the UK, CIS, ID, Sonar Systems,
PMES, PALS and Controls all maintained the
ISO14001 environmental standard.

Corporate Governance Report
Governance
Chairman’s governance statement Dear shareholder,
Strong governance continues to be at the
core of Ultra’s culture and operations. In
September 2014, a revised UK corporate
governance code was issued which applies to
accounting periods commencing on or after 
1 October 2014 (the Code). In the pages which
follow, we have set out our governance
policies and practices and included details of
how the Group has complied with the Code. 
The Board and its Remuneration, Audit and
Nomination Committees have considered the
Group’s policies and procedures in light of the
revised Code. As a result, improvements have
been made to the Group’s risk management
and internal control procedures (the details of
which are set out on pages 61 and 62); and
the Board has agreed a long-term viability
statement (set out on page 27). 
In the year, we have continued our active
engagement with the investor community
(see page 62) and taken account of our
shareholder voting guidelines. From 2016
onwards, all awards granted to Executive
Directors will be subject to a two-year post
vesting holding period, whereby net of tax
awards vesting cannot normally be sold until at
least the ﬁfth anniversary of the date of grant.
Mary Waldner (Group Finance Director) will
leave Ultra on 16 March 2016. The Nomination
Committee has been active in the search for a
new Group Finance Director. Details of the
Nomination Committee’s work in this regard
are set out on page 59. Succession planning for
the Board and senior management has been
a focus in 2015 (as described on page 60)
and will remain so in 2016.
Strong governance and high ethical standards
are the hallmarks of a sustainable business.
This is particularly the case during times of
challenging market conditions. The Board is
conﬁdent that Ultra’s strategy, reinforced by
Ultra’s culture of accountability and
responsibility and supported by a robust
governance framework, ensures Ultra remains
a resilient and sustainable business.

Corporate Governance Report
Governance 
Corporate Governance Report
Compliance statement
Throughout the financial year ended 
31 December 2015, the Board considers that it
and the Company have complied with the
provisions set out in the September 2014
edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code
(the Code). The Code is issued by the Financial
Reporting Council and is publicly available on
their website (www.frc.org.uk). This corporate
governance section of the Annual Report &
Accounts describes how we have applied the
main principles of the Code.
Role of the Board
The role of the Board is to provide effective
leadership and direction in delivering the key
corporate objective to outperform the market in
terms of annual increases in shareholder return.
The Executive Directors set the Group strategy
which is subject to challenge before final
agreement by the Board. The Board ensures that
adequate controls are in place, including
calibrating risk appetite and maintaining
oversight of Ultra’s risk management processes.
The Board also receives and reviews regular
Compliance Reports. The Board encourages the
Group’s businesses to behave ethically and
properly at all times and engenders a culture of
fairness to customers, suppliers and employees.
It is the function of the Group’s management,
through the Chief Executive and his Executive
Team, to run the operations of the Group.
In addition to the ten scheduled Board
meetings, the Board held unscheduled Board
meetings in the year. This enabled detailed
discussions and a robust risk review of the
termination of the Oman Airport IT contract,
Ultra’s strategy for the Middle East and the
acquisition of the Electronic Products Division of
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (now
known as Ultra Electronics Herley).
A summary of some of the Board’s key
responsibilities and activities is set out opposite
and the full range of Board responsibilities are
detailed in the document entitled ‘Terms of
References for Main Board’ which is available
from the Investors’ section of the Group’s

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
How the way we are governed supports the delivery of our strategy 
Good governance is crucial to ensuring we are well managed and can deliver our strategy.

The Board
Chairman: Douglas Caster; Senior Independent Director: Sir Robert Walmsley
All the Directors are collectively responsible for the success of Ultra. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising independent
and objective judgement and for scrutinising and challenging management.
The Board is responsible for approving our strategy and policies, for oversight of risk and corporate governance, and for ensuring expected returns on
investment are made from leveraging our portfolio strength. The Board is accountable to our shareholders for the proper conduct of the business and
our long-term success. It represents the interests of all stakeholders.
Members of the Board and their biographies are shown on pages 52 and 53. 
The Board has delegated certain key responsibilities to three Committees (see below) and the Chief Executive (see below).
The responsibilities of each Committee are in line with the recommendations of the Code and the detailed terms of reference of each Committee are
available from the Investors’ section of the Group’s website (www.ultra-electronics.com). 
Chief Executive: Rakesh Sharma
The Executive Team comprises:
Chief Executive; Group Finance Director; Group Marketing Director; Chief Operating Officer; Group Human Resources Director; 
Company Secretary & General Counsel; and the Divisional Managing Directors/Presidents of the three divisions
The Executive Team is the body through which the Chief Executive exercises the authority delegated to him by the Board. It considers major business
issues and makes recommendations to the Chief Executive, and typically reviews those matters which are to be submitted to the Board for its
consideration. The Chief Executive is responsible for establishing the Executive Team and chairing the Executive Team meetings.
Ethics Overview Committee
Three independent members: 
David Shattock (Chairman); Martin Bell; and Major General (retired) Tim Cross
Three Ultra members: 
Chief Executive; Company Secretary & General Counsel; and Divisional Managing Director Communications & Security
Further details about the Ethics Overview Committee are given on page 49.
Ultra is committed to ethical business conduct. In this regard, the Group has the beneﬁt of an independent Ethics Overview Committee. The Group has issued a
Policy Statement on Ethics and Business Conduct (available from the Corporate Responsibility section of the Group’s website: (www.ultra-electronics.com)).
Nomination Committee
Chairman: Douglas Caster
Talented people are critical to the delivery of the
Group’s strategy. The Nomination Committee
met four times in 2015 to:
• Recommend appointments to the Board and
Board Committees
• Review the succession planning process for
senior executives
• Commence the recruitment process for the
Group Finance Director role (see page 59)
• Review its terms of reference 
The Board’s policy on diversity is described on
page 59. 
In 2016, the focus of the Nomination
Committee will be to:
• Oversee the Group Finance Director
recruitment process 
• Review the developments made by the
Company in improving talent management
• Review the Director induction process
Audit Committee
Chairman: John Hirst
To deliver the Group’s strategy we must have
sound financial and non-financial controls. 
The Audit Committee met five times in 2015.
Full details of the activities of the Audit
Committee during 2015 are given in the 
Audit Committee Report on pages 65 to 67.
In 2016, the focus of the Audit Committee will
be to review:
• The bid process 
• Project management of long-term contracts
• Business Continuity Planning and IT Disaster
Recovery
• The embedding of the Risk Management
Framework within the businesses
Remuneration Committee
Chairman: Martin Broadhurst
We seek to reward senior management
competitively to enable Ultra to recruit,
motivate and retain executives of a high calibre
whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration
payments. The Remuneration Committee met
four times in 2015.
Full details of the activities of the Remuneration
Committee during 2015 are given in the
Remuneration Report on page 79.
In 2016, the focus of the Remuneration
Committee will be to review:
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy for
submission to the shareholders at the 2017
AGM (i.e. at the end of the original three-year
policy period)
• New employee share plans for shareholder
approval at the 2017 AGM Board meetings 
Financial results for operating businesses, each
division and the Group are provided to the Board
monthly and presented at every scheduled Board
meeting. Comprehensive briefing papers are
circulated to the Directors in advance of each
Board meeting to enable an informed debate to
take place. Acquisition opportunities are
presented to the Board by the appropriate
Divisional Managing Director/President. This
enables a full discussion of the merits and risks of
any acquisition proposal to take place at an early
stage. The Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director explain the significance of any major
impacts on the financial performance and draw
the Board’s attention to any significant trends or
deviations from budget revealed by forecasts of
future performance.
Other significant matters that require formal
Board approval which are routinely presented by
the appropriate business include major bids,
updates on key strategic initiatives and major
capital and private venture development
expenditure proposals. 
When a scheduled Board meeting is not held in
the month, the Directors receive the following
information: a summary financial report for the
Group comprising consolidated financial
information and business financial information;
summary financial reports from each of the
businesses; and a shareholder analysis summary
report on Ultra.
The Executive Team as a whole meets the Board
annually to present the proposed Strategic Plan
for the next five years. This is then debated with
the Directors, changes agreed and a final plan is
approved. In addition, in line with the areas of
focus from the 2014 Board evaluation (see page
60), there were two additional annual half-day
Board strategy sessions in the year. 
The scheduled Board meetings are rotated
around the sites of the operating businesses at
which the Board undertake site tours and are
given product demonstrations. During 2015, the
Board visited four operating businesses in the
UK. The Board held one of the Board meetings
at one of its North American businesses,
following a tour by the Non-Executive Directors
of some of the North American operations. 
The Board receives presentations by Ultra’s
business units detailing recent performance, key
opportunities and future forecasts. This gives the
Non-Executive Directors a good practical insight
into the operating businesses.

The table below shows attendance by Directors
at the Board and Committee meetings. To the
extent Directors were unable to attend meetings,
because unscheduled meetings were called at
short notice or because of prior commitments,
they received and read papers for consideration
at the relevant meeting, relayed their comments
in advance and, where necessary, followed up
with the Chairman on the decisions made.
Product demonstrations and site tours take place, giving the Non-Executive 
Directors a good practical insight into operating businesses. They also conduct
individual visits to businesses. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 59
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Throughout 2015, the Board structure was in
line with the Code.
Diversity
Ultra continues to follow its overriding policy of
appointing the best person for a particular role,
regardless of sex, race, nationality, disability,
sexual orientation, age, marital status, religion
or beliefs. The Board contends that a board
composed of the right balance of skills,
experience and diversity of views is best placed
to support a company in its strategic objective.
The Board has considered in detail the
requirements of the Code regarding gender
diversity. In selecting the best person for a role,
the Board gives active consideration to the
benefits of diversity, including gender diversity.
However, setting diversity target aspirations,
especially by specific dates, can distort the
selection process and conflict with its preferred,
diversity-aware ‘best person for the role’
approach. You can read more about Ultra’s
initiatives to improve diversity across the Group,
including information on the gender split across
the Board, Executive Team and the Group as a
whole, in the sustainability sections of our
Strategic Report on page 50.
Board skills and experience
The Board has a balance of skills, understanding,
perspectives and experience relevant to the
Group’s activities. The Board collectively
possesses a deep understanding of the Group’s
core defence, security, transport and energy
markets. This is complemented by its members’
experience and expertise in other industries and
disciplines including procurement, accountancy,
financial management and growing
international businesses. This range of skills and
experience informs the Board’s decision-making
and enables it to provide effective leadership.
The particular skills and experience that each
Director brings to the Board are described in
their biographies on pages 52 and 53.
Executive Directors, excluding the Chief
Executive, have been permitted to accept one
appointment as a Non-Executive Director in
another listed company. Going forward, the
Group will extend this to include the Chief
Executive. The Board considers that such roles
enrich the skills and experience of its Executive
Directors to the benefit of the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted to retain any
fees from such external appointments.
Board roles
There is a clear division of responsibilities
between the Chairman, the Chief Executive and
the Senior Independent Director. This formal
division of responsibilities has been agreed by
the Board and is summarised in a table which is
available from the Investors’ section of the
Group’s website (www.ultra-electronics.com).
Non-Executive Directors
Martin Broadhurst, John Hirst and Sir Robert
Walmsley are the Group’s independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Chris Bailey had served
on the Board for over ten years and retired as
Non-Executive Director at the 2015 Annual
General Meeting. John Hirst became a 
Non-Executive Director on 1 January 2015. The
Board considers all Non-Executive Directors to
be independent. In assessing independence, the
Board considers that they are independent of
management and free from business and other
relationships which could interfere with the
exercise of independent judgment, now and in
the future. The Chairman has also considered the
Non-Executive Directors’ performance in the year
and has determined them to be effective and to
have demonstrated commitment to their roles.
The Board believes that any shareholdings of the
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors serve to
align their interests with those of all shareholders.
The key role of the Non-Executive Directors, along
with the Chairman, is to provide an appropriate
level of challenge and constructive criticism to the
plans of the Executive Directors. The Non-Executive
Directors met without the Chairman or Executive
Directors being present during the year to
discuss aspects relating to the Board and the
Company and appropriate feedback was given.
On behalf of the Company, the Non-Executive
Directors are active in developing relationships at
a senior level with the Company’s key suppliers,
customers and business partners.
Insurance
The Group maintains an appropriate level of
Directors and Officers Liability insurance cover in
respect of legal action against its Directors.
Board appointments – the process
In making appointments to the Board, the
Board, through the Nomination Committee, is
careful to identify the skills, knowledge and
experience needed for each role and to
complement the existing skills mix provided by
other Board members. To ensure selection from
the widest possible talent pool, it is Ultra’s
normal practice to engage the services of
independent external search consultants in
recruiting new Directors.
Following a tender process the executive search
firm Russell Reynolds Associates was engaged to
identify potential candidates for the position of
Group Finance Director following the notice from
Mary Waldner of her intention to leave the
Group. The search firm does not have any other
connection with the Company. The role
specification and selection criteria was determined
by the Nomination Committee and required the
candidate to: be a qualified accountant, have
experience in corporate financial matters and
have: extensive senior level accounting
experience; significant leadership and managerial
experience; technical appreciation and knowledge
of long-term contract accounting; and strategic
thinking skills. The curriculum vitaes of the
shortlisted candidates will be considered by the
Nomination Committee and a subcommittee will
interview the short listed candidates and select
those candidates to go through to final interview.
All members of the Nomination Committee will
be invited to attend the final interviews. Following
this process, the Nomination Committee will meet
to agree upon the successful candidate before any
recommendation is put to the Board.
The recruitment process for the appointment of
John Hirst as Non-Executive Director was set out
in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts. 
Ultra’s succession planning process is described
in detail on page 48.

Directors’ induction and training
All new appointments to the Board receive a
comprehensive induction to the Group covering
the Group’s strategy, governance framework,
policies and procedures, the products and
services of the Group’s businesses, the key
markets in which the businesses operate, the
key risks which the Group faces (together with
the actions and plans which are in place to
mitigate against these), corporate and
organisational structure, financing principles and
legal and regulatory issues.
Programmes of visits to Group businesses are
arranged. It is important for these to encompass
as many businesses as possible, since Ultra’s
businesses cover a broad range of capabilities.
New Directors are encouraged to meet business
and divisional management teams to gain a feel
for the Group’s style and culture. John Hirst
joined Ultra as Non-Executive Director on 1
January 2015. In addition to receiving a full
induction pack, he undertook an induction
programme of visits to various businesses across
the Group and meetings with management
teams of those businesses. He also met with the
Group’s internal and external auditors.
The Directors’ induction programme will be
reviewed in 2016 in advance of the appointment
of the new Group Finance Director.
The Company Secretary & General Counsel
annually presents to the Board on corporate
governance. The Board is briefed on significant
changes in the law or governance codes
affecting their duties as Directors. Experts
present to the Board on specialist areas, such as
pensions and tax. Specific training is arranged for
Directors as and when appropriate. The Directors
are able to call on independent professional
advice at any time should this be necessary in
order for them to carry out their duties.
Board evaluation
The Chairman commissions externally-facilitated
annual Board evaluations. Board evaluations run
on a two year cycle. One year, the effectiveness
of the Board and its Committees is evaluated.
The following year, individual Directors’
performance is evaluated.
Following an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the Board and its Committees in 2014, the 2014
Annual Report and Accounts set out the areas of
focus going forward. An update on progress made
on these actions is set out in the table below. 
Focus
Increased strategic focus
Succession planning for senior managers
Continued improvements to risk management
processes
Actions
In addition to the annual off-site meeting
dedicated to strategy, there will be two additional
annual half-day Board strategy sessions.
The Chief Executive will provide the Board with a
written summary of strategic matters prior to
each Board meeting.
There will be an increased focus on strategy in
the businesses’ presentations to the Board. 
The Board will receive annually a report on the
succession planning and career progression of
senior employees.
A review of the Company’s risk management
processes in light of the Code’s new
requirements will be undertaken.
Progress
Half-day Board strategy sessions were held in
April and July and the full day Board strategy
session focused on the strategy for the new
market segments. 
The Chief Executive provides his reports in writing
to the Board as part of the Board pack issued in
advance of each meeting. 
Business presentations to the Board highlight how
they fit with the applicable segment strategy.
The Nomination Committee met in July to
discuss succession planning and career
progression for senior employees and considered
the skills and qualities needed to support the
Group’s organic growth and the tools and
training available to develop these skills. Progress
made in this area will be considered by the
Nomination Committee in 2016.
The Group engaged PwC to carry out a review
of risk management processes and their report
was considered by the Board and the Audit
Committee. Further details of the Group’s
management of risk are provided on pages 61
and 62.
Board evaluation action points
In November 2015, Mr Telfer of Auxesis
Consulting Ltd undertook an assessment of
individual Director’s performance. All Directors
completed a detailed questionnaire requiring
them to give feedback on their fellow Board
members’ contribution. The objective of the
process was to encourage the improved
performance and effectiveness of the Board. A
report of the results was given to the Chairman
of the Board, detailing any significant points
pertaining to the individual Directors and
broader issues regarding the combined strengths
and weaknesses of the Board. Mr Telfer
reviewed the report with the Chairman to
discuss possible actions arising and the feedback
to be provided to individual Directors. Individual
feedback reports were given to each Director.
The review concluded that each Director
contributed effectively and demonstrated
commitment to the role. There is an appropriate
balance of skills, experience, independence,
diversity and knowledge of the Company to
enable the Directors to discharge their respective
duties and responsibilities effectively.
Commitment of time by all Directors for Board
and Committee meetings and other duties was
also considered sufficient for the effective
discharge of their responsibilities. The Chairman
will meet with each Director to discuss their
individual reports and the Board will discuss
initiatives to enhance the operation of the Board.
Mr Telfer has considerable experience of working
at board level. He was the Human Resources
Director of Ultra up until June 2004 (when he left
Ultra to set up his own consultancy) and so was
able to facilitate the evaluation from a position of
having a good understanding of the Group and
its culture. He provides a valuable insight into
Ultra’s challenges and needs and is able to assess
the Board and its Committees in the context of
the Group’s development.
Annual re-election of Directors
All the Directors will stand for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2016. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 61
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Conflicts of interest
The Company has in place procedures for
managing conflicts and potential conflicts of
interest. The Company’s Articles of Association
also contain provisions to allow the Directors to
authorise conflicts or potential conflicts of
interest so that a Director is not in breach of his
or her duty under UK company law. If Directors
become aware of a conflict or potential conflict
of interest they should notify in line with the
Company’s Articles of Association. Directors have
a continuing duty to update any changes to their
conflicts of interest. Directors are excluded from
the quorum and vote in respect of any matters in
which they have a conflict of interest. No material
conflicts were reported by Directors in 2015.
Risk management and internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for
establishing, monitoring and maintaining an
effective system of risk management and
internal control. In accordance with the Code
the Board confirms that:
• There is a continuing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the principal risks
faced by the Group (see principal risks on
pages 36 to 41)
• The systems have been in place for the year
under review and up to the date of approval
of this Annual Report and Accounts 
• The systems are regularly reviewed by the Board
• The systems accord with the FRC guidance on
risk management, internal control and related
financial business reporting 
During 2015 the Board has directly, and through
delegated authority to the Executive Team and
the Audit Committee, overseen and reviewed
the performance and evolution of the approach
to risk management and internal control.
Through this involvement, the Board is satisfied
that the risk management and internal control
systems are in place and effective.  
Whilst the review did not identify any significant
weaknesses in the system of internal control
there were some improvements identified
during the year to enhance further the overall
approach to risk management. The particular
enhancements made included:
• The implementation of a formal Risk
Management Framework that sets out Ultra’s
approach to risk management
• A re-fresh of the strategic risk profile (using a
more detailed risk assessment criteria) to
reflect a robust assessment of the principal
risks (see principal risks on pages 36 to 41)
• The development of risk appetite statements
and supporting metrics for each principal risk
identified 
• The introduction of Risk Champions to
support the identification, capture, assessment
and management of risk at each division
Each enhancement to our risk management
approach has further embedded risk
consideration as part of the culture of the Group.
This evolution of our risk maturity is something
we will continue in 2016 with particular focus on: 
• Ensuring consistent application of the new
Risk Management Framework at a Divisional
and individual business level
• Further work on considering risk in aggregation
• More detailed quantification, deep dives and
scenario analysis on our principal risks 
• On going review of the risk appetite metrics to
identify any potential breaches before they arise
Risk management 
The Board, supported by the Audit Committee
and the Executive Team, has overall 
responsibility for implementing an effective risk
management approach.
The overall approach is governed by the Risk
Management Framework which is supported by
a guiding principle of ensuring the consideration
of risk is embedded into the culture and
behaviours of the way Ultra operates. 
The Risk Management Framework facilitates the
following objectives: 
• Identification, measurement, control and
reporting of risks that can undermine the
business model, future performance, solvency
or liquidity of the Group
• Better allocation of efforts and resources for the
management of principal and emerging risks
• Assurance from management that a particular
risk is owned by the individual best positioned
to control/mitigate that risk
• Driving business improvements and improved
intelligence for key decision making
• Support and development of our reputation as
a well governed and trusted organisation
The key components of the Risk Management
Framework are:
Oversight structure and accountability – The risk
management oversight structure has been
developed using the principles of the three lines
of defence (a simple but well established
governance and internal control model) and
ensures risk is considered from both a top down
and a bottom up perspective with risk
information captured at a strategic, divisional
and individual business levels. 
Process – The risk management process is a
consistently applied approach across each level
of the business. It is focused on risk
identification (using cause and effect analysis),
inherent (pre controls) and residual (post
controls) assessment, control identification and
the development and implementation of further
mitigation strategies.
As part of this process, risk appetite is considered
for each of the principal risks, allowing the Board
to clearly set out the nature and extent of the
risk the Group is willing to accept in pursuit of
the Group’s strategic objectives.

Risk Management (continued)
Escalation, monitoring and reporting – A clear
escalation criteria is in place to ensure changes 
to risk exposure are notified through the
governance structure as required. Risk leads are
identified for all risks who have the responsibility
for ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of
current controls and the progress against the
implementation of further mitigating actions. 
The risk reporting flow is based on a combination
of annual, bi-annual, quarterly and monthly
reporting to the Board, Audit Committee,
Executive Team and Divisional/individual
businesses management teams. 
Details of the Group’s principal risks and how
they are being managed or mitigated is provided
on pages 36 to 41.
Financial control 
The Group has in place internal control and risk
management arrangements in relation to the
Group’s financial reporting processes and the
preparation of its consolidated accounts. The
arrangements include procedures to ensure the
maintenance of records which accurately and
fairly reflect transactions to enable the
preparation of financial statements in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards or UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, as appropriate, with
reasonable assurance. They also require reported
data to be reviewed and reconciled, with
appropriate monitoring internally and by the
Audit Committee. 
Business Performance Reports (comparing
actuals, budget, forecasts and prior year) are
prepared for all businesses on a monthly basis
and reviewed where relevant by the Divisional
Finance Director, Group Finance Director,
members of the Executive Team and the Board. 
When preparing and reviewing financial
information, the businesses do not work to a
materiality threshold. All variances judged to be
significant are investigated and explained.
In addition to this, there is a Group-wide process
specifically for monitoring financial controls and
risks. Management have delegated control
ownership to each of the businesses and
established a framework for reporting whether
the controls are designed and operating
effectively. Every six months, Divisional Control
Review (DCR) meetings, which are attended by
the Group Finance Director, each Divisional
Finance Director and PwC are held. 
At the DCR meetings, the internal controls
processes and issues for each business are
discussed. These include:
• Results from the Senior Accounting Officer
review and any tax audits
• Self-assessment against the Group Operating
Manual
• Outstanding internal and external audits
• Segregation of duties and IT access audits
• Compliance with the Group’s Information
Security Policy
Summary results from these reviews are
included in the Internal Controls Improvement
Status Report, which is presented to the Audit
Committee twice a year.
Operational controls 
The Group Operating Manual (which is
communicated across Ultra) sets out the
mandatory Group policies and procedures 
to be followed.
The Managing Directors and Presidents, Finance
Directors and Vice Presidents of Finance of each
business are required to give a formal written
representation to the Board each year
confirming that they accept responsibility for
maintaining effective internal controls in line
with the Group Operating Manual and that they
have disclosed full details of any fraud or
suspected fraud within their business.
Internal audit 
The Board maintains an internal audit process,
carried out by PwC, to review financial and
information systems control procedures
throughout the Group. The internal audit plan is
a combination of Group-wide risk-based reviews
and a rolling rotational individual business
programme. All significant individual businesses
are audited at least once every two years, while
other businesses are audited on a three-year
cycle. In addition, all newly acquired individually
operating businesses are audited within a year of
their acquisition date. Where required, additional
audits are identified during the year in response
to changing priorities and requirements.
All internal audit findings are graded and
appropriate remedial actions, responsibilities and
timescales are agreed with management.
Progress is monitored and reported through the
Audit Committee.
Shareholder communication
Commitment to dialogue
The Board is committed to a high-quality dialogue
with shareholders. The Executive Directors lead in
this respect. The Chairman, Senior Independent
Director and other Non-Executive Directors are
available to meet with shareholders on request. 
In 2015, the Remuneration Committee
considered the views of one institutional
shareholder on applying a holding requirement
to long-term incentives and agreed to
implement the changes outlined on page 68.
The Company wrote to shareholders on 
19 January 2016 advising them of the Company’s
decision to adopt FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure
Framework” (FRS 101) and to take advantage 
of the permitted election to the disclosure
exemptions allowed under FRS 101. The
consolidated financial statements of the Group
continue to be prepared in accordance with
International Finance Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Annual programme
A full programme of engagement with
shareholders, potential investors and analysts is
undertaken each year by the Executive Directors.
Ultra organises focused events and/or site visits
to provide greater insight into the strengths and
potential of its extensive portfolio of specialist
capabilities. These range from introductory
briefings on the Group as a whole to
presentations on specific areas of capability.
Visits and presentations in the year included a
presentation to shareholders and to analysts in
June 2015. At this event the Directors gave
presentations on the reorganisation of market
segments, standardisation and shared services
and the acquisition of what is now known as
Ultra Electronics Herley. In addition, Ultra invited
investors and members of the financial
community to the Defence and Security
Equipment International exhibition where a
significant proportion of the Group’s products
and capabilities were exhibited.
Meetings are held with institutional investors and
financial analysts after the release of the interim
and full year financial results, at which detailed
briefings are given. These briefings are also
available from the Investors’ section of the Group’s
website (www.ultra-electronics.com), together
with copies of all regulatory announcements, press
releases and copies of the published full year and
Interim Reports and Accounts.
The Board is regularly updated by the
Company’s stock broker on analysts’ and major
shareholders’ views on the Company. The Board
receives a report at each Board meeting on any
changes to the holdings of the Company’s main
institutional shareholders. 
All shareholders are invited to attend the Annual
General Meeting on 29 April 2016 where they
have the opportunity to meet with Directors and
to ask questions. 
Voting at the Annual General Meeting is
conducted by way of a show of hands. Proxy votes
lodged for each Annual General Meeting are
announced at the meeting and published on the
Group’s website (www.ultra-electronics.com).
Electronic communication with shareholders is
preferred wherever possible since this is both
more efficient and environmentally friendly.
However, shareholders may opt to receive hard
copy communication if they wish. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 63

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required to
prepare the Group financial statements in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union and Article 4 of the
International Accounting Standards Regulation
(IAS) and have elected to prepare the Company’s
financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and applicable law) including FRS 101. Under
company law, the Directors must not approve
the accounts unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
and of the profit or loss of the Company as well
as the undertakings included in the
consolidation for that period.
In preparing the Company’s financial statements,
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently
• Make judgments and accounting estimates
that are reasonable and prudent
• State whether applicable UK Accounting
Standards have been followed subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements
• Prepare the financial statements on the
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company will continue
in business
In preparing the Group financial statements,
International Accounting Standard 1 requires
that Directors:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies
• Present information, including accounting
policies, in a manner that provides relevant,
reliable, comparable and understandable
information
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance
with the specific requirements in IFRSs are
insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’s financial position
and financial performance
• Make an assessment of the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern
The Directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are sufficient
to show and explain the Company’s transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance
and integrity of the corporate and financial
information included on the Group’s website
(www.ultra-electronics.com). Legislation in the
United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge,
taken as a whole:
• The financial statements, prepared in
accordance with the relevant financial reporting
framework, give a true and fair view of the
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or
loss of the Company and the undertakings
included in the consolidation taken as a whole 
• The Strategic Report includes a fair review of
the development and performance of the
business and the position of the Company and
the undertakings included in the consolidation,
together with a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties that they face
• The Annual Report and financial statements,
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and
understandable and provide the information
necessary for shareholders to assess the
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy
The Annual Report (including the Strategic Report
and Directors’ responsibilities statement) on

Audit Committee Report
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
I am delighted to have assumed the role of
Chairman of the Audit Committee (the
Committee) this past year and I would like to
thank Chris Bailey for his years of leadership of
the Committee. Ultra is committed to ensuring
that it has robust and effective risk management
and control processes. As Chairman of the
Committee, I am pleased to present our report
detailing the role and responsibilities of the
Committee and its activities during the year that
support this. The Board’s report on the systems
of internal control and their effectiveness can be
found in the Corporate Governance Report on
pages 56 to 64. An assessment of the Group’s
principal risks and uncertainties, can be found
on pages 36 to 41 and together with the going
concern and long-term viability statements, can
be found in the Strategic Report on page 27.
During the year, the Committee continued to
review the appropriateness of the Group’s
system of risk management and internal
controls, the robustness and integrity of the
Group’s financial reporting, along with both the
internal and external audit processes. 
A risk and rotational based approach is taken by
the Company in determining its internal audit
plan, thereby ensuring the plan is clearly linked to
the Company’s strategy and flexible enough to
highlight and address emerging risks. The focus in
2015 continued to be on the Group’s Business
Continuity and IT Disaster Recovery processes, as
well as working capital management and controls
in integrating new businesses. In addition, the
Company worked with PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (PwC), the Company’s internal auditor, to
improve the Company’s risk management
processes in line with the Code. Further details on
Ultra’s risk management processes can be found
on pages 61 and 62. 
In 2015, the significant issues at the forefront of
the Committee’s deliberations were: valuation
and impairment testing of goodwill and
intangible assets; and accounting and disclosure
in relation to the changes to the Group’s
operations in the Middle East. The Committee
also considered the impact that the Group’s
adoption of S3 would have in enhancing the
Group’s internal controls. 
I am pleased to present the Committee’s Report
for 2015.
John Hirst, Chairman of the Audit Committee
Composition
The composition of the Committee is set out on
page 58. The Chairman of the Committee has

Deloitte reported on it’s views of the Group’s
financial management process and any matters
that they thought should be brought to the
attention of the Committee.
Role
The Committee’s main responsibilities include: 
• Scrutinising the Group’s annual and interim
financial statements and accounts and reporting
to the Board on the significant financial
reporting issues and judgements made

Accounts and advising the Board whether,
taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information
necessary for shareholders to assess the
Company’s position and performance, business
model and strategy
• Reviewing the scope and effectiveness of the
external audit process, including negotiating
the terms of the external auditor’s
appointment, scope, fees and independence
and supervising any audit tender process
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the internal
audit function and the adequacy and
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal
control, including financial reporting, and the
processes for assessing business risks and
monitoring and managing the impact of the
risks facing the Group
The Committee has written terms of reference
which include all matters recommended by the
Code. These terms of reference are reviewed
and approved by the Board annually and are
available on the Group’s website 
(www.ultra-electronics.com).

How the Committee addressed these judgements
The Committee considered the judgements taken in accounting for the termination event and the

the treatment of the minority interest, and the associated disclosures presented in this Annual Report. 
The Committee assessed the risk control processes and approval practices adopted when determining
revenue and profit recognition.
The Committee reviewed the methodology and assumptions used to determine the balance sheet
values. The Committee also considered reports from, and held discussions with, the external auditors.
The Committee reviewed the main assumptions used in determining the defined benefit post
retirement obligation.
Internal audit 
PwC are appointed by Ultra as its internal auditor.
The Committee uses internal audit as its key
resource for gaining independent assurance on the
effectiveness of the system of internal control. The
internal audit plan and resources are considered
and monitored by the Committee, together with
all internal control findings and remedial actions.
The lead partner of PwC reports directly to the
Chairman of the Committee and presents the
findings twice annually to the Committee.
Progress reports on follow-up remedial actions
are reported regularly to the Committee. PwC
confirms whether appropriate action has been
taken to address the risks when they next visit
the business concerned.
The effectiveness of internal audit is assessed by
the review of internal audit reports, meetings with
the Chairman of the Committee without
management being present and views from senior
management and the Group Finance Director. 
External auditor
The performance, effectiveness and
independence of the Company’s auditor,
Deloitte, are reviewed annually by the
Committee. The Committee considered the
questions contained in a questionnaire issued by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland in October 2007 to assess performance,
effectiveness and independence and concluded
that Deloitte had been sufficiently transparent
and incisive and the audits had been effective. 
The Committee concluded that Deloitte was 
both independent and objective and that the 
re-appointment of Deloitte as external auditor
should be recommended to the shareholders.
Accordingly, a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte
will be put to shareholders at the 2016 Annual
General Meeting. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 67

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
External auditor (continued)
The senior audit partner employed by Deloitte on
the Group’s audit is subject to a strict policy of
regular rotation such that there is a change in this
role at least once every five years. This is in
accordance with professional practice guidelines.
The current senior audit partner’s tenure
commenced in 2011 and therefore a new audit
partner will be appointed in 2016. Deloitte was
appointed in 2002. The Committee considers that
for an organisation of the size and complexity of
Ultra, the tendering of external audit must be well
planned to ensure that the Group complies with
best practice corporate governance as well as
ensuring the Group receives a high quality, efficient
and effective external audit service. In particular, the
Committee does not consider it is appropriate to
consider tendering the external audit at the same
time as recruiting and inducting a new Group
Finance Director and therefore considers it would
be appropriate to conduct an external audit
tender by no later than 2023 at which point
Deloitte would be precluded from being Ultra’s
external auditor. The Company is in compliance
with the requirements of the Statutory Audit
Services for Large Companies Market
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive
Tender Processes and Audit Committee
Responsibilities) Order 2014 and the Code. 
There are no contractual obligations that restrict
the Committee’s choice of external auditor.
The auditor’s engagement letter and the scope
of the year’s annual audit cycle is discussed in
advance by the Committee, ensuring that any
changes in circumstances arising since the
previous year are taken into account. With respect
to non-audit services undertaken by Deloitte, Ultra
has a policy to ensure that the provision of such
services do not impair Deloitte’s independence or
objectivity. The policy states that:
• non-audit services are restricted to regulatory
reporting, consultancy services associated with
financial restructuring, responding to new
reporting requirements, due diligence
assessments of potential acquisitions and minor
consultancy work. In connection with due
diligence work and tax consultancy, it is the
Board’s view that the auditor’s familiarity with
the Company’s accounting practices and the
techniques that are involved in the Company’s
long-term contracting activities serves them
well in carrying out such work;
• when considering the use of the external
auditor to undertake non-audit work,
consideration must be given to the provisions
of the Financial Reporting Council Guidance
on Audit Committees with regard to the
preservation of independence and objectivity;
• the external auditor must certify to the
Company that they are acting independently;
• in providing a non-audit service, the external
auditor should not:
– audit their own work;
– make management decisions for 
the Company;
– create a mutuality of interest; or
– find themselves in the role of advocate 
for Ultra;
• the Group Finance Director has authority to
commission the external auditor to undertake
non-audit work where there is a specific
project with a cost that is not expected to
exceed £50,000. Any individual assignments
with an estimated fee in excess of £50,000
must be referred in advance to the Chairman
of the Committee for his approval. All non-
audit work has to be reported to the
Committee at its next meeting; and
• before commissioning non-audit services, the
Group Finance Director or the Chairman of
the Committee, as appropriate, must ensure
that there is no issue as regards independence
and objectivity and that other potential
providers are adequately considered.
The effectiveness of the external audit process is
assessed by the Committee, which meets
regularly throughout the year with the senior
audit partner and senior audit managers. Key to
the overall effectiveness of the process is that
both the Company and the auditor make the
other aware of accounting and financial
reporting issues as and when they arise, and this
exchange is not limited to the period in which
formal audit and review engagements take place.
This general approach is supported by a formal
feedback request process whereby each of the
businesses in the Group are requested to
feedback comments on the audit process, the
performance of the auditor and any
recommendations for the audit process going
forward. A debrief meeting is then held with
Deloitte to discuss the results of the feedback
and agree on any measures for improvement of
the audit process. 
The Committee believes that sufficient and
appropriate information is obtained from the
feedback request to form an overall judgment on
the effectiveness of the external audit process.
The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of audit and
non-audit services are shown in note 98 to the
Financial Statements.
The Group has a policy on employment of
former employees of the external auditor. This
requires that any such employment is considered
on a case by case basis and takes into account
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
on such appointments. Such appointment
requires approval by a combination of the Group
Finance Director, the Committee and the Board,
depending on the seniority of the appointment.
Fraud
The internal audit process carried out by PwC,
described on page 62, and the Group’s internal
control framework help to protect the Group
against fraud. Regular business reviews take place
at all businesses, in which detailed balance sheet
and cash flow reviews are carried out by the
relevant Divisional Managing and Financial
Directors. In addition, the Group Finance Director
and Group Chief Operating Officer review the
performance of the businesses with the Divisional
team monthly and directly with the businesses at
least twice a year. Significant differences between
forecast and reported financial results are
highlighted and require explanation by the
business unit concerned. The Chief Executive and
Group Marketing Director also attend such
divisional/business reviews as the case requires.
The internal control framework that is in place is
supplemented by the external audit process which
represents a second independent review of
controls and procedures, with selective transaction
testing of higher risk areas. There is a fraud
reporting process in place. All cases of fraud would
be immediately investigated and the situation
reported to the Committee and the Board.
Whistleblowing
An independently hosted Employee Hotline
(EthicsPoint) is used to provide a process for
reporting ethical concerns. Such concerns can be
filed anonymously. Employees are informed of
this process through posters (which are
translated into local languages) and through the
Group intranet (which is accessible by all
employees). Activities were undertaken in 2015
to republicise EthicsPoint to increase awareness
and engender a culture where employees feel
comfortable raising ethical dilemmas. Employee
concerns are forwarded to the Chairman of the
Committee or, in the case of issues covered by
US security legislation, to the Chairman of the
Security Committee of either Ultra’s Special
Security Agreement company or Ultra’s Proxy
Board company, as appropriate. During 2015, 
13 reports were submitted (two in 2014) which
were investigated and dealt with appropriately.
Ultra views the increase in reports as an
illustration of the success of its activities in 2015
to republicise EthicsPoint and create a more
open and ethical workplace. 
Anti-bribery
Ultra has robust anti-bribery policies and
procedures in place. All Directors and employees
are required to sign Ultra’s code of conduct on
anti-bribery and commit to act in accordance
with it. Within one week of joining Ultra, all
Directors and employees undertake anti-bribery
training. Further anti-bribery training is given to
targeted groups throughout the year. Compliance
with the code of conduct on anti-bribery is
closely monitored by a requirement for Ultra
businesses to submit monthly business
performance reports confirming compliance with
the code of conduct and reporting any breaches.
The Group intranet contains a statement from
the Chief Executive regarding compliance with
Ultra’s anti-bribery policies.

Remuneration Report
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear shareholder
As the Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee, I am pleased to present the
Remuneration Report, prepared by the
Remuneration Committee (the Committee) and
approved by the Board, for the financial year
ended 31 December 2015. It has been prepared
in accordance with Schedule 8 of The Large and
Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts
and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in
August 2013 and has been divided into the
following three sections:
1. this Annual Statement, which summarises
the major decisions on, and any substantial
changes to, Directors’ remuneration;
2. the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Report, which sets out Ultra’s policy on the
remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive
Directors; and
3. the Annual Report on Remuneration,
which discloses how the Remuneration Policy
will be implemented in the year ending 31
December 2016 and how it was implemented
in the year ended 31 December 2015.
As the Committee is not seeking to make any
changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Report for 2016, only the Annual Statement
and Annual Report on Remuneration will be
tabled for shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
Remuneration policy for 2016
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, as approved
by the majority of shareholders at the 2015 AGM,
will remain unchanged and therefore will apply to
remuneration payable to Directors for 2016.
However, reflecting the Committee’s desire to
increase alignment between the Executive
Directors and shareholders, the Committee has
decided to enhance the existing approved policy
by the introduction of a two-year post-vesting
holding period which will be applied, at the
Committee’s discretion, to Long-Term Incentive
Plan (LTIP) awards made in 2016 and thereafter.
Therefore, while the LTIP vesting and performance
period will continue to be set at three years,
Executive Directors will be asked to retain the
net of tax awards until at least the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant. Consistent with
past practice, LTIP awards for 2016 will be
granted at 125% of salary for the Chief
Executive and 100% of salary for other Executive
Directors. In line with last year’s awards, 20% of
awards will vest for median TSR as measured
against the constituents of the FTSE 250
(excluding investment trusts) increasing pro-rata
to full vesting for upper quartile performance. In
addition to the TSR targets, an EPS underpin
must be achieved for awards to vest. For 2016,
the EPS underpin will be reduced from 15% over
three years to 9%, to reflect the challenging
economic environment. Malus and clawback
provisions will continue to operate.
In addition, the Committee determined that 
the salary review date should be defered from 
1 January to 1 April to better align it with the
Group’s financial results. Executive Directors were
not compensated for this three month deferral.
The holding period and change to the salary
review date will be incorporated formally into
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for approval
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM (i.e. the end
of the original three-year policy period). The
Committee also elected to defer the Chairman
and other Non-Executive Directors fee review
date to 1 April.
Finally, the Committee intends to relax the
current policy in respect of the Chief Executive
not being permitted to accept outside
appointments as a non-executive director. As
such, Rakesh Sharma will be given permission to
seek one non-executive director role (in line with
the other Executive Directors) and the Directors’
Remuneration Policy will be amended at the
2017 AGM (and apply retrospectively if
necessary), subject to shareholder approval.
Performance and reward during 2015
The continuing uncertainty in Ultra’s core defence
markets led it to adopt a prudent view of annual
performance which it has delivered against.
Revenue and underlying operating profit were
£726.3m (2014: £713.7m) and £120.0m (2014:
£118.1m) respectively; underlying earnings per
share were 123.9p (2014: 123.1p); operating
cash flow was £81.3m (2014: £83.1m); and total
shareholder return was 6% (2014: 8%).
Reflecting this, the Executive Directors earned 
an annual bonus for 2015 (see page 75) (no
bonus was paid for 2014). The 2013 LTIP 
awards which had been due to crystalise in 2016
based on three-year TSR and EPS performance 
to 31 December 2015 will not vest as a result of
performance targets not being met.
Board change
As announced, Mary Waldner tendered her
resignation from the Group in November 2015
and will leave on 16 March 2016 following the
preliminary 2015 results announcement. The
Nomination Committee is in the process of
finding a replacement and, when appointed, their
remuneration arrangements will be in line with the
policy set out in this report and will be disclosed in
full in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Shareholder engagement
I am pleased to say that our voting result at the
2015 AGM was 97.03% in favour of the
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report and
99.06% in favour of the Annual Statement and
Annual Report on Remuneration.
In conclusion, the Board firmly considers that
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy continues to
be aligned with the strategic aims of the Group
in adding to shareholder value and supporting
the long-term success of the Company.

The policy described in this section, which was originally approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, with minor amendments approved at the 2015 AGM,
remains unchanged for the year ending 31 December 2016. 
Policy overview
The Group’s Remuneration Policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling Ultra to recruit, motivate and retain executives of a high calibre,
whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments. The remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers is aligned with the Group’s
objectives and the interests of shareholders.

appointed with a salary
significantly below the
competitive level
Annual salary increases for
Executive Directors will not
normally exceed the average
increase awarded to other 
UK-based company employees

Notes to policy table:
(1) A description of how the Company intends to
implement the policy in 2016 is set out in the
Annual Report on Remuneration.
(2) The Remuneration Policy described above
provides an overview of the structure that
operates for the most senior executives in the
Group. Lower levels of incentive operate for
employees below executive level, with
remuneration driven by market comparators
and the impact of the role. Long-term
incentives are reserved for those anticipated as
having the greatest potential to influence the
Group’s earnings growth and share price
performance, although as the Committee is
aware of the benefits which wider employee
share ownership can generate, all employees
are encouraged to participate in the AESOP
and Savings Related Share Option Scheme in
the countries in which they are offered. 
(3) The choice of the performance metrics
applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect
the Committee’s view that any incentive
compensation should be appropriately
challenging and largely tied to financial 
performance. The TSR and EPS performance
conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected
by the Committee on the basis that:
• TSR aligns the performance objectives of the
Executive Directors (TSR is one of the
Group’s Key Performance Indicators) more
closely with the interests of the shareholders;
• TSR is an entirely objective measure of
relative performance;
• The use of TSR and EPS reflects the metrics
most commonly used by other quoted
companies;
• TSR reduces the complexity and cost of
calculating the vesting result; and
• The EPS underpin ensures an appropriate level
of profit growth is maintained by the Group.
(4) None of the employee share plans operate
performance conditions.
(5) As highlighted above, Ultra has a share
ownership policy which requires the Executive
Directors to build up and maintain a target
holding equal to 100% of base salary (125%
for the Chief Executive). Details of the extent 
to which the Executive Directors had complied
with this policy as at 31 December 2015 are
set out on page 78.
(6) For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this
amended Directors’ Remuneration Policy,
authority was given to Ultra to honour any
commitments entered into with current or
former Directors (such as, but not limited to,
the payment of a pension or the
vesting/exercise of past share awards) that
have been disclosed to and approved by
shareholders in previous Remuneration
Reports. Details of any payments to former
Directors will be set out in the Annual Report
on Remuneration as they arise.
(7) While the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will
remain unchanged and therefore will apply to
remuneration payable to Directors for 2016,
reflecting the Committee’s desire to increase
alignment between the Executive Directors and
shareholders, the Committee has decided to
enhance the existing approved policy by the
introduction of a two-year post-vesting holding
period which will be applied, at the 
Committee’s discretion, to LTIP awards made in
2016 and thereafter. Therefore, while the LTIP
performance period will continue to be
measured over three years, Executive Directors
will be asked to retain the net of tax awards
until at least the fifth anniversary of the date of
grant. The holding period will be incorporated
formally into the Directors’ Remuneration
Policy at the 2017 AGM (i.e. the end of the
original three-year policy period).
(8) Although the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
states that the base salary review date will
normally be 1 January, the Remuneration
Committee determined that the 2016 salary
review date should be deferred until 1 April
(and then annually thereafter) to better align it
with the Group’s financial results. Executive
Directors were not compensated for this three
month deferral to the effective date. This
change to the salary review date will be
incorporated permanently and formally into
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 2017
AGM (i.e. the end of the original three year
policy period). 
ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS
The Executive Directors are
eligible to participate in the
Company’s HMRC approved 
All-Employee Share Ownership
Plan (AESOP) and the Savings
Related Share Option Scheme
on the same terms as other
employees
To encourage employee share
ownership and increase
alignment with shareholders
Under the AESOP , UK
employees are offered the
opportunity to buy shares up to
the prevailing HMRC limits per
annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust
until the maturity date or until
employment with Ultra ends
Under the Savings Related
Share Option Scheme,
employees are entitled to save
up to the prevailing HMRC
limits or the lower limit set by
Ultra per annum from net pay
towards the purchase of
options to buy Ultra shares
Under the AESOP up to the value of
£1,500 per annum from pre-tax pay
Under the Savings Related Share
Option Scheme, up to £1,200 per
annum from post-tax pay 
n/a Remuneration scenarios for 
Executive Directors
The charts below show how the composition of
the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages
varies at three performance levels, namely, at
minimum (i.e. fixed pay including pensions and
taxable benefits), target and maximum levels,
under the policy set out in the table overleaf.
The charts show the proportion of the total
package comprised of each element.
Director recruitment policy
The Nomination Committee normally considers
both internal and external candidates before any
new appointment is made. New Executive
Directors are provided with remuneration
consisting of base salary, short-term incentive,
long-term incentive and other benefits.
Salary
Ultra’s policy is to set pay for Executive Directors
at industry competitive levels taking market
capitalisation and annual sales into account. It is
recognised that a new appointee may not have
as much experience as someone at a competitive
level and may therefore be offered a salary
below competitive levels but at a level that is
sufficient to attract the person. In exceptional
circumstances, the Committee may exercise its
discretion to offer an above industry competitive
level salary in order to attract the best person.
Short-term incentives
Short-term incentives are offered in line with
those paid to other Executive Directors.
Maximum opportunities will be in line with
current plan maximums for existing Executive
Directors (i.e. 100% of salary p.a.).
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives are offered in line with those
paid to other Executive Directors. Maximum
opportunities will be in line with current plan
maximum for existing Executive Directors (i.e. up
to 125% of salary p.a. or 150% of salary p.a. in
exceptional circumstances). 
Other benefits
Other benefits are offered in line with those
paid to other Executive Directors.
Buy outs
To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make
an award to buy-out incentive arrangements
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing
so, the Committee will take account of all relevant
factors including any performance conditions
attached to these awards and the time over which
they would have vested or been paid. Ultra may
make use of the flexibility provided in the Listing
Rules (LR 9.4.2) to make awards if appropriate.
Where possible, incentives will be bought out on a
like-for-like basis with respect to vesting/payment
dates, currency (i.e. cash versus shares) and the
use of performance targets.
Non-Executive Directors
The approach to the recruitment of Non-Executive
Directors is to pay an annual fixed fee, after
considering existing Non-Executive Directors fee
levels, market levels and expected time
commitment. In deciding whether to accept any
fee increase the Non-Executive Directors consider
Company performance.
Executive Director service contracts
The Group’s policy is to ensure that the Executive
Directors’ service contracts have a notice period
of one year, which the Committee considers
appropriately reflects both current market
practice and the balance between the interests
of the Group and each Executive Director. The
following table provides more information on
each Executive Director’s service contract:
Original date Notice 
Name of contract period
R. Sharma 21 Apr 2011 12 months
M. Waldner 1 Jul 2013 12 months
M. Anderson 11  Apr 2012 12 months
No Executive Directors have provisions in their
contracts for compensation on early termination
other than for the notice period.
External appointments of Executive Directors
Executive Directors may accept not more than
one external appointment as a Non-Executive
Director. Up to 50% of any time spent
undertaking such external duties can be taken
as additional unpaid leave with the remainder
being treated as annual holiday.
Executive Director exit policy
Ultra may terminate an Executive Director’s
contract early with contractual notice or by way
of a payment in lieu of notice, at its discretion.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice
will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payments in lieu of notice will equate to the
basic salary and benefits payable during the
notice period or, if notice has already been
given, the remainder of the notice period.
Payment in lieu of notice will be made by way of
a lump sum or by phased instalments over the
notice period. Where payments are phased, if an
employee gains employment during the notice
period, payments would be reduced. There is no
contractual entitlement to annual incentive
payments in respect of the notice period. An
annual bonus may be payable with respect to
the period of the financial year served although
it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the
normal payment date as defined by the bonus
scheme rules. 
Any share-based entitlements granted to an
Executive Director under the Group’s share plans
will be determined based on the relevant plan
rules. The default treatment under the 2007 LTIP
is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation
of employment. However, if a participant ceases
to hold office or employment because of death
or for any other circumstance, at the discretion of
the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be
applied. For good leavers, the Committee can
decide that awards will vest on the date they
would normally have vested had the participant
not ceased to hold office or employment.

Alternatively, the Committee can decide that
awards will vest on cessation. In both cases, the
award will vest subject to the satisfaction of the
relevant performance conditions at that time
and a pro rata reduction to reflect the period of
time from the date of grant of the award to the
date of cessation relative to the normal three
year vesting period. However, the Committee
can decide not to apply a pro rata reduction if it
regards it as inappropriate to do so in any
particular case.
Non-Executive Director appointment letters
The Non-Executive Directors have appointment
letters fixed for 12 months with no notice
period. Details of their appointment letters are in
the table below:

D. Caster 22 Apr 2016 Nil

Sir Robert Walmsley 1 Jan 2017 Nil
There are no provisions in their appointment
letters for compensation on early termination.
How employment conditions elsewhere in
the Group are considered
Base salary increases take into account a number
of factors including the underlying base salary
increases within the overall Group. Pay is only set
centrally for Executive Directors, Executive Team
members, Divisional staff, Business Managing
Directors/Presidents, UK Directors and Head
Office staff. All other salaries are set within the
operating businesses. In all cases there are two
levels of approval. The Committee does not
consult with employees when setting the
remuneration of Executive Directors. It uses
independent comparison metrics to benchmark
remuneration with other companies.
How shareholders’ views are taken 
into account
The Committee considers shareholder feedback
received during the year. At the 2015 Annual
General Meeting, 99.06% of our shareholders
voted in favour of the Annual Statement and
Annual Report on Remuneration and 97.03%
voted for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Malus and clawback policy
Consistent with best practice, Ultra operates
malus (i.e. the ability to reclaim deferred
remuneration prior to payment/vesting) and
clawback (i.e. the ability to reclaim amounts
paid) provisions in respect of the annual bonus
and LTIP . The triggers which may result in the
malus and/or clawback provisions being invoked
cover misstatement, error in respect of the
calculation of a payment, where an individual
has (or would have) been dismissed for gross
misconduct and where there has been an
exceptional negative event.

Remuneration Report
Annual Report on Remuneration
Implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2016
A summary of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied for the year ending 31 December 2016 is set out below.
Salaries
While the normal base salary review date is 1 January, the Committee determined that the 2016 salary review date should be deferred until 1 April 2016 to
better align it with the Group’s financial results. Executive Directors were not compensated for this three month deferral to the effective date. It is intended
that this change to the salary review date will apply going forward and be incorporated permanently and formally into the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
at the 2017 AGM (i.e. the end of the original three year policy period).
Current Executive Director salary levels are as follows:
Increase
2016 2015 awarded from
Salary Salary 1 April 2016
£’000 £’000 %
R. Sharma 535 522 2.5
M. Waldner 317 317 -
M. Anderson 254 248 2.5
Both Rakesh Sharma and Mark Anderson will receive an inflationary base salary increase of 2.5% from 1 April 2016, in line with the average increase
awarded to the workforce as a whole. As Mary Waldner announced her resignation from the Company, her salary would remain unchanged. 
Directors’ pension entitlements
The Group will continue to operate a defined benefit pension scheme arrangement for Rakesh Sharma until 5 April 2016 (when the defined benefit scheme
will close) with provision based on a calculation by the scheme actuary. A full review of pension provision for Rakesh Sharma will be carried out in advance
of the next Directors’ Remuneration Policy review prior to the 2017 AGM. Mark Anderson and Mary Waldner will continue to participate in the defined
contribution scheme, receiving annual company contributions of up to 18% of salary (with Mary Waldner’s contribution pro-rated up to cessation).
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors’ fees will increase by 2.5% from 1 April 2016, in line with inflation and the average increase awarded to
the workforce.
Annual bonus for 2016
The maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2016 will continue to be 100% of base salary. 
Consistent with the prior year, a maximum of 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target, a maximum of 60% payable
for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target, and a maximum 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of strategic non-financial
measures. No bonus will be paid in respect of the non-financial element of the bonus if the Committee considers the Company’s financial performance to
be unsatisfactory or there is an exceptional negative event during (or just after) the relevant financial year. As the Committee considers that commercial
sensitivities restrict the disclosure of forward-looking annual bonus targets, retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next year’s Annual
Report on Remuneration.
Long-term awards to be granted in 2016
Consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee intends to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 125%
of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other Executive Directors during 2016 (with the exception of Mary Waldner who is due to leave the
company in 2016).
As per last year’s grant, 20% of awards will vest at median TSR ranking, increasing to 100% vesting for an upper quartile TSR ranking, measured against the
constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts). In addition to the TSR target, there is an underpin requiring an average growth of EPS (after
adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition). For the 2016 awards, this will be
reduced from 15% over the three-year performance period to 9% over the three-year performance period to reflect the challenging economic environment.
From 2016 onwards, all awards granted to Executive Directors will also be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period, whereby net of tax awards
vesting cannot normally be sold until at least the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.  Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 75

Annual bonus for year under review – Audited
Annual bonuses in relation to 2015 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets,
as well as individual strategic objectives. Financial targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board. They were adjusted where
appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of “stretch” challenge and incentive to outperform. Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance
Indicators by which the Group is measured. Please refer to pages 28 and 29 for details.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2015 were a maximum of 20% of salary (subject to the achievement of £111.8m profit before tax and loss on
fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles on acquisition), and a maximum of 60% of salary (subject to achieving an operating
cash flow of £77.7m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure, purchase of long-term incentive plan shares and the Committee exercising
its discretion on movements in working capital to ensure working capital management throughout the financial year was in the short and long term
interests of the Company). The remaining 20% of the bonus potential reflected strategic goals. 76 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc

The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows:
Actual Bonus

£’000 £’000 £’000 %
Underlying profit before tax 100,620 111,800 112,425 20%
Operating cash flow 49,500 77,700 81,314 51%
*Both threshold profit and operating cash flow targets must be exceeded for any payment
In addition, the Committee assessed performance against the strategic goals which were based on the: (i) completion of an organisational efficiency review; 
(ii) implementation of the segment re-organisation, (iii) key contract negotiations; (iv) enhancement of investor relations; (v) review of the Business Continuity Plans;
(vi) book to bill ratio; and (vii) performance of sales and marketing. The Committee determined that bonuses of 17.2%, 17.0% and 10.1% of salary (max
20%) should be payable to Rakesh Sharma, Mary Waldner and Mark Anderson respectively.
In assessing the strategic targets, the Committee retained discretion not to make a payment if it considered that Ultra’s financial performance was
unsatisfactory or there was an exceptional negative event during (or just after) the relevant financial year.

Total defined benefit pension entitlements – Audited
Under the defined benefit scheme, a pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years. Where
pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service. With the Group’s
consent, Executive Directors may retire from age 55. After age 58, Group consent to early retirement is not required. The pension is reduced in the event
of early retirement. In the event of death-in-service, a spouse’s pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for
dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant. On the death of a retired Executive Director, a spouse’s pension of
50% of the Executive Director’s pension is payable. Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Executive Director’s pension above the Guaranteed
Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5% for service prior to 1 April 2008 and at 5%
thereafter, above which increases are at the Trustees’ and the Group’s discretion. 
No Executives accrued direct benefits under defined benefit schemes during the year. As Rakesh Sharma ceased accruing a direct benefit from 6 April 2014,
his pension provision is currently determined on an annual basis by the scheme actuary such that it is equivalent in value to the value of defined benefits
formerly accrued.
The defined benefit scheme will close from 5 April 2016. A full review of pension provision for Rakesh Sharma will be carried out in advance of the next
Directors’ Remuneration Policy review prior to the 2017 AGM.

The role and composition of the Remuneration Committee
Role 
The role of the Committee is to: 
• determine and agree with the Board the framework and broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, Chairman of the Board and senior
management reporting to the Executive Directors (the Executive Team);
• ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group’s overall performance with due regard to the
interests of shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the Group; and 
• ensure that contractual arrangements, including the termination of Executive Directors, are fair both to the individuals concerned and to the Group. 
The Committee’s terms of reference include all matters indicated by the Code and are approved and reviewed by the Board annually. The terms of
reference are available on the Group’s website (www.ultra-electronics.com).
Composition 
Martin Broadhurst was Chairman of the Committee and Sir Robert Walmsley was a member throughout the year. Chris Bailey was a member of the
Committee until his retirement on 30 April 2015. John Hirst joined the Committee on 2 March 2015. 
Sharon Harris continued to act as Secretary to the Committee. Although not Committee members, the Chairman, Chief Executive and Group HR Director
normally attend Committee meetings by invitation, except where matters directly relating to their own remuneration are discussed.

Advice 
Wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes is received from New Bridge Street, part of Aon plc. New Bridge Street is a member
of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to its Code of Conduct. New Bridge Street was appointed by the Committee after a tender process
and, during the year, provided the Group with advice on the operation of Ultra’s LTIP and other share schemes, remuneration benchmarking services and an
annual update on market and best practice. During 2015, insurance broking services were also provided to the Group by other subsidiaries of Aon plc which the
Committee considers in no way prejudices New Bridge Street’s position as the Committee’s independent advisers. Fees charged by New Bridge Street for advice
provided to the Committee for 2015 amounted to £47,571 (excluding VAT). Pension advisory services were provided to the Committee and the Group by Towers
Watson. Fees charged by Towers Watson for advice provided to the Committee for 2015 amounted to £138,795 (excluding VAT), 75% of which was related to
the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme (see page 26). In addition, the Committee consults the Chief Executive with regard to the remuneration and
benefits packages offered to Executive Directors (other than in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package) and members of the Executive Team.
The 2016 Annual General Meeting 
The Committee remains of the view the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy is fair and balanced between employees and shareholders and that there is
strong alignment to the Group’s strategy. As such, the Committee encourages shareholders to vote in favour of the Annual Statement and Annual Report
on Remuneration resolution at the 2016 AGM. The Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 26 February 2016 and signed on its behalf by:

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2015
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc is the Group holding company and it is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group, together with the Accounts and independent auditor’s report for the year ended 
31 December 2015. Details in relation to health and safety, the environment and greenhouse gas emissions, business ethics and employment practices are
included in the Sustainability section on pages 42 to 51 of the Strategic Report. The Corporate Governance Report on pages 54 to 64 forms part of this
report, and the financial risk management objectives and policies can be found in note 23.
Strategic Report
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) Ultra is required to set out information which helps the shareholders assess how the Directors have
performed their duty to promote the success of the Group, together with a fair review of the Group’s business and a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties facing the Group. The information that satisfies these requirements can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 36 to 41.
Results and dividends
The Group results and dividends are as follows:
2015
£’000
Balance on retained earnings, beginning of year 246,132
Total comprehensive income for the year 22,949
Dividends: 2014 final paid of 31.1p per share (21,695)
2015 interim paid of 13.8p per share (9,637)
Equity-settled employee share schemes 979
Balance on retained earnings, end of year 238,728

interim dividend was paid on 25 September 2015, making a total of 46.1p (2014: 44.3p) per share in the year.
Future developments 
A review of the activities and future developments of the Group is contained in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 4 to 7.
Research and development
The Directors are committed to maintaining a significant level of research and development expenditure in order to expand the Group’s range of
proprietary products. During the year a total of £146.6 million (2014: £157.1 million) was spent on engineering and business development of which
£110.6 million (2014: £115.9 million) was funded by customers and £36.0 million (2014: £41.2 million) by the Group.
Supplier payment policy
Individual operating businesses are responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions under which they conduct business transactions with their suppliers.
It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms, provided that the supplier is also complying with all relevant terms
and conditions. Trade payable days of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 were 60 days (2014: 64 days) based on the ratio of Group trade
payables at the end of the year to the amounts invoiced during the year by suppliers.
Employment policy
It is the policy of Ultra to create a working environment in which there is no discrimination and all employment decisions are based entirely on merit and the
ability of people to perform their intended roles. Ultra aims to continue to build a workforce that is recruited from the widest possible talent pool (see page 48).
Political expenditure 
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have made any political donations during the year.
Directors and their interests 
The Directors who served throughout the year and to the date of signing these financial statements (see biographies on page 53), and their interests in
the shares and share options of Ultra at 26 February 2016 are shown in the Annual Report on Remuneration (see pages 74 to 80).
Directors’ indemnities
The Group has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors which were made during the year and remain in force at
the date of this report.
The Directors present their annual report on 
the affairs of the Group, together with the 
accounts and independent auditor’s report, 
for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Branches
The Company and its subsidiaries have established branches, where appropriate, in a number of countries outside the UK. Their results are, however, not
material to the Group’s financial results.
Contractual arrangements
The Group contracts with a large number of customers in order to sell its wide portfolio of specialist capabilities to a broad range of customers around
the world. The Group’s largest customers are the US Department of Defense and UK Ministry of Defence. A wide range of separate contracts are entered
into with these customers by different Ultra businesses through different project offices and project teams. The Group also contracts with numerous
suppliers across the world and manages these arrangements to ensure that it is not over-dependent on a single supplier. This is normally achieved through
dual sourcing specialist components.
Purchase of own shares
During the year Ultra purchased no (2014: nil) ordinary shares and no (2014: nil) ordinary shares were distributed following vesting of awards under the
Ultra Electronics Long-Term Incentive Plan. At 31 December 2015, the Group held 235,245 ordinary shares under the Ultra Electronics Long-Term Incentive
Plan (representing 0.3% of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 December 2015).
Substantial shareholdings
As at 26 February 2016, Ultra had been notified, in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency rules, of the following voting rights as

Opinion on financial statements of 
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Going concern and the Directors’ assessment
of the principal risks that would threaten
the solvency or liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting and the Directors’ statement on the
longer-term viability of the Group, which are both contained within the strategic report on page 27
to the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 27 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future
performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 37 to 41 that describe those risks and explain how they are being
managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in the statement of accounting policies on page 123 to the financial
statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of
the financial statements;
• the Director’s explanation on page 27 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group,
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment,
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not
identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and
we confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of
the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 85
Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Risk
Ithra related provisions
Refer to page 129 (critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty – assessment of Ithra related
provisions); and page 66 (Audit Committee
report – significant judgements considered).
During the period, the Oman Airport IT
Contract was terminated and subsequently Ithra
(a jointly owned subsidiary in Oman) was placed
into voluntary liquidation. At 31 December 2014,
the Group recognised a £37.2m provision against
contract receivables and a £9.7m provision for
other termination costs. At 31 December 2015
management continues to provide for all known
liabilities, where they can be reliably estimated.
A liquidator was apponted for Ithra and is
pursuing claims against the customer on behalf
of interested parties, consequently there
remains significant uncertainty regarding the
likely outcome of these negotations.
The material and uncertain nature of these
balances means that we consider the accuracy
of these estimated values to be a key audit risk.
How the scope of our audit responded 
to the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over the
accuracy of Ithra related provisions.
To challenge management’s judgements we have
reviewed correspondence relating to the contract
termination by the customer, and subsequently
with the liquidator appointed for Ithra. In
addition, we have reviewed legal correspondence
between the Group and its external legal counsel.
We have obtained third party evidence for all
known costs to be incurred including specific
legal and supplier liabilities.
For costs incurred during the year, we have traced
a sample back to supporting third party evidence,
and used these actual costs incurred to challenge
the accuracy of anticipated costs to come.
We have continued to assess the recoverability
of contract balances and associated costs of
recovering these contract balances through our
review of correspondence relating to the
negotiations and the likely timing of any receipt
or agreed settlement process.
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect
on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the
engagement team:
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Revenue recognition
Refer to page 128 (critical accounting judgements
and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
– assessment of contract accounting); page 125
(accounting policies – revenue recognition); and
page 66 (Audit Committee report – significant
judgements considered).
Revenue recognition is a risk area, specifically 
in relation to:
• Significant long term contracts. Subject to
meeting certain criteria, Ultra Electronics
adopts long term contract accounting for a
number of its contracts. Revenue recognised
on this basis in the year was £371.6m. In these
circumstances, a number of judgements are
undertaken which specifically impact the extent
of revenue and profit recognised, including:
determing the total contract value; estimating
the costs to completion and within this
judgements relating to the provision for the cost
of mitigating technical risks and meeting future
milestones; and assessing the percentage of
contract completion at the balance sheet date.
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over long-
term contract accounting. 
To confirm that revenue and profit recognised
to date are based on the current best estimate
of the degree of work performed under the
contract, we selected a sample of contracts and
reviewed the contract risk registers and
evidence for the progress made against the
contract, such as milestone completion, to
provide evidence over the judgement taken
when providing for the cost of mitigating
technical risks and meeting future milestones.
We also sought to verify the costs to complete
by agreeing to evidence of committed spend,
budgeted rates or actual costs incurred to date.
We understood and challenged management’s
assumptions by referring to evidence including
signed contract terms and latest project status
reports, and discussed contract progress and
future risks with contract engineers. We also
assessed the reliability of management estimates
through consideration of the historical accuracy of
prior period management estimates. 
For each contract selected for testing, we made
enquiries as to any unusual contract terms or side
agreements separate to the original contract, in
addition to detail testing of a sample of billings
and costs incurred to date.

To the members of Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Refer to page 129 (critical accounting judgements
and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
– goodwill impairment); page 126 (accounting
policies – intangible assets); and page 66
(Audit Committee report – significant
judgements considered).
The Group recognised £375.9m of goodwill and
£173.6m of acquired intangibles at 31 December
2015. There is a risk regarding the potential
impairment of the carrying value of these assets
given the judgements management are required
to make in respect of the assumptions used to
determine their recoverable amount. This is
further heightened by the challenging economic
environment in which the Group operates and the
decline in organic revenue and organic underlying
operating profit for the Group in 2015.
The key judgements include identification of
cash generating units and challenging the level
at which management monitor goodwill for
impairment purposes given the change in
methodology in the period from an individual
CGU level to a group of CGUs, growth rates in
future cashflow forecasts both short term and
longer term, discount rates applied to these
forecasts, and determining the impact of
reasonably possible changes in these assumptions.
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over
monitoring the carrying value of goodwill and
acquired intangibles. 
We challenged management’s revised approach
to the level at which goodwill is monitored for
impairment purposes through a review of the
level at which cashflows are internally reported
by management, evidence of the Group’s
capabilities through its go-to-market strategy,
and confirmation of management’s revised internal
process for monitoring goodwill for impairment.
We further challenged the risk of management bias
by recalculating the annual assessment of goodwill
impairment under the previous methodology
where goodwill was allocated to individual CGUs.
We challenged the assumptions used by
management in their impairment assessment by
using valuation specialists within the audit team to
benchmark the discount rate against independently
available data, together with peer group analysis,
our understanding of the secured orders
underpinning the Group’s cashflow forecasts,
and the historical performance of the businesses.
Having audited the assumptions, we checked
that the impairment model had been prepared
on the basis of management’s assumptions and
was arithmetically accurate. We challenged the
appropriateness of management’s sensitivities
based on our work performed on the key
assumptions, and recalculated these sensitised
scenarios.
With regards to the disclosures within the
Annual Report, we are satisfied that they
appropriately reflect the facts and circumstances
within management’s assessment of impairment
over goodwill and acquired intangibles, with
sufficient explanation provided for the change
in level at which goodwill is monitored.
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement (continued)
Risk
Revenue recognition (continued)
• Delivery of goods, due to the complex
contractual terms with regards to the transfer
of risk and reward that arise within the
Aerospace and Defence industry and therefore
whether revenue has been appropriately
recognised. The complexity is increased as
individual business units enter into different
contractual terms with different customers for
similar products.
How the scope of our audit responded 
to the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls around
revenue recognition.
We reviewed contractual evidence to understand
how the specific terms in respect of the transfer
of risk and reward had been met. Then we
performed a sample test of sales recognised either
side of the year end, and outstanding trade
receivables to substantiate whether the
appropriate terms of the relevant contracts had
been satisfied and that the risks and rewards
associated with the contract had passed to the
customer. We used external evidence, such as
shipping documentation or client acceptance
documentation to confirm that revenue had been
recognised in the appropriate period. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 87
Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement (continued)
Risk
Acquisition accounting
Refer to page 129 (critical accounting
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty – acquisition accounting); 
page 124 (accounting policies – business
combinations); and page 66 (Audit Committee
report – significant issues considered).
During the year, the Group entered into two
business combinations, being the Electronic
Products Division of Kratos Defense & Security
Solutions and Furnace Parts LLC. In aggregate,
£172.5m was paid in respect of these acquisitions.
There is a risk that acquisitions are not
accounted for correctly in line with IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations’. The risk relates to the
assumptions and assertions used by management
to forecast future trading performance to
determine both the fair value of acquired assets
and future contingent consideration payments.
How the scope of our audit responded 
to the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over
acquisition accounting. 
For the current year acquisitions, we made use of
our valuations specialists to support our review
of the acquisition accounting, and in particular
the valuation of acquired intangible assets
identified. We obtained calculations for the fair
value adjustments for these acquisitions and
assessed whether the period of assessment was
correct as well as confirming that the adjustment
was supported by actual trading data.
There was no contingent consideration on the
current year acquisitions. We confirmed this
against the signed sale and purchase agreements.
For historical acqusitions we compared the
forecast contingent consideration positions to
the post year end trading results, approved
budgets and historical levels of settlement. 
Pensions
Refer to page 129 (critical accounting
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty – pensions); page 125 (accounting
policies – pensions); and page 66 (Audit
Committee report – significant issues considered).
The Group operates four defined benefit
pension schemes, for which there is judgement
required in determining the valuation as
recorded at the balance sheet date, in
accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. At
31 December 2015, these four schemes had a
total net IAS 19 deficit of £84.8m.
The valuation is based on a number of assumptions
on both a micro and a macro-economic level as
disclosed in the notes to the accounts.
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over the
accounting for defined benefit pension schemes. 
We included pension specialists within our audit
team to assess the appropriateness of the
assumptions through benchmarking to industry
data, and methodology used to value the defined
benefit pension schemes at the balance sheet date.
In addition, we circularised the independent
actuary and investment managers responsible
for managing the pension fund to confirm the
source inputs into the pension valuation. This
provided assurance over the completeness of
the pension assets and the valuation for which
we further agreed a sample to publically
available asset valuations.
The risks described above have not changed from prior year, with the exception that we have no longer
included the significant risk in relation to completeness of warranty provisions due to the nature of the
Group’s warranty commitments going forwards. The description of risks should be read in conjunction
with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on page 66.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or
influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the
results of our work.
We have used professional judgement in determining an appropriate materiality benchmark. This
includes consideration of alternative benchmarks.
Underlying pre-tax profit is a key performance measure for the Group and it is therefore an
appropriate basis on which to determine materiality. However we do adjust underlying pre-tax profit
as presented by management, by deducting amortisation of acquired intangibles. The Group has
established a track record of making acquisitions and hence we consider amortisation of acquired
intangibles to be relevant when considering our basis for determining materiality.
On this basis, we determined materiality for the group to be £5.7 million (2014: £6.2 million), which
represents 7% (2014: 7%) of adjusted underlying pre-tax profit. The decrease in materiality is due
to a larger amortisation of acquired intangible assets in 2015 due to the acquisitions in the period.
The determined materiality equates to 2% (2014: 2%) of equity. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in
excess of £114,000 (2014: £124,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view,
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Our application of materiality
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including
Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on
that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 24 (2014: 25)
locations, 14 (2014: 14) of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining 10 (2014: 11) were
subject to either an audit of specified account balances or specified audit procedures where the extent
of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the
materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations.
These 24 (2014: 25) locations represent the principal business units and account for 85% (2014: 87%)
of the Group’s net assets, 90% (2014: 91%) of the Group’s revenue and 85% (2014: 91%) of the
Group’s underlying operating profit. They also provided an appropriate basis for undertaking audit
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the 24
(2014: 25) units was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were
lower than Group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures
to confirm that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial
information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team follows a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the
Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the
significant overseas components locations at least once every three years. Every year, regardless of
whether we have visited or not, we include the component audit partner and other senior members of
the component audit team in our team briefing, direct the scope of their work for the purposes of our
Group audit, discuss their risk assessment and review documentation of the findings from their work

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exceptions
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for
our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures
of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement
relating to the Company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in
our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our
knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual
report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses
those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems
include our dedicated professional standards review team [and independent partner reviews].
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

7 Deemed disposal of Ithra
On 4 March 2015, ‘Ithra’ (“Ultra Electronics in collaboration with Oman Investment Corporation LLC”), the legal entity established with the sole
purpose of delivering the Oman Airport IT contract, was placed into voluntary liquidation. A liquidator was appointed and is pursuing claims against
the customer on behalf of the interested parties. Ithra, upon liquidation, no longer meets the IFRS 10 criteria for consolidation as a subsidiary of the
Group and is, consequently, a deemed disposal as at 4 March 2015.
During 2014 the full expected cost of the Oman contract termination of £46,878,000 was charged to the consolidated income statement and impacted
the Group's profit for the year in 2014. The loss attributable to the Oman Investment Corporation (‘OIC’) non-controlling interest of £14,301,000 was
credited to reserves as mandated by IFRS 10 para B94. Upon deemed disposal, the existing non-controlling interest of £13,751,000 is not permitted to
be debited back against reserves, even though the cost has already been reflected in full on the face of the 2014 income statement, and is consequently
recycled through the income statement, together with £2,696,000 of foreign exchange losses recorded in the translation reserve over the life of the
entity. The net charge booked to exceptional Oman termination related costs in the 2015 income statement is as follows: 
2015 2014
£’000 £’000

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s Cash Generating Units (CGUs) which comprise its individual business units. Goodwill is initially allocated, in the
year a business is acquired, to CGUs expected to benefit from the acquisition. Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent
operations to which goodwill relates are transferred between CGUs. The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a reportable operating segment.
In 2015 the Group amended its internal organisation to better reflect the markets that the Group addresses so that business groupings reflect its
capabilities, evolving product offerings and market-facing-segments. The market-facing-segments are; Aerospace, Infrastructure, Nuclear,
Communications, C2ISR, Maritime, Land and Underwater Warfare. The reporting structure has been altered in a way that changes the composition
of one or more CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, and consequently goodwill has been reallocated to these market-facing-segments.
These represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill has been allocated to CGU
groupings as set out below:

Maritime & Land 102,382 99,378

As a result of this change in internal operation, the composition of the Group’s reportable segments has changed. As such, in line with IFRS 8, the
corresponding information for the prior year has been restated. Previously results were reported as the following divisions; Aircraft & Vehicle Systems,
Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems. They are now reported as Aerospace & Infrastructure, Communications & Security and
Maritime & Land.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares
cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan, representing the best estimate of future performance. These plans,
which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU
over the next five years. The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum. Cash flows
beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross
margins. Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks
specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2015 varied between 10.4% and 12.9% (2014: 10.8% to 13.7%). Future revenues are based on orders
already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates. Budget
and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historic experience, available government spending data and management and
industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates. Longer-term growth rates,
applied for the ten year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%. Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be
appropriate for the sectors in which it operates. Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary
pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development
and available markets. A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultra’s products and expertise from a number of US government
agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to:
(i) reduce the post-2020 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil.
(ii) apply a 20% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows.
(iii) consider specific market factors as noted above.

Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to a potential impairment in Infrastructure. Headroom, which represents the value derived from the key
growth assumptions in the Infrastructure value-in-use calculations, is £7.2m. Sensitivity (ii) results in a £0.5m impairment in Infrastructure; the CGU
grouping is sensitive to the ability of the remaining operations to win sufficient new customers over the medium term.
For all other CGUs, the value in use calculations exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
During the prior-year, the value-in-use of the Blue Sky Group CGU was lower than the carrying value of the CGU’s net operating assets and consequently
an impairment charge of £7.4m was recorded in administrative expenses in 2014. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of goodwill for the
Blue Sky Group CGU was £nil. As set out in note 2, the £7.4m impairment charge was included in 2014 as part of the non-underlying operating results
of the Group. Blue Sky Group is within the Aerospace & Infrastructure operating segment.

The Group’s interest in associate is represented by its 49% holding of ordinary shares in Al Shaheen Adventure LLC (“ASA”), a Company
incorporated in the UAE. The Group has significant influence over the entity but does not control it, consequently ASA has been accounted using
the equity method of accounting. The associate’s year end is 31 December 2015.
During the year Ultra received an interim cash dividend of £5,343,000 and will receive a further final dividend of £2,530,000 upon the receipt by
ASA of certain outstanding third-party trade receivables, or 30 June 2017, whichever is earlier. The declared final dividend has been recorded by the
Group in other receivables due in less than 1 year. On 30 December 2015, the Group reached agreement to transfer the whole of its 49% equity
interest in ASA to Emirates Advanced Investments Group (“EAI”).
The carrying amount of the Group’s investment in ASA and loan receivable balance (see note 33) have been written down to £nil at 31 December 2015
to reflect the fair value of the remaining interest. Consequently, a non-underlying impairment charge of £2,693,000 has been recorded in 2015 as
disclosed in note 6.

of the current economic climate and on the length of time that the receivable has been overdue. All trade receivables that have been overdue for
more than a year are provided for in full. 20 Trade and other receivables (continued)

Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group
mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned
by international credit rating agencies. 
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counter parties and customers, the customers are
mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships. The Group has a small number
of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding. These customers are considered to have low credit risk. As set out in note 7, the Oman
Airport IT contract has been terminated. Specific provisions were recorded against the associated receivables balances. 
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Group’s
credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements (see note 23) net of any allowances for losses represents the Group’s
maximum exposure to credit risk.

23 Financial instruments and financial risk management
Derivative financial instruments
Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge
exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels
1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted (unadjusted) active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All of Ultra’s financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Liquidity risk
The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Group’s banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland. During the year there were three facilities in
place. The first provides £100 million of revolving credit and was due to expire in December 2017; during the year the terms were amended to extend
the expiry date to August 2019 and to reduce the applicable margin to match that of the £200 million revolving credit facility. The second facility,
which was put in place in August 2014 provides £200 million of revolving credit which expires in August 2019. Both facilities are denominated in
Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs. A USD225 million term loan
facility, which expires in August 2019, was put in place at the time of the Herley acquisition. The same covenants are in place across the three facilities.
A further £15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured. Interest was predominantly charged at 1.00% (2014: 1.00%) over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had available £159,756,000 (2014: £177,956,000) of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working
capital requirements. Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Group’s committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems (UETCS), participates in two Canadian programmes
that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products. Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allowed the Group to issue loan
notes up to a value of USD150 million and with a maturity date of up to 10 years. USD10 million of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity
date of July 2018 and a further USD60 million of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019. In January 2014 the
Group agreed an amendment to extend the private shelf agreement for a three year period. Consequently loan notes can now be issued up until 
2 January 2017. The amendment also increased the size of the shelf agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue. As at 
31 December 2014 USD125 million remained available under the shelf agreement.
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities:

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the
borrowings disclosed in note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk
The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk. The currencies giving
rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2015, the net fair value of the Group’s currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately £4,744,000 (2014: liability
£756,000), comprising £1,347,000 assets (2014: £2,842,000) and £6,091,000 liabilities (2014: £3,598,000). The loss on derivative financial
instruments included in the Group’s consolidated income statement for the period was £3,988,000 (2014: loss £7,243,000).

Net investment hedges
At the year end the Group had net investments in US companies where the associated foreign currency translation risk is hedged by external
borrowings in US dollars. The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as
effective hedges. The value of the net investment hedge was US$325m (2014: US$120m).
Interest rate risk
During the year the Group entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. The interest rate
swaps, denominated in US dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Group’s
policy. The swaps mature in July 2019 and have a fixed swap rate, including the bank margin, of 1.232%. The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR. At the
year end the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US dollar 120m (2014: nil). The hedging contracts fix US dollar 120m of borrowings to
December 2016, reducing to US Dollar 90m by December 2017, US dollar 60m by December 2018 and to US dollar 45m by July 2019.
The interest rate swaps were designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value is charged to equity. At 31 December 2015,
the net fair value of interest rate swaps was £198,000 (2014: nil). The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was £nil
and has been charged to interest cost in the year (2014: £nil).
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next 3.5 years. The Group also has US dollar 70m of fixed
rate debt with Pricoa at an interest rate of 3.60%, due for repayment in July 2018 and January 2019.
The interest rate swaps and fixed rate Pricoa debt were entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure
reflecting the Group’s policy.

Market risk sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk
During 2015 the Group’s net borrowings were predominantly at floating interest rates. The Group has estimated the impact on the income
statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2015. There is no significant difference between the
amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.

24 Government grants and loans
The Group through its Canadian subsidiaries Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems (UETCS) and Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems
(UEMS) participates in three Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative (SADI), the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect
of certain eligible research and development project costs. Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided to UETCS and reimbursed at
favourable rates of interest over the period to 2030. Up to $8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the
period 2020 to 2033. The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the
fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year. The fair value of the loans have been calculated using a market interest rate for a
similar instrument.
Following delays on some of the UETCS programme, an extension of the funding is under negotiation. The revised repayment profile and 
re-assessment of the discount rate has resulted in a reduction of the loan element and increase in the grant element during the year and a reduction
in capitalised development.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec (IQ) research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and
development of certain specified new products. Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified
projects. This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made. As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ
programme has been included in the income statement. 
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £11.3 million (2014: £9.5 million) relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.

Warranty provisions are based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. Such costs are generally incurred within two
years after delivery. Contract related provisions will be utilised over the period as stated in the contract to which the specific provision relates.
Contract related provisions also include contingent consideration, dilapidation costs and provisions associated with the Oman Airport IT contract
termination. Dilapidations will be payable at the end of the contracted life which is up to fifteen years. Contingent consideration is payable when
earnings targets are met: £514,000 of the provision was utilised in the year when the 2015 Forensic Technology earn-out target was met. As at 
31 December 2015 the remaining contingent consideration provision is £3,428,000 (2014: £3,276,000), payment of which is contingent on 
earnings targets for the Forensic Technology and 3Phoenix acquisitions through until December 2016, and for contingent payments relating to the
ICE WheelTug certification.  27 Share capital and share options

The Group recognised total expenses of £967,000 (2014: £1,783,000) in relation to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions. Expected
volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The weighted average share price during the year was £17.92. The fair value of
options granted during the year that are expected to vest was £2,878,631 (2014: £1,725,239). 27 Share capital and share options (continued)
The Group’s equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value for all
schemes other than the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 March LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the
following assumptions:

For the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 March LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as
this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition. The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following

Some UK employees of the Group are members of the Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme which was established on 1 March 1994. The
scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1/60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
The scheme was closed to new members in 2003. A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2013. The Group also operates two defined contribution
schemes for overseas employees. In addition to these schemes, the Group’s Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has
three defined benefit schemes and the Swiss business of the Forensic Technology group has a defined benefit scheme. During 2015 a consultation
took place with the members on a proposal to close the UK defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual from 5 April 2016. Following the end of
the consultation and discussion with the Trustee, it was announced to members on 1 February 2016 that the Company had agreed with the Trustee
the terms under which the scheme is to be closed and that the proposed closure would go ahead.
Defined contribution schemes
The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was £4,765,000 (2014: £4,696,000).

All the defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2015 using the ‘projected unit’ method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is
administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company. Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the scheme’s
membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company. The Trustees are also
responsible for the investment of the scheme’s assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death. Members who leave service before
retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.
Active members of the scheme pay contributions via salary sacrifice and the Company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular
actuarial valuations. The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the
accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk; inflation risk; investment risk and longevity risk. The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and
manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies. The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a
number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme
was at 6 April 2013. The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2016. These actuarial valuations are
carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence. This contrasts with
these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2013 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary. The figures in the
following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows:
UK Canada Switzerland UK Canada Switzerland
2015 2015 2015 2014 2014 2014
Discount rate 3.75% 3.75% 0.80% 3.65% 3.65% 1.50%
Inflation rate – RPI 3.05% 3.05% 0.80% 3.05% 3.05% 1.40%
Inflation rate – CPI 2.05% 2.05% 0.80% 2.05% 2.05% 1.40%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.30% 3.30% 1.00% 3.30% 3.30% 1.00%
Future pension increases (pre 6/4/08) 2.85% n/a n/a 2.85% 3.05% 1.40%
Future pension increases (post 6/4/08) 1.90% n/a n/a 1.90% n/a n/a
For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values. Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on
the level of the total obligation. For the UK scheme, a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.15% and a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate to
3.65% would increase the scheme’s liabilities by 1.4% and 1.9% respectively. If the members’ life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme
liabilities would increase by 3.3%. The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 20 years (2014: 19 years).
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners. Due to the size of the scheme the
mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely:
Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA/105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002
Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA/105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set
out below:
2015 2014
Current pensioners (at 65) – males 22 years 22 years
Current pensioners (at 65) – females 24 years 24 years
Future pensioners (at 65) – males 24 years 24 years
Future pensioners (at 65) – females 26 years 26 years

32 Acquisitions (continued)
Electronic Products Division of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions – Herley
On 21 August 2015, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the Electronic Products Division (“EPD”) of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions,
now known as Ultra Electronics Herley, for initial cash consideration of £161.5m. A further £3.2m was paid in January 2016.
Ultra Electronics Herley is a leading designer and producer of RF and microwave integrated systems and subsystems for use in EW, radar, communication,

A small amount of trading also occurs with ASA, in the normal course of business and on an arm’s length basis. Balances are settled on normal
trade terms and the amounts outstanding at year end were insignificant.
34 Non-controlling interests
The following table summarises the information, before any intra-group eliminations, relating to the Group’s former subsidiary ‘Ultra Electronics in
Collaboration with Oman Investment Corporation’, incorporated in the Sultanate of Oman, that had a material non-controlling interest held by
Oman Investment Corporation (’OIC’). On 4 March 2015 the entity was placed into voluntary liquidation and no longer meets the IFRS 10 criteria for
consolidation as a subsidiary of the Group (see note 7).

35 Contingent liabilities
The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business totalling £70.6m 
(2014: £59.6m). 
The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations
that arise. In addition, the Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In
particular, as set out in note 7, the Oman Airport IT contract was terminated in February 2015. This has given rise to significant uncertainty regarding
the likely outcome of negotiations in respect of this termination event, and it is not possible at this early stage to reliably estimate the outcome. 
36 Assets classified as held for sale
The Group is in advanced discussions to dispose of a small non-core part of the Communications & Security division. These operations, which are expected
to be sold within 12 months, have been classified on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities held for sale. The proceeds of disposal are expected
to substantially exceed the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of
these operations as held for sale. The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classified as held for sale are as follows:
2015

A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently across the Group throughout the current and
preceding year, is set out below:
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The financial statements have also
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations.
Adoption of new and revised Standards
The following IFRIC interpretations, amendments to existing standards and new standards have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted
the reported results or the financial position:
• Annual Improvements to IFRS: 2011-2013 cycle
The following standards were also adopted in the current year and have had the impact as set out below.
• None
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial
statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: enhancing disclosures about the Transfers of Financial Assets, enhancing disclosures about
offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities and disclosures about the initial application of IFRS 9
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group, except for:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – This will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers – This will potentially revise the timing and amount of revenue recognition on some of the Group’s
contracts. The Group is assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements. IFRS 15 is effective from 1 January 2018.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivatives and assets held for sale which are measured
at fair value.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Strategic Report on page 27. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries)
made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company: 
• has the power over the investee; 
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three
elements of control listed above. 
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statements of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests.
Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’ s accounting policies. 
All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in
full on consolidation.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of
the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference
between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in
equity and attributed to owners of the company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of
the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and
liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary
are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant
assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the
fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under FRS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the
cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 124 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
Proxy Board
Certain Group companies in the US undertake work of importance to US national security; consequently activities are conducted under foreign
ownership regulations which require operation under a Proxy Agreement. The regulations are intended to insulate these activities from undue foreign
influence as a result of foreign ownership. The entities that are operated under the management of a Proxy Board are ProLogic Inc (“ProLogic”) and
Advanced Tactical Systems Inc (“ATS”).  
The Directors consider that the Group has control over the operating and financial policies and results of these entities, therefore, they are consolidated
in the Group consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group
to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with 
IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively; and 
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
are measured in accordance with that standard. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the
acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a
business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted
retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional
information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that
existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends
on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and
its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent
reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39, or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain 
or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity is remeasured to its acquisition date fair
value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that
have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that
interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports
provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see
above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above. Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is
recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. Cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or
more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the
other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not
reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included in determining
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control
over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Investments in
associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 125

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Sales of goods are normally recognised when
goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from contracts to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contracts in the same way as for long-term
contracts. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract
costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Revenue from long-term contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on long-term contracts (see accounting policy
‘Long-term contracts’). 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Long-term contracts
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the
contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to
the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and
incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer, or when it is considered probable that the customer will
approve the variation and the amount of revenue arising from the variation.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it
is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at the actual exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that
date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in 
the income statement.
The trading results and cash flows of overseas undertakings are translated into sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, using the
average rates of exchange during the relevant financial period. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the
rates ruling at the year-end. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening balance sheets and results are classified as equity and
transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the
closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling
denominated assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred, except where they relate to qualifying assets, in which case they
are capitalised.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the expenditure towards which they are intended to contribute,
to the extent that the conditions for receipt have been met and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received.
Government assistance provided in the form of below market rate of interest loans are treated as government grants. The benefit of the below market
rate of interest is calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loan and is matched against the related
expenditure. The fair value of the loan is calculated using prevailing market interest rates.
Retirement benefit costs 
The Group provides pensions to its employees and Directors through defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The schemes are
funded and their assets are held independently of the Group by trustees.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations
being carried out at each balance sheet date. The actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised
outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the
average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Any internally generated intangible asset arising from development activities is recognised only if an asset is created that can be identified, it is probable
that the asset created will generate future economic benefit and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 126 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
Other intangible assets
Costs associated with producing or maintaining computer software programmes for sale are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly
associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, that will generate economic benefits exceeding
costs beyond one year and that can be measured reliably, are recognised as intangible assets. Capitalised software development expenditure is stated at cost
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset.
Acquired computer software licences for use within the Group are capitalised as intangible assets on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring
to use the specific software.
Patents and trademarks are stated initially at historical cost. Patents and trademarks have definite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination whose fair value can be reliably measured are separated from goodwill and amortised over their
remaining estimated useful lives.
Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine
the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so
that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for
the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, except for goodwill.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is shown at original historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected
useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years
Short leasehold improvements over remaining period of lease
Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of
the relevant lease.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals under operating leases, where the Group acts as either lessee or lessor, are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the
payments are not made on such a basis. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of
the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis and including an appropriate proportion of overheads incurred in bringing
the inventories to their present location and condition) and net realisable value. Provision is made for any obsolete, slow moving or defective items.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is
objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in-hand, call deposits and bank overdrafts, where there is right of set off. Bank overdrafts are presented as
current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Assets held for sale
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This
condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must
be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 127
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their fair value.
Loans and overdrafts
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs where there is a facility commitment. In these
circumstances issue costs are deducted from the value of the loan and amortised over the life of the commitment. Where there is no facility
commitment, issue costs are written-off as incurred. Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for on an
accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market related conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the share option plans and a stochastic model for awards made under the 2007 Long-Term
Incentive Plan.
The credits in respect of equity-settled amounts are included in equity.
Provisions
Provisions, including property related provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of
a past event, and where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of repair and rectification of products under warranty, based on known exposures and historical occurrences.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to
affected parties. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
Ultra uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate
and interest rate movements. Ultra does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities and measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Changes in their fair
values are recognised in the income statement and this is likely to cause volatility in situations where the carrying value of the hedged item is not
adjusted to reflect fair value changes arising from the hedged risk. Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met, hedge accounting may be used
to mitigate this income statement volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting will not generally be applied to transactional hedging relationships, such as hedges of forecast or committed transactions. However,
hedge accounting will be applied to translational hedging relationships where it is permissible under IAS 39. When hedge accounting is used, the
relevant hedging relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or
decrease in the fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent
that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. 128 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement. Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. For cash flow hedges of forecasted future transactions, when the hedged item is recognised
in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged
items result in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Income statement
Additional line items are disclosed in the consolidated income statement when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Group’s 
financial performance.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and after the share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items
When items of income or expense are material and they are relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance, they are disclosed
separately within the financial statements. Such exceptional items include material costs or reversals arising from a restructuring of the Group’s operations,
material creation or reversals of provisions, and material litigation settlements. 
Non-statutory performance measures
In the analysis of the Group’s operating results, earnings per share and cash flows, information is presented to provide readers with additional
performance indicators that are prepared on a non-statutory basis. This presentation is regularly reviewed by management to identify items that are
unusual and other items relevant to an understanding of the Group’s performance and long-term trends with reference to their materiality and nature.
This additional information is not uniformly defined by all Companies and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other
organisations. The non-statutory disclosures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent statutory measure. Information for
separate presentation is considered as follows:
• Contract losses arising in the ordinary course of trading are not separately presented, however losses (and subsequent reversals) are separately disclosed
in situations of a material dispute which are expected to lead to arbitration or legal proceedings.
• Material costs or reversals arising from a significant restructuring of the Group’s operations, such as the S3 programme, are presented separately.
• Disposals of entities or investments in associates or joint ventures, or impairments of related assets are presented separately.
• The amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions and impairment of goodwill or intangible assets are presented separately.
• Other matters arising due to the Group’s acquisitions such as adjustments to contingent consideration, payment of retention bonuses, acquisition costs
and fair value adjustments for acquired inventory made in accordance with IFRS 13 are separately disclosed in aggregate.
• Furthermore, IAS 37 requires the Group to discount provisions using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current assessment of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the liability, this discount unwind is presented separately when the provision relates to acquisition contingent consideration.
• Derivative instruments used to manage the Group’s foreign exchange exposures are ‘fair valued’ in accordance with IAS 39. This creates volatility in the
valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time. This has minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but
can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates, consequently the gain or loss is presented separately.
• The defined benefit pension net interest charge arising in accordance with IAS 19 is presented separately.
• The Group is cash-generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business. It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure
of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth. For this, the Group uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations,
as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments. Management believes that
using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product
development and other intangibles, would result in an under-reporting of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
When applying the Group’s accounting policies, management must make a number of key judgements involving estimates and assumptions concerning
the future. These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including historical experience, that may differ significantly
from the actual outcome. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include:
CONTRACT REVENUE AND PROFIT RECOGNITION
A significant proportion of the Group’s activities are conducted under long term contract arrangements and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 11
Construction Contracts.
Revenue and profit on such contracts are recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date of the
particular contract and are calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and expected costs. When the contract outcome cannot be
reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to match costs until such time as this can be reliably estimated. Expected costs are calculated after taking
account of the perceived contract risks related to performance not yet proven. 
Owing to the complexity of some of the contracts undertaken by the Group the cost estimation process requires significant judgement and is carried out
using the experience of the Group’s engineers, project managers and finance and commercial professionals. Because of the level of judgement required,
cost estimates are reviewed and updated on a regular basis using the Group’s established project management processes. Some of the factors that will
impact upon cost estimates include the availability of suitably qualified labour, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of
materials, the impact of change orders and the performance of sub-contractors.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where services are rendered, sales are recognised when the stage of completion of the services and the related revenue and costs can be measured reliably. 
Where goods are delivered under arrangements not considered to fall under the scope of IAS 11 Construction Contracts, revenue is recognised when
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 129

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Group accounts for its post-retirement pension plans in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income
statement in the period in which those benefits have been earned by the employees. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in
which they arise and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the scheme liabilities as reduced by the fair value of
the scheme assets.
The main assumptions used in determining the defined benefit post retirement obligation include the discount rate used in discounting scheme
liabilities, the inflation rate, the expected rate of salary inflation, the expected rate of future pension increases, expected returns on scheme assets and
future mortality assumptions. For each of these assumptions, there is a range of possible values. Relatively small changes in some of these variables can
have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
The valuation of pension scheme assets and liabilities at a specific point of time rather than over a period of time can lead to significant annual
movements in the pension scheme deficit as calculated under IAS 19, but has no impact on short-term cash contributions since these are based upon
separate independent actuarial valuations.
Details of the pension scheme assumptions and obligation at 31 December 2015 are provided in note 31.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets
requires the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome. These estimates and judgements cover future growth rates,
expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. 
GOODWILL
Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating
units (CGUs). These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash flows and long-term growth rates of the CGUs. Further details
on these estimates are provided in note 14.
INCOME TAXES
In determining the Group’s provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will
be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made. 
OMAN AIRPORT IT CONTRACT TERMINATION AND DEEMED DISPOSAL OF ITHRA
Confirmation of the termination of the Oman Airport IT contract was received on 9 February 2015. The termination event related to conditions already
in existence at the 31 December 2014 balance sheet date and consequently the termination was considered to be an adjusting post balance sheet event
for 2014 in accordance with IAS 10. 
There remains significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of negotiations with the Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Transport & Communications, or
whether agreement can be reached without the need to enter a formal arbitration or judicial process.
As set out in note 7, on 4 March 2015, ‘Ithra’ (“Ultra Electronics in collaboration with Oman Investment Corporation LLC”), the legal entity established
with the sole purpose of delivering the Oman Airport IT contract, was placed into voluntary liquidation. A liquidator was appointed and is pursuing
claims against the customer on behalf of the interested parties. Ithra, upon liquidation, no longer meets the IFRS 10 criteria for consolidation as a
subsidiary of the Group and is, consequently, a deemed disposal as at 4 March 2015.
Trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts were assessed for recoverability and allowances made for estimated irrecoverable amounts in the
2014 financial statements. Upon the liquidation of Ithra, the provisions and gross receivables are now presented as a net position. Specific provisions were
also booked in 2014 to cover estimated legal costs and all known liabilities where the group has assessed it is probable that an outflow of economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. The Group continues to provide for all known remaining liabilities as at 31 December 2015. Material
items have been disclosed separately within the financial statements. Disclosure is provided on the consolidated income statement and in note 7 regarding
the 2015 deemed disposal of Ithra, and on the consolidated income statement and in note 2 regarding the non-underlying 2014 £46.9m contract
termination cost, comprising the £37.2m provision charge booked against contract receivables balances (see note 20) and other termination provisions
of 2014 £9.7m. 130 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc

Statement of accounting policies for the Company accounts
A summary of the Company’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and preceding year in the
separate financial information presented for the Company, are set out below:
Basis of accounting
The Company accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with FRS101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. The
transition from the previously applicable United Kingdom accounting standards is not considered to have resulted in any material re-statements. No profit and
loss account is presented for the Company, as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by FRS101, the Company has taken
advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management,
presentation of a cash-flow statement and certain related party transactions. The Company’s retained profit for the year is disclosed in note 47.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are shown at original historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at
rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Taxation
UK Corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements. These arise from
including gains and losses in tax assessments in different periods from those recognised in the financial statements. A net deferred tax asset is regarded
as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Retirement benefit costs
The Company participates in a defined benefit plan that shares risks between entities under common control. The details of this UK scheme, for which
Ultra Electronics Limited is the sponsoring employer, are set out in note 31 of the Group accounts. There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for
charging the net benefit cost to Ultra Electronics Holdings plc. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. Assessment of impairments requires estimates to be made of the value in use of
the underlying investments. These value in use calculations are dependant on estimates of future cash flows and long-term growth rates.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Strategic Report on page 27.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at the actual exchange rates at the date of the transactions (or, where
appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date (or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward
exchange contract). Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain
or loss in the profit and loss account.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate
of shares that will eventually vest. Further disclosure in relation to share-based payments is given in note 27 of the Group financial statements.
Related parties
Remuneration of the Directors, who are considered to be the key management personnel of the Company, is disclosed in the audited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 75 to 79.
Loans and overdrafts
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs where there is a facility commitment. In these
circumstances issue costs are deducted from the value of the loan and amortised over the life of the commitment. Where there is no facility commitment,
issue costs are written-off as incurred. Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for on an accruals basis
in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled
in the period in which they arise.

*During the year the Group amended its internal organisation to better reflect the markets that the Group addresses so that business groupings better
reflect its capabilities, evolving product offerings and market facing segments. As a result of this, the composition of the Group’s reportable segments has
changed. As such, in line with IFRS 8, the corresponding information for the prior years have been restated. Previously results were reported as Aircraft &
Vehicle Systems, Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems, they are now reported as Aerospace & Infrastructure, Communications &

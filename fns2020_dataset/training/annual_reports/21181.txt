Chairman’s statement
THE FULL YEAR RESULTS REFLECT THE RESILIENCE 
OF THE BUSINESS MODEL, OUR LONG-STANDING 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND THE QUALITY OF 
THE BUSINESS-CRITICAL SOLUTIONS WE PROVIDE
Overview 
I am pleased to report that AVEVA 
continued to deliver a solid performance 
throughout the course of 2015/16.
The full year results reflect the resilience 
of the business model, our long-standing 
customer relationships and the quality of 
the business-critical solutions we provide.
Group revenue was £201.5 million (2015 
– £208.7 million) which was broadly 
in line with our expectations against 
a challenging market backdrop.
Revenue was impacted by foreign 
currency headwinds during the year 
with sterling strengthening against 
most major currencies. After adjusting 
for currency effects, organic constant 
currency revenue declined by 2% 
compared to 2014/15, a respectable 
performance given the market conditions.
Adjusted profit before tax was £51.2 
million (2015 – £62.1 million) representing 
a margin of 25.4% (2015 – 29.8%). 
Reported profit before tax was £29.4 
million (2015 – £54.9 million) which reflects 
lower revenue and one-off exceptional 
costs of £15.2 million, principally arising 
from restructuring initiatives and from 
professional services fees relating to the 
aborted Schneider Electric transaction.
Acquisitions
In July 2015, we announced that headline 
terms had been agreed to acquire 
Schneider Electric’s software business. 
A very intense period of due diligence 
continued from that point to December 
2015 when discussions were terminated. 
I am pleased to report that, despite 
the obvious potential distractions 
of this transaction, the employees 
and management remained focused 
on ensuring that AVEVA delivered a 
solid operating result in the year.
During the year, the Group completed the 
acquisition of FabTrol Systems Inc., a North 
American business providing fabrication 
management software, for £3.6 million.
Strategy update
The Board has recently reaffirmed 
the Group’s strategy, which has at its 
foundation a commitment to generating 
strong cash flows that can be reinvested 
in the business in order to drive long-
term profitable growth and deliver 
consistent returns for our shareholders. 
The Board has approved a three year 
strategic plan, comprising a number of 
key priorities which are covered in more 
detail in the CEO’s strategic review. We 
are very excited by the opportunities 
that lie ahead. Innovation remains at the 
heart of our success as a Company and 
the investment that we have made in 
recent years is now bringing measurable 
benefits, clearly seen in the strong 
momentum behind AVEVA E3D and our 
newest solution, AVEVA Engage. ™
“The Board is confident 
that our strategy is both 
focused and achievable.”
Philip Aiken
Chairman STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board
The composition of the Board has 
remained very stable for several years 
but there will be some change during 
the year ahead with two of our non-
executives due to retire from the Board, 
each having reached the nine year limit 
under the Corporate Governance code.
Jonathan Brooks’ nine year tenure as 
a Non-Executive Director ends in July 
2016 and I would like to thank him on 
behalf of the Board for his contribution to 
AVEVA. Jonathan joined us in 2007 and 
has overseen a period of strong growth 
and success for AVEVA. The process to 
find his replacement as Audit Committee 
chair is underway and we expect to 
appoint a successor shortly. Jonathan 
has agreed to stay on until November 
2016 to ensure an orderly handover.
Philip Dayer will also reach his ninth 
anniversary with AVEVA in January 2017 
and a replacement will be sought in 
due course.
Capital allocation
AVEVA has remained cash generative 
during the year and at 30 April 2016 our 
cash balance was £123.5 million, with no 
debt. The Board believes it is important 
to maintain a strong balance sheet in 
order to provide additional confidence 
in the strength of our business to our 
customers and also to have at hand 
sufficient resources to invest in the future 
growth of the business. Our strong 
cash flows also continue to support our 
ability to grow via acquisition and our 
progressive dividend policy. At the same 
time the Board recognises the need 
to strike the correct balance between 
investing in the business and providing 
returns to shareholders over the long 
term. Following an in-depth review of 
our capital allocation and discussions 
with our shareholders and our advisers, 
the Board has concluded to maintain its 
sustainable progressive dividend policy, 
balanced against an active focus on 
M&A, with excess capital being returned 
to shareholders from time to time. 
Hence, with this in mind, we are pleased 
to announce the increase of the ordinary 
dividend alongside these results, which 
illustrates our confidence in the long 
term prospects for the business and its 
underlying strength. The final dividend 
will be increased to 30.0 pence per share 
(2015 – 25.0 pence) which represents 
an increase of 20% over the prior 
year and takes the full year dividend 
to 36.0 pence (2015 – 30.5 pence), 
an increase of 18% over last year.
Summary
Despite 2015/16 having been a challenging 
year for the Group on a number of fronts, 
the business has shown great resilience 
and delivered a highly respectable 
performance, demonstrating the strength 
of our business model as well as the 
benefits that our technology delivers to 
customers. This performance would not 
have been possible without the hard work 
and dedication of all of our employees and 
the Board would like to express its sincere 
thanks for their considerable efforts.
I believe that AVEVA is well-positioned 
to capitalise on a number of exciting 
opportunities over the long-term, and 
as a Board we are confident that our 
strategy is both focused and achievable.

Chief Executive’s Q&A
RICHARD LONGDON DISCUSSES THE CHALLENGES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT LIE AHEAD, THE KEY ROLE THAT 
INNOVATION PLAYS IN THE BUSINESS AND HOW 
CUSTOMERS CAN EXPECT TO BENEFIT FROM AVEVA’S 
INVESTMENT IN THE CLOUD
Could you discuss some of the 
key challenges facing AVEVA’s 
customers today and how 
technology can help?
The only real constant in the 
industries we serve is change, 
and this presents a major 
challenge for our Engineering, 
Procurement and Construction (EPC) 
and Owner Operator (OO) customers. 
In the design phase of a project where 
our 3D tools are used extensively, for 
example AVEVA E3D, customers are 
having to adapt all the time to deliver 
assets faster and at a lower cost. Later on, 
with the commissioning and operation 
of the project, ensuring the optimum 
performance of the asset through 
maintaining accurate data is a highly 
complex task, and this is where AVEVA’s 
information management and laser 
modelling software can be very beneficial.
We are on a journey with all of our 
customers to help them to realise the 
value of their Digital Assets – our vision 
is that for every physical asset there 
ought to be a digital representation. For 
these customers, the execution of major 
engineering projects requires hundreds 
of decisions – large and small – every 
day. Thousands more are required in 
the subsequent decades of operation, 
maintenance, modification and end of 
life. Throughout all of this, accurate and 
timely decisions depend on the quality, 
completeness and accessibility of the 
information that forms the Digital Asset. 
This, in essence, is the ultimate challenge 
that AVEVA is helping customers to meet 
every day. Consistent data is the key, 
and it is very much in AVEVA’s DNA. STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
07
Can you talk about the 
role of innovation at AVEVA 
and why it is so important?
In my view innovation is 
the lifeblood of AVEVA. As 
an organisation we have 
invested over £170 million 
in R&D over the past five years and it is 
central to our strategy to continue this 
pace of investment in the future. As a 
key partner to our customers, we are 
constantly devising new capabilities and 
functionality that will enable ever-greater 
efficiency and competitive advantage. 
It is no accident that AVEVA has a 
considerable lead over the competition 
from a technology standpoint; this has 
been achieved through a consistent 
focus over the lifetime of our Company.
One of the major themes 
across the software industry 
at the moment is cloud 
computing and the Software 
as a Service (SaaS) delivery 
model. How do you see 
AVEVA’s customers 
approaching these new 
paradigms and what do you 
think the benefits might be?
AVEVA is extremely well 
placed, from a technical 
standpoint, to offer all of its 
products via the cloud over the 
course of the next few years and, indeed, 
AVEVA E3D is already cloud-enabled. 
I believe that customers currently have 
valid concerns over data security, but 
that these will ultimately be resolved 
sufficiently for broad industry adoption 
to the new model. The efficiencies for 
customers will be dramatic, with on-
demand access to software, low setup and 
running costs and unparalleled flexibility.
Could you give us an idea of 
the strategic areas of focus for 
AVEVA at the moment and 
where we should be expecting 
to see the Company invest 
over the next few years?
We have a very clearly defined 
set of strategic goals and 
so our investment plans are 
entirely focused on enabling 
the business to deliver against these 
targets. Specifically, we plan to invest 
more in transitioning our business to 
becoming the leading provider of the 
Digital Asset via the cloud. We are focused 
on developing our business into new 
markets where we are currently under-
represented and we shall continue to 
expand our presence beyond engineering 
design and into operations. We shall also 
continue to broaden the range of solutions 
we offer to customers, expanding our 
reach within their organisations to create 
even greater efficiencies through tight 
data integration between applications.
AVEVA is a diverse 
international business; 
what are the challenges 
you currently face as an 
organisation?
After a period of substantial 
growth, driven in a large part 
by the strength of the various 
end-markets in which our 
customers operate, we are now very 
focused on ensuring that we operate 
as efficiently as possible as a business. 
This means that we continually have 
to question whether we are allocating 
our resources in the most effective 
manner in order to capitalise on the huge 
opportunities that lie ahead, as we grow 
into new markets, deliver new innovations 
to our customers and adapt to new ways 
of selling and delivering our products. 
Sometimes this means that we need to 
take difficult decisions as we manage 
the costs across our global operations.
Looking at the 2015/16 year 
under review, what do you 
consider to have been the 
real highlights for the 
business and were there 
any disappointments?
One of the most important 
tests for our business has 
been to demonstrate the 
mission-critical role that our 
engineering software tools play within our 
customers’ day-to-day activities, and that, 
even during some of the toughest end-
market conditions many will remember, 
we can deliver a resilient financial result. 
I believe that this is something we have 
been able to demonstrate, which is very 
encouraging and is a particular highlight 
when I consider these results. There 
are always aspects of the business that 
we wish had performed better, and 
we have been disappointed with the 
sharp slowdown we have seen in Latin 
America, mainly due to external factors 
relating particularly to Brazil. Having 
said that, we remain committed to the 
region which we expect will prove to 
present very exciting opportunities 
for AVEVA over the longer term. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

KEY MARKETS
Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas is a critical industry, meeting 60% 
of the world’s energy needs and providing 
raw materials used to manufacture products 
that are essential to our modern lives. 
AVEVA has had a long and close relationship 
with the industry. Our technology continues 
to enable many of its most advanced 
engineering developments, both within 
the upstream and downstream industries 
where AVEVA dominates the market.
The unprecedented over-supply of oil 
to the markets has seen a longer-than-
expected period of low oil prices. This 
has resulted in the implementation of 
cost cutting programmes by upstream 
companies. In contrast, companies 
which operate downstream businesses 
are enjoying buoyant market conditions 
due to the low price of feedstock. 
AVEVA has a balanced product portfolio 
allowing the business to be resilient in 
turbulent market conditions. AVEVA’s 
laser solutions reduce the cost involved 
in capturing existing site conditions 
and integrate seamlessly with AVEVA’s 
design tools, making AVEVA the best 
for brownfield change projects. AVEVA 
ProCon™ has a proven track record in 
removing significant costs from project 
execution through better contract 
management within the supply chain, 
helping project owners execute their 
projects with minimal cost overruns. 
Market Drivers:
 – Period of low oil prices due to over-
supply
 – Gradual increase in price as the supply/
demand balance is restored
 – Greater investment in life extension and 
upgrades of assets 
 – Buoyant downstream sector with high 
refining margins STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Power
The Power sector continues to experience 
increasing demand, driven by population 
growth and economic expansion. The 
IEA predict a 70% growth in electricity 
demand between 2013 and 2040 with 
developing economies driving this growth.
During the period 2015 – 2040, $20 trillion 
will be invested in power generation and 
infrastructure; $11 trillion will be spent 
on new power generating capacity and 
the rest on delivery infrastructure. The 
world’s power generation mix will change 
and dependence on coal as a fuel will 
drop. The share of low carbon power 
generation technologies will increase 
from 30% to 47% in this period, due to the 
growth of non-hydro renewables and a 
stable share of nuclear and hydropower. 
AVEVA is already a preferred supplier 
to the world’s nuclear industry and the 
leading technology provider to the other 
power generation markets. We expect 
long-term growth in all these markets, 
especially within fast growing economies 
such as India, North America and China.
Market Drivers:
 – Long-term growth in electricity 
demand, growing 70% between 2013 
and 2040
 – Low carbon power generation capacity 
to increase 
 – Continued investment in nuclear 
energy worldwide

Marine
Exactly 60 years ago, Malcolm McClean 
transformed global trade through his 
invention of containerised shipment (the 
shipping container). Today the Marine 
industry is the backbone of the world’s 
economies, opening up cost-efficient 
means for countries and businesses to 
trade globally. Marine transportation 
remains the most efficient method for 
transporting commodities, raw materials, 
fuels and products around the world.
Global shipbuilding is a cyclical industry 
which is influenced by many market 
conditions. Following a multi-year boom, 
the industry is still suffering the effects 
of overcapacity stemming from a period 
of over ordering which saw the world 
Maritime fleet grow significantly. 
AVEVA is the market-leading supplier of 
software to the shipbuilding industries and 
AVEVA’s technology provides the greatest 
productivity advantage of any product on 
the market. AVEVA will continue to invest 
and support this significant market.
Market Drivers:
 – Marine market to stay flat over the 
medium term
 – Overcapacity in shipping continues

Customer proposition
AVEVA IS HELPING CUSTOMERS TO REVOLUTIONISE 
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE WITH DATA-CENTRIC 
ENGINEERING AND AVEVA’S DIGITAL ASSET APPROACH
Capex
Capital project investment is increasingly 
focused on brownfield modifications to 
enhance or expand existing production 
capacity, or to extend the asset’s 
operating life. Cost pressures are also 
prompting the decommissioning of 
ageing or less profitable assets.
Prior to a brownfield project, 3D laser 
scanning of the asset using technology 
from the AVEVA Group company LFM, 
allows the capture of the as-operating 
state. This is critical for clash-free design, 
in order to optimise schedule management 
and minimise any impact to production. 
Similarly, capturing a visual audit of an 
asset marked for decommissioning 
can be a useful step in securing the 
necessary regulatory and environmental 
approvals before work begins.
Opex
Years of operation frequently results 
in information decay – a widening gap 
between the digital equivalent of the 
asset (engineering data, documents 
and drawings) and the on-site reality. 
This adds risk to safety, reliability 
and the profitability of the asset. As 
compliance obligations have increased 
and ageing assets squeezed for 
efficiency, Operators are turning to 3D 
laser scanning technology from LFM to 
create a digital baseline for reporting 
and compliance, and as the foundation 
for the creation of a full Digital Asset for 
enhanced operational decision making.
Data-centric engineering
In markets characterised by both 
a reducing number of projects and 
increasing competition, engineering 
organisations looking to maintain or 
advance their market position are turning 
to technology to support substantial 
performance improvements. In addition 
to streamlining processes, a key area for 
improvement is the eradication of errors in 
materials management and construction 
that lead to costly delays and rework. 
Although Engineering & Design accounts 
for a relatively small proportion of the 
Total Installed Cost (TIC) of an asset, it 
is typically in these early project phases 
that these errors and inconsistencies are 
generated. As the impact on budget and 
schedule rise exponentially the later the 
issues are discovered, ensuring accuracy, 
consistency and reliability of Engineering 
& Design is critical if significant savings 
are to be realised. AVEVA’s integrated 
suite of market-leading design and 
engineering applications embeds trusted, 
standardised engineering information 
into the heart of every disciplinary 
process, supporting end-to-end 
process efficiency and accuracy.
The Digital Asset at your fingertips
At every decision point throughout 
the asset’s lifecycle, accurate, relevant 
information is essential. In the project 
phase, it can help to minimise overruns 
against budget and schedule. In 
operations, it reduces risks to safety 
and production. Underpinned by our 
Digital Asset approach, AVEVA is 
redefining how organisations should 
access and retrieve the information 
they need in order to improve the speed 
and reliability of their decision making 
across the project and asset lifecycle.
Historically, access to digital information 
was limited, causing delays to decision-
making that could introduce risk; in 
today’s Big Data world, similar delays 
can result from the availability of too 
much information, especially if access 
requires searching multiple systems, 
aggregating relevant data and resolving 
any differences that you might find.
AVEVA’s Digital Asset approach ensures

At the core of AVEVA’s 
business is the 
intellectual property 
generated in our 
software products. 
The Group sells its proprietary software 
products by licensing rights to use the 
software directly to customers through 
our network of global sales offices. 
This strategy provides customers 
with local sales and support and helps 
AVEVA to work closely with leading 
companies principally in the Oil & 
Gas, Power and Marine markets.
We operate a ‘right-to-use’ licensing 
model for our software. Typically, 
customers licence our software for  
a specified number of users by paying 
an initial licence fee followed by an 
obligatory annual fee or by paying a 
rental fee over a fixed period of time. 
In both cases, the customer has to 
continue to pay a fee in order to use 
the software. This model continues to 
provide a strong recurring revenue base 
for AVEVA which allows us to invest in 
the future roadmap of our products.
The amount of service required to 
deploy our software varies depending 
on the type of solution. Typically 
our services consist of consulting, 
implementation and customisation, 
which are provided either on a fixed 
contract or on a time and material basis.

GS CALTEX
GS Caltex was founded in May 1967 as the 
first private oil company in Korea. Jointly 
owned by Chevron and GS Group, it 
provides more than 30% of Korea’s oil 
needs and exports over 50% of its 
products. 
The company has deployed AVEVA E3D 
as the foundation of an innovative pipe 
corrosion management system that 
enables GS Caltex to understand the 
history, service life, operating condition 
and accessibility of each section of 
pipe, by viewing it on the 3D model  
of the facility.
Continual condition monitoring enables 
engineers to estimate the corrosion rate 
of each pipe and its remaining life. Being 
able to predict corrosion means that 
parts can be replaced during scheduled, 
routine maintenance activity, not as 
unscheduled downtime.

Chief Executive’s strategic review
OUR BUSINESS REMAINS STRONGLY POSITIONED IN 
ITS MARKETS, WITH FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS THAT ARE 
EXPECTED TO SUPPORT SUSTAINED GROWTH OVER 
THE LONG TERM
Summary
For the financial year 2015/16 AVEVA 
achieved reported revenue of £201.5 
million (2015 – £208.7 million) and 
adjusted profit before tax of £51.2 
million (2015 – £62.1 million). Excluding 
the contribution from acquisitions and 
negative currency effects, revenue was 
£204.4 million (2015 – £207.6 million), 
in line with the Board’s expectations. 
Regionally, we saw an improved 
performance in the Asia Pacific region, 
with growth in China offset somewhat 
by the pressures on our South Korean 
shipyard customers that resulted in a 
flat performance in North East Asia. 
The Americas region as a whole was 
affected by ongoing weakness in Latin 
America, principally Brazil, and flat 
underlying revenues in North America. 
We saw a steady performance in the 
EMEA region, despite the mixed market 
conditions facing our customers.
The business environment
Our software is used by customers as they 
design, build and operate large capital-
intensive assets, mainly in the process, 
power and marine industries. We sell 
our solutions principally to Engineering 
Procurement and Construction (EPC) 
companies, shipyards and Owner 
Operator (OO) customers worldwide. 
Our vision of a constantly evolving 
Digital Asset is enabling our customers 
to manage this process of continual 
change as they design, build and operate 
some of the world’s most complicated 
assets. Increasingly, our customers 
are looking to deploy a combination 
of our products and this, reinforced by 
our strategically focused ‘One AVEVA’ 
sales effort, is driving wider adoption of 
the entire AVEVA product portfolio.
Among the principal long-term drivers 
of historical revenue growth for AVEVA 
has been the growing complexity of 
the engineering challenges that our 
customers are required to undertake 
within ever-shrinking time schedules,

progress on a number of 
important fronts during

which necessitates an increasing 
investment in upfront engineering 
design and hence drives demand for 
our software applications. This has 
been a feature in all of our markets, but 
in particular in Oil & Gas, representing 
around 40% of revenue, where AVEVA 
has a competitive edge in the most 
complex of all design environments: 
upstream, offshore and deep water.
In recent times, global shifts in the supply 
and demand balance for Oil & Gas have 
led to a well-documented reduction in 
capital expenditure on new projects. 
This has particularly affected our ability 
to grow the revenue we derive from 
customers who have a high exposure 
to offshore and deep-water Oil & Gas 
projects. Among those most noticeably 
affected have been our shipyard 
customers in North East Asia, who had 
previously been major beneficiaries of 
the significant investment in offshore Oil 
& Gas, and our EPC customers who are 
heavily involved in the design phase of 
such projects. Consequently, we have 
seen some customers reducing their 
usage of our software over the past 
year and this has been evident in the 
reduction in total Group revenue and the 
related negative impact on profits that 
we have reported for this financial year.
We have responded to these changes in 
our markets by rapidly shifting our focus to 
expanding our presence in areas where we 
have historically been under-represented 
as well as pushing into adjacent markets. 
This has included a push into the 
downstream and onshore areas of Oil & 
Gas and an increased focus on building 
on our presence in Petrochemicals & 
Chemicals, Food & Beverage and Mining & 
Metals. In addition, we have increased our 
sales focus on higher growth regions such 
as India and China, where the market for 
power-related infrastructure is expected to 
show strong growth over the long term.
We have continued to invest in innovation 
over the past several years, and as a 
consequence of this we are seeing strong 
growth in sales of additional products 
into our installed base. For example, 
schematics applications, which currently 
represent less than 10% but could 
represent up to a third of total revenue in 
time, with AVEVA Engineering™ acting as 
a key driver of this adoption. Our flagship 
new design platform, AVEVA E3D, almost 
doubled its revenue in the first half of the 
financial year, and we saw this growth rate 
accelerate in the second half as various 
market trends increasingly play to the 
strengths of key areas of functionality 
such as laser modelling for brownfield 
engineering, which meets the demands 
of our EPC customers as they seek out 
more revamp, retrofit and life extension 
projects. AVEVA E3D contributed just 
under 10% of total revenue in the year 
to March 2016 (2015 − less than 5%).
The proven quality of AVEVA’s technology 
continues to provide customers with 
business-critical capabilities, enabling 
them to enhance their competitive 
advantage. This continues to underpin 
the strong customer relationships we 
enjoy as well as our recurring revenue 
base, both of which have been pivotal in 
helping to offset challenging markets.
When we look to understand the general 
direction of our markets our global 
accounts business is an important 
bellwether, representing many of our 
largest customers and contributing 
approximately 20% to annual Group 
revenue. We have been encouraged by the 
trends we saw during the year amongst 
these customers, where we witnessed 
increased usage of our new software 
solutions in onshore and downstream, 
as well as in the adjacent market of 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) 
and fabrication markets. This helped 
partially offset reduced usage of our 3D 
products in specific accounts. In particular, 
we were encouraged to see increased 
adoption of AVEVA’s engineering data 
management solutions, helping us to 
displace competitor products with AVEVA 
Engineering, AVEVA NET™ and AVEVA 
Information Standards Manager. ™
The AVEVA engineering data management 
solution spans all industry sectors and 
is currently being deployed on all major 
continents within our EPC global account 
customer base. Indeed, engineering data 
management is a clear driving force in our

is key to driving customer adoption of a 
broader set of AVEVA solutions over time. 
In areas such as UK infrastructure projects, 
where our unique approach to information 
management has been proven over many 
years in the process industries, AVEVA has 
established a foothold in the BIM space.
Market fundamentals and our positioning
Our business remains strongly positioned 
in its markets, with fundamental drivers 
that are expected to support sustained 
growth over the long term. Despite the 
near-term effects of a weaker oil price, 
the projected increase in energy usage 
from a growing global population, in 
addition to the requirement to upgrade, 
replace and extend the lifetime of 
ageing existing assets, indicates that 
significant infrastructure investment 
will be necessary in order to meet 
demand. The International Energy 
Authority (IEA) estimates that by 2040 
world energy demand will increase by 
one-third, with the net growth driven 
entirely by developing countries. Over 
the same period, China’s net oil imports 
are forecast to be nearly five times 
that of the United States, and India’s 
will easily exceed that of the European 
Union with an estimated 600 million new 
electricity consumers (Source: World 
Energy Outlook, IEA November 2015).
Power therefore offers very attractive 
growth opportunities over the 
long-term as the world’s emerging 
economies invest in their power 
generation requirements and the ageing 
infrastructure of the developed world 
is maintained and replaced. Our global 
presence leaves us well positioned to 
capitalise on these opportunities. 
Within our Marine segment, the 
shipbuilding market remains depressed 
given subdued demand and overcapacity 
in the world fleet. The market is affected 
by trends in global GDP and a general 
slowdown in global trade combined with 
an economic slowdown in emerging 
markets, particularly the leading global 
importer, China. There are some areas 
where we see growth, for example in 
naval shipbuilding in China and India, but 
the overall macro picture is expected to 
remain challenging. Whilst a number of  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016
20
our major shipyard customers have been 
successful in diversifying their businesses 
into offshore projects over the past five 
years, their pipelines for this activity 
have seen a sharp slowdown since 2014, 
affected in particular by the boom in 
North America’s shale Oil & Gas market.
In times of uncertainty, we are keenly 
focused on supporting our customers as 
they seek to become more efficient and 
adapt to the fast changing environment. 
This was clearly evident at our annual 
customer event, the AVEVA World 
Summit, held in Dubai in October 
2015. With over 330 delegates from 45 
countries, we heard from customers from 
across the world’s Process, Plant, Power 
and Marine industries as they shared 
their project and operational experiences, 
explaining how AVEVA technology 
is helping them to address technical 
and strategic business challenges. 
Among the key themes of the Summit this 
year was engineering decision-support and 
we unveiled our new asset visualisation 
product, AVEVA Engage, and showcased 
the powerful Design in Context capabilities 
of the latest release of AVEVA E3D. As part 
of the continuing evolution of the AVEVA 
Digital Asset offering, customers were 
also able to familiarise themselves with 
our latest laser-modelling technologies, 
introducing the unique capabilities of 
the AVEVA Trusted Living Pointcloud. ™
Progress towards our key strategic goals
AVEVA has a clear strategy to grow its 
business over the long term, supported 
by achievable medium-term goals. As 
part of that objective, we have made 
good progress on a number of important 
fronts during the year, in particular in 
the following key strategic areas: 
(1) increasing our revenue from OOs
(2) increasing solution sales through our 
MT3D initiative
(3) broadening our market exposure
(4) further developing our Software as 
a Service (SaaS) solutions
Increasing our revenue from OOs
The OO market represents a significant 
opportunity for AVEVA to grow. With 
many plants today operating far beyond 
their intended lifetime, the pressure 
is on owners to keep these ageing 
assets running which presents OOs 
with important challenges as they seek 
to comply with ever more stringent 
environmental and safety legislation, 
whilst maximising profits through 
minimising downtime and unplanned 
outages. For this reason, OOs often 
exert influence over an EPC’s choice 
of engineering software tools, as they 
recognise the value of this design data 
in operations. As a result, OOs are 
particularly interested in areas such as 
our laser modelling capabilities contained 
in AVEVA E3D, as well as our Integrated 
Engineering & Design solutions.
Operators do not always have the skills or 
resources to maintain their Digital Assets 
and AVEVA is increasingly working with 
partners, providing a managed service 
offering to keep data current and accurate 
for the asset in question. We saw a good 
illustration of how AVEVA can solve this 
problem for customers during the year 
with a new customer, DowAksa, a leading 
global OO in the provision of industrial 
carbon fibre for the transportation, 
energy and infrastructure markets, who 
has chosen to standardise on AVEVA 
Integrated Engineering & Design™ in 
order to increase its overall control 
and management of all of its assets. 
Many of our OO customers are witnessing 
a growing risk to asset reliability and 
compliance that can result from the 
difficulties inherent in maintaining 
the accuracy of the information they 
hold about the assets they own and 
operate. Simply attempting to stay 
abreast of the constant change in this 
information can lead to significant 
inefficiencies and increase the risk of 
costly errors in the field. During the 
period we were able to demonstrate the 
value that AVEVA technology can offer 
in solving this problem for a leading
North American OO based in North 
Dakota, in this case through the roll 
out of AVEVA Diagrams™ to support 
its mechanical integrity operations.
Increasing solution sales through our 
MT3D initiative
We see a major market opportunity 
in leveraging our 3D installed base by 
selling additional engineering software 
tools, outside of AVEVA’s core 3D design 
platforms, AVEVA E3D and PDMS. One 
of the strongest areas of revenue growth 
within our business over the past year has 
been in MT3D, which include schematics, 
laser modelling and AVEVA Bocad™ 
amongst other applications. In particular, 
we believe the cross-selling opportunity 
for schematics and laser modelling is 
substantial. Our MT3D focus, backed 
by strong sales incentives, is already 
delivering results as we expand our 
product footprint within our key accounts.
Broadening our market exposure
Our technology delivers efficiency gains 
resulting from tight data integration 
and is a principal driver leading to an 
increasing number of EPC and OO 
customers choosing to standardise on 
AVEVA technology. AVEVA’s solutions 
are designed to help customers eliminate 
errors in construction and thus reduce 
expensive rework later in the project 
phase. Another key determinant of the 
customer’s decision to invest in AVEVA 
technology is their need to cope with 
increasing scale and complexity. 
Furthermore, our solutions enable the 
maintenance of accurate and reliable 
information, which is increasingly a 
key regulatory requirement in all the 
industries our customers serve. Thus, 
through the deployment of AVEVA 
technology our customers are able 
to maintain a competitive edge in the 
markets in which they are operating.

These factors, and the extensive 
capabilities of our solutions themselves, 
are clearly relevant to a broader set of 
end-markets than Oil & Gas, Power and 
Marine, where we are well represented. 
Hence, one of our key strategic initiatives 
is to expand into areas of the process 
industries in which we have little or 
no penetration, as well as adjacent 
markets where appropriate. Some 
of the following customer examples 
serve to illustrate the progress we 
made during the year on this front.
In the Paper & Pulp industry, we saw a 
strategically important customer in Latin 
America begin its migration from PDMS 
to AVEVA E3D, as a means of eliminating 
the problem of data inconsistency 
in the revision of complex drawings, 
which had previously been done using 
third-party tools unconnected to the 
3D model and, hence, prone to error.
In the Power market, a leading global 
EPC chose to deploy AVEVA’s Integrated 
Engineering & Design solutions, including 
AVEVA E3D, replacing a legacy system 
in order to benefit from increased 
efficiency within its engineering 
disciplines and in order to streamline 
purchasing and production workloads 
and replacing an inefficient legacy 
system. Key to this decision was the 
ability for AVEVA’s solutions to reduce 
rework in construction and improve the 
efficiency of the approvals process.
Eliminating errors in construction, and 
thus reducing costly rework in both 
greenfield and brownfield projects, led 
one of the leading EPCs operating in 
the Russian Petrochemical market to 
become a customer for the first time, 
replacing a legacy competitor solution. 
Again, in Russia, we saw one of the 
country’s largest petrochemical and gas 
processing EPCs extend its deployment 
of AVEVA technology to include a number 
of new products including AVEVA E3D, 
in order to cope efficiently with projects 
of greater scale and complexity.
Brodosplit Shipyard in Croatia 
implemented an AVEVA Integrated 
Shipbuilding solution, optimising the 
design of both vessels and offshore assets 
as well as materials management and 
production across the entire shipyard. 
One of the largest power EPCs in the 
Middle East selected AVEVA Integrated 
Engineering & Design package, replacing 
a competitor’s solution. We closed an 
important standardisation deal with a 
large Russian EPC and a major water 
services customer commenced full 
migration to AVEVA E3D, having been a 
PDMS customer for a number of years. 
We saw an encouraging number of new 
customers adopt AVEVA NET to meet their 
information management requirements, 
where regulatory compliance is a key 
consideration and driver behind the 
investment decision. These included a 
global chemical company, a major nuclear 
fusion research facility in France and 
two major South Korean EPCs. AVEVA 
NET has also gone into production at a 
Norwegian integrated oil major, which 
includes the first deployment of the 
AVEVA Activity Visualisation Platform™ 
(AVEVA AVP™). This is an example of a 
customer choosing to use the 3D model 
as the portal for navigation as they access 
data held in AVEVA NET, a trend which 
we expect to drive further convergence 
of these technologies. Encouragingly, 
progress in our AVEVA NET business 
has now reached a level of maturity 
where we can look to build additional 
scale through a partner approach rather 
than through further investment in 
our internal service organisation.
Our Fabricators business also delivered 
strong growth during the period. This 
business incorporates AVEVA Bocad and 
the recently acquired FabTrol, ™ offering an 
end-to-end solution for steel detailing and 
steel fabrication management, production 
control and shipping. The FabTrol 
acquisition, completed in June 2015, has 
already begun to raise awareness of AVEVA 
Bocad in the North American market, 
recently underpinned by significantly 
upgraded functionality that we expect to 
support future development in the region. 
Finally, providing further evidence of 
our determination to move into new 
industry segments, we were pleased to 
deliver an integrated design and workflow 
management solution, as the first stage 
of an eventual standardisation strategy, 
to one of the largest global suppliers 
of technology into the food processing 
industry, where AVEVA software tools 
are now being deployed to develop and 
design production plants for the dairy, 
beverage, brewery, food, pharmaceutical 
and chemical processing markets.

Further developing our Software as a 
Service (SaaS) solutions
We expect that over time the SaaS 
delivery model will become more 
valuable to our customers, particularly 
as it enables them to leverage the many 
efficiencies and benefits offered by cloud 
computing. AVEVA has a strong technical 
proposition and is well positioned, 
through partnerships with the industry-
leading cloud infrastructure platform 
providers, for the eventual SaaS delivery 
of our solutions. Indeed, AVEVA has 
led the industry with AVEVA Global™ 
which has allowed customers to move 
projects around the globe to enable 24 
hour collaborative working on projects. 
We were very encouraged during the year 
by the uptake for our on-demand AVEVA 
E3D environment AVEVA Experience, ™ 
with over 1,000 customers already 
trialling the cloud version of AVEVA E3D, 
where existing and prospective users 
of our design software can gain hands-
on experience with the fully-functional 
AVEVA E3D platform, via the cloud, 
and we have some well-established 
hosted deployments of AVEVA NET. 
We believe that over the long term 
these solutions will gain strong traction, 
but there are a number of challenges 
for the industry to overcome before 
wider adoption becomes the norm.
Some years ago we saw the majority 
of the market move from initial 
licences to rental licences and to 
a SaaS hybrid of token licensing. 
The next transition will be towards 
greater use of SaaS and off premise 
services and software; as we make this 
technology shift there will be additional 
opportunities for AVEVA enabling us 
to offer a broader set of solutions.
Outlook
The result for the year has highlighted 
the strength of the AVEVA business 
model, the value that our technology 
delivers to our customers and our ability 
to adapt to changing market conditions 
through a disciplined approach to 
innovation and organisational efficiency. 
AVEVA’s Digital Asset approach is proving 
to be transformational for our EPC and 
OO customers as we help them to 
focus on profitability, lean engineering 
disciplines, operational efficiencies and 
regulatory compliance in information 
management. We have continued to 
invest in our technology vision and 
are particularly encouraged to see the 
concept resonating strongly with our 
customers, many of whom have placed 
the Digital Asset at the heart of their 
technology vision. The Digital Asset offers 
our customers a means of building a 
substantial business opportunity around 
the entire lifecycle of the asset, which 
we expect to increase in importance for 
both EPCs and OOs over the long term.
As we manage our business through the 
cycle we are focused on ensuring the 
most efficient allocation of resources, 
optimising our investment in future 
opportunities. As a consequence, in the 
second half of the year we undertook 
some additional cost saving initiatives, 
achieved at a one-off exceptional cost 
of approximately £4.5 million, part of 
which has been recognised in the year. 
We believe that our organisation is 
now well positioned to deliver further 
progress against our key strategic 
initiatives, despite the difficult end-market 
backdrop we are currently experiencing.
It is a testament to the dedication of 
all of our employees around the world 
that we have been able to deliver a solid 
result in difficult markets alongside 
the implementation of significant 
cost savings during 2015/16. As a 
result, AVEVA is in a stronger position 
today, both from a technology and an 
organisational perspective, than ever 
before. Our business remains well 
capitalised and we intend to continue to 
bolster our organic growth with selective 
acquisitions over time, adding new 
product capabilities and accelerating 
access to new markets as a result.
Whilst we recognise the challenges in 
our markets, we are focused on the 
opportunities that lie ahead of us both 
strategically and operationally and, with 
these in mind, the Board is confident that 
we can achieve our targets in the current 
financial year and over the medium term.

Key performance indicators
We aim to deliver good sustainable 
growth, balanced by our need to continue 
to invest in innovation, sales and 
marketing in order to achieve this. The 
goal is to deliver profitable growth as the 
business expands, whilst maintaining a 
healthy balance sheet. We have set out 
a range of the financial key performance 
indicators (KPIs) that help to present 
a meaningful picture of how AVEVA is 
performing. Taken overall, we believe 
that this range of KPIs – which offers 
insights into our revenue, investment, 
profitability, and cash generation –

illustrates the high levels of recurring 
revenue, strong margins and ability 
to convert profits to cash effectively 
that are features of our business. Our 
markets continued to be difficult over 
the past year, particularly in Oil & Gas, 
and that is reflected in the KPI trends. It 
is noteworthy that our recurring revenue 
was relatively stable, and despite a modest

CTO’s review
THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, AVEVA HAS PARTNERED WITH 
ITS CUSTOMERS IN SEARCHING FOR NEW WAYS IN WHICH 
TECHNOLOGY CAN DELIVER MAJOR BUSINESS BENEFITS
Continued focus on delivering innovation 
Often this is achieved through the 
transformation of how activities are 
undertaken or even by eliminating entire 
steps in their business processes, thus 
enhancing efficiency, driving down costs 
and improving quality and business 
agility. Our search for transformational 
technology ideas continues.
During the past year we have delivered a 
number of ground-breaking innovations, 
spanning the entire solution portfolio.
Lifetime extensions
Current economic conditions are 
challenging for many of our customers and 
many asset owners are looking to improve 
operating performance and to extend 
the life of their existing assets, while 
limiting their investment in new green-
field facilities. Life extension projects are 
by their nature complex involving refitting 
equipment and systems into the existing 
facility. There is usually no single right 
answer to the re-design or to achieve the 
re-construction, but the aim is to achieve 
an improved, possibly extended, facility 
and have it operational in the shortest 
possible time achievable within the 
available budget. In a typical project of this 
kind, thousands of decisions are needed 
across many different areas of speciality.
Through careful planning and targeted 
investment, AVEVA’s technology has 
evolved to address these specific needs.
We have developed and incorporated 
several major new capabilities into our 
market leading 3D design product, AVEVA 
E3D. As a result, AVEVA E3D directly 
addresses the requirements for asset 
modification and lifetime extension that 
are urgently required by our customers.
Customers are benefiting from the 
ability to handle laser data directly within 
the design environment. The latest 
innovations allow AVEVA’s laser-modelling 
technology to enable new capabilities 
such as the demolition and removal of 
existing plant items in the laser model 
prior to re-construction and installation 
of new equipment and systems. 
The technology allows continuous 
updating of the laser point cloud as 
modifications are made to the operating 
asset. By doing so, the point cloud can 
be maintained as a true model of the 
operating asset and can be used to 
provide a true-to-life 3D visualisation to 
easily and naturally navigate and access 
all types of information about the asset. 
As a result of this unique capability, we are 
now delivering what we term the ‘Trusted 
Living Pointcloud™’, an evolving source of 
reliable, value-rich information that forms 
a core 3D component to a perpetually 
changing Digital Asset. This is true for both 
existing assets and for new greenfield or 
brownfield projects. We are continuing to 
invest in our laser-modelling technology 
and recently introduced the HyperBubble, ™ 
which delivers a photo-realistic overlay 
of laser point cloud data in a freely 
navigable, immersive environment.

Engineering decision support
Ultra-high performance visualisation 
brings models to life and makes 
information far more accessible, but has 
traditionally been the domain of specialist 
applications and so not readily available to 
the broader population of decision makers. 
The advent of large format, touch-enabled 
display devices removes the need to learn 
a specialist application and provides an 
unrivalled environment for reviewing asset 
information and driving more effective 
decision making. The launch of AVEVA 
Engage in October 2015 created a new 
benchmark in information accessibility 
through combining ultra-high performance 
visualisation with application-agnostic 
access to information via large format 
touch devices. The effect is amazing 
and inspiring and has begun to generate 
immediate interest from owner operators 
and engineering contractors alike.
These technical advances can replace 
existing methods and, by adding greater 
automation, streamline customers’ 
businesses making them leaner and 
more efficient. AVEVA’s unique object-
management platform does this by 
allowing multiple disciplines to interact 
on the same data objects, driving out 
data duplication and reducing the risk 
of errors and miscommunication.
We have recently extended this 
benefit to incorporate the work of 
electrical departments by making 
AVEVA Electrical™ the only engineering 
product of its type to allow accurate 
cable-length and sizing calculations 
through integration with AVEVA E3D 
for cable routing. This enhancement 
reflects our continued commitment to 
realise our vision for AVEVA Integrated 
Engineering & Design by ensuring that all 
2D and 3D designs are tightly integrated 
throughout the product lifecycle.

technologies. The launch of AVEVA 
Experience, which provides on-demand 
cloud-based access to AVEVA E3D for 
customers to get hands-on experience 
of the new design platform has been 
particularly well received, with over 
1,000 registrations since launch.
We continue to develop our products with 
the eventual move to the cloud in mind in 
order to provide an appropriate solution 
for customers, with the cloud delivering 
a hybrid extension of their on-premise 
environment, creating new efficiencies 
and flexibility for rapid redeployment of 
resources and, over time, on-demand 
access to our entire application portfolio.
I am very excited about AVEVA’s 
portfolio and the opportunities it can 
bring to help support our customers 
in their quest for greater efficiency 
and return on investment.

Finance review
THE BUSINESS HAS DELIVERED A SOLID PERFORMANCE 
DESPITE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS
Summary
The business has delivered a solid 
performance despite difficult market 
conditions. We have seen a broadly 
flat performance in organic, constant 
currency terms with our recurring 
revenue continuing to hold up at 76% of 
total revenue. With the business being 
heavily weighted towards the second 
half, it was pleasing that the business 
performed broadly as we expected with 
over 80% of our profit being earned in 
H2. The business remains highly cash 
generative and we closed the year with 
£107.9 million in net cash and no debt.
Total revenue for the year was £201.5 
million which was down 3% compared to 
the previous year (2015 – £208.7 million). 
Included in the results is £6.9 million of 
revenue from the acquisitions of 8over8 
Limited, (acquired January 2015) and 
FabTrol, the fabrication management 
software (acquired June 2015). Organic 
revenue on a constant currency basis 
declined 2% compared to the prior year. 
Rental licence fee revenue fell by 4% to 
£92.9 million with the largest fall coming 
from Latin America. Again we saw a 
significant seasonal effect with rental 
revenue of £60.0 million (2015 – £65.1 
million) in the second half of the year. As 
previously highlighted, this was driven by 
our Global Account customers where 
renewals typically fall into the second half 
of the year. Generally we saw our Global 
Account renewals hold up reasonably well 
in the period and the price escalation 
achieved in multi-year contracts, in 
particular through the introduction of 
AVEVA E3D, was in line with expectations. 
Unsurprisingly we saw some customers 
reduce their usage of our software tools, 
principally due to the more challenging 
market conditions in Oil & Gas.
Initial licence revenue was £30.1 million, a 
reduction of 3% compared to the previous 
year (2015 – £31.1 million). 
Training and services revenue was down 
6% at £18.0 million (2015 – £19.1 million).
“We continue to have a 
focused and disciplined 
approach to managing the 
cost base.”
James Kidd
Chief Financial Officer
Following first half revenue of £82.0 
million (2015 – £85.9 million), the second 
half of the year delivered revenue of 
£119.5 million, compared to £122.8 million 
in 2014/15 and represents 59% of the 
year’s revenue (2015 – 59%). Adjusted 
profit before tax was £51.2 million (2015 
– £62.1 million), which included a loss 
of £0.3m from acquisitions and was 
impacted by a foreign exchange loss 
of £1.7 million in March 2016 resulting 
from the translation of (in particular) US 
Dollar-denominated assets following 
the weakening of the Dollar.
Revenue
Organic, constant currency revenue

The Group’s recurring revenue, which 
consists of annual fees and rental licence

(2015 – £157.4 million) and represented 
76% of revenue (2015 – 76%).
Annual fees grew by 5% to £63.4 million 
following on from initial licence sales in the 
previous year and some price increases.  STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue was impacted by £9.8 million 
(a reduction of 5%) related to foreign 
exchange on the translation of our 
overseas subsidiaries, which was a 
continuation of the effects we saw in the 
first half of the year. EMEA was impacted 
most significantly as a result of the 
weakness, relative to sterling, of the 
Euro and Russian rouble.
Asia Pacific
In Asia we achieved growth of 7% on a 
constant currency basis with growth in 
all of the territories in which we operate, 
which was very pleasing. Our focus on 
South East Asia is paying dividends and 
has helped deliver strong growth. The 
investment we have made in India in 
recent years is delivering good growth 
and we benefited principally from naval 
projects, Power and refining. In South 
Korea and Japan, there was modest 
growth overall despite this region having 
the biggest exposure to shipbuilding. 
Finally, in China we saw growth over last 
year, driven mainly by Power, Chemical 
and Oil & Gas customers.
EMEA
In EMEA we achieved overall growth of 4% 
on a constant currency basis. There was 
strong growth in the Middle East from OOs 
and in Northern and Central Europe from 
rental fees from non-Oil & Gas accounts. 
Global Accounts in EMEA were flat 
compared to the previous year.
Americas
In the Americas, the performance was 
impacted by Brazil where we experienced 
a decline in revenue compared to the 
previous year. In North America, whilst 
Global Accounts usage was reasonably 
stable, we did see one Global Account 
where we recognised less revenue 
in 2015/16 due to the timing of the 
renewal. Excluding this one customer, 
we saw a flat performance in our 
North American business. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Acquisitions
In January 2015, we completed the 
acquisition of 8over8 Limited, a vendor of 
contract risk management software for 
increased project control and capital 
discipline. Whilst the recurring revenue for 
8over8 has remained intact during the 
year, the lack of new capital projects within 
Oil & Gas has affected demand for new 
licences of the ProCon software. We 
remain focused on selling ProCon into 
other capital intensive industries where it 
is equally relevant and we were pleased to 
close our first contract with a mining 
company during the year.
In June 2015, we completed the acquisition 
of FabTrol Systems Inc for £3.6 million. The 
business is based in North America and 
provides fabrication management 
software to the steel fabrication industry. 
It has a well-established market position 
with 1,400 customers globally with a 
particularly strong installed base in North 
America, a major cross-selling opportunity 
for our Bocad software.
Finance review 
CONTINUED
In total, the acquisitions contributed £6.9 
million of revenue during the year and 
incurred costs of £7.2 million resulting in an 
adjusted loss before tax of £0.3 million in 
the year.
Cost analysis
As disclosed in the interim statement, the 
allocation of costs between selling and 
distribution costs and administrative 
expenses has been amended during the 
year and the income statements of prior 
periods have been restated accordingly. 
There has been no impact on profit from 
operations. Further details are contained 
in note 2.
Normalised items include amortisation of 
intangibles (excluding other software) £5.6 
million (2015 – £4.7 million), share-based 
payments £0.5 million (2015 – gain of £0.4 
million), loss on fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts £0.4 million 
(2015 – £1.0 million) and exceptional items 
of £15.2 million (2015 – £2.0 million).

We continue to invest in Research & 
Development in both continued 
advancement of our existing products with 
examples including the new version of 
AVEVA E3D with enhanced laser capability 
for brownfield projects and new products 
such as AVEVA Engage. Research & 
Development costs fell by 15% on an 
organic, constant currency basis partly 
due to the benefit of the restructuring that 
was undertaken in the first half, savings 
from utilising our in-house facility in 
Hyderabad for more projects and an 
increased benefit from a higher R&D tax 
claim in the UK.
Selling and distribution expenses 
increased by 7% on an organic, constant 
currency basis. This was principally due to 
increased sales commissions, higher 
anti-piracy costs and higher technical sales 
and marketing costs.
Administrative expenses increased by 7% 
on a constant currency basis although 
2014/15 benefited from a foreign exchange 
gain of approximately £2.5 million. In 
2015/16 we also incurred higher costs of 
national insurance on share options.
We continue to have a focused and 
disciplined approach to managing the cost 
base. In March 2016, we implemented a 
number of cost efficiency initiatives 
including a reduction in headcount in 
specific areas of the business, some office 
rationalisation and other efficiency 
measures. As a result, we have incurred an 
exceptional charge of £2.4 million in the 
second half for redundancy and related 
costs, and property lease costs with £2.1 
million having been incurred in the first 
half. These will be completed by the end of 
the first quarter of 2016/17 and we expect 
to incur a charge of approximately £2.5 
million. The resulting savings are intended 
to mitigate the impact of expected cost 
inflation and planned investments 
elsewhere in the business. STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A FOCUSED AND DISCIPLINED 
APPROACH TO MANAGING THE COST BASE
Exceptional items
During the year the Group 
incurred exceptional costs of £15.2 
million (2015 – £2.0 million).
Included in exceptional items were 
professional fees paid of £10.5 million 
(2015 – £0.4 million) principally for legal and 
financial due diligence services related to 
the aborted Schneider Electric transaction 
as well as the acquisition of FabTrol 
Systems Inc. In the previous year, the costs 
were in relation to professional fees related 
to the acquisition of 8over8 Limited.
As noted above, during 2015/16 
exceptional restructuring costs of 
£4.5 million (2015 – £0.9 million) 
were incurred for redundancy and 
related costs in connection with the 
rationalisation of offices and reduction 
in headcount in specific areas of 
the business. The total cash cost in 
2015/16 amounted to £2.5 million. 
The Group has provided for a potential 
underpaid sales tax liability, in respect 
of prior periods, related to the local 
sales of one of the Group’s subsidiary 
companies. The provision includes an 
estimate of the underpaid tax as well 
as related interest for late payment.
Profit before tax
Adjusted profit before tax for the 
year ended 31 March 2016 was £51.2 
million (2015 – £62.1 million), a decrease 
of 18%, principally caused by the 
reduction in revenue. This resulted 
in an adjusted profit margin of 25.4% 
compared to 29.8% for 2014/15.
Reported profit before tax was £29.4 
million (2015 – £54.9 million) and was 
principally impacted by the lower 
revenue and one-off exceptional items 
of £15.2 million as described above.
Taxation
The headline effective tax rate for the year 
was 30.4% (2015 – 24.2%) as the charge 
was impacted by the non-deductible 
acquisition-related exceptional costs of 
£10.5 million (2015 – £0.4 million). After 
adjusting for these costs, the underlying 
effective rate was 22.5% which is slightly 
above the underlying UK corporate tax 
rate of 20%, caused by profits being taxed 
at higher rates in overseas jurisdictions 
and other non-deductible expenses.
Dividends
With consistent and strong cash flows 
and no net debt, the Group retains 
considerable financial flexibility going 
forward. The Board remains focused on 
delivering growth both organically and 
through acquisitions. Our strong cash 
flows underpin the Board’s sustainable, 
progressive dividend policy, balanced 
against an active focus on M&A, 
with excess capital being returned to 
shareholders from time to time. The Board 
is proposing a final dividend of 30.0 pence 
per share (2015 – 25.0 pence per share), 
an increase of 20%. The dividend will be 
payable on 5 August 2016, to shareholders 
on the register on 1 July 2016.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 32.03 pence 
(2015 – 65.07 pence) and diluted earnings 
per share were 31.96 pence (2015 – 64.92 
pence). Adjusted basic earnings per share 
were 62.04 pence (2015 – 74.51 pence).
Balance sheet and cash flows
AVEVA continues to maintain a 
strong balance sheet and has no 
debt. Net assets at 31 March 2016 
were £201.0 million compared to 
£189.9 million at 31 March 2015. 
Non-current assets
Non-current assets decreased from 
£90.9 million to £87.5 million mainly 
due to lower capital expenditure as we 
carefully managed our cash flow and 
as a consequence of a reduction to the 
consideration paid for 8over8 Limited 
of £4.1 million that arose through 
an acquisition indemnity claim.
Working capital
Gross trade receivables at 31 March 2016 
were £94.5 million which was in line with 
last year (2015 – £94.2 million). Again we 
saw a strong finish to the year with a large 
number of our Global Account renewals 
occurring in the final quarter resulting 
in billings being more weighted towards 
the end of the period. The bad debt 
provision at 31 March 2016 was £5.9 million 
compared to £5.6 million at 31 March 2015. 
We have continued to apply the Group’s 
bad debt provision policy consistently 
throughout the year and as highlighted 
above, we suffered a bad debt charge of 
£3.4 million (2015 – £3.3 million) as a result 
of delays in getting paid by customers, 
principally in Brazil, Russia, India and China. 
Deferred income at 31 March 2016 was 
£46.9 million compared to £48.2 million 
at 31 March 2015. 
Trade payables and other liabilities were 
higher than last year due to the timing 
of invoices.
Cash generation
Net cash (including treasury deposits) 
at 31 March 2016 was £107.9 million 
compared to £103.8 million at 31 March 
2015. Since 31 March 2016, we have seen 
strong cash collections from customers 
resulting in cash at 30 April 2016 being 
£123.5 million (2015 – £117.6 million). AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Finance review 
CONTINUED
Cash generated from operating activities 
after tax was £24.3 million (2015 – £30.9 
million). The Group showed strong cash 
generation in the first half of the year 
but we saw an impact in the second half 
due to the delay of a large receivable, 
subsequently collected in April 2016. 
There has been no change in the credit 
terms offered to customers, however, as 
highlighted above, we have experienced 
some delays in payment in certain 
countries impacting cash conversion. In 
addition, during the year the Group paid 
professional fees principally related to the 
Schneider Electric transaction of £10.5 
million. The cash conversion for the year 
was 123% (2015 – 83%) reflecting higher 
year-end trade creditors and provisions, 
including in respect of restructuring costs.
Pensions
On an accounting basis, the Group’s 
pension liabilities decreased from £14.2 
million last year to £5.2 million. This was 
principally caused by the UK defined 
benefit scheme deficit decreasing from 
£11.3 million to £2.3 million driven by 
an increase in government gilt and 
corporate bond yields, leading to a 
corresponding increase in the discount 
rate used to discount our long-term 
liabilities, together with a strong 
equity and bonds performance.
On 31 March 2015, the Group closed the 
UK defined benefit pension scheme to 
future accrual. This decision was taken 
to manage the current and future risk on 
the Group’s balance sheet, with a view to 
ultimately effecting an insurance buy-out. 
Previously accrued pension benefits will 
continue to be revalued in line with RPI. 
Capital structure
At 31 March 2016, the Group had 
63,961,113 shares of 3 5/9p each in issue 
(2015 – 63,948,241 shares). During the 
year the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit 
Trust 2008 (‘the Trust’) purchased 4,418 
ordinary shares in the Company in the 
open market at an average price of 
£21.23 per share for total consideration of 
£93,784 in order to satisfy awards made 
under the AVEVA Group Management 
Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008. At 
31 March 2016, the Trust owned 22,077 
ordinary shares in the Company.
Treasury policy
The Group treasury policy aims to ensure 
that the capital held is not put at risk and 
the treasury function is managed under 
policies and procedures approved by 
the Board. These policies are designed 
to reduce the financial risk arising from 
the Group’s normal trading activities, 
which primarily relate to credit, interest, 
liquidity and currency risk. The Group 
is, and expects to be, cash positive 
and at 31 March 2016 held net cash 
of £107.9 million. The treasury policy 
includes strict counterparty limits.

Principal risks and uncertainties
AVEVA FACES A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT 
ON THE GROUP’S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE. THE BOARD 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE NATURE OF THESE 
RISKS AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE MITIGATING ACTIONS 
ARE IN PLACE TO MANAGE THEM EFFECTIVELY
Risk management process
The Board retains ultimate responsibility 
for the Group’s risk management and 
as part of this regularly completes a 
review of the Group’s Risk Register 
and an assessment of the adequacy 
of the mitigating controls identified 
by management. To aid this process 
the Board approved the formation 
of a Risk Committee comprising 
senior management from each 
function of the business. The Risk 
Committee reports jointly to the 
Board and the Executive Board.
The Risk Committee meets at least 
quarterly and has responsibility 
for considering risk appetite, risk 
identification, risk quantification/
qualification and the determination of 
mitigating internal controls. The Risk 
Committee is not responsible for internal 
audit activities which remain under the 
responsibility of the Audit Committee. 
More details of AVEVA’s assessment 
of internal controls is included within 
the Audit Committee Report and on 
page 42 of the Corporate Governance 
section of the Directors’ Report.
This year the Risk Committee gathered 
opinions, via a Risk Questionnaire, from 
around 50 of the most senior managers 
within the Group and this formed a 
valuable input when considering the Group 
risk profile and in undertaking the annual 
review of the Risk Register. The Risk 
Register was compiled after considering 
three main risk characteristics – likelihood, 
size of impact and timeframe for when 
the risk may impact the Group. Likelihood 
was assessed on a net risk basis (i.e. 
after the operation of internal controls) 
as the Risk Committee considered this 
gave a more robust view of the risks 
currently faced by AVEVA. Separately, 
the Audit Committee has responsibility 
for determining the appropriate level of 
review required to ensure that internal 
controls are operating as designed.
The updated Group risk register was 
ultimately reviewed and approved 
by the Board and in the context 
of the assessment of viability the 
Board considered which risks, and 
combination of risks, would threaten 
the viability of the company. 
The principal risks faced by the Group 
are set out on pages 34 to 35, and 
include indicators of the financial 
impact, likelihood and whether the 
risk has increased or decreased in 
significance since the last review.
Viability Statement
In accordance with the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the Group’s 
prospects and viability over a period 
significantly longer than the outlook 
of the Going Concern statement of 12 
months. The Directors have determined 
that the appropriate period is three years, 
corresponding with the period covered 
by the Group’s business planning cycle. 
The Directors considered the principal 
risks in plausible but severe scenarios 
and assessed the potential impact of a 
decline in the Group’s revenue caused 
by a period of sustained low economic 
growth resulting in low levels of capital 
investment, together with the potential 
deterioration in the market share of 
our dominant product family and this 
was combined with an unfavourable 
foreign exchange assumption. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
have considered the Group’s current 
position and principal risks, and have 
a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over a three year period.
In making this statement, the Directors 
have also made the following assumptions:
 – oil prices will not fall significantly further 
 – the UK EU referendum, which could 
lead to Britain exiting the EU, will 
not affect current trading or existing 
customer contracts or relationships
 – our internal controls in mitigation of a 
significant proportion of the risks on the 
register continue to operate effectively
Going concern statement
The Group has significant financial 
resources, is profitable and has a strong 
position in the markets it serves. At 
31 March 2016, the Group had cash and 
treasury deposit balances of £107.9 
million (2015 – £103.8 million) and no debt. 
Therefore, after making enquiries and 
considering the cash flow forecasts for the 
Group, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements.  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

STRATEGIC AND MARKET RISKS
Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy
Dependency on key markets
AVEVA generates a substantial amount of its income 
from customers whose main business is derived 
from capital projects in the Oil & Gas, Power and 
Marine markets. World economic conditions or 
funding constraints for new capital projects may 
adversely affect our financial performance. Currently, 
some of AVEVA’s vertical end markets are under 
pressure with lower oil prices and inevitably this 
is having an impact on the Group’s revenues.
AVEVA is expanding into new 
market segments such as mining, 
petrochemicals and AEC, albeit from 
a relatively small base. It is central to 
our strategy to diversify our customer 
offerings into OOs and Plant operations. 
This will help secure a longer-term 
income stream that extends beyond 
the design/build phase of these capital 
projects. In addition, our extensive global 
presence provides some mitigation from 
over-reliance on key geographic markets.
Competition
AVEVA operates in highly competitive markets that serve 
the Oil & Gas, Power and Marine markets. Our 3D design 
tools are well established in our markets and we believe 
that there are a relatively small number of significant 
competitors. However, some of these competitors 
could, in the future, pose a greater competitive threat 
to AVEVA’s revenues, particularly if they consolidate 
or form strategic or commercial relationships among 
themselves or with larger, well capitalised companies. 
Further threats are posed by the entrance, into 
AVEVA’s markets, of a much larger technology 
competitor or transformational technology, such 
as Cloud-based solutions.
The Group’s strategy to extend the digital asset footprint 
is key to ensuring that our customer penetration is broad 
and that AVEVA’s sources of revenue are diversified.
We carefully monitor customers and 
other suppliers operating within our 
chosen markets. We stay close to 
our customers and ensure we have a 
strong understanding of their needs 
and their expectations from the AVEVA 
product development roadmap.
We expect that the customers we serve 
will, over the next three to five years, 
show an increased appetite or insistence 
on their software needs being delivered 
with more flexibility. AVEVA is already 
well progressed with its Cloud strategy 
and expects to be able to meet these 
customer demands as they develop.
Professional Services
Where AVEVA assists customers with the deployment 
of an enterprise solution this involves some degree 
of consulting and/or implementation work. This 
requires specialist knowledge to be available and 
well managed in many geographic locations. There 
is a risk that the services provided do not meet the 
customer’s expectations or that technical difficulties 
are encountered. 
In some instances we may opt to partner with a third 
party for this work and this relationship also requires 
careful management and maintenance to ensure 
that AVEVA’s strong reputation with our customers 
is not damaged. 
We employ experienced industry 
professionals within our professional 
services team and continue to 
build commercial partnerships with 
third party systems integrators.
We have rigorous processes and 
controls for the appraisal of potential 
commercial opportunities prior to any 
bid being submitted. Bids are appraised 
on grounds of technical complexity as 
well as financial and commercial risk.
Acquisitions
An acquisition by AVEVA or of AVEVA could pose a 
significant distraction to management and to the 
delivery of our business plan.
The Group expects to continue to review acquisition 
targets as part of its strategy. The integration of 
acquisitions involves a number of unique risks, including 
diversion of management’s attention, failure to retain 
key personnel of the acquired business, failure to 
realise the benefits anticipated to result from the 
acquisition, and successful integration of the acquired 
intellectual property.
While each acquisition and integration is 
unique, AVEVA now has an experienced 
team to appraise and complete 
acquisitions. The Group’s experience 
of previous ‘bolt-on’ acquisitions 
as well as the aborted transaction 
with Schneider Electric provides a 
good understanding of potential 
transaction and integration risks.

OPERATIONAL RISKS
FINANCIAL RISKS
Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy
Recruitment and retention of employees
AVEVA’s success has been built on the quality and 
reputation of its products and services, which rely 
almost entirely on the quality of the people developing 
and delivering them. Managing this pool of highly skilled 
and motivated individuals across all disciplines and 
geographies remains key to our ongoing success. 
The Group endeavours to ensure that 
employees are motivated in their work 
and there are regular appraisals, with 
staff encouraged to develop their 
skills. Annually there is a Group-wide 
salary review that rewards strong 
performance and ensures salaries 
remain competitive. Commission and 
bonus schemes help to ensure the 
success of the Group and individual 
achievement is appropriately rewarded.
Protection of intellectual property
The Group’s success has been built upon the 
development of its substantial intellectual property 
rights and the future growth of the business 
requires the continual protection of these tools. 
The protection of the Group’s proprietary 
software products is achieved by licensing 
rights to use the application, rather than selling 
or licensing the computer source code.
The Group uses third party technology 
to encrypt, protect and restrict access 
to its products. Access limitations and 
rights are also defined within the terms 
of the software licence agreement. 
The Group seeks to ensure that 
its intellectual property rights are 
appropriately protected by law 
and seeks to vigorously assert its 
proprietary rights wherever possible. 
Research & Development
The Group makes substantial investments in 
Research & Development in enhancing existing 
products and introducing new products and must 
effectively appraise its investment decisions and 
ensure that we continue to provide class-leading 
solutions that meet the needs of our markets. 
Our software products are complex and new products 
or enhancements may contain undetected errors, 
failures, performance problems or defects which may 
impact our strong reputation with our customers.
AVEVA continually reviews the alignment 
of the activities of our Research & 
Development teams to ensure that 
they remain focused on areas that will 
meet the demands of our customers 
and deliver appropriate financial returns. 
This process is managed by developing 
a product roadmap that identifies 
the schedule for new products and 
the enhancements that will be made 
to successive versions of existing 
products. Products are extensively 
tested prior to commercial launch.
International operations
The Group operates in over 30 countries globally 
and must determine how best to utilise its resources 
across these diverse markets. Where necessary, the 
business must adapt its market approach to best 
capitalise on local market opportunities, particularly 
in the strategically key growth economies.
In addition, the Group is required to comply with the 
local laws, regulations and tax legislation in each 
of these jurisdictions. Significant changes in these 
laws and regulations or failure to comply with them 
could lead to additional liabilities and penalties. 
The Group manages its overseas 
operations by employing locally 
qualified personnel who are able to 
provide expertise in the appropriate 
language and an understanding of 
local culture, custom and practice. 
Local management is supported by 
local professional advisers and further 
oversight is maintained from the Group’s 
corporate legal and finance functions.
Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy
Foreign exchange risk
Exposure to foreign currency gains and losses can 
be material to the Group, with more than 80% of the 
Group’s revenue denominated in a currency other than 
sterling, of which our two largest are US Dollar and Euro. 
The UK referendum on European Union 
membership on 23 June 2016 is currently increasing 
foreign exchange risk for the Group and if the 
decision is to exit this increased uncertainty and 
volatility may prevail for the medium term. 
The overseas subsidiaries predominantly 
trade in their own local currencies, which 
acts as a partial natural hedge against 
currency movements. In addition, 
the Group enters into forward foreign 
currency contracts to manage the risk 
where material and practical. The Group 
limits its hedging of revenue to US Dollar, 
Euro, Japanese Yen and its hedging of 
costs to Swedish Krona and Indian Rupee. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Corporate responsibility
Internal stakeholders
AVEVA is a diverse organisation 
with employees in 30 countries 
and from many different 
cultures. Our Global Ambassador Network 
continues to expand and provides a 
channel for our employees to provide 
feedback to the senior management team. 
Editorial teams manage the network’s 
regional communications to ensure our 
largest regions receive both corporate 
and regionally focused updates regularly, 
to support our employees in their roles.
As of 31 March 2016 we have a headcount 
of 1,706, a 5% increase on last year (2015 
– 1,623). 75% of our employees are male 
and 25% are female (2015 – 73% and 27%).
External stakeholders
Transparency and disclosure is 
fundamental to our relationship 
with customers and suppliers and 
we continue to maintain open, honest and 
fair discussions to maintain our reputation 
as a trusted and ethical organisation.
To protect the interest of our customers, 
our Anti-Piracy and Compliance teams 
monitor the illegal use of AVEVA software 
and enforce compliance within our 
terms and conditions. This team has 
been expanded over the past two years 
in order to tackle the increased use of 
illegal software. AVEVA will continue to 
invest in both people and technology 
to further ensure compliant use of its 
technology. Whilst illegal use of our 
software is an ongoing challenge, AVEVA 
is becoming much more successful in 
the detection of such cases and the 
subsequent enforcement of licence terms.
To embed and reinforce our corporate 
policy against the acceptance or 
payment of bribes we have enhanced 
and improved our eLearning tools. 
Every employee completes the Global 
Corporate Governance and Group 
IT Compliance training each year to 
ensure that we maintain our high 
ethical standards. We review monthly 
operational challenges in the key regional 
hubs to ensure local governance.

Employee engagement
During September 2015 we 
carried out ‘Pulse’ engagement 
surveys in five key locations. 
Out of the total 654 employees who 
were invited to participate we achieved 
a 78% response rate and the overall 
score for engagement was 82%. 
Where there were areas highlighted 
that showed improvement was 
necessary, action plans were 
developed and implemented. 
Managers play a critical role in 
engagement and we continue to invest 
to support our senior management 
team. An example of this has been the 
development of a specific ‘Managers’ 
Zone’ on our corporate intranet which 
hosts a range of materials, information and 
toolkits for managers, to support them 
as they communicate with and develop 
their teams. The Executive Team holds 
manager briefings on key issues affecting 
employees, providing updates along with 
an open forum for questions and answers.
Communications
Keeping employees informed of business 
priorities and changes remains a key focus 
within AVEVA. As a global organisation, 
it is important that everyone feels part 
of AVEVA and that we share information 
across all teams and regions. Regular 
internal communication campaigns help 
to achieve this – through people stories, 
successes and competitions, our aim is to 
be inclusive and to celebrate our diversity.
Engagement levels remain high and we 
use feedback from our Global Ambassador 
Network to continue to improve and 
develop information that both informs 
and motivates our employees.
Learning and Development
Our well established learning and 
development programmes continue 
to provide a range of opportunities for 
our current employees. This includes 
on-line language studies, technical 
development and management 
& leadership programmes.
To support our ambition to attract and 
nurture young, talented people we 
continue, through our apprenticeship 
schemes, work experience and as 
members of specific science and 
engineering groups, to encourage young 
people to start their careers with us. 
Last year we saw:
 – 2,166 hours of technical training 
(PluraSight) completed
 – 2,671 hours of classroom training
 – 44 colleagues completing Management 
Development
 – 254 hours of AVEVA eLearning 
completed
AVEVA in the community 
We are proud of our AVEVA 
colleagues who continue to 
support many local, national 
and international charities. We match 
the funding raised by employees who 
have participated in various events, 
such as marathons, charity auctions, 
events, and fun runs. This year AVEVA 
has matched a total of £59,473 to 
support local communities.
One of the many fine examples of the 
fantastic support that our teams have 
given during the course of the year comes 
from our team in Japan, who wanted to 
provide support to the growing number 
of refugees who find themselves in 
difficult situations. The team took part 
in a charity initiative to donate their 
used clothes to help raise funds through 
a Japanese clothing retail chain.
The chain have been donating clothing 
to many vulnerable groups in the region: 
evacuees, victims of disaster, expectant 
and nursing mothers, as well as others 
in need across the globe. The team 
collected a vast amount of clothing and 
are looking to continue to support this 
charity in such a simple but effective way 
to make a difference to people’s lives.

Carbon emissions
AVEVA is committed to minimising its 
carbon emissions, increasing the use of 
recycling opportunities and reducing the 
use of valuable natural resources. We are 
continually improving the way in which we 
capture and record our emissions data. 
For the purposed of this report, the 
emissions have been calculated according 
to the ‘Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines: Including mandatory 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting 
guidance’ issued by the Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA), and by applying DEFRA’s 
Conversion Factors. We have aimed for 
the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions to 
be captured for all of our UK and overseas 
offices between April 2015 and March 2016.
On the rare occasion that the information 
was not available for a particular AVEVA 
office, an estimate has been produced 
based on the ratio between the local office 
size, and our UK offices, which we believe 
offers the best available comparison.
The 2014 financial year serves as the 
baseline for our targets. For our carbon 
intensity ratio we have measured our 
carbon usage as it relates to our business 
performance, citing tonnes of CO
2
e/£ 
million of revenue. In 2016 this intensity 
ratio increased to 13.80 tonnes CO
2
e/£ 
million (2015 – 10.36). This increase reflects 
the growth of our overall headcount and 
hence a larger overall carbon footprint, 
rather than any particular inefficiencies 
arising during the course of the year.

Introduction
I am pleased to introduce the 2016 
Corporate Governance statement. The 
Company is committed to the principles 
of Corporate Governance contained in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code provided 
by the Financial Reporting Council and 
for which the Board is accountable 
to shareholders. The Company has 
complied with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code throughout 
the year and to the date of this report. 
Further explanation of how the principles 
have been applied is set out below 
and, in connection with Directors’ 
remuneration, in the Remuneration 
Committee report on pages 49 to 63.
Composition of the Board
Throughout the year the Board 
comprised the Chairman, three Non-
Executive Directors (including the Senior 
Independent Director) and two Executive 
Directors (being the Chief Executive 
and the Chief Financial Officer). 
Brief biographical details of all Board 
members are set out on pages 44 
and 45. The membership of all Board 
Committees is set out on page 42.
Board changes
The Nominations Committee has 
responsibility for Board and committee 
composition, particularly in relation to 
the diversity of background, skills and 
experience. The committee oversees the 
nomination, selection and appointment 
of Non-Executive and Executive Directors 
and monitors succession planning for 
Board and senior management roles.
The Chairman of the Nominations 
Committee and the remainder of the 
Board considered the independence of 
Philip Dayer and Jonathan Brooks now 
that both are in their third term of office. 
It was concluded that both remained 
independent and continued to contribute 
to the operation of the Board. Jonathan 
Brooks will stand for re-election to the 
Board at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) on the basis that he will resign from 
the Board in November 2016. The intent 
would be to allow a transition to a newly 
appointed Non-Executive Director during 
this time frame. Philip Dayer will not stand 
for re-election at the 2017 AGM. On this 
basis, and after considering a number of 
search firms, the Chairman has retained 
Spencer Stuart to find two new NEDs 
over the next 12-18 months. The first 
search to replace Jonathan Brooks is well 
advanced with a long list of candidates 
screened by the Chairman; shortlisted 
candidates have been interviewed by the 
Chairman and Audit Committee Chairman 
and, at the time of writing, the leading 
candidates are being interviewed by the 
Executive Directors. An appointment is 
expected to be made prior to the AGM.
Operation of the Board
The Chairman, along with the Executive 
Directors and Company Secretary, 
ensures that the Board functions 
effectively and has established Board 
processes designed to maximise its 
performance and effectiveness. Key 
aspects of these processes are:
 – The AVEVA Group Board meets 
regularly in combination with the 
Board of AVEVA Solutions Limited, the 
main operating company in the Group 
which owns all of the Group’s trading 
subsidiaries. The AVEVA Solutions 
Limited Board includes as members 
the Chief Technical Officer and Head of 
Solutions & Technology and the Chief 
Operations Officer as well as all the 
members of the Group Board.  
“2015/16 proved to be an 
eventful year for the Board 
with six months of 
discussions between 
AVEVA and Schneider 
Electric. Whilst ultimately 
no agreement was 
reached, the Board was 
involved closely with the 
transaction and discussed 
at length key elements of 
the proposed transaction 
and associated risks.”
Philip Aiken
Chairman

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
41
This ensures that the AVEVA 
Group Board is well informed 
on technical and market factors 
driving the Group’s performance 
as well as on financial outcomes.
 – The Board had seven scheduled 
meetings during the year. These 
meetings, together with any 
Committee meetings, are generally 
held at the Group’s Head Office in 
Cambridge or in our London office 
and are approximately one day in 
duration. In addition, nine unscheduled 
meetings of the Board took place 
predominantly to deal with matters 
arising related to the proposed 
transaction with Schneider Electric.
 – Each scheduled Board meeting has 
an over-arching theme. These include 
annual technology review, business 
plan/strategy day, succession planning, 
annual budget, presentations from 
Executive management and interim 
and final results.
 – The Board aims that Directors visit 
an AVEVA office outside the UK at 
least once per year and in September 
2015 the entire Board travelled to 
the Group’s office in Frankfurt and 
held a Board meeting, as well as 
meetings with staff and customers. 
In addition, in September 2015 one 
Non-Executive Director travelled to 
China to meet with management and 
staff in Shanghai to review operations.
 – In addition, the Board holds a full-day 
strategy meeting every year at which 
Executive Directors and members of 
the senior management team make 
presentations covering progress 
against current strategy and objectives 
and ideas for future investment. 
 – The Board delegates the day-to-
day responsibility for managing the 
Group to the Executive Directors. 
 – To enable the Board to discharge 
its duties, all Directors receive 
appropriate and timely information. 
Briefing papers are distributed by the 
Company Secretary to all Directors 
usually four working days in advance 
of Board and Committee meetings.
 – A monthly reporting pack containing 
management accounts with 
commentary and reports from 
each Executive is distributed to 
the Board on a monthly basis.

 – Meetings were held between the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors during the year, without the 
Executives being present, to discuss 
appropriate matters as necessary. 
 – The Chairman ensures that the 
Directors take independent professional 
advice where they judge it necessary 
to discharge their responsibilities as 
Directors at the Group’s expense. All 
members of the Board have access to 
the advice of the Company Secretary. 
 – Non-Executive Directors and 
Executive Directors are encouraged 
annually to undertake training in 
furtherance of their specific roles 
and general duties as a director.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders 
for the proper management of the 
Group. There is a formal schedule of 
matters specifically reserved for the 
Board’s decision that covers key areas 
of the Group’s affairs, which include:
 – overall responsibility for the strategy 
of the Group; 
 – corporate governance;
 – review of trading performance and 
forecasts;
 – risk management;
 – Board membership; 
 – communications with shareholders;
 – approval of major transactions, 
including mergers and acquisitions; and 
 – approval of the financial statements 
and annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors 
and segregation of duties
The Board has considered the 
independence of the Chairman and the 
Non-Executive Directors and believes 
that all are currently independent of 
management and free from any material 
business or other relationships that 
could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. 
Their biographies on pages 44 and 45 
demonstrate a range of experience and 
sufficient calibre to bring independent 
judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards 
of conduct which is vital to the Group.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive are distinct and the division of 
responsibility between these roles has 
been clearly established, set out in writing 
and agreed by the Board. The Chairman 
is responsible for the effectiveness of 
the Board and ensuring that it meets its 
obligations and responsibilities. The Chief 
Executive is responsible to the Board 
for the day-to-day management of the 
business, leadership of the executive team 
and execution of the Group’s strategic 
and operating plans. The Chairman and 
Chief Executive meet regularly to discuss 
any issues pertaining to the Company’s 
performance, reputation and organisation.
 
Committees of the Board
The Board has three committees: 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the duties of the 
committees are set out in formal terms 
of reference. They are available on 
request from the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours 
and are available on the Company’s 
website at www.aveva.com. 
Details of the main responsibilities and 
activities during the year of the Audit 
Committee are included on pages 
46 to 48 and for the Remuneration 
Committee on pages 49 to 63.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal and 
rigorous review of its performance and 
that of its committees and Directors each 
financial year. In 2014, an extensive review 
was externally facilitated by Armstrong 
Bonham Carter LLP, the independent 
board performance consultants. The most 
recent review carried out in March 2016 led 
by the Chairman and conducted following 
one-on-one interviews with each Director.
Overall, the review concluded that 
the Board and its committees had 
demonstrated a high degree of 
effectiveness. The Board is considered to 
be of the right size and has appropriate 
skills representation. The 2016 review 
identified three priorities in the form 
of the development of strategy, the 
monitoring of risks and succession 
planning which the Board is addressing.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal control and 
for monitoring its effectiveness. However, 
such a system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
and by its very nature can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The principal risks and uncertainties 
the Group faces are set out on pages 
34 and 35. There were no significant 
control failures during the year.
The Board has established a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks 
the Group faces. The Board regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls, which have been in 
place from the start of the year to the 
date of approval of this report, and 
believes that it is in accordance with 
the Internal Control: Revised Guidance 
for Directors on the Combined Code.
The key elements of the system of 
internal controls currently include:
 – each member of the Executive team 
has responsibility for specific aspects 
of the Group’s operations. They meet 
on a regular basis and are responsible 
for the operational strategy, reviewing 
operating results, identification and 
mitigation of risks and communication 
and application of the Group’s policies 
and procedures. Where appropriate, 
matters are reported to the Board;
 – regular reports to the Board 
from the Executive team on key 
developments, financial performance 
and operational issues in the business;
 – operational and financial controls 
and procedures which include 
authorisation limits for expenditure, 
sales contracts and capital expenditure, 
signing authorities, IT application 
controls, organisation structure, 
Group policies, segregation of duties 
and reviews by management; 
 – an annual budget process which 
is reviewed, monitored and 
approved by the Board;

 – regular meetings between the 
Executive team, sales area managers 
and line of business managers to 
discuss actual performance against 
forecast, budget and prior years. 
The operating results are reported 
on a monthly basis to the Board and 
compared to the budget and the 
latest forecast as appropriate;
 – targeted internal audit reviews and 
extended external audits which 
focus on confirming the operation 
of controls in key process areas; and
 – maintenance of insurance cover 
to insure all major risk areas of 
the Group based on the scale 
of the risk and availability of the 
cover in the external market.
The Board’s monitoring covers all material 
controls, including financial, non-financial, 
operational and compliance controls and 
risk management. It is based principally 
on reviewing reports from management 
to consider whether significant risks 
are identified, evaluated, managed and 
controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses are promptly remedied 
and indicate a need for more extensive 
monitoring. The Board periodically carries 
out visits to the Group’s subsidiaries 
and receives presentations from local 
management on their operations.
The Board has also performed a specific 
assessment for the purpose of this 
Annual Report. This involved reviewing 
the Group’s risk matrix that had been 
reviewed/updated by a newly formed Risk 
Committee, with representatives involved 
from the Executive team and senior 
managers. This assessment considered 
all significant aspects of internal control 
necessary for the Company to successfully 
carry out the key business strategies of 
the Group together with more generic 
inherent risks of the Group’s operations. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board 
in discharging its review responsibilities.
Indemnities to Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association, Directors are granted 
an indemnity from the Company to 
the extent permitted by law in respect 
of liabilities incurred as a result of the 
performance of their duties in their 
capacity as Directors to the Company. 
The indemnity would not provide any 
coverage to the extent the Director 
is proven to have acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly. The Company has 
maintained Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance cover throughout the year.
Policy on appointment and 
reappointment
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, all Directors are required 
to retire and submit themselves 
for re-election at least every three 
years by rotation and also following 
their appointment. In addition, as 
in the prior year and in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, all of the Board members are 
offering themselves for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
On appointment, all Directors are asked 
to confirm that they have sufficient time 
to devote to the role, which is confirmed 
together with details of their duties in 
the letter of appointment. All Directors 
undergo an induction as soon as practical 
following their appointment. As part of the 
induction process, Directors are provided 
with background information on the Group 
and attend the Group’s headquarters in 
Cambridge for meetings and presentations 
from senior management. In addition, 
where appropriate, meetings are also 
arranged with the Group’s advisers. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
for a term of three years. The terms 
and conditions of appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal 
business hours and will be available 
for inspection on the day of the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
Communication with shareholders is 
given high priority by the Board. The Chief 
Executive, Chief Financial Officer and 
Head of Investor Relations have meetings 
with representatives of institutional 
shareholders and hold analyst briefings 
at least twice a year, following the 
announcement of the interim and full year 
results, but also at other times during the 
year as necessary. Senior managers from 
Product Development, Business Strategy 
and Finance also attended analyst and 
shareholder meetings during the year. All 
of these meetings seek to build a mutual 
understanding of objectives with major 
shareholders by discussing long-term 
strategy and obtaining feedback. The 
Board also receives formal feedback from 
analysts and institutional shareholders 
through the Company’s financial PR 
adviser and financial advisers. The Board 
is appraised of discussions with major 
shareholders to ensure that Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors consider 
any matter raised by shareholders and 
to enable all Directors to understand 
shareholder views. In addition, when 
necessary, the Group consults with 
shareholders in respect of proposals for 
the remuneration of Executive Directors. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, Philip Dayer, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which 
contact through the normal channels 
of Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief 
Financial Officer has failed to resolve or 
if such contact would be inappropriate. 
The Chairman, Senior Independent and 
Non-Executive Directors are available for 
dialogue with shareholders at any time and 
attend (together with the other members 
of the Board) the Annual General Meeting, 
but are not routinely involved in investor 
relations or shareholder communications. 
Corporate information is also available on 
the Company’s website, www.aveva.com.
Constructive use of the Annual 
General Meeting
The Board seeks to use the Annual General 
Meeting to communicate with investors 
and all shareholders are encouraged to 
participate. The Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and the Nominations 
Committees will be available at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer any questions. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Audit Committee report
THE BOARD PLACES A VERY HIGH PRIORITY ON THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, 
THE QUALITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF ITS FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AVEVA’S RISK 
MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS. THE 
AUDIT COMMITTEE ASSISTS THE BOARD IN ITS OVERSIGHT 
AND GOVERNANCE OF THESE CRITICAL AREAS 
“After nine years on the 
Board, I will be resigning 
this year. I will stay until 
November to effect 
a smooth handover 
to the new Audit 
Committee Chair.”
Jonathan Brooks
Audit Committee Chairman
24 May 2016
Having joined the Board in the summer 
of 2007, this will be my ninth and final 
report as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
At the time of writing we are in the 
final stages of appointing a new Audit 
Committee Chair and in order to ensure 
a period of continuity and handover, 
I have agreed to continue to chair the 
committee until the publication of the 
interim results in November 2016 at 
which point I intend to resign from both 
the Audit Committee and the Board.
Audit Committee terms of reference
The Audit Committee monitors the 
integrity of the financial statements of 
the Group and the committee members 
(as part of the full Board) review all 
proposed announcements to be made 
by the Group and consideration is given 
to any significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them. 
The committee considers the 
effectiveness of financial reporting 
and internal controls, compliance 
with legal requirements, accounting 
standards and the Listing, Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority and also reviews any 
proposed change in accounting policies 
and any recommendations from the 
Group’s auditor regarding improvements 
to internal controls and the adequacy 
of resources within the Group’s finance 
function. The committee also assesses 
the process that has been established 
to ensure that the Annual Report is 
fair, balanced and understandable, 
reporting to the Board on their findings.
A full copy of the committee’s Terms 
of Reference, is available from the 
Company’s website at www.aveva.com. 
Committee membership
During the financial year, the committee 
comprised three independent Non-
Executive Directors. As Chairman of the 
committee, I was deemed by the Board 
to have recent and relevant financial 
experience. I am a Fellow of the Chartered 
Institute of Management Accountants and 
I have held a number of senior financial 
positions in my career, the most relevant 
of which being the Chief Financial Officer 
of ARM Holdings plc between 1995 and 
2002. ARM is a major global technology 
company as well as having a similar 
software licensing business model to 
AVEVA. Philip Dayer and Jennifer Allerton 
made up the other two members of the 
Audit Committee. Brief biographical details 
for all the members of the committee 
are included on pages 44 and 45.
Information flows to the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least 
four times per annum. The Company 
Chairman and CFO are invited to attend 
all meetings. The external auditor and 
the Group’s Head of Finance are also 
invited to attend. Members of senior 
management are invited from time to 
time to make presentations such as the 
committee’s agenda necessitates. 
The committee meets quarterly with 
the auditor without any members 
of the executive management team 
being present. I also meet with the 
external auditor from time to time 
away from the Company’s offices.
Risk and internal controls
The key elements of the Group’s internal 
control framework and procedures 
are set out on page 48. The principal 
risks the Group faces are set out on 
pages 34 and 35. Annually, the Audit 
Committee considers the Group risk 
register and related management 
controls. Throughout the process, 
the Board or the Audit Committee:
 – Gives consideration to whether areas 
should be looked at more closely 
through specific control reviews;
 – Identifies areas where enhancement 
of internal controls is required; and
 – Agrees action plans to deliver 
the necessary or recommended 
enhancements. STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Overview of the year’s activities
In addition to its prescribed duties the Audit Committee undertook several additional projects during the year. 
Topic Activity in the year
Proposed AVEVA-Schneider 
Electric transaction
The committee spent considerable time on various aspects of the proposed AVEVA-
Schneider transaction. There were a number of items which had to be addressed during 
the year, including resolving potential differences in accounting policies between the two 
companies, particularly those concerning revenue recognition, as well as assessing the 
impact of the complex structuring of the proposed transaction on goodwill and intangible 
assets. In addition, all adviser fees had to be approved by the committee. 
Revenue recognition The committee received regular updates from management as to its consideration 
of implications of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition – IFRS 15. The 
Company is currently targeting to be ‘IFRS 15 ready’ by 1 April 2017 and to this end, 
management’s conclusions from a preliminary impact assessment were presented to the 
committee in March 2016. 
Viability statement and establishment  
of a risk committee
The committee reviewed the work done to justify the proposed period for the new 
viability statement to be included in the 2016 Annual Report, deciding that a three-year 
viability period was the most appropriate given this is the Group’s usual business planning 
horizon and also given the fast-changing nature of the software industry. In light of the 
recent changes in corporate governance to enhance the overall level of Risk Reporting, 
the committee also established a separate risk committee, comprising staff from each 
business function, chaired by the Executive Vice President of Regional Operations and 
tasked with the ongoing review and identification of risks faced by the Group prior to 
periodic reviews first by the Audit Committee and subsequently by the main Board.
Risks and internal controls In May 2015, the committee received a report covering management’s annual cyber-
security review and following this, cyber-security was discussed at two out of the three 
subsequent meetings held, reflecting its growing significance as a risk. Separately, a 
series of simulated phishing attacks were conducted during the year, targeted at different 
users and functions within the Company, from which many useful lessons were learned.
In March 2016, the committee received, reviewed and discussed the findings of the 
extended external audit procedures conducted in India, which also included a visit to the 
Group’s Indian offices by the Group’s Head of Finance and the external Audit Partner. 
Generally controls were considered to be good with only some minor opportunities for 
improvement in credit control being identified.
In March 2016, management presented a Group taxation update and assessment of 
current risks for the Group, particularly in India, as well as its annual treasury review.
External audit The committee’s intention had been to conduct an audit tender in the summer of 2015 
but this became impracticable due to the talks with Schneider Electric. Initially the 
intention was to defer the tender process to the autumn of 2015 but it quickly became 
clear this was not possible. The tender process will now be conducted in 2016/17, 
following the appointment of the new Audit Committee Chair.
Assessment of AVEVA E3D pricing The committee conducted a review of the pricing discipline and penetration of AVEVA 
E3D since its launch in April 2013. The review established that the licensing of AVEVA E3D 
had resulted in an overall price uplift of the order of 15% when compared to the previous 
PDMS licences, with little evidence of discounting outside of agreed parameters. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

There is a formal whistle-blowing 
policy which has been communicated 
to employees. This policy provides 
information on the process to follow 
in the event that any employee feels 
it is appropriate to make a disclosure. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the process is effective and reviews 
key issues which are reported.
Key estimates and judgments
The Audit Committee discusses with 
management and the auditor the approach 
that has been taken in assessing all 
key estimates. These include revenue 
recognition, provisions for impairment 
of receivables, the valuation of 
retirement benefit obligations and the 
uncertainty of tax treatments in certain 
jurisdictions. Annually, the committee 
considers the going concern principle 
upon which the financial statements 
are prepared and this year for the first 
time the committee considered the 
Group’s viability statement disclosures. 
Internal audit
The Group does not maintain a separate 
internal audit function, however during 
the past year a new role within the 
Group’s finance function was created 
with approximately one half of this role 
being dedicated to internal audit activities 
and to the monitoring of risk and internal 
controls. The holder of this new role 
undertook the AVEVA E3D review that 
was conducted during the year, which the 
committee found valuable and insightful. 
The Group’s operations are geographically 
widely spread which means that in 
many instances where assurance over 
the operation of internal control is 
considered valuable, there is a clear 
advantage in such reviews of controls 
being undertaken by teams with specific 
local regulatory knowledge and without 
any local language barrier. Further, the 
committee believes that such instances 
favour the provision of assurance from 
external sources, which is considered 
to be both more efficient and effective 
than having its own central internal audit 
team. However, the Audit Committee 
does review the need to have its own 
separate internal audit function each year.
The Audit Committee has developed 
a framework to gain assurance over 
the system of internal financial and 
operational controls. This comprises: 
 – A risk assessment performed by 
operational management and the Board 
to identify key areas for assurance. 
 – Peer and head office reviews of key 
risk areas of financial internal control, 
although it should be noted that 
the enormous volume of additional 
accounting and due diligence work 
done on the proposed AVEVA-
Schneider transaction effectively 
curtailed any new projects in this area.
 – The use of qualified third parties 
to undertake specialist reviews 
in more technical areas. During 
2015/16 third-party technical 
reviews were undertaken on tax 
risks in India and cyber-security.
 – An extension of the external auditors 
work in certain areas and geographies 
to cover other key financial risks, such 
as operations in fast growth areas 
as well as new taxation risks arising 
from trading in emerging markets. 
During 2015/16 extended external 
audit procedures were undertaken 
in India, following similar exercises in 
recent years in France, Japan, Brazil, 
South Korea, China and Russia. 
 – An annual assessment by the 
Audit Committee of the whole 
system of internal financial 
and operational controls. 
External audit
The Audit Committee advises the Board 
on the appointment of the external auditor 
and on its remuneration both for audit 
and non-audit work and discusses the 
nature, scope and results of the audit 
with the external auditor. The committee 
keeps under review the cost effectiveness 
and the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor. Controls in place to 
ensure this include: strict controls over 
the extent and nature of non-audit work 
performed by the auditor; semi-annual 
review of audit independence by the 
committee; and an annual assessment of 
the quality of the audit service. An analysis 
of audit and non-audit fees is provided 
in note 6 to the financial statements.
The Audit Committee monitors fees paid 
to the auditor for non-audit work and 
delegates the authority for approval of 
such work to the Chief Financial Officer 
where the level of fees involved are 
insignificant. During the year the auditor 
did perform permitted non-audit work 
which mainly consisted of transaction 
support services, tax compliance work 
for subsidiaries of the Group and some 
other statutory filing work. In light of 
expected regulation and developing 
practice, the Audit Committee considers 
that any permitted non-audit work should 
not exceed 70% of the audit fee, except 
with the possible exception of reporting 
accountants’ work, which would have to 
be approved by the committee – as do 
any projects over £50,000. The Group 
engages other independent firms of 
accountants to perform tax consulting 
work and other consulting engagements 
to ensure that the independence of 
the auditor is not compromised. 
Audit partners are rotated every five years 
and a formal statement of independence 
is received from the auditor each year. 
The Board and the Audit Committee 
are satisfied that the independence of 
the auditor has been maintained. The 
current audit partner, Marcus Butler, will 
complete his first year with the Group 
this year, having taken over from Bob 
Forsyth who stepped down in 2015 
following completion of his fifth year.
At the May 2016 meeting, the committee 
assessed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor. This assessment was based 
upon feedback from key members of the 
Group’s finance team as well as from the 
Audit Committee members. The overall 
conclusion was that while the audit 
process was effective, some areas of 
potential improvement were identified. 
Every second year a more detailed exercise 
is conducted across key units of the Group.
Audit planning and main audit issues
At the November 2015 meeting of the 
committee the auditor presented their 
audit plan for 2015/16. This included a 
summary of the proposed audit scopes 
for the year for each of the Group’s 
subsidiaries and a summary of what 
the auditor considered to be the most 
significant financial reporting risks 
facing the Group together with the 
auditor’s proposed audit approach to 
these significant risk areas. The main 
areas of audit focus for the year were 
the significant judgements surrounding 
revenue recognition and the auditor 
extended the scope of its analysis 
while also bringing more of the smaller 
entities in the Group into a ‘full scope’ 
audit. The Audit Committee was in 
agreement with both enhancements.

Remuneration Committee report
THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS THAT THE EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS HAVE CONTINUED TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS 
WELL WITH COMMITMENT AND LEADERSHIP THROUGH 
A CHALLENGING PERIOD
“I am pleased to present this 
year’s Report on Directors’  
Remuneration.”
Philip Dayer
Remuneration Committee Chairman
24 May 2016
Remuneration review
The Remuneration Committee believes 
that the remuneration arrangements 
voted on and agreed in 2014 continue 
to align Executive Directors with the 
delivery of the long-term strategy and 
creation of shareholder value while 
rewarding Executives fairly if success is 
achieved. Overall, the committee has 
decided this year not to make any changes 
to the principles of the Remuneration 
Policy approved at the 2014 AGM and 
the policy will continue to be operated 
as set out in the 2013/14 Remuneration 
Committee report. However, during the 
course of the year the committee will 
review the current policy in readiness 
for the submission to shareholders of a 
new policy at the 2017 AGM (the current 
policy by then having come to the end 
of its three-year life). To the extent that 
material changes to the existing policy are 
considered appropriate, we will consult 
with the Company’s major shareholders.
As previously highlighted, the business 
has faced a number of headwinds during 
2015/16, particularly in its end markets of 
Oil & Gas and Shipbuilding and in some of 
the countries where AVEVA has previously 
seen good growth such as China, Brazil 
and South Korea. This has been coupled 
with Sterling generally remaining strong 
against the Euro and other currencies 
in which the business trades. Despite 
these challenges, the business has 
remained resilient and is well positioned 
for when its end markets recover.
The committee considers that the 
Executive Directors have continued 
to manage the business well with 
commitment and leadership through 
a challenging period. The Executive 
Management team has carefully balanced 
the requirements to continue to invest 
in the future growth of the business 
through Research & Development and 
other initiatives whilst at the same time 
ensuring the cost base is appropriate 
given the challenging conditions.
Against this backdrop the committee 
has concluded the following in terms of 
the operation of the policy for 2016/17:
Base salary – to be increased in line with 
UK employees
The committee considers it appropriate 
to increase the salaries of the Executive 
Directors by 2 per cent, in line with the 
other UK employees, with effect from 
1 April 2016. The following table sets 
out the proposed increases in salary:
With effect from CEO CFO
1 April 2015 £485,000 £300,000 
1 April 2016 £495,000 £306,000 
Increase c. 2.1% c. 2.0%
Annual incentive arrangements – 
no changes proposed
There are no changes proposed to 
alter the quantum or principles of the 
current annual incentive scheme.
In line with last year, the annual 
incentive scheme will predominantly 
be based on stretching Group adjusted 
profit before tax (PBT) targets.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP) – change 
proposed to performance targets
The committee reviewed again the 
appropriateness of a single vesting 
performance metric for the LTIP and 
concluded Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
continued to be the most appropriate 
measure linked to delivering the 
Company’s strategy. Accordingly, the 
committee has agreed that awards to 
be granted under the LTIP in 2016 will 
continue to be based solely on EPS 
performance and that there will be no 
change to the quantum of the awards. 
The committee will, however, continue 
to assess regularly the suitability of the 
vesting performance metrics of the LTIP. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016
50
As noted above, AVEVA has faced 
challenging market conditions over 
the last two years, which are expected 
to continue until there is a prolonged 
recovery in the Oil & Gas industry. 
The impact of those challenges has 
been evident in the low proportions 
of vesting of recent LTIP awards, with 
0% having vested in 2015 and 2016. 
The slowdown in demand in the Oil & 
Gas industry has been reflected in the 
Group’s three-year business plan, and 
whilst it still remains a challenging plan 
to deliver, unsurprisingly the growth 
potential has been scaled back to reflect 
the market conditions. As a result, and 
having consulted with the Company’s 
major shareholders, the committee has 
decided to adjust the EPS performance 
targets that will apply to the 2016/17 grant 
to bring them into line with the Group’s 
business plan. Furthermore, given the 
unpredictability of when the Group’s end 
markets will recover, the committee has 
also decided to widen the range to take 
account of the potential volatility. Whilst 
reduced in absolute terms, these targets 
remain relatively tough compared with 
similar targets within the FTSE 250.
The committee believes that the 
annual review is consistent with the 
approved Remuneration Policy and 
consistent with our ethos of rewarding 
the Executive Directors and in the 
interests of the shareholders. 
2015/16 Out-turns
Primarily as a result of continued 
stagnation of oil prices, trading conditions 
in the upstream Oil & Gas markets in 
which the Company operates have 
continued to be difficult for the Group. 
This, together with a strong foreign 
currency headwind, led to performance in 
2015/16 being below the target set. Total 
revenue for the year was £201.5 million 
which was down 3% compared to 2014/15. 
Adjusted profit before tax for the year 
ended 31 March 2016 was £51.2 million 
(2015 – £62.1 million), a decrease of 18%.
 
In this context, the Committee 
determined that none of the financial 
element of the annual incentive award 
will be paid as targets were not met. 
The Remuneration Committee have 
decided that the individual performance 
element of the annual incentive (10% 
of the core award) will pay out in full.

Remuneration reporting
The Directors’ remuneration policy, which 
was approved by the shareholders with 
votes in favour of 97.31%, will continue to 
apply for three years from the 2014 AGM 
until 2017 and is available to view on the 
Company website, www.aveva.com.
The annual report on remuneration, 
which sets out payments and awards 
made to the Directors and explains the 
linkage between the Group’s performance 
and remuneration in respect of the 
2015/16 financial year, is set out below. 
Agenda for 2016/17
The committee will continue to 
keep the structure and details of our 
remuneration arrangements under 
review and, in particular and as noted 
above, will conduct a full review of 
the current policy in advance of its 
formal renewal at the 2017 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee
The Board sets the remuneration policy 
for the Group. The Remuneration 
Committee makes recommendations 
to the Board within its agreed terms 
of reference, details of which are 
available at www.aveva.com. 
The Remuneration Committee’s 
principal responsibility is to determine 
the remuneration package of both the 
Company’s Executive Directors and 
its senior management within broad 
policies agreed with the Board. 
When reviewing and setting remuneration 
policy the committee considered a range 
of factors including the Company’s 
strategy and circumstances, the 
prevailing economic environment and 
the evolving landscape in best practice 
guidelines to ensure that it remains 
appropriate. In addition, it reviews the 
remuneration policy for the Company as 
a whole and oversees and approves the 
Company’s share incentive plans for all 
participants. The remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors is determined 
by the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman, rather than the committee.
The conclusions and recommendations 
of the Remuneration Committee were 
finalised in four formal meetings during 
the year, and these were preceded by 
several informal discussions, including 
some with advisers (none of whom had 
any other connection with the Company). 
The members of the committee 
during 2015/16 were Philip Dayer 
(Chairman), Philip Aiken, Jonathan 
Brooks and Jennifer Allerton.
The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) 
is invited to submit recommendations 
to the Remuneration Committee and 
to attend meetings when appropriate. 
He was not present when his own 
remuneration was discussed.
The committee has access to external 
advisers as required. During the year 
the Committee received advice from 
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (FIT). 
Previously the committee received 
advice from Deloitte LLP but during the 
year and following a review of other 
providers, the committee appointed FIT 
as its remuneration adviser. FIT adheres 
to the Remuneration Consultants 
Code of Conduct in its dealings with 
the committee. The committee is 
satisfied that the advice provided by 
FIT is independent. The fees paid to 
FIT were calculated based on time 
spent and expenses incurred for the 
majority of advice provided but on 
occasion for specific projects a fixed 
fee may be agreed. In 2015/16, FIT 
received fees of £24,500 in relation to 
advice provided to the committee.  STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The committee is appreciative of the significant shareholder support that it received in respect of the Director Remuneration Policy and 
Annual Report and the Remuneration Committee circulated the principal shareholders with information in respect of the 2016 
remuneration review ahead of this published report.
The Directors’ remuneration 
policy
Set out overleaf is a copy of the policy 
table from the Directors’ remuneration 
policy (the Policy), which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, held 
on 14 July 2014. To provide consistency 
with the remainder of the report, 
Executive Director salaries, Non-
Executive Director fees and scenario 
charts showing the operation of the 
policy have been updated for 2016/17. 
We highly value shareholders’ comments 
on and overwhelming support for 
our Remuneration Policy. This was 
demonstrated at the 2014 AGM where the 
resolution to approve our Remuneration 
Policy received 97.31% of votes cast 
in favour. It is our belief that it is the 
preference of shareholders that we 
should not make frequent changes to the 
Remuneration Policy and we will propose 
changes only if we believe that they 
would lead to a better alignment between 
pay, strategy and long-term business 
performance (until such time as the Policy 
requires renewal, as will be the case at the 
2017 AGM). The only substantive change 
to how the current Policy will be operated 
in 2016/17 is the adjustments to the EPS 
targets in relation to the forthcoming 
LTIP awards as referred to on page 49.
Full details of the Directors’ remuneration 
policy, as approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM, can be found on 
our website www.aveva.com.
AVEVA’s Executive remuneration 
philosophy 
The Remuneration Committee aims to 
ensure that: the Executive Directors are 
provided with appropriate incentives 
to align them with the achievement 
of the Company’s strategy and the 
future creation of shareholder value; 
enhanced performance is encouraged; 
and, the Executive Directors are, in a 
fair and responsible manner, rewarded 
for their individual contributions 
to the success of the Group.
It also aims for a combination of fixed 
and variable payments, benefits and 
share-based awards that will achieve 
a balance in incentives to deliver short 
and long-term goals. The Company’s 
policy is that a substantial proportion 
of remuneration of Executive Directors 
should be performance related and 
should be delivered in shares to create 
alignment with shareholders’ interests. 
Remuneration for Executive Directors 
is set in the context of the economic 
environment in which the Group 
operates, the outcome of the wider 
pay review for all Group employees as 
well as the financial performance of the 
Group. When determining remuneration 
arrangements, the committee takes into 
consideration relevant external market 
data as well as the remuneration for 
employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration commitments made 
which were consistent with the 
approved remuneration policy in 
force at that time shall be honoured, 
even if they would not otherwise be 
consistent with the policy prevailing 
when the commitment is fulfilled. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Base salary
 – Helps recruit and 
retain employees.
 – Reflects experience 
and role.
 – Base salary is normally reviewed 
annually with changes effective from 
1 April, although salaries may be 
reviewed more frequently or at different 
times of the year if the Committee 
determines this is appropriate.
 – The Committee determines base 
salary taking into account factors 
including, but not limited to:
 – The individual’s role, experience 
and performance in achieving 
financial and non-financial goals 
within his areas of responsibility.
 – Salaries at other companies of a 
similar size and complexity as well 
as global technology peers.
 – Remuneration of different groups of 
employees within the Company.
 – Total organisational salary budgets.
 – Paid in cash.
 – In determining salary increases the 
Committee generally considers the factors 
outlined in the ‘operation’ column. 
 – While there is no maximum salary 
level, salary increases will normally 
be in-line with the range of increases 
in the broader workforce salary. 
 – The Committee retains the discretion 
to make increases above this 
level in certain circumstances, for 
example, but not limited to:
 – an increase in the individual’s 
scope of responsibilities; 
 – in the case of new Executive 
Directors who are positioned on 
a lower initial salary while they 
gain experience in the role; or
 – where the Committee considers 
that salary is behind appropriate 
market positioning for a company 
of AVEVA’s size and complexity.

Pensions
Provides a competitive 
retirement benefit in a 
way that is cost 
effective to the 
Company.
CEO
 – The CEO, Richard Longdon, participated 
in the CadCentre Pension Scheme, a 
defined benefit pension scheme, until 
2010 when he accrued the maximum 
benefits that he is entitled to under the 
scheme. The plan is a contributory, funded, 
occupational scheme registered with 
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and, 
since 1 October 2004, Career Average 
Revalued Earning benefits apply.
 – Mr Longdon is now a deferred member 
of the scheme and is no longer 
accruing any further benefits.
CFO
 – The CFO is a member of the AVEVA 
Group Personal Pension Plan (a 
defined contribution scheme).
New appointment
 – The intention is that new appointments to 
the Board would participate in the AVEVA 
Group Personal Pension Plan or receive 
an equivalent cash payment. However, 
if appropriate the Committee may 
determine that alternative arrangements 
for the provision of retirement benefit 
may apply. When determining pension 
arrangements for new appointments 
the Board will give regard to the cost 
of the arrangements, market practice 
and the pension arrangements 
received elsewhere in the Group.
CEO
 – The current CEO is entitled to a pension 
on normal retirement, or on retirement 
due to ill health, equivalent to two-thirds 
of his pensionable salary provided he has 
completed (or would have completed in 
the case of ill health) 25 years’ service. 
 – A lower pension is payable on earlier 
retirement after the age of 55 by 
agreement with the Company and 
subject to HMRC guidelines. 
 – Pensions are payable to dependants on the 
Director’s death in retirement and a lump 
sum is payable if death occurs in service.
CFO
 – The Company currently contributes 
10% of base salary to the plan.

Benefits
 – Help recruit and

 – Provide a 
competitive range of 
valued benefits
 – Assist toward early 
return to work in the 
event of illness or 
injury
 – The benefit policy is to provide an 
appropriate level of benefit taking into 
account market practice at similar sized 
companies and the level of benefits 
provided for other employees in the Group.
 – In line with benefits provided for 
other senior employees in the Group, 
Executive Directors currently receive 
a mobility allowance or company car, 
a fuel allowance and a £500 annual 
allowance toward a range of benefits.
 – In the event that an Executive 
Director was required to re-locate to 
undertake their role, the Committee 
may provide additional benefits to 
reflect the relevant circumstances 
(on a one-off or ongoing basis).
 – Benefits are reviewed by the Committee 
in the context of market practice from 
time to time and the Committee may 
introduce or remove particular benefits 
if it is considered appropriate to do so. 
 – If the Company were to operate an 
all-employee share plan in the future, 
Executive Directors would be entitled 
to participate in the plan on the 
same terms as other employees.
 – The cost of benefit provision will 
depend on the cost to the Company 
of providing individual items and 
the individual’s circumstances and 
therefore there is no maximum value.
None
Annual Incentive Scheme & Deferred Share Scheme
 – Incentivises and 
rewards the 
achievement of 
annual financial and 
strategic business 
targets and delivery 
of personal 
objectives.
 – Deferred element 
encourages 
long-term 
shareholding, helps 
retention and 
discourages 
excessive risk taking.
 – The Committee determines an individual’s 
maximum incentive opportunity taking into 
account the responsibilities of the role and 
market practice at comparable companies. 
 – Performance targets are set by the 
Committee on an annual basis.
 – The Committee determines the level 
of bonus paid taking into account 
performance against targets, the 
underlying performance of the 
business and Executive Directors’ 
performance during the year.
 – The annual bonus is generally paid in 
a mix of cash and deferred shares.
 – For the core award, at 100% achievement 
of bonus performance targets, 60% of 
the bonus amount is payable in cash and 
the balance, 40%, is used to calculate 
the number of deferred shares. If the 
bonus amount is less than or equal to 
70% of the potential maximum bonus, 
then 75% of the total bonus is paid in 
cash and 25% is deferred into shares. If 
the bonus amount is between 70% and 
100% of the potential maximum then 
the proportion paid in deferred shares 
is determined by linear interpolation 
between 25% and 40%. The Committee 
may determine that a different balance of 
cash and deferred shares should apply.
 – The whole outperformance award would 
normally be delivered in deferred shares.
 – Further details of how the deferred 
share element operates are included 
as a footnote to this table.
 – The maximum bonus opportunity 
is 125% of base salary (core award 
of 100% of salary, outperformance 
award of 25% of base salary).
Core Award
 – The core bonus award is 
based on a mix of financial 
and individual objectives. 
For 2015/16, 90% of the 
bonus is based on financial 
measures with 10% based 
on individual measures 
agreed by the Committee 
at the start of the year. The 
Committee reserves the right 
to vary these proportions for 
future years. However, in any 
year, financial performance 
will always account for at 
least 70% of the bonus.
 – For the financial performance 
element, up to 10% of 
the bonus can be earned 
based on interim financial 
performance. Other than for 
this element performance is 
assessed over a financial year.
 – The core award starts 
being earned for entry level 
performance from 0% of 
salary and accrues linearly 
up to 100% for achievement 
of stretch target. Around 
50% of the core award bonus 
is paid if target levels of 
performance are achieved. 
Outperformance award
 – The outperformance 
award is based on financial 
performance over the financial 
year and is only delivered 
for the over-achievement 
of stretch targets. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

granted in the form of conditional awards 
or nominal cost options or phantom 
options which will be settled in cash.
 – The Committee determines targets 
each year to ensure that targets are 
stretching and represent value creation 
for shareholders while remaining 
motivational for management. 
 – The Committee shall determine the 
extent to which the awards will vest 
based on performance against targets 
and taking into consideration the 
wider performance of the Group. 
 – Awards are subject to malus 
and clawback provisions.
 – The maximum limit under the plan 
rules is 250% of base salary. 
 – The current intention is that 
awards will be limited to:
 – 150% of base salary for the CEO
 – 120% of base salary for the CFO
 – The intention is the maximum award 
will only be awarded in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. recruitment).
 – The Committee retains the discretion 
to grant awards up to the maximum 
limit under the plan rules. The 
Committee’s intention would be to 
consult with shareholders in the event 
that awards were to be increased. 
 – Awards vest based 
on earnings per share 
performance.
 – The Committee retains 
the discretion to introduce 
alternative or additional 
performance measures 
if it considers that these 
would be better aligned with 
strategy and incentivise 
Executive Directors to deliver 
long-term shareholder 
value. However, in any, 
year financial performance 
will always account for at 
least 75% of an award.
 – For threshold levels of 
performance, 25% of the 
award vests, increasing 
to 100% of the award for 
maximum performance. 
There is straight-line vesting of 
awards between these points.
Policy table footnotes
 – The deferred share element for both the core and outperformance annual incentive will be structured as a nil-cost option. 
 – Deferred awards will normally deliver the shares to participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the three years following 
the year in which an award is granted. The committee has discretion to determine an alternative vesting profile.
 – Awards granted from 2012 onwards under the LTIP and the deferred share scheme are subject to malus and clawback provisions. 
Those provisions may apply at the discretion of the committee if accounts are corrected or published that indicate the relevant 
performance was materially worse than in the accounts used to assess vesting.
 – Other elements of remuneration are not subject to malus or clawback.
 – The committee may operate the 2014 LTIP and the deferred share scheme in accordance with its terms. This includes amending the 
scheme and the terms of awards (including adjustments to take account of any variation of capital, demerger or special dividend). STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Legacy plans
Up to 2013, the Company’s long-term incentive arrangement was the AVEVA Group Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted with shareholder 
approval in 2004 (2004 LTIP). Awards under the plans were granted in the form of nominal priced options and vest based on the 
achievement of EPS performance over a three-year period. No holding periods apply. At the 2007 AGM, shareholders approved the 
Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 (2007 ESOS). No grants have been made under the scheme. The committee may operate the 2004 
LTIP and 2007 ESOS in accordance with its terms. This includes amending the scheme and the terms of awards or performance 
conditions (including adjustments to take account of any variation of capital, demerger or special dividend).
Committee discretion
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including the exercise of any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above 
where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not 
a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a 
director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ include the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award 
over shares is ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
The committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. 
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The remuneration package at AVEVA is structured so that the majority of the package is related to the delivery of performance over the 
short and long-term to ensure that reward is aligned with shareholder value creation. 
The charts below show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed performance 
scenarios:
CEO CFO
Maximum award opportunities % of salary Annual Incentive Scheme 125% 125%
LTIP 150% 120%
Minimum  – No annual incentive pay-out 
 – No vesting under the LTIP
Mid performance – 60% of salary pays out under the annual incentive (48% of maximum); 10% for the half 
year, 10% personal objectives and half of the 80% for full year targets 
 – 0–50% of maximum vesting under the LTIP 
Maximum performance – 100% of maximum annual incentive pay-out 
 – 100% of maximum LTIP vesting

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Approach to setting fees Basis of fees Other items
 – Fees for the Chairman and the Non-
Executive Directors are determined taking 
account of the individual’s responsibilities, 
the expected time commitment for 
the role and prevalent market rates. 
 – The Board is responsible for setting 
fees for the Non-Executive Directors 
with the Committee being responsible 
for setting fees for the Chairman. 
 – Fees are reviewed at appropriate intervals.
 – Basic fees are subject to the aggregate 
limit in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. Any changes in this limit would 
be subject to shareholder approval.
 – Non-Executive Directors are paid a 
basic fee for membership of the Board 
with additional fees being paid to Non-
Executive Directors who hold the position 
of Committee Chairman to take into 
account the additional responsibilities 
and workload. Additional fees may also 
be paid for other Board responsibilities or 
roles if this is considered appropriate.
 – The Non-Executive Chairman receives 
an all-inclusive fee for the role.
 – Fees are paid in cash.
 – Current fees are as follows:
 – Chairman’s fee – £187,000
 – Basic Non-Executive 
Director fee – £49,000
 – Committee Chairman fee (Audit 
and Remuneration) – £11,200
 – Senior Independent Director fee – £11,300
 – Fees may be increased in future years in 
line with the policy outlined above.
 – Non-Executive Directors do not receive 
incentive pay or share awards.
 – Non-Executive Directors do not currently 
receive any benefits. Benefits may be 
provided in the future if, in the view of the 
Board (or, in the case of the Chairman, the 
Committee), this was considered appropriate.
 – Travel and other reasonable expenses 
(including fees incurred in obtaining 
professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties) incurred in the course of 
performing their duties are reimbursed 
to Non-Executive Directors.

Annual report on remuneration
Implementation of policy for 2016/17
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that: the Executive Directors are provided with appropriate incentives to align them with 
the achievement of the Company’s strategy and the future creation of shareholder value; enhanced performance is encouraged; and the 
Executive Directors are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
Base salary
The Committee considers it appropriate to increase the base salary for the CEO and CFO for 2016/17 by c. 2%, which is in line with that of 
the UK employee base: 
Base salary with effect from CEO CFO
1 April 2015 £485,000 £300,000 
1 April 2016 £495,000 £306,000 
Increase c. 2.1% c. 2.0%
Benefits
In line with benefits provided for other senior employees, in 2016/17 Executive Directors will continue to be provided with a company car 
or a mobility allowance, a fuel allowance and a £500 annual allowance towards a range of flexible benefits. 
 
Pension 
As noted in the Policy Table on page 52, Richard Longdon participated in the AVEVA Solutions Limited defined benefit pension scheme 
until 2010 when he accrued the maximum benefits that he is entitled to under the scheme. He is now a deferred member of the scheme 
and is no longer accruing any further benefits.
James Kidd is a member of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan (a defined contribution scheme). Due to recent changes significantly 
reducing the annual allowance for pension contributions, the Remuneration Committee, in consultation with our advisers, have decided 
that it would be appropriate to offer a cash alternative to the extent that the overall cost to the Group of providing this is unchanged. 
For 2016/17, the Company contribution to the plan of 10% of salary will instead be paid as a cash alternative, with James contributing 
the maximum amount possible of £10,000 via salary sacrifice.
Annual Incentive Scheme
For 2016/17, the maximum opportunity for Executive Directors under the annual incentive will continue to be 125% of base salary 
(which will be made up of a core award of 100% of salary and an outperformance award of 25% of base salary).
It has been agreed that for the core award 90% of bonus shall be based on achieving stretching Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) 
targets. 10% of the core award is contingent upon achievement of key individual performance objectives which were agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year.
Of the 90% of the core award based on financial performance, 10% is based on achievement for the six months to 30 September and the 
remaining 80% is based on the full year results for 2016/17.
The performance targets for the core and outperformance award are based on Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) targets and the 
outperformance award will only be delivered for the achievement of stretch targets over and above the targets for the core award.
The Board believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, the targets are market 
sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance. 
Deferral
For the core award, at 100% achievement of bonus performance conditions, 60% of the bonus amount is payable in cash and the 
balance, 40%, is deferred into shares. If the bonus amount is less than or equal to 70% of the potential maximum core bonus, then 75% 
of the bonus is paid in cash and 25% paid in deferred shares. If the bonus amount is between 70% and 100% of the potential maximum 
core bonus then the proportion paid in deferred shares is determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 40%.
Any outperformance award will be paid in deferred shares. 
Deferred awards vest pro-rata over three years.   AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Long-Term Incentive Plan
In line with our Policy, the award opportunity for the CEO will continue to be 150% of base salary and for the CFO will be 120% of base 
salary. 
As with previous years, the performance conditions for the award will be based on average adjusted diluted EPS growth over the 
three-year period from 2015/16 to 2017/18. However, the Committee has (following consultation with major shareholders) decided to 
adjust the EPS performance targets applying to the 2016 awards to bring them into line with the Group’s business plan. Furthermore, 
given the unpredictability of when the Group’s end markets will recover, the Committee has also decided to widen the range to take 
account of the potential volatility. The performance ranges for the awards to be granted in 2016 are therefore as follows:
Performance Targets
Proportion

award)

Threshold 5% 25%
Maximum 15% 100%

Annual incentive 
This reflects the total annual incentive paid and payable in 2016 based on performance in the year ended 31 March 2016. This includes 
both the cash element of the bonus and the portion deferred into shares under the deferred share scheme. 
The majority of the annual incentive is dependent on achieving Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) performance targets. 10% of the 
core award was dependent on achieving the half year PBT target of £15.0m. This was a binary target, paying out either nothing or in full. 
The actual achievement was £9.3m. 80% was dependent on full year PBT performance, with nothing paying out if achievement was 
below £60.8m, and fully paying out if achievement reached £70.4m. The actual achievement was £51.2m. In light of the PBT results, the 
committee determined that none of the financial element of the core award will be paid. 
The Executive Directors were given individual performance objectives which comprise the remaining 10% of the annual incentive. 
The Remuneration Committee have decided that the individual performance element of the annual incentive will pay out in full. 
None of the outperformance award will be paid as targets were not met. Achievement for the year was 10% of the core award and 8% 
of the maximum payable for both Executive Directors (2015 – 10% and 8%). When determining the bonus outturn against the personal 
element, the committee took account of performance in a number of areas, including delivery of cost savings, operational efficiencies 
and key strategic objectives. Based upon the committee’s overall assessment against these objectives, the committee has decided to 
pay these performance objectives in full.

Long-term incentives 
This includes the LTIP awards, granted under the previous Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2013 that was capable of vesting based on 
performance in the three-year period ending 31 March 2016.
These awards were subject to the delivery of EPS growth. 0% of awards vest for diluted adjusted EPS growth of less than 14% p.a., with 
100% of awards vesting for diluted adjusted EPS growth of 20% p.a. Average diluted EPS growth for the three year performance period 
did not reach the minimum 14% p.a. growth needed and therefore 0% of the LTIP awards will vest in the period relating to 2015/16.
For 2014/15, none of the LTIP awards granted to the Executives in 2012/13 vested as the minimum threshold performance target was 
not met.

of employees (including only those employees who were employed at the start of the 2014/15 financial year through to the end of the 
2015/16 financial year). The UK Group has been chosen because AVEVA is headquartered, and employs around one-quarter of its 
employees, in the UK. Typical salary inflation in some other AVEVA locations is materially higher than the UK, which would distort 
the comparison.

Relative importance of spend on pay
The chart overleaf illustrates the year-on-year change in total remuneration for all employees in the Group compared to adjusted profit 
before tax and distributions to shareholders for 2015/16 and 2014/15. The committee determined to include adjusted profit before tax in 
this chart as it is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is the primary measure for the annual incentive scheme.
Outside appointments
The Board believes that accepting Non-Executive appointments with other companies enhances the experience of Executive  
Directors and therefore they are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that Board approval is sought  
prior to accepting the appointment. Whether or not the Director concerned is permitted to retain their fees is considered on a  
case-by-case basis. 
Richard Longdon is, since January 2015, Chairman of the Board of Process Systems Enterprise Limited. Prior to his appointment to this 
position, the Board considered the impact on his role as CEO and concluded that he could still devote sufficient time to his role and 
therefore approved his appointment. Richard Longdon receives fees of £20,000 annually for this role, which, as he performs this role 
independently of his duties to the Company, the committee determined he was entitled to receive. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Subject to any restrictions referred to in 
the next section, members may attend 
any general meeting of the Company.
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares in the Company other 
than: certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws); and pursuant to the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority 
whereby Directors and certain employees 
of the Company require the approval

shares and pursuant to the Articles of 
Association where there is default in 
supplying the Company with information 
concerning interests in the Company’s 
shares. There are no special control rights

Voting rights
Subject to any restrictions below, on 
a show of hands every member who 
is present in person or by proxy at a 
general meeting has one vote on each 
resolution and, on a poll, every member 
who is present in person or by proxy has 
one vote on each resolution for every 
share of which he/she is the registered 
member. A proxy will have one vote for 
and one vote against a resolution on a 
show of hands in certain circumstances 
specified in the Articles of Association. 
The Notice of Annual General Meeting

A corporation which is a member of the 
Company may authorise such persons as 
it thinks fit to act as its representatives at 
any general meeting of the Company.
No member shall be entitled to attend 
or vote, either personally or by proxy, 
at a general meeting in respect of 
any share if any call or other sum 
presently payable to the Company in 
respect of such share remains unpaid 
or in certain other circumstances 
specified in the Articles of Association 
where there is default in supplying the 
Company with information concerning

Dividends, distributions and liquidation
Members can declare final dividends by 
passing an ordinary resolution but the 
amount of the dividends cannot exceed 
the amount recommended by the Board. 
The Board can pay interim dividends 
provided the distributable profits of the 
Company justify such payment. The 
Board may, if authorised by an ordinary 
resolution of the members, offer any 
member the right to elect to receive new 
shares, which will be credited as fully 
paid, instead of their cash dividend. Any 
dividend which has not been claimed 
for 12 years after it became due for 
payment will be forfeited and will then 
revert to the Company. Members may 
share in surplus assets on a liquidation.
If the Company is wound up, the 
liquidator can, with the sanction of the 
members by special resolution and any 
other sanction required by law, divide 
among the members all or any part of 
the assets of the Company and he/she 
can value any assets and determine 
how the divisions shall be carried out 
as between the members or different 
classes of members. The liquidator can 
also transfer the whole or any part of the 
assets to trustees upon any trusts for the 
benefit of the members. No members 
can be compelled to accept any asset 
which would give them any liability.
There are no agreements between 
holders of securities that are known 
to the Company which may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
on voting rights, save as described below 
in relation to the Employee Benefit Trust.
Change of control
All of the Company’s share-based plans 
contain provisions relating to change 
of control. Outstanding awards and 
options normally vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control, 
subject to the satisfaction of any relevant 
performance conditions at that time.
There are no other significant 
agreements to which the Company 
is a party that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid.
There are no agreements between 
the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation 
for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid.

Association of the Company may 
be made in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 
by way of special resolution.
Powers of the Directors
The business of the Company is managed 
by the Directors, who may exercise 
all powers of the Company, subject to 
the Company’s Articles of Association, 
relevant statutory law and to any direction 
that may be given by the Company in 
general meeting by special resolution. 
Subject to the Companies Act, shares 
may be issued by Board resolution. At 
the Company’s last Annual General 
Meeting, powers were granted to the 
Directors (subject to limits set out in the 
resolutions) to issue and to buy back its 
own shares; similar powers are proposed 
to be granted at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The buy-back authority 
was limited to 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital. No shares have 
been bought back under this authority.
Appointment of Directors
The Articles of Association limit the 
number of Directors to not less than 
two and not more than ten save where 
members decide otherwise. Members may 
appoint Directors by ordinary resolution 
and may remove any Director (subject

ordinary resolution. New Directors may be 
appointed by the Board but are subject to 
election by members at the first Annual 
General Meeting after their appointment. 
A Director may be removed from office 
if requested by all other Directors.
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require that at each AGM there shall retire 
from office (and be subject to re-election

Employee benefit trust
The AVEVA Group Employee Benefit 
Trust 2008 was established in 2008 
to facilitate satisfying the transfer of 
shares to employees within the Group 
on exercise of vested options under the 
various share option and deferred bonus 
share plans of the Company. The Trust 
holds a total of 22,077 ordinary shares 
in AVEVA Group plc representing 0.03% 
(2015 – 44,722 shares representing 
0.07%) of the issued share capital at the 
date of this report. Under the terms of 
the Trust deed governing the Trust, the 
trustees are required (unless the Company 
directs otherwise) to waive all dividends 
and abstain from voting in respect of 
ordinary shares in AVEVA Group plc held 
by the Trust except where beneficial 
ownership of any such ordinary shares 
was passed to a beneficiary of the Trust. 
In the same way as other employees, the 
Executive Directors of the Company are 
potential beneficiaries under the Trust.
Disabled employees
The Group gives full consideration to 
applications for employment from disabled 
persons where the candidate’s particular 
aptitudes and abilities are consistent with 
adequately meeting the requirements 
of the job. Opportunities are available 
to disabled employees for training, 
career development and promotion.
Where existing employees become 
disabled, it is the Group’s policy to 
provide continuing employment wherever 
practicable in the same or an alternative 
position and to provide appropriate 
training to achieve this aim as well as 
reasonable adjustments to the workplace 
and other support mechanisms.
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on 
the involvement of its employees and 
has continued to keep them informed 
of matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting 
the performance of the Group. This is 
achieved through formal and informal 
meetings, employee newsletters, 
the Group intranet and presentations 
from senior management. There is an 
employee representative committee 
which meets on a regular basis to 
discuss a wide range of matters affecting 
their current and future interests. All 
employees are entitled to receive an 
annual discretionary award related to the 
overall profitability of the Group subject 
to the performance of the individual 
and the Group. The Group conducts 
employee-wide surveys from time to 
time to gauge the success or otherwise 
of its policies and uses this information 
to improve matters as appropriate.
Directors’ indemnity 
The Company has granted an indemnity 
to its Directors against liability in respect 
of proceedings brought by third parties, 
subject to the conditions set out in the 
Companies Act. Such qualifying third party 
indemnity provision remains in force as at 
the date of approving the Directors’ report.
Greenhouse gas emissions reporting
The Company is required to state the 
annual quantity of emissions in tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent from activities 
for which the Group is responsible, 
including the combustion of fuel, the 
operation of any facility, and resulting from 
the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or 
cooling. Details of our emissions are set 
out within the Corporate Responsibility 
section of the Strategic Report and form 
part of the Directors’ Report disclosures.
Auditor

Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in relation  
to the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
The Directors are required to prepare 
Consolidated financial statements for 
each financial year in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. The Directors have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom General Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law including FRS 
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”). 
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the undertakings 
included in the consolidation as a whole 
as at the end of the financial year and 
the profit or loss of the undertakings 
included in the consolidation as a 
whole, so far as concerns members of 
the Company, for the financial year. In 
preparing those Consolidated financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select and apply accounting policies 
in accordance with IAS 8;
 – present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; and
 – provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance.
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgments and 
accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
which are sufficient to disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who were members of 
the Board at the time of approving the 
Directors’ report are listed on page 64. 
Each of these Directors confirms that:
 – so far as he is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as 
defined by Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 – he has taken all the steps he ought 
to have taken as a Director in order 
to make himself aware of any such 
relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information.
Fair and balanced reporting
Having taken advice from the Audit 
Committee, the Board considers the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and that it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Responsibility statement pursuant  
to FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency 
Rule 4 (DTR 4)
Each Director of the Company 
(whose names and functions appear 
on pages 44 and 45) confirms that 
(solely for the purpose of DTR 4) 
to the best of their knowledge:
 – the financial statements in this 
document, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable UK law and 
applicable accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
report include a fair review of the 
development and performance of 
the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Overview of our audit approach
Risk of material misstatement – Risk of inappropriate revenue recognition on software licence contracts, in particular:
 – Due to complex contractual arrangements, inappropriate application of the group 
revenue recognition policy and IAS 18 (Revenue) for rental licence revenue 
recognition which could result in, for example, revenue being recorded when 
performance conditions have not been satisfied, incorrect deferral of revenue for 
support and maintenance and other obligations; and 
 – inappropriate licence revenue recognition in relation to cut off, as revenue may not 
have been recognised in the correct accounting period.
Audit scope – We performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components and 
audit procedures on specific balances for a further eight components.
 – The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 
105% of adjusted pre-tax profit and 81% of Revenue.
Materiality – Overall Group materiality of £2.2m which represents approximately 5% of adjusted 
pre-tax profit. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Independent auditor’s report to the members of AVEVA Group plc 
CONTINUED
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement 
We identified the risk of material misstatement described below as that which had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing this risk, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.
Risk
Inappropriate revenue recognition on rental licence software contract – £90.6m (2015: £97.5m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 46); Accounting policies (page 111); and Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(page 80)
Due to complex contractual arrangements, the risk in particular is inappropriate application of the group revenue recognition policy and 
IAS 18 (Revenue) for rental licence revenue recognition which could result in, for example, revenue being recorded when performance 
conditions have not been satisfied, incorrect deferral of revenue for support and maintenance and other obligations; and inappropriate 
licence revenue recognition in relation to cut off for all significant revenue streams, as revenue may not have been recognised in the 
correct accounting period.
Our response to the risk
We have reviewed and walked through the central process over the approval and recognition of revenue contracts across the group.
We have walked through and assessed the design effectiveness of key management controls over data input and IT.
A summary of our key procedures are:
We have performed rental licence revenue sample transaction testing at a local and group level to ensure that revenue has been 
recorded in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy and IAS 18 and has been appropriately recorded in the current year 
income statement or deferred on the balance sheet as appropriate. This was achieved by testing a sample of contracts by
 – agreeing licence revenues through to signed contracts or software licence agreements.
 – agreeing the revenue through to subsequent payment as evidence of collectability.
 – checking evidence to support that software has been delivered to customers and therefore correct timing of revenue recognition.
 – reviewing contract terms for any conditions that would impact the timing of the revenue recognition and in turn the completeness of 
deferred revenue 
 – ensuring appropriate allocation of the fair value and recognition of revenue for other deliverables included within the contract
 – assessing whether revenue has been recognised in line with the Group’s revenue recognition policy and IAS 18. 
We have performed journals testing by selecting a sample of revenue journals and assessed the appropriateness of the journal by 
checking to supporting evidence and ensuring compliance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy and IAS 18. The sample selected 
was based on risk based criteria including but not limited to manual journal entries, those close to period end and postings that are 
inconsistent with roles and responsibilities. 
We have tested management’s methodology surrounding the fair value of the support and maintenance element of the revenue 
contracts. To better understand the nature of the contractual relationships with customers, any contractual issues or any ongoing 
contractual obligations, we made enquiries of management within the business, including the sales team and legal counsel to ensure 
that appropriate obligations and commitments had been recorded in the financial statements.
We have performed a test of detail on a sample of deferred revenue and accrued revenue items to ensure it is in accordance with the 
revenue recognition principles. 
We have performed cut-off testing for a sample of revenue items booked either side of year end to ensure that licence revenue was only 
recognised for software in the period where the contract was signed by both AVEVA and the customer prior to year end and the software 
has been made available prior to the year end.
As a primary team we gained oversight of the testing performed by the overseas teams through:
 – Our review of their reporting deliverables where they are required to report on any exceptions identified from their testing and 
unusual contractual terms and conditions; 
 – Reviewing contracts meeting the Board review threshold and; 
 – Reviewing any contracts identified as having unusual terms or conditions by management and/or overseas audit teams to confirm 
appropriate recognition of revenue in accordance with the contract accounting policy.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 13 locations, which covered 81% of revenue.
What we concluded to the Audit Committee
We conclude that revenue recognised in the year, and deferred as at 31 March 2016, is materially correct on the basis of our procedures 
performed both at group and by component audit teams.  STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We have further refined our revenue 
recognition risk from the prior year to be 
specific to the rental revenue due to the 
complex contractual arrangements. 
In the prior year we had the assessment of 
the carrying value of goodwill in relation 
to the Enterprise Solutions business 
segment as a significant risk. As a result 
of the groups reorganisation an exercise 
was performed to identity the new Cash 
generating Units (CGUs) of the group. The 
new CGUs identified are on a geographical 
basis which is also in line with the change 
in operating segments in line with IFRS 
8. Under the new CGU’s the level of 
headroom is now significantly greater 
which has reduced the risk in relation 
to potential impairment of goodwill.
The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our 
evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality 
determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, 
this enables us to form an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements. 
We take into account size, risk profile, 
the organisation of the group and 
effectiveness of group-wide controls and 
changes in the business environment.
In assessing the risk of material 
misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had 
adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial 
statements, of the 30 reporting 
components of the Group, we selected 13 
components that represent the principal 
business units within the Group.
Of the 13 components selected, we 
performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of five components 
(“full scope components”) which were 
selected based on their size or risk 
characteristics. For the remaining 
eight components (“specific scope 
components”), we performed audit 
procedures on specific accounts within 
that component that we considered had 
the potential for the greatest impact on 
the significant accounts in the financial 
statements either because of the size 
of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The reporting components where we 
performed audit procedures accounted 
for 105% of the Group’s adjusted pre-tax 
profit and 81% of the Group’s Revenue. 
For the current year, the full scope 
components contributed 57% of the 
Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit and 52% of 
the Group’s Revenue. The specific scope 
components contributed 48% of the 
Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit and 29% of 
the Group’s Revenue. In the prior year the 
full scope and specific scope components 
contributed 96% of the Group’s pre-tax 
profit and 81% of the Group’s revenue. 
The audit scope of these components 
may not have included testing of all 
significant accounts of the component 
but will have contributed to the coverage 
of significant accounts tested for the 
Group. The Group audit risk in relation 
to revenue recognition was subject to 
audit procedures at each of the full and 
specific scope locations with revenue.
Of the remaining 17 components that 
together represent an overall loss of 5% 
to the Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit; 
none are individually greater than 5% of 
the Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit. For 
these components, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, 
testing a sample of revenue contracts 
at group level which were in limited 
scope entities, testing of consolidation 
journals and intercompany eliminations 
and foreign currency translation 
recalculations to respond to any 
potential risks of material misstatement 
to the Group financial statements.
The chart below illustrates the 
coverage obtained from the work 
performed by our audit teams.

Changes from the prior year 
France, Germany and Korea have been 
designated as full scope components 
this year, whereas they were designated 
as specific scope locations in the prior 
year. We have changed the designation 
in order to obtain greater quantitative 
full scope coverage of the Group’s 
key metrics. We do not perceive any 
additional risk in these components and 
no additional risk areas were discovered 
as a result of the increase in audit scope.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the 
Group audit, we determined the type of 
work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the primary 
audit engagement team, or by component 
auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. 
Of the five full scope components, audit 
procedures were performed on two 
of these directly by the primary audit 
team. In addition audit procedures were 
also performed by the primary audit 
team for two of the eight specific scope 
components. For the remaining six specific 
scope and three full scope components, 
the work was performed by component 
auditors, we determined the appropriate 
level of involvement to enable us to 
determine that sufficient audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow 
a programme of planned visits that has 
been designed to ensure that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor or his representative 
visits at least two (2015: two) of the 
components each year. During the 
current year’s audit cycle, visits were 
undertaken by the primary audit team 
to the component teams in India and 
Germany (2015: Korea and Germany). 
These visits involved, where appropriate, 
discussing the audit approach with the 
component team and any issues arising 
from their work, meeting with local and 
regional management, attending the 
planning meeting in India and the closing 
meeting in Germany and reviewing key 
audit working papers on risk areas. The 
primary team interacted regularly with 
the component teams during various 
stages of the audit, reviewed selected 
working papers and were responsible 
for the scope and direction of the audit 
process. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave 
us appropriate evidence for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality 
in planning and performing the audit, 
in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and 
in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or 
misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial 
statements. Materiality provides a 
basis for determining the nature and 
extent of our audit procedures. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016
72
Independent auditor’s report to the members of AVEVA Group plc 
CONTINUED
We determined materiality for the Group 
to be £2.2 million , which is approximately 
5% of adjusted pre-tax profit because, in 
our view, this is the most relevant measure 
of the underlying financial performance 
of the Group. For 2016 we used pre-tax 
profit adjusted for the aborted acquisition 
costs of Schneider Electric (£10.2m) 
and certain restructuring costs (£3.8m). 
In 2015 we used pre-tax profit and 
materiality for the Group was £3.1m. 
 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the 
individual account or balance level. It is set 
at an amount to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, 
together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance 
materiality was 75% (2015: 50%) of our 
planning materiality, namely £1.7m (2015: 
£1.5m) although we reduce our testing 
thresholds in areas of significant risk to 
appropriately reflect our assessment 
of risk in the business and to focus on 
the key judgements and estimates. 
We have increased our assessment of 
performance materiality from 50% to 
75% during the year as the previous audit 
findings which warranted the reduction in 
performance materiality in the prior year 
were one off in nature, are not applicable 
to the current year audit and are not 
indicative of systemic issues in other 
areas. Our approach is designed to have 
a reasonable probability of ensuring that 
the total of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements does not exceed our 
materiality of £2.2 million for the group 
financial statements as a whole.
Audit work at component locations for the 
purpose of obtaining audit coverage over 
significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage 
of total performance materiality. The 
performance materiality set for each 
component is based on the relative scale 
and risk of the component to the Group as 
a whole and our assessment of the risk of 
misstatement at that component. In the 
current year, the range of performance 
materiality allocated to components was 
£0.5m to £0.9m (2015: £0.3m to £0.7m). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified 
misstatements are considered 
as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them all uncorrected 
audit differences in excess of £0.11m (2015: 
£0.15m), which is set at 5% of planning 
materiality, as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality 
discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations 
in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the group’s and the 
parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report and accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in 
the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 67, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.

performing our audit; or 
 – otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired in the course of 
performing the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report and accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business model and 
strategy; and whether the annual report appropriately addresses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee that we 
consider should have been disclosed.
We have no exceptions to report.
Companies Act 2006 reporting
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
Listing Rules review requirements
We are required to review:
 – the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, and longer-term viability, set out on page 33; and
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have no exceptions to report.
Statement on the Directors’ Assessment of the Principal Risks that Would Threaten the Solvency or Liquidity of the Entity
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 – the directors’ confirmation in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 – the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
 – the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.

1 Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 
given on the inside back cover. AVEVA Group plc’s shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 
2 Key accounting policies
Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group. The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on pages 109 
to 116.
a) Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 
2016. The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(£000) except when otherwise indicated.
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2016. 
The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement. The Directors believe that 
this alternative measure of profit provides a reliable and consistent measure of the Group’s underlying performance. The face of the 
Consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented 
under the applicable accounting standards. Adjusted earnings per share, as disclosed in note 13, is calculated having adjusted profit after 
tax for the same items and their tax effect. The term adjusted profit is not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute 
for, or superior to, GAAP measures of profit. 
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc are included on pages 103 to 107.
From 1 April 2015, the EDS and ES lines of business were merged and the Executive team now monitor and appraise the business based 
on the performance of three geographic regions: Asia Pacific; Americas; and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). These three regions 
are now the basis of the Group’s primary operating segments reported in the financial statements. Performance is evaluated based on 
regional contribution using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Group’s financial statements. There is no inter-segment 
revenue. Balance sheet information is not included in the information provided to the Executive team. Support functions such as head 
office departments are controlled and monitored centrally. Disclosure for the year ended 31 March 2015 has been restated to reflect the 
new organisational structure.
Also from 1 April 2015, the allocation of costs between selling and distribution expenses and administrative expenses has been amended 
and the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2015 has been restated accordingly. Previously, all costs related to the sales 
offices were included in selling and distribution expenses including the local finance, HR and IT costs to reflect the total cost of the 
regional sales operation. In line with industry practice, the presentation has been updated to allocate the costs by function to selling and 
distribution costs and administrative expenses respectively. Comparatives have been restated accordingly resulting in an increase of 
£7.5 million to administrative expenses and a corresponding decrease to selling and distribution costs in the year ended 31 March 2015. 
There has been no impact on profit from operations. Similarly, and also in line with industry practice, selling and distribution expenses 
and administrative expenses have been combined on the face of the Consolidated income statement with the split of these expenses 
now provided in a note – see note 5. The Directors believe that the revised income statement presentation more appropriately and 
consistently reflects the nature of the Group’s operations. 
b) Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser 
extent indirectly through resellers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes. It comprises 
initial licence fees, annual licence fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until:
 – a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced;
 – delivery has been made in accordance with that contract;
 – if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met; and
 – the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable. Where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist, revenue recognition is 
deferred until payment is due.
Initial/annual licence agreements
Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is 
charged every year. Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use, and customer support and maintenance, which includes core 
product upgrades and enhancements, and remote support services. Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the 
right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met. Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the contract, which is typically 12 months. If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial 
licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016
80
Rental licence agreements
As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental 
licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-cancellable and 
consist of two separate components; the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with customer support and 
maintenance. Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market 
value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer. This component is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the contract. The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised up 
front, provided all of the above criteria have been met. Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value 
of the customer support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model. Under this model, a ‘basket’ of tokens representing licences to use 
different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required. 
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised 
with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions 
being met. Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on the actual number of tokens used.
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training, and are performed under separate service 
arrangements. Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by 
reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project. If a contract cannot be reliably 
estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred. Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided 
that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not 
subject to acceptance criteria. In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are 
performed.
c) Exceptional items
The Group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better 
understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group. The Group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises, 
fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
d) Significant accounting estimates
Revenue recognition
The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of 
revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation 
services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer. This policy involves the assessment of which customer 
projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects. 
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use, and to customer support and 
maintenance, is reviewed periodically. On average, the element attributable to customer support and maintenance as a proportion of 
the initial software delivery is 17%. 
Provision for impairment of receivables
The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis. The determination of the appropriate level of 
provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Group’s customers and management consider a 
number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age 
of the receivable outstanding and the Group’s trading experience with that customer. The provision for impairment of receivables at 
31 March 2016 was £5,879,000 (2015 – £5,636,000).
Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such 
intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates. Future results are impacted 
by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income 
statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including 
discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. Further details about the assumptions used are set out in 
note 15.

Income taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and there are instances where significant judgement is required in 
determining the provision for tax. The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of taxes that are likely to become due. 
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income 
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made. Areas of tax judgement and where the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain include transfer pricing and deferred tax asset recognition.
Retirement benefit obligations
The determination of the Group’s obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of 
Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts. The assumptions applied, together with 
sensitivity analysis, are described in note 26 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries 
and mortality rates. While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or 
significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Group’s future pension obligations, actuarial gains 
and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs. The net carrying 
amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2016 was £5,162,000 (2015 – £14,187,000).
e) Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies and 
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are 
independent of other cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is 
tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. The carrying values of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative 
expenses line item.

4 Segment information
From 1 April 2015, the Group was reorganised so as to place greater emphasis on regional performance. The Group is now organised into 
three geographical segments: Asia Pacific; Americas; and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Each segment is determined by the 
location of the Group’s operations and is organised and managed separately due to the differing local requirements in each market. 
The Executive management team monitors the operating results of the regions for the purposes of making decisions about performance 
assessment and resource allocation. Performance is evaluated based on regional contribution using the same accounting policies as 
adopted for the Group’s financial statements. There is no inter-segment revenue. Balance sheet information is not included in the 
information provided to the Executive management team. Support functions such as head office departments are controlled and 
monitored centrally. Disclosure for the year ended 31 March 2015 has been restated to reflect the new organisational structure.

– differing tax rates (19) 128
– adjustments in respect of prior years (336) 489
Income tax expense reported in Consolidated income statement 8,955 13,303
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year before exceptional items and adjustments in respect of prior periods is 22.9% (2015 – 22.8%).
At the balance sheet date, the UK government had substantively enacted a 1% reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% 
from 1 April 2017 and by another 1% to 18% from 1 April 2020. These rate changes resulted in a £85,000 movement to opening deferred 
tax consisting of a credit of £141,000 to the income statement and a £226,000 charge to comprehensive income.
On 16 March 2016, the UK government announced that it would reduce the main rate of corporation tax by a further 1% from 1 April 2020 
to 17%. This change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is consequently not included in these financial 
statements. The effect of this proposed reduction would be immaterial to the UK net deferred tax liability. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for the 
year of £20,474,000 (2015 – £41,559,000). Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity 
holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share 
amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all 
the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares. Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 27.

The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share. 
The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has been adjusted for the tax effects 
of the items adjusted.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is a more representative presentation of the underlying performance of the 
business.

On 5 January 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of 8over8 Limited headquartered in Northern Ireland. The 
acquisition consideration was cash of £26.9 million. Details of the provisional fair values of the net assets acquired and goodwill was set 
out in detail in the 2015 Annual Report. The final fair values of the assets acquired were increased by £189,000 from the disclosed 
provisional values as a result of the collection of a customer debt previously provided against. Additionally, in January 2016 the Group 
successfully obtained a partial refund of acquisition consideration paid of an amount of £4,071,000. This adjustment to the cost of the 
acquisition and the resulting goodwill was due to the Group claiming under an indemnity provided by the vendors of the business at the 
time of the acquisition in January 2015.

Goodwill which arose on past acquisitions had previously been allocated to the Engineering & Design Systems and Enterprise Solutions 
cash-generating units (CGUs). As a result of the Group’s decision to move to a regional organisation structure, goodwill has been 
reallocated to the three reported segments of Asia Pacific, EMEA and Americas. This reallocation has been completed on a relative 
recoverable amount basis. The goodwill attached to each of the Group’s CGUs is as follows:

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
In 2015/16 the goodwill impairment testing was carried out on a value in use (VIU) basis using the most recently approved management 
budgets for the year ended 31 March 2017 together with the most recent three-year business plan extrapolated out for a duration of five 
years in total. Projected cash flows beyond five years have been assumed at the long-term growth rate for that region and these have been 
used to formulate a terminal value for the discounted cash flow calculation. Cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates of 12%, 9% 
and 11% per annum, reflecting the weighted average cost of capital for each of the Asia Pacific, EMEA and Americas CGUs respectively.
Asia Pacific
During the year the contribution of the Asia Pacific segment was £43.9 million (2015 – £40.6 million). This is far in excess of the 
attributable goodwill and any other intangible assets. Therefore, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes in key 
assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the 
carrying value.
EMEA
During the year the contribution of the EMEA segment was £58.8 million (2015 – £61.8 million). This is far in excess of the attributable 
goodwill and any other intangible assets. Therefore, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions 
would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.
Americas
During the year the contribution of the Americas segment was £8.3 million (2015 – £19.3 million). A VIU assessment was prepared for this 
CGU which was based on budget and business planning data for the next three years and which assumed revenues returning to levels 
recorded in 2015. The VIU assessment demonstrated considerable headroom and the sensitivity analysis performed showed that 
projected revenue for the Americas region at the end of the period covered by the business plan would need to be 20% lower than 
projected before a possible impairment would be indicated.

For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation (note 13), intangible asset amortisation excludes the charge relating to 
other software of £338,000 (2015 – £628,000).

The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, motor vehicles and items of equipment. These leases have a

24 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange 
contracts. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly 
from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be 
undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below:
a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or 
the value of its holding of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk
The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits. The 
Group’s overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, accessibility and 
competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk 
variables on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity. The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash 
equivalents and treasury deposits. The Group does not have any borrowings. The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest 
rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately £633,000 (2015 – 
£765,000) and profit after tax by £506,000 (2015 – £604,000).
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of 
operations. These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency of Sterling. 
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit. The main exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, 
South Korean Won, and Japanese Yen, reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Group’s revenue and cash receipts are 
denominated in these currencies, whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research & Development, are settled in Sterling, Indian 
Rupees and Swedish Krona.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
CONTINUED STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
93
The Group manages exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts. The Group enters into forward foreign 
exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euros to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base. In addition, it enters 
into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts, when the timing of forecast cash flows is 
reasonably certain. Other currency exposures are less easy to hedge cost effectively. At 31 March 2016, the Group had outstanding 
currency exchange contracts to sell $18 million (2015 – $22.8 million) and €10.4 million (2015 – €9.7 million). It also had outstanding 
currency exchange contracts to buy Danish kr0 million (2015 – kr4.5 million). Non-deliverable forward contracts were used to hedge the 
purchase of INR0 million (2015 – INR30 million).
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange 
contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk. Gains and losses arising 
from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign 
exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders’ equity. The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the 
monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional 
currency and being of a monetary nature; differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation 
currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling, and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and 
profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown. In management’s opinion, this is a reasonably possible 
change given current market conditions. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign 
currencies, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014/15.

b) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by 
the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies. As set 
out in the Group’s treasury policy, the amount of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific limit, up to a maximum of 50% of 
the Group’s total counterparty risk. Within this overall limit, some counterparties are subject to more restrictive caps on counterparty 
exposure.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. 
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is 
made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the 
cash flows. The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis. Credit checks are performed 
before credit is granted to new customers. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large 
number of customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. The exposure 
to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit quality of trade receivables are included in note 19.

c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows 
and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities. The Group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is 
not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on

d) Fair values
The book values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities consist of bank and cash balances of £64,611,000 (2015 – £58,519,000) and 
treasury deposits of £43,316,000 (2015 – £45,248,000). The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Group’s 
financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition, the Group’s financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts. Financial instruments which are recognised at fair 
value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. The three 
levels are defined as follows:
 – Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 – Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 March 2016, the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial 
recognition. The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was £864,000 at 31 March 2016 (2015 – £432,000 
liability).
The resulting loss of £432,000 (2015 – loss of £980,000) on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
e) Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity 
holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or 
issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2015 or 2016.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend. The Group is not exposed to any 
externally imposed capital requirements.

*  A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus 
accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for 
financial reporting purposes:

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £7,005,000 (2015 – £1,654,000) available for offset against future profits. 
Of the total deferred tax asset of £1,514,000 (2015 – £533,000), £933,000 (2015 – £40,000) has been recognised and is included in ‘other’ 
above. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately £37,134,000 (2015 – £37,003,000). No liability 
has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is likely that the majority of the 
overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.

a) UK defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded. This scheme 
was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 (with the option of reopening if required) and was converted to a Career Average 
Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004. The scheme closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 1 April 2015. Pensions are 
also payable to dependants on death. Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed, and the funds are held and 
managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally qualified actuary, Broadstone 
Corporate Benefits Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme. Scheme assets are 
stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows:
2016 
%
2015 
%
Main assumptions:
Discount rate 3.40 3.10
Inflation assumption – RPI 3.30 3.30
Rate of salary increases 5.30 5.30
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.10 3.10
Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.30 2.30
Cash Commutation 20% of pension 20% of pension
The duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 19 years.
For the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, the mortality assumptions adopted imply the following weighted average life expectancies 
at age 65:
2016 
Years
2015 
Years
Male pensioners 23.1 23.8
Female pensioners 24.3 25.0
Non-retired males 24.2 25.1
Non-retired females 25.6 26.5
Company contributions were £1,580,000 (2015 – £7,724,000). The total contributions in 2016/17 are expected to be approximately 
£1,580,000. The PPF levy of approximately £20,000 will be payable in addition (2015 – £19,300).

b) German defined benefit schemes
There are two defined benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH. Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme 
that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992. No current employees participate in the scheme and it 
is closed to new applicants. Benefit payments are made as they fall due. The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon 
Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005. 
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software GmbH has been responsible for the pension obligations of six former Bocad 
employees. At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles. In March 2013, 
AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which results in the insurance company being obliged to provide all 
benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external insurance provider 
defaults.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee. This scheme is closed to new members. 
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below:
2016 2015
Rate of increase of pension in payment 1.25%–2.5% 1.25%–2.5%
Discount rate 1.5%–2.5% 1.25%–3.0%
Mortality 13–20 years 14–18 years
Rate of salary increases N/A N/A
The retirement age for the Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH schemes was 60 and 63 years of age respectively (2015 – 60 and 63 
years of age).
c) South Korean severance pay
South Korean employees are entitled to a lump sum on severance of their employment equal to one month’s salary for each year of 
service. The IAS 19 valuation of the liability has been carried out using the following assumptions:
2016 
%
2015 
%
Rate of salary increases 4.00 4.00
Discount rate 2.29 2.81
The retirement age for AVEVA Korea Limited employees is 60 years of age (2015 – 60 years of age). 
d) Other retirement schemes
All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP, an industry scheme for salaried employees 
which provides benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements. The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance 
company. It is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component. AVEVA AB pays monthly 
premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee. AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the 
underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and 
therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme. At 31 March 2016, Alecta’s surplus in the 
form of collective funding level was 144% (2015 – 148%) which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for 
Insurance Companies. The total cost charged to the income statement was £701,550 (2015 – £603,278).
e) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian employees. The 
assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. The total cost charged to income of £6,346,000 (2015 – £5,136,000) 
represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.
27 Share-based payment plans
The Group has four equity-settled share schemes: the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP); the AVEVA Group Management 
Bonus Deferred Share Scheme; the AVEVA Group plc Senior Employee Restricted Share Plan 2015; and the AVEVA Group plc Executive 
Share Option Scheme 2007. No grants have been made under the 2007 scheme which was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 
12 July 2007. Details of these plans are set out below.

The weighted average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding at 31 March 2016 is 5.23 years (2015 – 4.77 years).
The average fair value of options granted during the year was £19.55 (2015 – £19.07). In calculating the fair value, the expected life of the 
options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects 
the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The Group recognised an expense of £494,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year ended 31 March 
2016 (2015 – credit of £441,000). AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Details of the share option plans are as follows:
a) Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The following awards have been made under the LTIP. The exercise price is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 
3.56 pence. Options under the LTIP are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of 
grant.
Performance conditions related to LTIP awards originally granted in 2011/12 and 2012/13 have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the 
special dividend of £100 million and share consolidation during 2013/14.
2015/16 awards
In 2015/16, a total of 253,610 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth over the three years from 2015/16 to 
2017/18. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over 
the same period is less than 12% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 12% and 20% the number of shares that 
vest will be determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2014/15 awards
In 2014/15, a total of 189,740 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2014/15 to 2016/17. If average 
adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over the same period is 
less than 12% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 12% and 20% the number of shares that vest will be 
determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2013/14 awards
In 2013/14, a total of 136,886 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2013/14 to 2015/16. If average 
adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over the same period is 
less than 14% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 14% and 20% the number of shares that vest will be 
determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2012/13 awards
In 2012/13, a total of 160,730 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The performance 
conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2012/13 to 2014/15. If average diluted EPS growth is 
more than 15% then all shares shall vest. If average diluted EPS growth over the same period is less than 8% then none of the shares will 
vest. For growth rates between 8% and 15% the number of shares that vest will be determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 
100%. Following the share consolidation in July 2013, target growth rates were increased by 1.5 percentage points to 9.5% and 16.5%.
b) Deferred annual bonus share plan
In 2008, the Company established the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 (the Deferred Share Scheme). 
Directors and senior management participate in this scheme. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single 
financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash and partly in ordinary shares in the 
Company to be delivered on a deferred basis.
In August 2015, the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 awarded 2,131 (2015 – 13,991) deferred shares to the Executive Directors 
and senior management in respect of the bonus earned in the year ended 31 March 2015 (2015 – bonus earned in year ended 31 March 
2014).
The awards of deferred shares take the form of nil-cost options exercisable by participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the 
three years following the year in which the award is made. The option may be exercised in the 42-day period beginning on the 
announcement of the financial results of the Group in each of the three calendar years after that in which the option was granted. The 
last date of the exercise is the end of the 42-day period following the announcement of the financial results of the Group in the third 
calendar year following that in which the option was granted or (if applicable) such later date as the Remuneration Committee may 
specify. These awards are made solely in respect of performance in the financial year immediately prior to their grant. Delivery of the 
deferred shares is not subject to further performance conditions but each participant is required to remain an employee or Director of 
the Group during the three-year vesting period in order to receive his deferred shares in full (except in the case of death or the occurrence 
of a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company).
c) AVEVA Group plc Senior Employee Restricted Share Plan 2015
During the year a new employee share scheme was approved at the 2015 AGM. The scheme allows awards of options to be made to 
senior management employees and the exercise price of awards granted is 3.56 pence, being the nominal value of the underlying shares. 
The right to exercise an option is subject to completion of a required period of continued employment within the Group, usually being 
three years. Options that are not exercised prior to the fifth anniversary (or, in the case of an award with an overall award period of more 
than four years, the sixth anniversary) of the date of grant shall lapse.
In July 2015 a total of 66,638 options were granted to senior management. One-third of the shares under option are exercisable two 
years after the date of award and two-thirds of the shares under option are exercisable after three years.

1 Authorisation of Financial Statements and Statement of Compliance with FRS 101
The financial statements of AVEVA Group plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 March 2016 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 24 May 2016 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Philip Aiken, the Group Chairman, and Richard 
Longdon, the CEO. AVEVA Group plc is a limited Company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales whose shares are publicly 
traded on the London Stock Exchange. The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) 
and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. The 
accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 
2016. The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
No income statement is presented by the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The results of AVEVA 
Group plc are included in the Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc. 
The Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite macroeconomic and geopolitical 
uncertainties. It has considerable financial resources and no borrowings. As a consequence of these factors and having reviewed the 
forecasts for the coming year, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that there are adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial 
statements. 
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Explained below are the significant accounting policies of the Company. The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on 
pages 109 to 116.
a) Basis of preparation
The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) for all periods 
presented. There are no material adjustments required, as disclosed in note 10. The Company has taken advantage of the following 
disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
 – the requirements of IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows
 – the requirements of IAS 8: IFRSs issued but not effective
 – the requirements of IFRS 2: Share based payments
 – the requirements of IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures
 – the requirements of IFRS 13: Fair Value measurements
 – the requirements of IAS 24: Related party disclosures
 – the requirements of IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements, to present comparative information and a third balance sheet
 – the requirements of IFRS 1, to present an opening statement of financial position when adopting FRS 101 for the first time
There were no transitional adjustments in the transition from UK GAAP to FRS 101 in the opening balance sheet as at 31 March 2014, and 
therefore no third balance sheet has been prepared.
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the Consolidated financial statements of the 
Group in which the entity is consolidated.
b) Taxation
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
c) Share-based payments
The accounting policy in relation to share-based payment transactions is disclosed in full in the Consolidated financial statements. The 
Company recognises the expense relating to the Executive Directors. The Company also records a corresponding increase in its 
investments in subsidiaries with a credit to equity which is equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
d) Investments in subsidiaries
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
3 Result for the year
AVEVA Group plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2016 of £29,811,000 (2015 – £29,641,000).
Audit fees of £7,000 (2015 – £7,000) are borne by another Group company.
The Company does not have any employees (2015 – nil). Directors’ emoluments are disclosed in the Annual report on remuneration on 
pages 49 to 63 and, in respect of the Executive Directors, are paid by a UK subsidiary company.

the Consolidated financial statements for the Group includes details of share option awards made during the year.
9 Related party transactions
There were no transactions with related parties in either the current or the preceding financial year that require disclosure within these 
financial statements.
10 Transition to FRS 101
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with 
previously extant UK GAAP. These financial statements, to the year ended 31 March 2016, are the first the Company has prepared in 
accordance with FRS 101.
There were no transitional adjustments recorded in the transition from UK GAAP to FRS 101 in the opening balance sheet as at 31 March 
2014, and therefore no third balance sheet has been prepared.
Exemptions applied
IFRS 1 allows first time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirements to apply IFRS retrospectively. The Company has 
taken advantage of the exemption in respect of merger accounting and merger reserve.

Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 
given on the inside back cover. AVEVA Group plc’s shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2016. The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest 
thousand (£000) except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement. The Directors believe that 
this alternative measure of profit provides a reliable and consistent measure of the Group’s underlying performance. The face of the 
Consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented 
under the applicable accounting standards. Adjusted earnings per share, as disclosed in note 13, is calculated having adjusted profit 
after tax for the same items and their tax effect. The term adjusted profit is not defined under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be 
a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures of profit.
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2016. 
The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared under the FRS 101 reduced disclosure framework 
and are included on pages 103 to 107.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each 
year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation. Adjustments are made 
to translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAP and IFRSs.
Inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated 
in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the 
cost of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. New standards and interpretations which 
came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet effective
The IASB have issued the following standards (although in some cases not yet adopted by the EU) which are expected to have 
implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures in future 
financial years:
Effective for periods 
commencing after
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016
IAS 16 and IAS 38 Amendments – Clarification of Accounting Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016
IFRS 11 Amendments – Accounting for Acquisition of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016
IAS 27 Amendments – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts from Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The Group intends to adopt these standards in the first accounting period after the effective date. Except for IFRS 15, the Directors do 
not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations listed will have a material effect on the Consolidated financial 
statements in the period of initial application.
Statement of Group accounting policies AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Significant accounting estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of judgement and estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below:
Retirement benefit obligations
The determination of the Group’s obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of 
Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts. The assumptions applied, together with 
sensitivity analysis, are described in note 26 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries 
and mortality rates. While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or 
significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Group’s future pension obligations, actuarial gains 
and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs. The net carrying 
amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2016 was £5,162,000 (2015 – £14,187,000).
Provision for impairment of receivables
The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis. The determination of the appropriate level of 
provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Group’s customers and management consider a 
number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age 
of the receivable outstanding and the Group’s trading experience with that customer. The provision for impairment of receivables at 
31 March 2016 was £5,879,000 (2015 – £5,636,000).
Revenue recognition
The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of 
revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation 
services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer. This policy involves the assessment of which customer 
projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects. 
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use, and to customer support and 
maintenance, is reviewed periodically. On average, the element attributable to customer support and maintenance as a proportion of 
the initial software delivery is 17%. 
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and there are instances where significant judgement is required in 
determining the provision for tax. The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of taxes that are likely to become due. 
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income 
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made. Areas of tax judgement and where the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain include transfer pricing and deferred tax asset recognition.
Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such 
intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates. Future results are impacted 
by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income 
statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including 
discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. Further details about the assumptions used are set out in 
note 15.
Statement of Group accounting policies 
CONTINUED STRATEGIC REPORT  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser 
extent indirectly through resellers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes. It comprises 
initial licence fees, annual fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until:
 – a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced;
 – delivery has been made in accordance with that contract;
 – if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met; and
 – the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable. Where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist, revenue recognition is 
deferred until payment is due.
Initial/annual licence agreements
Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is 
charged every year. Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core 
product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services. Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the 
right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met. Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the contract, which is typically 12 months. If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial 
licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements
As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental 
licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis. Other 
rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-cancellable and consist 
of two separate components; the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance. 
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based 
on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer. This component is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the contract. The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised up front, provided all of 
the above criteria have been met. Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer 
support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model. Under this model, a ‘basket’ of tokens representing licences to use 
different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required. 
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised 
with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions 
being met. Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on the actual number of tokens used.
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed under separate service 
arrangements. Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by 
reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project. If a contract cannot be reliably 
estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred. Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided 
that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not 
subject to acceptance criteria. In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are 
performed. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is Pounds Sterling (£). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the 
Consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the 
date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies. As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas 
subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling (£) at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, and their income statements 
are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Exceptional items
The Group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better 
understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group. The Group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises, 
fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when a 
business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the 
Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of 
acquisition. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible asset as set out below. 
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Consolidated income statement in 
the year in which it is incurred. Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical 
feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Amortisation is 
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows:
Years
Developed technology 5–12
Customer relationships 10–20
Other software 3
Purchased software rights 5–10
Research expenditure
Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.

Government grants
Grants in respect of specific Research & Development projects are recognised as receivable when there is reasonable assurance that 
they will be received and the conditions to obtain them have been complied with. They are credited to the income statement in the 
same period as the related Research & Development costs for which the grant is compensating. The grant income is presented as a 
deduction from the related expense.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life 
of the asset as follows:
Years
Computer equipment 3
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 6–8
Motor vehicles 4
Leasehold buildings and improvements are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease (3 to 49 years) or useful 
economic life, if shorter. 
Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies and 
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are 
independent of other cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is 
tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. The carrying values of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative 
expenses line item.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for 
any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts 
are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the Consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value. For the purpose of the 
Consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments
The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign 
exchange risk. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All forward foreign exchange 
contracts have been marked-to-market and are held at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Group has not applied hedge 
accounting during the year and therefore movements in fair value are being recorded in the Consolidated income statement. Fair value is 
estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term.
Taxation
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Legislation has been enacted to allow UK companies to elect for the Research & Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) on qualifying 
expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013, instead of the super-deduction rules. At the balance sheet date, management has concluded that 
the election will be made and therefore the RDEC is recorded as income included in profit before tax, netted against Research & 
Development expenses as the RDEC is of the nature of a government grant.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences:
 – except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and
 – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax 
losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-
forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:
 – except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The income tax effects of items recorded in either other comprehensive income or equity are recognised in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity respectively. Otherwise, income tax is 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement. 
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except:
 – where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the 
sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
 – receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
Consolidated balance sheet.

Post retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany. The Group also provides certain post 
employment benefits to its South Korean employees. 
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002 and closed to 
future accrual from 31 March 2015. UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The German unfunded defined benefit schemes are closed to new applicants and provide benefits to nine deferred members. These 
schemes were acquired as part of previous business combinations. No current employees participate in the schemes. Full provision has 
been made for the liability on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one 
German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industry-wide defined benefit scheme. It is not possible 
to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and reasonable 
basis. Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by qualified external actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and to 
the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation). The retirement benefit liability in the 
Consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate derived from a 
published index of AA rated corporate bonds) as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled 
directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price. The value of a net 
pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or 
reductions in the future contributions. The current service cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an employee 
benefit expense. The net interest element of the defined benefit cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined 
benefit liability or asset.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and non-UK employees. Contributions to defined 
contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, 
further details of which are given in note 27. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting 
date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. 
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the 
date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a 
replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original 
award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, subject to an 
estimate of whether performance conditions will be met. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016

Employee benefit trust
The Group has established an employee benefit trust (AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008), which is a separately administered 
trust and is funded by loans from Group companies. The assets of the trust comprise shares in AVEVA Group plc and cash balances. The 
Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the Consolidated financial statements and shares held by the trust are recorded at 
cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
Consideration received for the sale of shares held by the trust is recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from 
the sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. Company information and advisers

THE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
It is a pleasure to report good results for Wyndeham for the year to 31 March 2005.  The strong start to the year, 
that we announced at the interim stage in November 2004, was maintained during the second half of the year 
and this performance reﬂects good progress despite the absence of any improvement in market and economic 
conditions and the well publicised increase in energy costs.
The Group’s improvement in performance is in part a direct result of corporate action taken both during 2003 and 
2004.  Of particular relevance was the successful integration of Graphic Facilities, which won the pre press company 
of the year award, acquired a year ago and the success of our new centralised sales operation.  Wyndeham has 
continued to invest in state-of-the-art technology and as a result has beneﬁted from new contract wins. 
Results and Dividend  
Group turnover increased 14% to £141.3m (2004: £123.6m) and proﬁt before tax, exceptional items and amortisation 
of goodwill increased substantially by 70% to £7.5m (2004: £4.4m),  continuing the improvement achieved in 
2004.
In recognition of the long term strategy for growth and the overall improvement in margins throughout the Group 
the Board is recommending a 10% increase in the ﬁnal dividend to 3.03p (2004: 2.75p).  Subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 31 August 2005 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 5 August 2005.
The increase in ﬁnal dividend, if approved, will result in a total dividend for the year of 4.68p (2004: 4.25p) which 
is covered 1.4 times (2004: 0.7 times) by earnings.
The Group continues to be cash generative and net debt has fallen to £28.2m.  Interest cover has risen to 3.8 times 
(2004: 2.2 times).
Board and Employees
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our staff for all their efforts during the year.
Just after the period under review, on 1 April 2005, the Board announced the appointment of Paul Utting as Chief 
Executive.  Having joined Wyndeham as Group Managing Director in October 2003 from St. Ives PLC, Paul has 
had a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial impact on the Group driving the restructuring forward successfully.  His considerable 
contribution has been recognised by the Board and his appointment to Chief Executive is much deserved.
To support Paul in his new role as Chief Executive, I have agreed to continue as Chairman. 
Additionally, Roy Kingston who joined Wyndeham from St. Ives PLC shortly after Paul Utting has also made a 
signiﬁcant contribution to the Group as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer.  He continues to bring new operating techniques 
and ideas to the Group which are having a beneﬁcial impact on improving efﬁciencies.
Current Trading and Prospects
The current structure of Wyndeham has been established following careful analysis of the needs of our markets 
and considerable change has already been implemented to arrive at this position.  Wyndeham is now more efﬁcient 
and is now set to beneﬁt from the reorganisation of the business.
To drive Wyndeham’s growth in 2005 and beyond, the Board has been strengthened, supported by a very able 
management team and our new integrated offering is set to reap further rewards for our customers.
The installation of the second 64 page press at Wyndeham Heron is on track and on budget.  The press will have a 
good base load of new work, following contract wins, when it comes on line in September this year.
In 2005 Wyndeham has started to show the beneﬁts of the changes undergone in previous years.  Despite ongoing 
challenging conditions the Board is cautiously optimistic of further progress this year and thereafter.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Summary
The year under review has been one of signiﬁcant progress.  We have achieved strong ﬁnancial results, with 
increase in turnover and proﬁt, working within a competitive commercial environment.  We have successfully 
implemented a restructuring programme affecting all disciplines and product types, which have realised beneﬁts 
during this period and which will continue to support us in the new ﬁnancial year.
We have won a number of new and high proﬁle contracts which will provide a base loading for our new 64 
page press at Wyndeham Heron, our ﬂagship web offset plant, an investment that keeps us at the forefront of 
technological advances in the print arena.
Looking forward, although margin pressure will remain an issue, we are conﬁdent that our new initiatives planned 
for implementation in the current ﬁnancial year will further enhance our stated strategies to improve efﬁciency 
and reduce costs.
Group Strategy
Our strategy remains to serve a broad range of print markets through a diverse product offering, providing our 
customers with a ‘one stop shop’ for all of their print requirements.
Internally, we continue to promote maximum co-operation and ﬂexibility between all our operations and we are 
structuring the Group management and resources in order to achieve this objective.
We continue to pursue cost and efﬁciency improvements by leveraging the Group resources and by adoption of 
‘World Class’ manufacturing measures.
In addition we will continue to invest in technologically advanced equipment and infrastructure to offer our clients 
competitive advantage and to support Wyndeham’s continued growth.
Group Integration and Reorganisation 
Sales and Marketing
Following the creation of a centralised Group sales team in early 2004 our sales staff are now able to offer the 
whole range of Group options to our customers.  We have already started to realise the beneﬁts, with contract 
wins that have been dependant on this co-ordinated offering and that span a number of Wyndeham sites.  The 
contract awarded to us in December 2004 from the National Magazine Company where we provide both pre-press 
and print services endorses the value of an integrated sales force.
This has been enhanced by the formation of Wyndeham Bespoke, our new Print Management business enabling our 
sales team to offer a range of in house and outsourced solutions.  Print management is a rapidly growing business 
and we are encouraged that Wyndeham Bespoke has already gained an important foothold in the market.
Costs and Efﬁciency
Following the assessment and subsequent centralisation of our purchasing function during the last year, we have 
seen both ﬁnancial beneﬁts and improved service levels.
In addition we continue to work on a number of initiatives to improve efﬁciency and lower operating cost. These 
include: the introduction of ‘Lean Manufacturing’ techniques in a number of Group companies, the closure of 
manufacturing operations at Wyndeham Keyne Print, work previously produced at this site is being successfully 
produced in other Group locations, and a project to examine logistic costs at our major sites.
In order to achieve these business improvement initiatives, we have made a number of key management changes, 
including a new managing director at our continuous stationery business, Wyndeham Print Direct, and the 
appointment of two divisional ﬁnance directors reporting directly to the Group Financial Director.
However, despite the continual pressure on selling prices, we are subject to certain increases in costs.   This year, 
we have incurred extra cost as a result of electricity and gas price increases and these costs which are forecast to 
increase signiﬁcantly again on renewal of contracts. In the year ended 31 March 2005 we suffered a 30% increase 
and we are anticipating a further 45% increase in the current ﬁnancial year. We are active in monitoring and 
assessing cost increases with a view to minimising their impact without affecting the quality of our products. – 7 –
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Capital Investment
As expected, capital investment has remained at a relatively low level this year at £5.2m (2004: £4.4m).
At our half year results we announced the purchase of a new 64 page press for the Heron site at a cost of £7m. 
This is currently being installed and will be operational by September 2005 and will result in capital expenditure of 
approx £10m in total during the current ﬁnancial year.
In addition the Group has also invested in additional improvements to facilitate improved use of resources and 
common working methods across all sites in two areas; pre-press workﬂows and a Group wide production planning 
system. These investments will cost approximately £0.5 million to be spread over 3 years.
Market Conditions
During the year, market conditions have remained challenging.  Advertising levels remained at similar levels to 
the previous year and as a result there has been little change in pagination. Advertising levels in the current year 
are difﬁcult to predict but if the consumer slow down continues it is likely to have an impact. However industry 
statistics show that overall, copy sales have increased and we have seen an increase in new launches in the weekly 
sector, a trend which looks set to continue in the coming year. In the commercial print markets, demand has 
remained stable during the year.  Much commercial print is aimed at the consumer market and we are therefore 
closely monitoring the developments in consumer spending and the response from the business community. 
Magazine
We continue to print a wide range of both consumer and business to business titles, providing a good mix of work 
for all our sites.   
We have won a number of new contracts.  In January we were pleased to announce the signing of a new 5-year 
contract with Haymarket Publishing worth approximately £50m over the contract term of 5 years.  We have also 
won new business with Dennis Publishing and National Magazine Company totalling approximately £4 million per 
annum.
These contracts were targeted in order to provide the right balance of work to utilise the additional capacity which 
will be available following the installation of the 64 page press at Wyndeham Heron. The overall capacity in the 
sector remains an issue and we will remove old equipment as planned to keep supply in line with demand as far 
as possible.
Commercial
Our initiatives put in place to capitalise on the opportunities in this market have been encouraging.  
The centralised sales team, working in tandem with our new Wyndeham Bespoke business have brought a number 
of new opportunities particularly in the ﬁnancial sector.  
We also continue with our work for a number of blue chip clients including: General Motors, Tesco and Thomas 
Cook Holidays. 
Margin pressure remains high in this sector.  We have consolidated capacity with the closure of manufacturing 
operations at Wyndeham Keyne Print and alongside new business opportunities, we continue to look at ways to 
improve efﬁciencies.
Financial Review
Turnover for the year increased by 14% to £141.3m (2004: £123.6m) and this generated operating proﬁt, before 
exceptional costs relating to restructuring (totalling £0.6m) and goodwill amortisation (totalling £1.2m) of £9.5m 
(2004: £6.6m). 
There is a slight reduction in interest payable to £2.0m (2004: £2.3m), due to a reduction in net debt. Proﬁt before 
tax, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation was £7.5m (2004: £4.4m). 
Earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation was 9.8p (2004: 6.9p) reﬂecting a 42% 
increase.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
(continued)
Outlook
Despite the fact that the challenging trading conditions look set to remain, we believe that Wyndeham, with 
our emphasis on investment in improved technology and with our strategy to drive internal improvements on all 
fronts, will continue to show progress this year and onwards.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
This review is intended to serve as an additional explanation to the accounts which follow, summarising some of 
the key details and providing reasons for accounting treatments adopted.
RESULTS
In the year under review operating proﬁt before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items amounted to 
£9.5m (2004: £6.6m) an increase of 44% over the previous year.
The exceptional item of £0.6m this year was re-organisation costs, last year the exceptional items of £0.8m were  
bad debts net of provisions and re-organisation costs.
Amortisation of goodwill this year was £1.2m (2004: £1.0m).
The net interest charge for the year was £2.0m (2004: £2.2m) reﬂecting a reduction in borrowings.
The proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was £7.5m (2004: 
£4.4m) an increase of 70%.
The proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation was £5.7m (2004: £2.6m).  The tax charge for the year was £2.5m 
(2004: £1.2m) representing an effective rate of 43% (2004: 46%).  This high effective rate arises principally from 
the disallowance of goodwill amortisation for tax purposes.
The proposed ﬁnal dividend for the year is 3.03p per share (2004: 2.75p) making a total distribution for the year 
of 4.68p (2004: 4.25p).  The dividend will absorb £2.4m (2004: £1.9m) and is covered 1.4 times (2004: 0.7 times), 
leaving a proﬁt of £0.9m (2004: loss of £0.5m) to be transferred to reserves.
BALANCE SHEET
Our balance sheet has shown a considerable improvement in strength this year with the restructuring of our debt 
facilities by taking out a new ten year loan replacing existing short term borrowings, with our bankers Barclays 
Bank PLC. Net current liabilities have reduced from £16.5m to £2.4m. Included in creditors due within one year are 
items which fall due over the year including corporation tax which is payable by quarterly instalments and ﬁnance 
lease obligations which are payable by regular monthly instalments. This means that although the Group balance 
sheet shows net current liabilities the group cash ﬂow projections show that the Group can meet all its obligations 
as they fall due.
CASH FLOWS, CASH AND DEBT
The Group cash ﬂow statement is set out in full on page 28.  Over the year there has been a net inﬂow of £1.1m.  
Our net borrowings reduced from £30.3m to £28.2m by the year end of which £10.5m is at ﬁxed rates ranging 
from 4.4% to 7.5%.  The balance is at 1% over base rate and this averaged 5.6% during the period.  Given the high 
level of operating gearing within a printing business, we believe our optimal level of debt/equity is between 50% 
and 100%.  In measuring our ﬁnancial leverage and stability we pay more regard to interest cover than gearing 
because the latter is affected by the goodwill writeoffs associated with previous acquisitions.  Interest cover has 
increased from 2.2 times to 3.8 times and gearing reduced to 49% (2004: 55%).  Our targets are a minimum of 4 
times interest cover and a maximum of 100% gearing.  We purchased ﬁnishing equipment, pre-press equipment 
and extended one of our factories at a total cost of £5.2m.
The Group has a progressive dividend policy.  Dividend growth will follow earnings growth and we will aim in the 
future to maintain dividend cover at our target of 3 times.  We believe this level of cover should generate sufﬁcient 
retained capital to support the equity component of our investment programme.
For major deposits, our policy remains that we expect the bank concerned to maintain a long term credit rating 
of AA or better
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
The company will be required to use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the preparation of the 
Group ﬁnancial statements with effect from the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2006, including the Interim Report 
for the six months ending 30 September 2005, and restatement of comparative ﬁgures. – 10 –
FINANCIAL REVIEW
We stated in the 2004 Annual Report and Accounts that the company had commenced work on its project to 
review the impact of IFRS, and work on the project has continued in the period since. The key areas of impact 
on the proﬁt and loss account and balance sheet are likely to be in accounting for goodwill, and for share-based 
payments. There will also be other areas of less signiﬁcance. It is our intention to publish a restatement of the 
results for the year ended 31 March 2005 at or around the time of the publication of the interim results for the six 
months ending 30 September 2005 to allow the impact to be interpreted and understood. During the transition to 
IFRS we will provide reconciliations between IFRS and current UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice to help 
with this understanding. 
Eight new Financial Reporting Standards have been issued since the last Annual Report and there have also been 
two Urgent Issue Task Force pronouncements during the year. 
We believe that we have complied with the requirements of these Financial Reporting Standards and the UITF 
pronouncements where applicable.
TREASURY POLICY
The Group maintains a centralised treasury function which reports to the Group Finance Director and which 
operates within written policies approved by the Board and within the Group’s internal control framework.  All 
treasury activities are focused on risk management with no transactions being undertaken on a speculative basis.
The object of the treasury function is to manage the Group’s banking relationships and arrange centrally an 
appropriate mix of bank facilities to meet anticipated borrowing requirements.  It also provides advice to subsidiaries 
on banking, reporting and ﬁnancing; monitors the activities of local cash management; and the administration of 
intra-Group borrowings.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign 
currency contracts) during the year.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments 
shall be undertaken.
Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁts and bank and ﬁnance lease borrowings.  
The Group borrows in sterling and euros at both ﬁxed and variable rates of interest to manage the Group’s exposure 
to interest rate ﬂuctuations.  The Group’s policy is to keep the split of borrowing between ﬁxed and variable rates 
of interest under regular review.
Liquidity risk
As regards liquidity, the Group’s policy has throughout the year been that, to ensure continuity of funding, 
repayment periods on all borrowings are appropriately matched to the forecast income streams from the assets to 
which the borrowing relates.
Short-term ﬂexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Currency risk
The Group purchased plant in the past with the assistance of a loan denominated in Euros, the balance outstanding 
at 31 March 2005 being £0.1m.  The Group has a cash ﬂow of income in Euros from customers which is sufﬁcient 
to fund the servicing of the debt.  The limited foreign currency risk to which the Group is exposed is, therefore, 
effectively minimised.  During the year currency movements had minimal impact on proﬁts.
Effect of interest rates
The Group’s borrowings and cash are all held in sterling and euros.  At present our borrowings are split between 
variable and ﬁxed rates of interest.  The signiﬁcant element of our debt comprises ﬁnance lease contracts for the 
purchase of our plant.  The remainder comprises bank loans originally taken out to fund the consideration for the 
acquisition of Print Direct and to ﬁnance the purchase of property and equipment.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND BENCHMARKING OF PERFORMANCE
We benchmark our performance against a peer group of comparable businesses (Bemrose, Fulmar, Polestar, St Ives).  
We aim for top quartile performance compared to this group in the following categories: operating proﬁt as a 
percentage of sales, return on capital employed, proﬁt per employee, proportion of repeat business.  We believe 
we currently rank in the second quartile of the printing sector on these criteria.
The Group achieved a return on capital employed before exceptional items of 6.6%.  In the long-term our objective 
is a steady rise in return on capital employed as a result of acquisitions, capital expenditure programmes and 
improvements in efﬁciency and machine utilisation.
TAXATION
The effective rate of taxation on proﬁt before the amortisation of goodwill for 2005 was 35.6% (2004: 32.9%).   
Full provision for deferred taxation has been made on all timing differences.
GOING CONCERN
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  For this reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.

£1.4m).  The directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 3.03p (2004: 2.75p) per share, making a total for the year of 
4.68p (2004: 4.25p) per share.  Dividends paid and proposed for the year amounted to £2.4m (2004: £1.9m) leaving

EMPLOYMENT POLICY 
The Company offers equal opportunities in recruitment, training and promotion and in terms and conditions of 
employment without discrimination on grounds of colour, ethnic or racial origin, nationality, disability, sexuality 
or marital status.
Companies in the Group are charged with ensuring that all employees understand their responsibility for the 
active implementation of this policy.  Responsibility for implementing recruitment policy, staff training and 
development lies with the operating divisions.  Wyndeham Press Group recognises the great importance of internal 
communication and consultation.  The operating divisions have clear responsibility for keeping their employees 
fully informed about the state of the business.
Incentive programmes and performance-related bonuses for managers are being used increasingly throughout the 
Group.  Decision making is devolved to the greatest extent possible and an individual’s performance is measured 
and rewarded against clearly deﬁned objectives.
The terms and scope of these programmes, as well as of the share option scheme which is in place, are kept under 
constant review.
SUPPLIERS
The Group recognises the importance of maintaining business relationships with its suppliers and settles their 
invoices within agreed terms unless there are good reasons not to do so. 
Trade creditors of the Group at 31 March 2005 were equivalent to 73  days (2004: 78 days)  purchases, based on the 
average daily amount invoiced by suppliers to the Group during the year.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
It is the Group’s policy to seek continually to eliminate and where this is not practicable, to minimise negative 
environmental impacts from the Group’s operations whilst continuing to produce high quality products to its 
customers’ needs, speciﬁcation and satisfaction.
Environmental impact is considered throughout the organisation, with particular emphasis placed upon:
• design and development of new products and processes;
• selection of raw materials and suppliers;
• internal production methods to include:
o reducing wastage
o reducing energy usage
o reducing the use of scarce resources, including raw materials;
• minimising the use and controlling the disposal of hazardous substances;
• controlling emissions to air, drainage and landﬁll.
It is the Group’s policy to comply with all statutory environmental requirements as a minimum and to aim to 
improve upon the standards set by local regulatory authorities. To this end each subsidiary is regularly reviewed by 
the Environmental Management Team to:
• benchmark performance across the group;
• help sites identify and prioritise issues for improvement;
• ensure legal compliance.
The results of the reviews are communicated directly to the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and appropriate action is 
taken.
In line with our practice of having measurable performance standards, the group has initiated a programme under 
which all of our operations are targeting the achievement of accreditation under the international environmental 
management standard ISO 14001. Wyndeham Gait became the ﬁrst company in the Group to achieve this standard 
in September 2004. It is our aim that all sites will achieve accreditation by the end of 2006.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
(continued) – 16 –
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance.  This statement describes how the Company 
applies the provisions of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Shareholder Relations
The Board seeks to present a balanced and understandable image of the Group’s position and prospects by way 
of its Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Report and press releases.  We have a web site (www.wyndeham.
co.uk) which provides information on all the companies in the Group and has updates on ﬁnancial and operational 
developments.  The full Annual Report and Accounts and the half-year Interim Report are sent to all shareholders 
and are accessible on our web site.  Members of the Board hold regular meetings with institutional shareholders 
to discuss Group strategy and objectives and to gain an understanding of their views about the Company.
An overview of the Group’s progress is presented at the Annual General Meeting and shareholders have the 
opportunity to raise matters of interest with the members of the Board.  The 2005 Annual Report and notice of 
the Annual General Meeting will be sent to shareholders at least 20 business days prior to the 2005 Annual General 
Meeting.
Membership of the Board Committees and a summary of their terms of reference are as follows:
The Board
The Company’s Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, four other executive directors and 
two other non-executive directors, both of whom, in the opinion of the Board, are independent.  The directors 
possess a range of experience to enable them to bring independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, 
resources and standards of conduct which is vital to the success of the Group. The Board is responsible to shareholders 
for the proper management of the Group.
The Chairman has primary responsibility for the running of the Board and for ensuring effective communication 
with shareholders. The Chief Executive is responsible for operations and for the development of strategic plans 
and initiatives for consideration by the Board. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive has been clearly established and agreed by the Board. John Jeremy is the Senior Independent Director 
of the Company.
The Chairman had no other signiﬁcant commitments during the year.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved to it for decision. All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. In addition, the Company Secretary 
ensures that the directors have access to appropriate training as necessary. The non-executive directors have 
a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by executive directors are fully discussed and 
critically examined.
To enable them to fulﬁl their roles all directors have full and timely access to all relevant information. The Board 
meets regularly and not less than six times a year and there is frequent contact between meetings to progress the 
Company’s business.
In addition to the roles described above, the non-executive directors play a major role on three key committees 
of the Board which are vital to effective corporate governance.  All directors, except the Chief Executive, are 
required to submit themselves for re-election at least every three years. In accordance with the Code, the Board 
has reviewed the independence of Mr J L Jeremy, who has served on the Board in excess of nine years. The review 
concluded that Mr Jeremy is independent in character and in the exercise of his judgement and for these reasons 
the Board considers him to be independent. In accordance with the Code, Mr Jeremy will stand for annual re-
election at each Annual General Meeting.
The performance of the Board, its non-executive directors and sub-committees was formally evaluated during 
the year. The evaluation was conducted by means of a detailed questionnaire completed by all directors. The 
results of this questionnaire were compiled by the Company Secretary for review by the Chairman and the Board 
as a whole. The non-executive directors appraise the performance of the Chairman through discussions with all 
the directors individually, and together with the Chairman they appraise the performance of the Chief Executive. 
The performance of the executive directors is monitored throughout the year by the Chief Executive and the 
Chairman. – 17 –
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
(continued)
The Chairman meets periodically with the non-executive directors, without the executive directors present, to 
discuss a range of issues including strategy, ﬁnancial performance, progress towards targets and the performance 
of the executive directors. 
During the year ended 31 March 2005 the Board met 9 times to deal with regular business, this is felt to be 
adequate to enable effective running of the Company. The attendance record of individual Directors at Board and 
Committee meetings is detailed below.

Audit Committee
Members: P A W Barber , J L Jeremy (Chairman), R Stokell
Terms of reference: To assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities for corporate governance, ﬁnancial 
reporting and corporate control, and to keep under review the scope and results of the 
external audit and its cost effectiveness, and the independence and objectivity of the 
auditors. At some of the meetings the external auditors and the Finance Director are asked 
to attend. The Committee also meets with the external auditors in private.
 The Committee reviews all published accounts and post audit ﬁndings before their 
presentation to the Board, focusing in particular on accounting policies, compliance, 
management judgement and estimates. It also monitors the Group’s internal control and 
risk management regime (including the effectiveness of the internal audit function) and 
ﬁnancial reporting. Any signiﬁcant ﬁndings or identiﬁed weaknesses are closely examined so 
that appropriate action can be taken, monitored and reported to the Board. 
 The Audit Committee also advises the Board on the appointment of external auditors and 
on the scope, results and cost effectiveness of their audit work. The Committee has adopted 
a policy which prohibits certain types of non-audit work that may be performed by the 
Company’s auditors, particularly where auditor objectivity and independence would be at 
risk. Other non-audit work which may be provided by the auditor is put to tender where 
considered appropriate. The Audit Committee also assesses the overall objectivity of the 
auditors’ services so that an independent professional relationship is maintained. Details of 
the auditors’ remuneration appear in note 4 to the accounts. – 18 –
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
(continued)
Remuneration Committee
Members: P A W Barber, J L Jeremy (Chairman)
Terms of reference: To recommend to the Board the remuneration policies for executive directors.  To determine 
the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman.
Nomination Committee
Members: P A W Barber, B S Bedson, J L Jeremy (Chairman)
Terms of reference:  To review the composition and structure of the Board and to identify and recommend 
candidates for executive and non-executive positions, based on the required role and 
capabilities which have been speciﬁed for their appointment. Executive search consultants 
are used by the Committee to assist this process as appropriate.
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  Such a 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s 
signiﬁcant risks, that it has been in place for the year ended 31 March 2005 and up to the date of approval of the 
annual report and accounts, that it is regularly reviewed by the Board and that it accords with the internal control 
guidance for directors on the Combined Code.
The Board receives reports setting out key performance and risk indicators and considers possible control issues 
brought to their attention by early warning mechanisms which are embedded within the operational units and 
reinforced by risk awareness training.  The Board and the audit committee also receive regular reports from the 
internal audit and ‘health, safety and environmental monitoring’ functions which include recommendations for 
improvement.  The audit committee’s role in this area is conﬁned to a high-level review of the arrangements for 
internal ﬁnancial control.  The Board’s agenda includes a regular item for consideration of risk and control and 
receives reports thereon from the audit committee.  The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance 
and not merely reporting by exception.  
At its June 2005 meeting, the Board carried out the annual assessment for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 
considering documentation from management and internal audit and taking account of events since 31 March 
2005.
Auditor independence
The auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit services that would compromise their independence or 
violate any laws or regulations affecting their appointment as auditors. Approval of the Board is required prior 
to awarding contracts for non-audit services to the external auditors. The external auditors report to the Audit 
Committee annually on their independence from the Company, including periodic rotation of key partners.
Compliance with the code provisions
The directors consider that the Company has, during the year ended 31 March 2005 complied with the requirements 
of the revised Combined Code except as follows:
Speciﬁed Terms of Appointment
The non-executive directors have not been appointed for speciﬁed terms.  Under the Company’s articles one third 
of the directors must stand for re-election at each Annual General Meeting and therefore the Board feel that 
speciﬁed terms for non-executive directors are unnecessary.
From 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2005 Mr Bedson had the dual role of Chief Executive and Chairman, this is a breach 
of the Combined Code provision A2.1. From 1 April 2005 he relinquished his role of Chief Executive but continues 
as Chairman. On appointment as Chairman he did not meet the independence criteria required by Code provision 
A2.2. – 19 –
THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Shareholder Approval
In accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, an ordinary resolution to approve this 
Remuneration Report will be put to the Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2005.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of all the non-executive directors.  The Committee’s members during 
the year were John Jeremy (who chairs the Committee) and Peter Barber, neither of whom has any business 
relationship with the Company which might interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement on 
remuneration matters.  The Chairman is invited to attend Committee meetings in an advisory capacity but is not 
present during discussions relating to his own remuneration.  The Committee also seeks advice as appropriate 
from external remuneration consultants, but no advice was sought in the year.
Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
The Committee reviews the Company’s policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and makes 
recommendations to the Board. The Committee applied the following remuneration policy to all executive 
directors during the year.  The Committee intends that the remuneration of all executive directors will continue to 
be determined on these principles but will be subject to a review by the Committee in the light of any legislative, 
regulatory and/or market practice changes.  The Company’s policy is to provide remuneration opportunities linked 
to and dependent upon the performance of the Group.  In making its recommendations the Committee seeks 
to follow the principles and provisions set out in Section 1 Part B and Schedule A of the Combined Code.  Total 
remuneration packages for the executive directors are intended to take account of:
- the size and nature of the Company’s business and the particular duties and responsibilities of the role;
- conditions prevailing in the employment market generally;
- the remuneration of senior management of other public companies in the printing industry (media 
sector) which the Company measures itself against; and
- the qualiﬁcations and experience of the individual concerned.
It is the Committee’s opinion that remuneration packages should strike a balance between ﬁxed and performance-
related elements of pay.  The ﬁxed element of the remuneration package i.e. basic salary, beneﬁts and contributions 
to personal pension funds, is set at relative medium levels with respect to other companies in the printing sector.  
The variable elements (discretionary annual bonus scheme, share options and the Long Term Incentive Plan) 
have been designed to provide the executive directors with the opportunity to earn further rewards but only in 
recognition of superior performance.
Performance Related Bonus
Executive Directors can earn an annual bonus for the achievement of speciﬁc ﬁnancial and qualitative targets set 
by the Remuneration Committee and dependent upon individual performance.
By reference to corporate budgets the Committee sets the level of ﬁnancial targets at which bonuses are paid 
before the commencement of each ﬁnancial year.  The highest levels of bonus (up to 50% of salaries) are paid on 
achievement of performance as determined by the committee.  Bonuses are non-pensionable.
Contracts of Service
In line with the recommendation of the Combined Code all contracts have a maximum of a 12 month or less notice 
period with the exception of Mr Bedson. Since the year end Mr Bedson has relinquished his Chief Executive role 
and continues solely as Chairman. His new contract is for a ﬁxed term ending 31 March 2007. No compensation 
payments for loss of ofﬁce were made to Directors during the year. – 20 –
THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
(continued)
Incentive Schemes
There are two Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS) in existence; an Inland Revenue Approved Scheme and an 
Unapproved Scheme.
The ESOS are share option schemes developed in line with long established market practice.  Under the approved 
scheme each individual participant is subject to a maximum £30,000 of options granted during a rolling ten year 
period.  Under the unapproved scheme each individual participant is subject to a 100% remuneration cap on the 
number of options at the option price granted each year.
Share options are granted to each Executive Director at a level of up to one times salary.  All grants are discretionary 
and awards may be varied depending on the speciﬁc circumstances including the performance of the Director to 
date and are not subject to future performance criteria.
Options granted may not normally be exercised earlier than 3 years or more than 10 years after the date of the 
grant.  Early exercise is permitted in certain speciﬁc cases, such as retirement, redundancy or the sale of the whole 
or part of the business.  Shares issued on exercise of options rank pari passu with existing shares.
Total options granted to employees under the schemes during the ﬁnancial year were as follows:
Date Number Exercise Price
7 December 2004 85,000 130.5p
Details of options outstanding at the end of the ﬁnancial year are given in Note 20 on page 43.
Long Term Incentive Plan
A Long Term Incentive Plan for future awards was approved at the Annual General Meeting held on 22 July 
2003.  The plan provides for an annual award of shares worth up to 100% of salary.  Vesting of the awards will be 
conditional upon achieving performance conditions that requires the Group’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) 
growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus a further percentage per annum over a period of 
3 years measured from a ﬁxed base point at the date of setting the award target.
Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors do not have service agreements with the Company.  They are subject to re-election at 
least every three years. A non-executive director’s appointment may be terminated on his not being re-elected by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.  The dates of appointment or re-election are as follows:
P A W Barber 20 July 2004
J L Jeremy 22 July 2003
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board of Directors with the assistance of 
independent advice concerning comparable organisations and appointments.  Fees are reviewed on an annual 
basis and were last increased on 1 April 2004.   – 21 –

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are required by UK company law to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and 
of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that year.  In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required 
to select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently, to make reasonable and prudent judgements 
and estimates and to follow applicable accounting standards.  The directors are also responsible for maintaining 
adequate accounting records, for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting fraud and 
other irregularities, and for preparing the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors’ report and other information included in the Annual 
Report is prepared in accordance with company law in the United Kingdom.  They are also responsible for ensuring 
that the Annual Report includes information required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.  The 
Group makes its Annual Report and Accounts available on its website and the maintenance and integrity of the 
website is the responsibility of the directors.   – 25 –
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF WYNDEHAM PRESS GROUP PLC
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements on pages 26  to 47. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the 
Companies Act 1985 contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report under the headings directors’ emoluments, directors’ pension contributions,  
directors’ share options and long term incentive plan (“the auditable part”).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.  Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the 
auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting 
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Code 
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.  We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements.  This 
other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, 
the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review and the Corporate Governance Statement.  We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.  Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.  It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the 
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements  and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.  In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
OPINION
In our opinion:-
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 March 2005 and of the Group 
proﬁt for the year then ended;  and
• the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
Year ended 31 March 2005
1.      ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting convention
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards.  
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts of Wyndeham Press Group PLC incorporate the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 31 March 2005.  Where subsidiary undertakings are acquired or disposed of during the 
year the proﬁt attributable to shareholders includes proﬁts or losses from the effective date of acquisition or to 
the effective date of disposal.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 1998 and earlier periods was written off to reserves 
in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.  As permitted by the current standard the goodwill 
previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.  On disposal of a previously 
acquired business the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining 
the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is capitalised and classiﬁed as an asset on the balance sheet.  
The provision for amortisation of goodwill is on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, being a period 
of up to 20 years.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost.  The provision for depreciation of ﬁxed assets is on a straight line basis at rates 
estimated to be sufﬁcient to write off the assets, less any residual value, over the terms of their working lives 
under normal conditions from the date the asset is brought into use.  The signiﬁcant rates of depreciation are as 
follows:
 Freehold land   nil
 Freehold buildings  2%
 Short leasehold property  Over the term of the lease
 Plant, equipment & vehicles  10% - 50%
Finance leases
Assets held under ﬁnance leases (including hire purchase contracts) are treated as tangible ﬁxed assets, depreciation 
is provided accordingly and the capital element of future payments is included in creditors.  Interest payable under 
ﬁnance leases and rental costs arising from operating leases are charged to the proﬁt and loss account as they 
arise.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in a liability for tax in 
the future.  Deferred taxation is provided on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the periods in which timing differences reverse.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress have been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost comprises labour, 
materials and overheads related to production.    – 32 –
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
(continued)
1.      ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Pension contributions
The Group operates a number of deﬁned contribution pension schemes.  The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.  The contributions are charged to the 
proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange current at the dates of the 
transactions.  Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities in the balance sheet are translated into sterling at 
the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the year except where the rate has been ﬁxed by agreement.
Share based payments
The Group operates an executive share option plan that gives rise to a proﬁt and loss charge in respect of the 
intrinsic value of the award. The cost of the shares that are expected to be awarded under each plan, measured 
using the share price at grant date, is amortised on an even basis over the vesting period. This is usually a period 
of not less than three years.
2. TURNOVER
Turnover represents charges for goods delivered to customers during the year, excluding VAT.
All operations are classed as continuing.
All proﬁts arose from operations carried on in the United Kingdom.  An analysis of turnover by geographic area 
of destination is as follows:
2005 2004
£’000 £’000
United Kingdom 140,518 122,826
Continental Europe 785 801

3. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
2005 RATIONALISATION
The decision to rationalise the manufacturing at Wyndeham Keyne Print into our other sites was made in March 
2005 and necessitated a re-organisation which resulted in one-off exceptional costs, including redundancies, of 
£0.6m. There has been no effect on the Group cash ﬂow for the year ended 31 March 2005 as all the cost will be 
paid in the year ending 31 March 2006.
2004 RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND BAD DEBTS
The re-organisation of the sales force and the rationalisation of the management within the web companies 
resulted in one-off exceptional costs of £0.5m. There were also three exceptional bad debts in the period, which 
were £0.3m net of provisions. – 33 –

The basic earnings per ordinary share amounting to 6.6p (2004: 3.3p) have been calculated on £3.3m (2004: £1.4m) 
being the consolidated proﬁt on ordinary activities after taxation attributable to members of the Company for the 
year ended 31 March 2005, and are based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and to be 
issued of 49,766,374 (2004: 43,761,175).
The fully diluted earnings per share amounting to 6.5p (2004: 3.2p) for the year have been calculated on the basis 
of adding 771,083 (2004: 290,581) to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to take account of 
the dilutive effect of the outstanding share options and shares to be issued to give 50,537,457 (2004: 44,051,756)

the amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items. It has been calculated on £4.9m (2004: £3.0m) being the 
consolidated proﬁt on ordinary activities after taxation before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items for 
the year and 49,766,374 (2004: 43,761,175) shares being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue

The Wyndeham Press Group Employee Beneﬁts Trust (“EBT”) was established to hedge the future obligations 
of the Group in respect of shares awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The Trustee of the EBT 
purchases or subscribes for the Company’s Ordinary Shares at the market price with ﬁnancing provided by the 
Company, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated share liabilities of the Group. The EBT 
has, since September 2004 waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of all its holding of the 
Company’s Ordinary Shares. The EBT’s waiver of dividends may be revoked or varied at any time.
The cost of the shares expected to be awarded under the plan is amortised over the period from the original grant 
of the particular award to the time of vesting. This is normally a period of not less than three years.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Explanatory Notes
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting and its explanatory notes are important and require your immediate 
attention.  If you are in any doubt as to what action you should take, you should consult your stockbroker, bank 
manager, solicitor, accountant or other appropriately authorised ﬁnancial adviser.
The Annual General Meeting is a meeting of shareholders which the Company holds each year.  This year the 
Directors are asking shareholders to approve 11 resolutions.
Resolution 1: To receive the Report of the Directors and the Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2005.
 The Directors will present to the meeting the Report of the Directors and the Accounts for the 
year ended 31 March 2005. 
Resolution 2: To approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report contained in the Company’s Annual Report for 
2005.
 The Directors will present to the meeting the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 19 to 23 
of the Annual Report for 2005.
Resolution 3: To approve the ﬁnal dividend of 3.03p per share for the year ended 31 March 2005. 
 The shareholders are asked to declare a ﬁnal dividend, which cannot exceed the 3.03p per share 
the directors recommend.  If approved the Company will pay its ﬁnal dividend on 31 August 
2005 to holders of ordinary shares who were on the register of members on 5 August 2005.
Resolutions 4 & 5: To re-elect directors.
 The Company’s Articles of Association requires that one third of the directors (to the nearest 
whole number)  shall retire by rotation each year and seek re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting.  The two directors who retire by rotation this year are Mr A J Austin and Mr E R 
Heron.  Mr Austin has a service contract with the Company which requires 3 months notice of 
termination. Mr Heron has a service contract with the Company which requires 3 months notice 
of termination.
Resolution 6: To re-elect a director.
 The Companies Act 1985 requires that any director over the age 70 must retire and seek re-
election at the Annual General Meeting.  Mr P A W Barber retires in accordance with the 
Companies Act and will be proposed for re-election.
Resolution 7: To re-elect a director.
 The Combined Code requires that any non-executive director who has served more than nine 
years on the Board must retire and seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting. Mr J L 
Jeremy retires in accordance with the Combined Code and will be proposed for re-election.
Resolution 8: Reappointment and remuneration of the independent auditors.
 This is a resolution to reappoint Baker Tilly as the Company’s auditors and to authorise the 
directors to agree their remuneration.
Resolution 9: Authority to allot shares.
 The Companies Act 1985 (the “Act”) prevents the directors of a company allotting unissued 
shares without the authority of the shareholders in general meeting.  In certain circumstances, 
this could unduly restrict directors from carrying on the Company’s business to its best 
advantage.  Authority is, therefore, sought for your directors to be able to allot unissued 
shares if it becomes beneﬁcial to the Company to do so, subject to the Investment Protection 
Committee’s guidelines on the maximum percentage of shares that the authority should cover 
(ie. 1/3 of the issued ordinary share capital). – 52 –
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Explanatory Notes (continued)
Resolution 10: Authority to allot shares without pre-emption requirements.
 The Act also requires that equity securities being issued for cash must ﬁrst be offered to all 
existing relevant shareholders unless the directors have been empowered to allot them without 
regard to this statutory pre-emption requirement.  The directors are, therefore, seeking power 
under resolution 9, set out in the Notice of General Meeting on pages 48 and 49 to allot equity 
securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of £506,795 (2,533,974 ordinary shares) 
representing 5% of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as 
at 31 March 2005 without ﬁrst offering the securities to existing ordinary shareholders.  The 
power sought is in accordance with the pre-emption guidelines of The Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority.  Resolution 9 also permits the directors to give shareholders in 
certain overseas countries the value, in money’s worth, of any right instead of securities being 
issued and to make any other exclusions or arrangements to deal with such difﬁculties.  This 
authority will terminate at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting to be held in 
2006 or the day 15 months from the passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 11: Authority to purchase own shares.
 This resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, gives the Company authority 
to purchase its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the Companies Act 1985.  
The authority limits the number of shares that could be purchased to a maximum of 7,601,922 
(representing 15%  of the issued share capital as at 31 March 2005) and sets maximum and 
minimum prices.  This authority will terminate at the conclusion of the next annual general 
meeting to be held in 2006 or the day 15 months from the passing of the resolution, whichever 
is the earlier.  The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase 
the Company’s ordinary shares but will keep the matter under review.  The authority will be 
exercised only if the directors believe that to do so would result in an increase in earnings per 
share and would be in the best interests of the shareholders generally.  Any purchases would be 
by means of a market purchase through the London Stock Exchange.  All shares so purchased 
would be cancelled so that the effect would be to reduce the number of ordinary shares in 
issue.
Resolution 12: To transact any other business of an Annual General Meeting. FORM OF PROXY

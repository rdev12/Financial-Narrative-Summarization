Strategy
Our objective is to acquire and develop
specialist support services businesses that have
the potential for growth, either organically or
in combination with other complementary
businesses. We are very much focussed on the
Emergency Repair and Document Handling
sectors.
Results
Revenue in 2007 was £68,153,000 (2006:
£42,453,000) and the profit before tax was
£5,047,000 (2006: £3,751,000). The profit
before amortisation of intangible assets, share
based payments charge and notional interest
on contingent consideration was £7,289,000
(see Chief Executive’s review for analysis)
(2006: £5,044,000). The basic earnings per
ordinary share were 0.56p (2006: 0.66p).
However, the measure we focus on as a Board
is the fully diluted earnings per share before
amortisation of intangible assets, share based
payments charge and notional interest on
contingent consideration. At this level, the
earnings per share for 2007 were 0.96p
compared to 0.81p in 2006, an increase of
19%. At 31 December 2007, net debt of the
Group amounted to £30,917,000 (2006:
£17,649,000).
Dividends
Mavinwood intends to re-invest profits in the
business and the Board do not recommend
declaring a dividend (2006: Nil).
Board
There were several changes to the Board
during 2007. Bob Guthrie was appointed as a
Non-Executive Director on 13 June 2007. Bob
was managing director of UK retail at the
international insurance broker, Willis Group
Limited, for 15 years. He has an in-depth
knowledge of and excellent relationships with
the UK insurance industry.
Also on 13 June 2007, Steve Watkins at that
time a Non-Executive Director, agreed to
become an Executive Director. Steve became
the Divisional Director responsible for the
Emergency Repair business. He was managing
director of ANSA, which specialises in drainage
surveys and repairs, for four years to 2005
when the company was acquired by
Mavinwood.
John Minton resigned on 26 October 2007 due
to ill health. John developed Restore with his
business partner prior to acquisition by
Mavinwood and assisted the expansion of the
Document Handling division. We all wish him
well with his early retirement. Ed Marshall,
Managing Director of Document Control
Services, has assumed John’s executive
responsibilities for our Document Handling
Division comprising Restore, Wansdyke and
Document Control Services.
People
The Group employed 1,262 people at 31
December 2007 (2006: 880 people). I would
like to express my thanks to all of them for
their respective contributions in 2007. 
Outlook
The Mavinwood Group ended the year with
two well established divisions and a current
market capitalisation in excess of £70 million.
Integration benefits are coming through in
the two divisions as well as good underlying
organic growth. After a few months of lower
than normal volumes at the end of 2007,
particularly in drainage, the Emergency Repair
business has started 2008 well with
instructions back to their early 2007 levels. The
Document Handling industry continues to
grow strongly in 2008 and our business is well
placed within the industry. 
We plan to add further complementary
businesses to divisions on a selective basis and
given the cash generative qualities of the
Group, there is scope over time to acquire
further businesses for cash.

Profit Before Tax
The profit before tax for the year ended 
31 December 2007 was £5,047,000 
(2006: £3,751,000). However, the Directors
believe that an adjusted measure of profit
before tax and earnings per share provides
shareholders with a more appropriate
representation of the underlying earnings
derived from the Mavinwood Group’s
business. The items adjusted for in arriving at
that underlying level are as follows:
2007 2006

Emergency Repair 7,152 4,832
Document Handling 3,886 2,459

* Independent Inspections five and a half months

** Peter Cox three months in 2007
*** Excluding share based payments charge
The significant increase in sales and profit in
this division is principally due to the fact that
Independent Inspections and Mono Services
were only included for part of 2006 compared
to a full twelve months in 2007. The 2007
figures include Peter Cox for three months.  
This division includes three businesses which
serve principally the insured repair sector.
Approximately 80% of sales in 2007 were to
leading insurance companies and we also
service a range of housing associations and
commercial companies. Peter Cox currently
carries out little insurance work and most of
its sales leads come from referrals or
household directories.
All four businesses share a common business
process which is:
• Take the emergency call from the
customer or via an insurer
• Arrange a survey to validate or repudiate
the claim and cost out the repair
• Undertake the repair either by directly
employed labour or sub contractors
ANSA specialises in drainage surveys and
repair, Independent Inspections in flooring
surveys and restoration and Mono Services in
building fabric surveys and repairs, often due
to water damage.

Mavinwood plc
ANSA, Independent Inspections and Peter Cox
are national businesses and Mono Services is a
regional business in the North West.  
There is some customer overlap between the
businesses but one of our opportunities
moving forward is to offer all our services to a
wider range of customers.
All these businesses operate to high service
standards. Examples of customer satisfaction
measures that are monitored on a continuous
basis are:
• Response times in terms of contacting a
policyholder after they report an insured
event
• Courtesy of staff and customer satisfaction
• Average cost per claim
There are integration benefits to flow
between the businesses. A range of
integration projects are underway including:
• Optimising the IT platform across all the
operations
• Purchasing initiatives 
• Optimising back office functions
• Reviewing marketing opportunities and
widening the service offering
As well as good organic growth within the
division, we will continue to look for bolt on
acquisitions which would further enhance our
offering.
Turning to the highlights within each
operation:
ANSA
After a strong start to the year, ANSA’s volume
of insurance instructions dropped overall
comparing 2007 with calendar 2006. The heavy
flooding over the summer reduced the number
of blockages we needed to attend. This wet
weather was then followed by one of the
driest autumns on record. This had the effect
of reducing root ingress into the drains.
Without the build up of water a number of
householders would not have been aware their
drains were blocked. Right at the year end,
December saw a sharp drop in volumes. This
pattern was a feature of the whole drainage
industry in the second half of the year. 
ANSA did benefit from an improved mix of
business with an increased proportion of larger
jobs in 2007. 
During January and February 2008, volumes of
instructions received from the insurers have
returned back to the levels seen during the
first half of 2007. 
ANSA has extended its drainage services to a
wider range of customers in the commercial
sector. This is still a relatively small part of the
ANSA business but after extensive trialling in
2007 we have national coverage and are
growing a number of regional and national
accounts.
Operating profit at ANSA has increased due to
an improved mix of business, cost reductions
and productivity gains. Customers have
benefited from strong performance in claims
validation, service delivery and cost control.
From October we renewed a contract with one
leading insurer and this arrangement will run
for three years.
In February 2007, ANSA acquired ESG Limited,
a small drainage contractor for £0.2 million.
This acquisition has helped to increase the
proportion of repair work that is being carried
out by direct labour as opposed to sub
contractors.
ANSA also owned a small business offering
Health and Safety training. Revenue in the first
six months of 2007 was £617,000. The trade
and assets of this operation were sold to the
training management team on 29 June 2007 at
net book value of £556,000. 
Independent Inspections
After suffering through low volumes in the first
quarter, a series of cost reduction and profit

Chief
Executive’s
Review
211679_pp04-pp11.qxp  18/3/08  19:09  Page 6 improvement initiatives were made. The
summer floods were positive for Independent
Inspections as a large number of floor
coverings were destroyed or damaged. New
income streams were developed later in the
year which has broadened the base of the
business.  
Mono Services
Mono Services sales have increased by
approximately one fifth compared to 2006
due to winning new business, helped by the
storm damage over the 2006/7 winter and
the summer floods. Some of Mono Services’
business has been re-directed via an insurer’s
joint venture partner that has caused some
disruption to our operations. This resulted in
transition and set up costs that reduced
margins during the year. 
The acquisition of Peter Cox with its network
of branches and its integration with Mono
Services will enable us to build a national
building fabric solution for insurers. 
Peter Cox
Peter Cox was acquired on 28 September
2007. It is a national provider of damp and
water proofing, timber preservation and wall
stabilisation for property in the United
Kingdom. Peter Cox has a network of 17
branches in England and Scotland and
employs 287 people. Its revenue is generated
from yellow pages and the commercial sector,
with at present little or no insurance work.
Peter Cox contributed revenue and operating
profit of £4.2 million and £0.3 million in its
first three months. Revenue was 6% up on
the comparable period and operating profit
significantly increased.
We commenced the integration of the back
office systems of Peter Cox into the
Emergency Repair division very promptly after
completion of the acquisition. This was partly
driven by the need to move out of the shared
services environment of the vendor group.
The central functions of Peter Cox have been
relocated to the same offices as ANSA and
Mono Services, in Oldham. During the last
quarter of 2007 there were double running
costs of operating the two environments plus
investment in the IT integration. We estimate
the double running and integration costs
incurred by Peter Cox and Mono Services
were £0.3 million in aggregate.
Emergency Repair Summary
Overall, on a true like for like basis
comparing each business with the
comparable period of trading in 2006, sales
advanced by 10% and operating profit by
18%. After a soft end to the year in volume
terms the division has bounced back in the
first quarter of 2008.
We have built a division which competes
effectively as  a claims fulfilment business for
insurance companies. We are integrating the
operations under one divisional management
team headed by Steve Watkins and
beginning to eliminate duplication in
function across the division. The
implementation of one IT platform across the
division will improve efficiency during 2008
and especially 2009. The integration of Peter
Cox with Mono Services will be a key
initiative for 2008.

Restore and Wansdyke
Restore and Wansdyke serve a wide range of
customers, including law firms, corporates of
varying sizes, financial services companies,
councils and health trusts. Our customers are
mostly based in London and the South across
to Bristol and South Wales. The majority of
sales are the storage and retrieval of archive
boxes but also individual files and other
material such as magnetic media and film. 
Scanning of documents on a selective basis is
also offered to clients. Shredding or pulping
of documents at the end of their useful lives is
currently outsourced, although this would
form a logical product extension.
The key customer satisfaction measures are:
• % accuracy in retrieving items
• % of items retrieved in accordance with
terms of service, such as same day or
next day delivery
We continue to integrate Restore and
Wansdyke and the companies share the same
management team. Approximately £0.1
million of integration costs have been charged
against Wansdyke’s profits in 2007. The
Restore operating system of bar coding is
being applied at Wansdyke and the back
office functions are increasingly being
integrated. Total employees at Wansdyke have
dropped from 75 at February 2006 to 66 at
31 December 2007 by natural wastage as
systems have become more automated.
We operate a combination of freehold and
leasehold sites at Wansdyke and Restore
respectively. Due to the absence of rental
charges, the return on sales at Wansdyke is
higher than that at Restore. 
Having repositioned the business in 2006,
Wansdyke’s sales grew strongly in 2007, by
10%. We are filling up our underground
storage facilities near Bath and in the first half
of 2007 acquired an adjoining underground
space of 16 acres for £0.5m. Once fitted out
this space will provide medium term
expansion for the business through to 2013.
Restore suffered from some disruption and
dealt with a high volume of archive box
intake but the flow through from this new
volume means it is well placed for 2008.
Document Control Services (DCS)
We acquired 100% of the share capital of
Stapledon Holdings Limited, the parent
company of DCS, on 26 March 2007. DCS is a
quality national operation, scanning and
indexing documents with high intellectual
property content. The business has a blue chip
customer base including Network Rail,
Highways Agency, The Crown Estate, oil and
gas companies, city councils and property
companies. DCS made a very strong
contribution in its first nine months.

Review
211679_pp04-pp11.qxp  18/3/08  19:09  Page 8 Document Handling Summary
The market for the physical storage of
archives continues to grow well in excess of
GDP, with especially strong growth in sectors
such as professional services. Overall, on a
true like for like basis comparing each
business with a comparable period of trading
in 2006, sales advanced by 11% and
operating profit by 21%. 
The division is well placed to capitalise on its
pipeline of new business while maximising
the utilisation of its freehold space. Restore
and Wansdyke are effectively being run as
one business and the appointment of Ed
Marshall from DCS as divisional Chief
Executive will help to bind all three
operations together.
Central Costs
Central costs have increased from £969,000 to
£1,439,000 as we now operate two much
larger divisions compared to 2006. 
2007 has been a busy and exciting year for
Mavinwood and we anticipate yet another
year of building on our solid foundations in
2008.

months from April to December.
• Operating profit of Peter Cox for the
three months from October to December.
• Operating profit of ANSA, Independent
Inspections, Mono Services, Restore,
Wansdyke and central costs for the
whole of calendar year 2007.
• Finance costs.
Revenue in the year ended 31 December 2007
was £68,153,000 (2006: £42,453,000). EBITA
before amortisation of intangible assets, share
based payments charge and notional interest
on contingent consideration was £7,289,000
(2006: £5,044,000). Of the increase in EBITA of
£2,245,000, £1,377,000 was generated by the
acquisitions of DCS and Peter Cox in 2007.
Interest
Net interest payable amounted to £2,372,000
(2006: £1,436,000) as we borrowed to fund the
acquisitions of Mono Services from September
2006 and DCS and Peter Cox in 2007.  Included
within the finance cost is £62,000 representing
the notional interest on contingent
consideration due on the acquisitions of
Independent Inspections, Mono Services and
DCS. The discount rate applied in this
calculation was 7.9%.
Profit Before Tax
Profit before tax in the year ended 
31 December  2007 was £5,047,000 (2006:
£3,751,000).
Taxation
The amortisation of intangible assets, the
notional interest on the contingent
consideration and the share based payments
charge do not attract any tax relief. Due to
these distortions, the reported tax charge is
49% (2006: 32%). The headline tax rate is
significantly higher in 2007 as we have assumed
that the share based payments charge will not
attract a tax deduction. In addition, we have
written off the deferred tax asset of £312,000
relating to the share based payment charge in
2006. However, the underlying tax rate during
2007 was 30%, as a percentage of adjusted
profit before taxation. (2006: 30%).
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Basic EPS in 2007 is 0.56p, which compares with
0.66p in 2006. The reason for the reduction in
basic EPS is the absence of tax relief assumed
on the share based payments charge. If we are
able to assume tax relief of 30%, the basic EPS
would have been 0.76p. Basic EPS adjusted for
the amortisation of intangible assets, the share
based payments charge and the notional
interest on the contingent consideration was
1.11p (2006: 0.90p). 
Assuming the exercise of all options and
awards under the LTIP plus the conversion of
the convertible A shares at an average price in
2007 of 18.4p (2006: 13.93p), the fully diluted
adjusted EPS becomes 0.96p (2006: 0.81p) an
increase of 19%.
Share Issues
New equity was issued on two occasions in
2007:
• 5.4 million shares were allotted on
26 March 2007 at 18.5p per share as part of
the consideration for DCS.
• 4.5 million shares were allotted on 
16 October 2007 at 20p per share to the
vendors of Mono Services in settlement of
contingent consideration due. The balance
of £0.1 million was settled in cash.
Acquisitions
External Services Group Limited (ESG), a
drainage sub contractor to ANSA, was
acquired on 2 February 2007 for cash of
£206,000. 
DCS was acquired for an initial sum of £1.3
million, including £1 million in Mavinwood
shares. In addition, debt of £4.8 million was
repaid. Contingent consideration of up to £2
million is also payable in cash linked to the
growth in EBITA above £0.93 million for the

year ending 30 June 2008. The full £2m is payable
assuming EBITA reaches £1.23 million.
Peter Cox Limited was acquired for an initial sum of £6
million. Contingent consideration of £1,050,000 was also
paid on 21 February 2008 linked to the achievement of
EBITA for the year ended 30 November 2007.
Balance Sheet
Net assets increased to £50,613,000 in the year reflecting
the profit before tax for the year of £5,047,000 plus the
share issues to part fund the acquisition of DCS and the
contingent consideration for Mono Services. Intangible
assets relating to the acquisitions, at 31 December 2007,
were £70,634,000 (2006: £58,823,000). 
Property, plant and equipment totalled £12,220,000 (2006:
£10,826,000) principally comprising the freehold
underground storage facilities at Wansdyke but also
computer systems, storage racking and vehicles. 
Operating working capital (excluding cash) amounted to a
net £7,967,000 at 31 December 2007. Net debt at 31
December 2007 totalled £30,917,000 (2006: £17,649,000)
after deferred financing costs of £357,000 (2006:
£310,000).  Interest cover in the year was 4.1 times.
Due to Independent Inspections’ slow start in the first half
of 2007, the Directors consider it unlikely that the business
will make the hurdles to trigger earn out payments to the
vendor in respect of 2007 and 2008 so these amounts of
£4m have been written back to opening intangible assets. 
Cash Flow
The net cash inflow from operating activities before
investing and financing activities was £1,430,000 (2006:
£2,793,000). This inflow is after taking account of an
outflow of £4.6m on working capital.  We expect an
outflow as the business expands and would have expected
this to be around £2.1 million. However, working capital
increased due to a number of other factors:
• £1.1 million due to the re-direction of work for a
large insurer via a joint venture management
company and other changes in Mono Services’
business model
• £0.5 million due to reducing the number of sub-
contractors in ANSA and bringing more work in house
The above factors are permanent changes in the size of our
working capital. In addition, we have suffered from other
slippages in our Document Handling business and in
Emergency Repair as some of our larger customers took
longer to settle during 2007. A large portion of this amount
of £0.9 million has been recouped since the year end.
Capital expenditure totalled £2,683,000 (2006:
£1,168,000). Two major projects accounted for £1 million
of the expenditure. £0.5 million was spent acquiring
further underground storage at Wansdyke and a similar
amount was spent on the first phase of the major IT
project in Emergency Repair. This project integrates the
finance and operating systems of Peter Cox and Mono
and helps build the IT platform for the entire Emergency
Repair division.
Risk Management
The significant financial risks the Group faces have been
considered and policies have been implemented to best
deal with each risk. The three most significant risks are
considered to be liquidity risk, finance cost risk and
customer relationship risk. The Group is wholly based in
the United Kingdom so the direct exposure to exchange
risk is considered to be small.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a £28 million committed term loan which
was increased at the time of the Peter Cox acquisition in
2007 and expires in 2011. In addition, the Group has a £9
million revolving credit facility and small finance lease
arrangements for a number of specific assets. 
The year end net debt was £30.9 million, which consisted
of £32.3 million of interest bearing loans and borrowings
less £1.1 million of cash and short term deposits and
£0.3 million of deferred financing costs. 
The facility has two main financial covenants. An interest
cover covenant and an EBITDA to net debt covenant. The
Group remained within these covenant tests during 2007.
Finance cost risk
The Group pays finance costs on its bank facilities and
finance leases. The bank facilities finance cost is a variable
cost linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%. The margin
will reduce as the net debt to EBITDA ratio reduces. An
interest rate cap at 6.4% on principal of £10 million was
taken out in March 2007 for 3 years. The cap cost £23,000
and at 31 December 2007 £10,000 is recognised as an
asset on the balance sheet. The average finance cost for
the Group in 2007 was 7.8%.
Customer relationships
The Group has commercial relationships with a number of
large customers particularly insurance companies. The loss
of those relationships could have a material impact on the
Group’s profitability and cash flows. This risk is managed
through good customer service backed up by regular
reviews with key management at these clients.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
We have adopted IFRS with effect from 1 January 2006.
Comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2006
have been presented. The principal differences relate to
the write back of goodwill amortisation in 2006 and
providing full deferred taxation on the property at
Wansdyke and other intangibles.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
211679_pp12-pp23.qxp  18/3/08  18:37  Page 15 INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and monitoring the Group’s systems of internal
control. Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the directors with reasonable assurance
that problems are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately.
The key procedures that have been established and which are designed to provide effective control are as
follows:
Management structure – The Board meets regularly to discuss all issues affecting the Group.
Investment appraisal – The Group has a clearly defined framework for investment appraisal and approval is
required by the Board where appropriate.
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the systems of internal control and considers the major
business risks and the control environment. No significant control deficiencies have come to light during the
year and no weakness in internal financial control has resulted in any material losses, contingencies or
uncertainties which would require disclosure as recommended by the guidance for directors on reporting on
internal financial control.
The Board considers that in light of the control environment described above, there is no current
requirement for a separate internal audit function. The Board will continue to review the need to put in place
an internal audit function.
GOING CONCERN
Having made appropriate enquiries and having examined the major areas which could affect the Group’s
financial position, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.

As at 12 March 2008 there has been no change in any of the above holdings.
The Directors believe that the success of the Company will depend to a high degree on the future
performance of the management team. The Company has established incentive arrangements which will
reward the Directors when shareholder value is created, thereby aligning the interests of management
directly with those of the shareholders.
Two Directors hold convertible A shares. The A shares become convertible into a number of ordinary shares
with an aggregate value equivalent to 15% of the increase in shareholder value. Shareholder value, for this
purpose, is broadly defined as the difference between the market capitalisation of the Company at the
relevant conversion date and the aggregate value of all ordinary shares issued up to the date of conversion.
Subject to certain provisions contained in the Articles, the A shares become convertible, at the election of
each holder of the A shares, after 5 November 2007 or on a takeover of the Company, into ordinary shares.
The A shares cease to be convertible from the fifth anniversary of Admission, that is 5 November 2009.
The A shares are non-voting and are entitled to dividends as if they had been converted on the relevant
record date.

The Company’s Remuneration Committee is responsible for administering the share option scheme. The
rules of the scheme are the same for both Directors and employees. The share options granted will, subject
to the performance targets being met, vest in three tranches on the date of the announcement of the final
results for the Company for each of the three years ending after the Date of Grant. The full vesting of each
tranche of the share options granted will be subject to the Company achieving annually a performance
target of a growth of earnings per share (EPS) of 10 percent or more over the adjusted EPS for the previous
year. In the event that the adjusted EPS growth in each year is less than 10%, then the proportion of options
that will vest shall be adjusted as follows:
Percentage of ordinary shares
Growth in EPS in previous financial year in annual tranche which vest
no less than 6% but less than 7% 20%
no less than 7% but less than 8% 40%
no less than 8% but less than 9% 60%
no less than 9% but less than 10% 80%
Any shortfall in the percentage of ordinary shares under option vesting (up to a maximum shortfall of 40%)
will vest in the following year if the performance test is exceeded by an equivalent amount in that year.
The base adjusted EPS for 2004 against which the Company’s EPS growth will be measured has been
determined by the Remuneration Committee. The base adjusted EPS for 2004 of 0.36p was calculated on a
proforma basis as though Restore had been acquired on 1 January 2004 with the debt and equity structure
in place which was used to acquire the business in May 2005. The adjusted fully diluted EPS for 2005, 2006
and 2007 has been 0.53p, 0.81p and 0.96p respectively.
The total share options in issue of 22,090,128 shares represents 4.8% of the issued share capital of
462,417,811 shares.

The Company’s Remuneration Committee is responsible for administering the LTIP .
Awards under the LTIP comprise options to acquire ordinary shares at nominal value which will be subject
to performance targets. A participant granted an option under the LTIP will be required to make a payment
of 0.1p per ordinary share on exercise of the option. Awards are first exercisable 5 years after issue, subject
to attainment of performance targets.
The performance test to be applied to all awards made to the Directors comprises two components. The
ordinary shares under the awards will vest in three equal tranches subject to satisfaction of either of two
tests each year in respect of each tranche, the first test being of growth in earnings per share (“EPS”) and
the second of total shareholder return (“TSR”).
The first test is that the average annual compounded growth in the Company’s EPS exceeds the performance
target percentage established at inception for the three periods each beginning 1 January and ending on

REMUNERATION REPORT 
211679_pp12-pp23.qxp  18/3/08  18:37  Page 20 31 December three years, four years and five years later respectively. For the initial grant of awards, the base
adjusted EPS for 2004 against which the Company’s EPS growth will be measured has been determined by
the Remuneration Committee at 0.36p. The adjusted fully diluted EPS for 2005, 2006 and 2007 has been
0.53p, 0.81p and 0.96p respectively.
The second performance test is based on the Company’s TSR (that is share price growth plus reinvested
dividends) measured over the specified periods commencing on issue date as shown in the table below:
Years following award TSR
3 70%
4 85%
5 100%
In relation to the awards made on 25 April 2007, if prior to 25 April 2012 an offer to acquire the entire issued
share capital of the Company (whether made by an offer to which the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers
applies or by a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 1985 or the Companies Act 2006 (as
applicable)) has become unconditional in all respects, exercise of the award (to the extent not already vested)
shall be subject to the additional condition that such offer values the Company at 25 pence or more per
ordinary share.
TSR shall be measured using the average share price over 20 consecutive dealing days immediately prior to
the relevant anniversary following award and comparing this with the price per share at issue.
In the event that neither of the relevant performance targets is met in relation to each tranche of the LTIP
award, that tranche of the award shall lapse.
The total awards under the LTIP of 44,310,000 shares represents 9.6% of the issued share capital of
462,417,811 shares.
Option Scheme limits
The number of ordinary shares issued or issuable pursuant to options granted under the Share Option
Scheme when aggregated with the number of ordinary shares issued or issuable pursuant to all rights
granted under the Share Option Scheme within the previous period of ten years, may not exceed 5% of the
Company’s issued ordinary share capital at the date of grant. The comparable limit under the LTIP is 10%.
An individual’s overall participation under the Share Option Scheme and LTIP is limited so that the
aggregate market value at the date of grant of the ordinary shares over which awards have been granted to
him cannot exceed 3% and 5% respectively of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at the date of
grant.
No share options or awards made under the LTIP were exercised or waived in the year.

REMUNERATION REPORT 
211679_pp12-pp23.qxp  18/3/08  18:37  Page 21 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
UK Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each
financial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare Group financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union
and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union to present
fairly the financial position and performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to
such financial statements that reference in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true
and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs
adopted by the European Union and for the Company financial statements state whether applicable
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the Company financial statements;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Group and the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial
information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
211679_pp12-pp23.qxp  18/3/08  18:37  Page 22 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MA VINWOOD PLC
We have audited the Group and Company financial statements on pages 24 to 78.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, and the Group financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and for
preparing the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in
our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Review, the Finance Director’s Review and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made
by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
● the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
● the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007;
● the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
● the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2007
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Mavinwood plc and its subsidiaries specifically focus on Emergency Repair and Document
Handling. The Group operates in the UK. During the year, the Group acquired control of External
Services Group, a drainage services company, Document Control Services, a value added scanning
company and Peter Cox, a damp course, water damage and timber treatment services company.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The
address of its registered office is Lacon House, 84 Theobald’s Road, London, WC1X 8RW .
The Company is listed on the AIM stock exchange.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors
on 12 March 2008.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements of Mavinwood plc have been prepared in accordance with EU
endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), IFRIC interpretations and the
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under IFRS for the first time. The disclosures required
by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 34.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements, are disclosed later in this note.
(a) Standards, amendment and interpretations effective in 2007
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosure’ and the complementary amendment to IAS1,
‘Presentation of financial statements – Capital disclosures’, introduces new disclosures relating to
financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the
Group’s financial instruments or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity
instruments where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity
instruments issued in order to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2. This
standard does not have any impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 10, ‘Interim financial reporting and impairment’, prohibits the impairment losses recognised
in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets
carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date. This standard does not have any
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
(b) Interpretation adopted early by the Group
The Group has not adopted early the following IFRS and IFRIC interpretations:
IAS 23 (Revised) Borrowing Costs (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2009);
IFRS 8 Operating Segments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2007
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
(c) Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted
The following Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements (effective 1 January 2008); and
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their
Interaction (effective 1 January 2008).
The Directors anticipate that all of the above Interpretations will be adopted in the Group’s
financial statements for the period commencing 1 January 2008 and that the adoption of those
Interpretations will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group in the period
of initial application.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise,
rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and
entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is
achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated
Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as
appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
BUSINESS COMBINATION (ACQUISITIONS)
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given,
liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control
of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the
acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the
net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Consolidated
Income Statement.
SEGMENTAL REPORTING
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services
that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A
geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic
environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments
operating in other economic environments.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of
discounts, V AT, returns, rebates and after eliminating intra-group sales.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable
that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each
of the Group’s activities as described below.
Sale of services – Emergency Repair
Revenue from Emergency Repair represents amounts in respect of the handling of insurance claims
together with ancillary services including specialist training, subcontracting services, surveying and
other services. Revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis of the relevant service.
Sale of services – Document Handling
Revenue from Document Handling represents amounts billed or due for the storage and retrieval of
customers’ files and boxes. Revenue is recognised on retrieval of documents or time-apportioned for
the period for which the documents are stored.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the costs of acquisition over the Group’s
interest in the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost
less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated
Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating
units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is
less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-
rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of
the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the
previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill has
been re-stated following transition to IFRS as certain intangible assets, which were not recognised
under UK GAAP, have now been separately classified, as they meet the recognition criteria under
IAS 38.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are recognised when they are controlled through contractual or other legal rights,
or are separable from the rest of the business, and the fair value can be reliably measured.
Intangible assets that are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives are not amortised.
Intangible assets that are regarded as having limited useful economic lives are amortised on a
straight-line basis over those lives. Assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually
and other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or
fair value less cost to sell. Amortisation and any impairment write downs are charged in
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Customer relationships
Acquired customer relationships are identified as a separate intangible asset as they arise from
contractual rights and can be reliably measured by a third party valuation. This valuation also
assesses the life of the particular relationship. The life of the relationship is assessed annually and
these are being written off over a period of 9 to 14 years, except where the relationships have been
assessed as having an indefinite life.
Trade names
Acquired trade names are identified as a separate intangible asset and valued by a third party
valuation. The life of the trade name is assessed annually for impairment.
Application and IT
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three
to five years).
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as
an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and
unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic
benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful
lives (expected to be up to five years). Residual values and useful lives are reviewed each year.
PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, except freehold land.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2%
Long leasehold land over the remaining life of the lease.
Leasehold improvements over the life of the lease
Plant and machinery 15% straight line and 25% reducing balance
Racking 5 – 12.5% straight line
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings 15% – 33% straight line and 15% – 25%

LEASED ASSETS
Leases of property, plant and equipment which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the Group are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are classified as a financial
liability and measured at amortised cost. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease
at the lower of the fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment and the present value of
the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the period of the lease. The resulting lease
obligations are included in liabilities. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance
of the liability.
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease
incentives, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the
period of the lease. Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed minimum incremental rental
payments, the total committed cost is determined and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the
life of the lease.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are initially recorded at fair value inclusive of transaction costs. Such investments are
subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses being recognised directly in equity until
the investment is disposed of or it is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain
or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement and recognised in profit
or loss for the period. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement when there is
evidence of impairment.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first in
first out basis. Net realisable value is the price at which inventories can be sold in the normal course
of business. Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIV ABLES
Trade receivables, defined as loans and receivables in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when
there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original
terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets’ carrying
amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The
movement in the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Any other trade
receivables are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts. An
allowance is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
CASH AND CASH EQUIV ALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement comprise cash in
hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short-term investments and bank deposits
with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception.

TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables, defined as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at
fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any
other trade payables are stated at cost. All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. Finance
charges are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Consolidated Income Statement using the
effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit
as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in
the computation of taxable profit and accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised
if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that
affects neither the tax profits not the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability
is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except
when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in equity.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and
a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. If the effect is material, provisions are determined
by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.

PENSIONS
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged
to the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the
transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7
November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the
grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is
measured by use of the Monte Carlo pricing model.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group
has become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group uses derivative
financial instruments such as interest rate caps to hedge its risks associated with interest rates. Such
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are
carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to profit or loss.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
● fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset
or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment; or
● cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk associated with either a recognised asset or liability.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge
relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the
hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how
the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in
the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected
to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on
an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial
reporting periods for which they were designated.

211679_pp28-pp66.qxp  18/3/08  18:40  Page 34 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
Fair value hedges
The change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognised in profit or loss. The change in the
fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as a part of the carrying
value of the hedged item and is also recognised in profit or loss. For fair value hedges relating to
items carried at amortised cost, the adjustment to carrying value is amortised through the profit or
loss over the remaining term to maturity. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged
financial instrument for which the effective interest rate method is used, is amortised through profit
or loss. Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when
the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being
hedged. If the hedge item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in
profit or loss. When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the
subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged
risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or
loss. The changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are also recognised in profit or loss.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity,
while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are
transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the
hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the
hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to
equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the
forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously
recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked,
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or firm
commitment occurs.
3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fair value
interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall
risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the board of directors. The
Group evaluates and hedges financial risks. The board provides written principles for overall risk
management.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk:
The Group operates in the UK and is not exposed to foreign exchange risk.

211679_pp28-pp66.qxp  18/3/08  18:40  Page 35 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk:
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at
variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. During 2007 and 2006, the
Group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in the UK pound. The Group
analyses its interest rate exposure using financial modelling. Based on the various scenarios,
the Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate
caps. Such interest rate caps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from
floating rates to fixed rates at a certain level. The interest rate cap is an agreement with other
parties at quarterly intervals, to exchange the difference between fixed and floating-rate
calculated by reference to the notional principal amount as shown in note 19.
(b) Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all
customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In
addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s
exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed
in note 15. With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which
comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the
counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments as also
shown in note 15.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a forecasting model. This model considers
the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivables, other
financial assets) and projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s objective is to maintain a
balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank
loans and finance leases. A detailed analysis of the Group’s debt facilities is given in note 19.
Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong
credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder
value. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in
economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ending 31 December
2007 and 31 December 2006.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments is market value.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the reporting date. However, uncertainty
about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future.

Judgments
In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following
judgments, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK. Judgment is required in determining the provision
for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates
of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different
from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and
deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at
each reporting date. Goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles are tested for impairment
annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for
impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash
flows from the asset or cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate
the present value of those cash flows. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis of key
assumptions, are given in note 11.
Share-based payments
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair
value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value requires
determining the most appropriate valuation model for a grant of equity instruments, which is
dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This also requires determining the most
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the option, volatility and
dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used are
disclosed in note 27.

The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the Consolidated Income Statement as
follows:

Total tax charge as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement 2,463 1,195

–––––––––––– ––––––––––––
The effective tax rate is 49% due to the distortion caused by the non deductibility of the
amortisation of intangible assets, the notional interest on the contingent consideration and the share
based payments charge. After adjusting for these the effective rate becomes 30% (2006: 30%).
9 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Basic earnings per share have been calculated on the profit after taxation for the year and the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share which are before amortisation of intangible assets, share based
payments charge and notional interest on contingent consideration have been presented in addition
to the basic earnings per share since, in the opinion of the directors, this provides shareholders with
a more appropriate representation of the underlying earnings derived from the Group’s businesses.

Goodwill and other infinite life intangible assets
The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is determined based on a value in use
calculation which uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the directors
for year one to year four. Terminal cash flows are based on year four projections, assumed to grow
perpetually at 1%. In accordance with IAS 36, the growth rates for beyond the forecasted period do
not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry. Change in selling prices and direct
costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. A discount rate
of 8.5% per annum (2006: 8.3% per annum) has been applied.
Annual test for impairment
During the year, the Group assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill and other infinite life
intangibles and determined that it was not impaired.

The average credit period on sales of services is 58 days. No interest is charged on the trade
receivables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. Thereafter, interest may be charged at
two percent per annum on the outstanding balance. Trade receivables are provided for based on
estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past payment
history and the current financial status of the customers.

The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans, finance leases, hire purchase
contracts and various other receivable and payable balances that arise from its operations. The main
purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations.
The main financial risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and
liquidity risk. The directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks. Interest rates
are regularly reviewed to ensure competitive rates are paid. Detailed cash flows are produced on a
regular basis to minimise liquidity risks.
Currency and interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
All bank borrowings are subject to floating interest rates, at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%. The
interest rate risk profile of the Group’s bank borrowings for the year was:

The Group’s finance leases, totalling £45,000 (2006: £109,000) bear fixed-term interest rates set at
between 5% and 10% and are all denominated in Sterling.
Financial assets recognised in the balance sheet and interest rate profile
The loan note of £550,000 as shown in note 13 to the financial statements is held at amortised cost
and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4%. All other financial assets are short term debtors and cash in
hand. The cash in hand earns interest based on the variable bank base rate.

Borrowing facilities
The Group has a term facility of £28 million and a revolving credit facility (RCF) of £9 million. £4
million of the RCF was undrawn at 31 December 2007. The facilities expire in August 2011. In
addition to these facilities the Group has an uncommitted overdraft facility of £0.5 million, of
which £0.2 million has not been utilised at 31 December 2007. All of the Group’s borrowings are in
sterling.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities bear floating interest rates and are relatively short term
in nature. In the opinion of the directors the book values of the assets and liabilities equate to their
fair value.
Interest rate caps
During the year the Group purchased an interest rate cap. The Group exchanges the difference
between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the issued variable
rate debt held. The fair value of the interest rate cap at the year end is the market value.

The interest rate cap settles on a quarterly basis. The interest rate cap is for £10 million, is set at 6.4%
and expires on 31 March 2010. The fair value of the cap at 31 December 2007 is estimated at £10,000
(2006 – £nil). As the hedge was not designated as effective on inception the movement in fair value
has been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Hedges and foreign currency
The Group’s policy is not to use forward contracts and therefore none were outstanding at the year
end (2006: £nil). The Group has no significant currency exposures at 31 December 2007 or
31 December 2006, so no numerical disclosures have been provided.

Contingent consideration, which has been provided for on a discounted basis may be paid to the
vendors of certain subsidiary undertakings in the years to 2008. Such payments are contingent on
future financial performance. The directors estimate that the liability at 31 December 2007 for

consideration due on the acquisition of Mono Services was settled at £1.0 million, £0.1 million in
cash and £0.9 million by the issue of 4,500,000 ordinary shares in Mavinwood plc at a mid market
price of 20p. The payment of this amount brought the consideration to £7.0 million before costs.

REMEDIAL PROVISION
The Group is maintaining a remedial provision to meet the estimated future costs of claims made
by customers under the terms of the guarantees issued in respect of property services. The amount
of the reserve has been calculated on the level of customer claims made on a historic basis.
PROVISIONS FOR DILAPIDATIONS
The Group holds a number of property leases which include a clause for the restoration of the
premises to their original state and a provision is being maintained to reflect the potential costs of
this work. The calculation of the amount required at the year end has been based on the reports of
professional surveyors and the directors’ estimate of the probability of the liability arising.

The A shares become convertible into a number of ordinary shares with an aggregate value
equivalent to 15 percent of the increase in shareholder value. For this purpose, shareholder value is
broadly defined as the difference between the market capitalisation of the Company at the relevant
conversion date and the aggregate value of all ordinary shares issued up to the date of conversion.
Subject to certain provisions contained in the articles, the A shares become convertible, at the
election of each holder of the A shares, after 5 November 2007 or on a takeover of the Company,
into ordinary shares. The A shares cease to be convertible from the fifth anniversary of admission,
that is 5 November 2009.
The A shares are non-voting and are entitled to dividends as if they had been converted on the
relevant record date.

26 PENSIONS
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. The
assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of
trustees. The total cost charged to income of £194,000 (2006: £127,000) represents contributions
payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plan.
27 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Share option scheme
The Mavinwood share option scheme was introduced in May 2005. Under the scheme the
Remuneration Committee can grant options over shares in the Company to directors and employees
of the Group. Options are granted at a fixed price equal to the market price of the shares under
option at the date of grant. The contractual life of the option is 10 years. Awards under the scheme
are generally reserved for employees at senior management level and above. The Company has made
four grants to date. The share options granted will, subject to the performance targets being met,
vest in three tranches on the date of the announcement of the final results for the Company for each
of the three years ending after the Date of Grant. The full vesting of each tranche of the share
options granted will be subject to the Company achieving annually a performance target of a growth
of adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 10% or more over the adjusted EPS for the previous year.
In the event that the adjusted EPS growth in each year is less than 10%, then the proportion of
options that will vest shall be reduced as follows:
Percentage of ordinary shares
Growth in adjusted EPS in previous financial year in annual tranche which vest
No less than 6% but less than 7% 20%
No less than 7% but less than 8% 40%
No less than 8% but less than 9% 60%
No less than 9% but less than 10% 80%
Any shortfall in the percentage of ordinary shares under option vesting (up to a maximum shortfall
of 40%) will vest in the following year if the performance test is exceeded by an equivalent amount
in that year. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.

The total fair value of options issued in the year was £361,827 (2006: £991,710). The volatility is
measured by calculating the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of share price movements.
Given the lack of past option data for the Company an expected term of five years has been used
as a typical span for a ten year option scheme. A reconciliation of option movements over the year

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Mavinwood Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) was introduced in May 2005. Awards under the
LTIP comprise options to acquire ordinary shares at nominal value which will be subject to
performance targets. A participant granted an option under the LTIP will be required to make a
payment of 0.1p per ordinary share on exercise of the option. Awards are first exercisable five years
after issue, subject to attainment of performance targets. The company has made four awards to date.
The performance test to be applied to all awards made to the Directors comprises two components.
The ordinary shares under the awards will vest in three equal tranches subject to satisfaction of
either of two tests each year in respect of each tranche, the first test being of growth in earnings per
share (“EPS”) and the second of total shareholder return (“TSR”).
The first test is that the average annual compounded growth in the Company’s EPS exceeds the
performance target percentage established at inception for the three periods each beginning 1
January and ending on 31 December three years, four years and five years later respectively.
The second performance test is based on the Company’s TSR (that is share price growth plus
reinvested dividends) measured over the specified periods commencing on issue date as shown in the
table below:
Years following award TSR
3 70%
4 85%
5 100%
In the event that neither of the relevant performance targets is met in relation to each tranche of the
LTIP award, that tranche of the award shall lapse. Exercise of an option is subject to continued
employment. Options were valued using a stochastic model. The fair value per option granted and
the assumptions used in the calculation are:

The volatility is measured by calculating the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of share
price movements. Given the lack of past option data for the Company an expected term of five years
has been used as a typical span for a ten year option scheme. A reconciliation of option movements

34 EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 will be the first financial
statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Group’s
financial statements prior to and including 31 December 2006 had been prepared in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP).
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition under the provisions of IFRS 1 and
show the effects of the transition to IFRS on the Group’s reported performance and financial
position for the comparative periods and on the date of transition. The last financial statements
prepared under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the date of transition to
IFRS is therefore 1 January 2006.
FIRST TIME ADOPTION – EXEMPTIONS IN IFRS 1
The Group has applied IFRS 1 – First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards to provide a starting point for reporting under IFRS. The rules regarding transitional
arrangements are set out in IFRS 1 which generally requires full retrospective adoption of all
standards effective at the reporting date. The primary IFRS exemptions the Group has taken are:
– business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2006 have not been restated
– the recognition of the expense of share-based payments has not been restricted to those
awards which have not vested by 1 January 2006.

Notes to the reconciliation of shareholders equity
a) Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ retrospectively to
business combinations that took place before 1 January 2006. The Group has adopted IFRS
3 ‘Business combinations’ in full for all acquisitions that have occurred after this date. This
has resulted in the recognition of net additional intangible fixed assets of £8,812,000 (after
amortisation of intangible assets of £10,000) at 31 December 2006.
The adjustment in goodwill and intangible assets at 31 December 2006 comprises:
Intangible
Goodwill assets
£’000 £’000
Goodwill written back 2,172 –
Wansdyke deferred tax on property revaluation 1,515 –

Mono Services existing customer relationships (3,097) 3,097
Mono Services applications software and website (99) 99

Amortisation of intangible assets – (10)
–––––––––––– ––––––––––––
(2,665) 9,070
–––––––––––– ––––––––––––
–––––––––––– ––––––––––––
Under UK GAAP the intangible fixed assets would have been recognised in goodwill the
amortisation would have been £2,172,000 in the year ended 31 December 2006.
b) Software classification
Application software, which can be run independently from any specific hardware
configuration, is included within intangibles under IFRS rather than tangible assets as is the
norm under UK GAAP. The effect of this is to reclassify software of £219,000 at January
2006 and £258,000 at December 2006 from tangible assets to intangible assets. Total net
assets remain unchanged by this adjustment.
c) Deferred tax 
A tax timing difference of £1,515,000 has been recognised in respect of revaluation of
properties acquired in February 2006 via the acquisition of Wansdyke Securities Limited.
A deferred tax liability on the intangible assets adjustments has been recognised of
£2,470,000 at 31 December 2006.
d) Retained earnings
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ retrospectively to
business combinations that took place before 1 January 2006. The retained earnings have
been restated due to the removal of goodwill of £2,172,000 at 31 December 2006 and
amortisation of intangible assets of £10,000 at 31 December 2006.

amortisation of intangible assets of £10,000 has been charged in the year ended 31 December 2006.

COMPANY BALANCE SHEET
At 31 December 2007
211679_pp67-pp78.qxp  18/3/08  18:41  Page 71 These Financial Statements for the Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention and
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom
(UK GAAP). The Directors consider that the accounting policies set out below are suitable, are supported
by reasonable judgements and estimates and have been consistently applied except where stated below. The
going concern basis has been applied in these accounts. A summary of the more important accounting
policies is set out below.
In the Company’s financial statements, dividends received and receivable are credited to the Company’s
profit and loss account. In accordance with section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is
exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account. The result for the financial year of
the Company is disclosed in note 45 to these Financial Statements.
INVESTMENTS
The Company’s investment in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Long term investments representing interests in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision
for impairment in the value of the fixed asset investment.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
The costs of tangible fixed assets are stated at their purchase price, together with any incidental expenses of
acquisition. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated
residual values, on a straight line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The
principal life used for this purpose is three years.
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when their recovery is assessed as more likely than not.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
BORROWINGS
All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue
costs. Issue costs together with other finance costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the period
of the term of the borrowings at a constant rate, or more quickly if appropriate. Accrued finance charges
are added to and issue costs are deducted from the carrying value of those borrowings.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company has periodically used derivative instruments to manage its interest rate exposure. Derivatives
are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-
measured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The cost of providing share based payments to employees is charged to the income statement over the
vesting period of the related share options or share allocations. The cost is based on the fair value of the
options and shares allocated determined using the Monte Carlo pricing model, which is appropriate given
the vesting and other conditions attached to the options. The value of the charge is adjusted at each balance
sheet date to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate of the amount can be made. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.

Subject to certain provisions contained in the articles, the A shares become convertible, at the
election of each holder of the A shares after 5 November 2007 or on a takeover of the Company,
into ordinary shares. The A shares cease to be convertible from the fifth anniversary of admission,
that is 5 November 2009.
The A shares are non-voting and are entitled to dividends as if they had been converted on the
relevant record date.

Notes These notes are important and require your immediate attention.
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of
his rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by the member. A proxy
need not be a member of the Company.
2. A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice. To be effective, a form of proxy must be completed, signed and deposited
with the Company’s registrar at the address on the form of proxy not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the
meeting. Depositing a completed form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting in
person.
3. In accordance with section 325 of the Companies Act 2006 (“2006 Act”), the right to appoint proxies does not apply to
persons nominated to receive information rights under section 146 of the 2006 Act. Any person to whom this notice is
sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the 2006 Act to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”)
may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has
no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to
give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
4. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertified Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual
General Meeting (and for the purposes of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast)
members must be entered on the Company’s register of members by 6.00 p.m. on 28 April 2008. Changes to entries on
the register of members after 6.00 p.m. on 28 April 2008 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to
attend or vote at the meeting.
5. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may
do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST manual. To
appoint a proxy or to give or amend an instruction to a previously appointed proxy via the CREST system, the CREST
message must be received by the issuer’s agent RA10 by 12 noon 28 April 2008. In order for a proxy appointment or
instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message must be properly authenticated
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited specifications and must contain the information required for such
instructions as required in the CREST manual. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is
able to retrieve the message. After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the proxy by other means. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those
CREST Members who have appointed voting service provider(s) should contact their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s) for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST. For further information on CREST procedures,
limitations and system timings please refer to the CREST Manual. We may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by
CREST in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. In any
case your proxy form must be received by the Company’s registrars no later than 12 noon 28 April 2008.
6. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting
so that (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote
on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the
meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will
vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one
corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not

nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate
representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate Shareholders are
referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate
representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of
appointment letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.

For the year ended 31 December 2007
211679_pp79-pp85.qxp  18/3/08  18:41  Page 82 EXPLANATORY NOTES OF PRINCIPAL CHANGES TO THE
COMPANY’S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”) is being implemented in stages and will be fully in force by 1
October 2009. Under Resolution 9, it is proposed that the Company adopts new articles of association
(“New Articles”) in order to update the Company’s current articles of association (“Current Articles”). The
New Articles will reflect the changes in Company law brought about by the 2006 Act which are already in
force or which are to come into effect on or before 1 October 2008. A detailed explanation of the principal
changes proposed to the Current Articles is set out below. The New Articles, showing all the changes to the
Current Articles, are available for inspection as set out at note 7 to the enclosed notice of annual general
meeting.
1. FORM OF RESOLUTION
The Current Articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose an ordinary resolution is
required, a special or extraordinary resolution is also effective and that, where an extraordinary
resolution is required, a special resolution is also effective. This provision is being amended as the
concept of extraordinary resolutions has not been retained under the 2006 Act and all references to
‘extraordinary resolutions’ have been amended to ‘special resolutions’.
The Current Articles enable members to act by written resolution. Under the 2006 Act public
companies can no longer pass written resolutions. These provisions have therefore been removed in
the New Articles.
2. CONVENING GENERAL MEETINGS
The provisions in the Current Articles dealing with the convening of general meetings and the length
of notice required to convene general meetings are being amended to conform to the new provisions
in the 2006 Act. In particular a general meeting to consider a special resolution can be convened on
14 days’ notice whereas previously 21 days’ notice was required.
3. QUORUM AT GENERAL MEETINGS
The Current Articles provide that two persons entitled to vote each being a member or a proxy for
a member constitute a quorum. This provision is being amended to provide that duly authorised
representatives of a corporation which is a shareholder count towards the quorum of a general
meeting and that two persons who are proxies or corporate representatives of the same member
shall be a quorum.
4. VOTES OF MEMBERS
Under the 2006 Act, proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands as well as on a poll, and
members may appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote at
meetings. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the
rights attached to a different share or shares. The New Articles reflect these new proxy rights. The
2006 Act also provides for multiple corporate representatives to be appointed and the New Articles
therefore refer to the right to appoint multiple corporate representatives. The provision giving the
chairman a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes has been retained as the Government has
made it clear that although the 2006 Act does not provide for the chairman to have a casting vote,
companies who previously had such a provision in their articles may continue to do so.
The directors may also specify in a notice of meeting that in determining the time for delivery of
proxies, no account shall be taken of non-working days.

The provision relating to the right to refuse to register a transfer of any share has been updated to
bring it in line with section 771 of the 2006 Act. In particular, the directors are now obliged to send
to the transferee such information about the reasons for refusal as the transferee may reasonably
request.
6. OMISSION TO SEND NOTICE
This provision has been amended so that omission to send notice due to circumstances beyond the
Company’s control will not invalidate any resolution passed or proceedings held at the meeting for
which any person entitled to receive such notice did not receive it.
7. AMENDMENT OF RESOLUTIONS
The wording of the provision detailing the methods by which resolutions may be amended has been
updated to bring the wording in line with the draft model form articles for public companies (the
“Model Articles”) of the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The Model
Articles will replace the Table A articles under the Companies Act 1985 in due course.
8. AGE OF DIRECTORS ON APPOINTMENT
The Current Articles contain a provision requiring a director to seek re-election annually after he
has reached the age of 70 years. Such provision could now fall foul of the Employment Equality
(Age) Regulations 2006 and so has been removed from the New Articles.
9. DIRECTORS’ FEES
The Current Articles are unclear regarding the cap on the directors’ fees. This has been clarified in
the New Articles. The aggregate cap on directors’ fees is £100,000 per annum.
10. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The 2006 Act sets out directors’ general duties which largely codify the existing law but with some
changes. Under the 2006 Act, from 1 October 2008 a director must avoid a situation where he has,
or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may conflict with the Company’s interests.
The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of
another company or a trustee of another organisation. The 2006 Act allows directors of public
companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where the articles of
association contain a provision to this effect. The 2006 Act also allows the articles of association to
contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
The New Articles give the directors authority to approve such situations and includes some conflict
management provisions regarding confidential information and a director’s ability to absent himself
from discussions.
Only directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant
decision. The directors will also be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if
they think this is appropriate.
It is also proposed that the New Articles should contain provisions relating to confidential
information, attendance at board meetings and availability of board papers to protect a director
being in breach of duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises. These
provisions will only apply where the position giving rise to the potential conflict has previously been
authorised by the directors.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
For the year ended 31 December 2007
211679_pp79-pp85.qxp  18/3/08  18:41  Page 84 11. RECORDS TO BE KEPT
The provision in the Current Articles requiring the board to keep accounting records has been
removed as this requirement is contained in the 2006 Act.
In addition, the provision in the Current Articles requiring there to be a register of directors’
interests has been removed as this is no longer a requirement under the 2006 Act.
12. UNDELIVERED NOTICES OR DOCUMENTS
A provision in the New Articles has been included which states that if, on three consecutive
occasions, a notice or other document or information sent to a shareholder (or other person) has
been returned undelivered, such shareholder (or other person) shall not thereafter be entitled to
receive notices or other documents or information from the Company until he has communicated
with the Company and supplied in writing to the Company’s registered office a new postal address
or an electronic address for the service of notices or other documents.
13. DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES AND LOANS TO FUND EXPENDITURE
The 2006 Act has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of the Company to indemnify
directors and to fund expenditure incurred in connection with certain actions against directors. In
particular, a company that is a trustee of an occupational pension scheme can now indemnify a
director against liability incurred in connection with the company’s activities as trustee of the
scheme and also allow a company to indemnify directors of associated companies.
14. INDEMNITY AGAINST CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SHARES
The New Articles contain a provision requiring a shareholder to indemnify the Company if the law
of any jurisdiction imposes a liability on the Company to make payment in respect of shares held
by or dividends or other monies paid to such shareholder (for example as a consequence of the non-
payment of income or inheritance tax).
15. GENERAL
Generally, the opportunity has been taken to bring clearer language in the New Articles and in some
areas to conform the language of the New Articles.

can decide not to vote at all. The proxy can also do this on any other resolution that is put to the meeting. The ‘Vote Withheld’
option is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution however it should be noted that a ‘vote withheld’ is not

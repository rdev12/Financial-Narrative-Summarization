Micro Focus has delivered another year of strong ﬁ nancial results, 
achieving signiﬁ cant organic revenue growth and improving proﬁ t 
margins, in spite of tough economic conditions. We successfully 
integrated NetManage, Liant and Relativity, companies acquired 
in June 2008, July 2008 and December 2008 respectively. 
While we remain conscious of the current challenging economic 
conditions, our long-term ambition remains to achieve signiﬁ cant 
growth in revenue and proﬁ ts through both organic and 
acquired means. 
The performance achieved over the past year continues to reﬂ ect 
well on the entire Micro Focus team and highlights the strong 
fundamentals of the business. We have ﬁ rst rate technology 
solutions, a loyal customer base and a leading position in a 
substantial, sustainable and growing marketplace. Market 
conditions for all companies are challenging but our revenue 
and EBITDA margin growth underlines the relevance of our 
customer proposition and the resilience of our business model. 
The board continues to adopt a progressive dividend policy reﬂ ecting 
the long-term earnings and cash ﬂ ow potential of Micro Focus and 
I am pleased to announce a proposed ﬁ nal dividend of 11.1 cents 
per share, giving a full year dividend of 15.6 cents per share. This 
represents a 20% increase when compared to a full year dividend 
of 13.0 cents last year and reﬂ ects the board’s conﬁ dence in both 
the relevance of our solutions and the prospects of Micro Focus. 
We ﬁ nished the year with cash of $71.6 million, and generated 
$105.0 million of cash from continuing operations during the year. 
Our business model has low ongoing capital requirements and 
delivers strong cash generation. During the year, $78.6 million 
of cash was used to fund the acquisitions and restructuring of 
NetManage, Liant and Relativity. This ﬁ gure comprises the purchase 
cost of $92.1 million, restructuring costs incurred of $14.9 million 
less cash acquired of $28.4 million. 
Since the year end we have completed the acquisition of the Testing 
and Automated Software Quality (‘ASQ’) business of Compuware 
for a gross consideration of $80 million. In addition, we have 
announced the acquisition of Borland Software Corporation for 
a gross consideration of approximately $113 million. To fund our 
acquisition and integration plans we have put in place a three-year 
revolving credit facility of $215 million provided through a syndicated 
loan consortium comprising Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS. 
As we build our Company to address new growth opportunities, we 
have added a signiﬁ cant number of employees to the business and 
I am pleased with their rapid integration, and the strong contribution 
they are making. The board would like to thank all of our employees 
for their continued hard work and commitment throughout the year. 
We continue to build for the future. 
We remain focused on proﬁ table revenue growth and I am conﬁ dent 
in the Company’s ability to continue to deliver value to all of its 
stakeholders. Through both dividend and capital growth we aim 
to deliver superior total shareholder returns. 
We look forward to the year ahead with conﬁ dence.

Operational review
Over the past year, Micro Focus has generated strong growth in both 
revenues and proﬁ ts. 
Organisations of all sizes are increasingly considering and selecting 
an application modernization strategy to reduce business costs, 
reduce risk and improve productivity and innovation. They are 
achieving required business beneﬁ ts by modernising existing IT 
applications, as opposed to implementing the lengthy, high risk and 
costly alternative of either rewriting these applications, or replacing 
them with a packaged solution with little additional business beneﬁ t. 
There is no other modernization player today that can offer the 
same level of experience and expertise to rapidly modernise and 
improve the functionality and cost effectiveness of business-critical 
enterprise applications. 
Including the beneﬁ cial impacts of recent acquisitions, we now 
estimate our addressable market to be approximately $4 billion 
per annum. We have a signiﬁ cant opportunity ahead. 
Execution 
Over the past year, we delivered a strong set of ﬁ nancial results and 
made acquisitions to further our strategic aims. While driving growth 
through acquisitions, we have also remained fully focused on driving 
organic growth. It was pleasing to see the core Micro Focus business 
continue to deliver double digit organic revenue growth in the year, 
despite tough economic conditions. 
On 18 June 2008, we acquired NetManage for $73.4 million in 
cash. On 11 July 2008, we acquired Liant Software Corporation 
for $4.9 million in cash and on 31 December 2008, we acquired 
Relativity Technologies, for $10.3 million in cash. All three acquisitions 
greatly strengthen our application modernization solutions. Since the 
year end we completed the acquisitions of Compuware’s Testing/ASQ 
business and Borland. 
All three acquisitions completed in the ﬁ nancial year have been 
integrated rapidly, drawing on our track record to acquire and bring 
acquisitions quickly into our own business model, with minimal 
disruption to our operations. Margins at these operations are in line 
with levels at the rest of the Micro Focus Group (‘Group’) for the 
period since acquisition. Combining the businesses of Micro Focus, 
NetManage, Liant and Relativity has further strengthened Micro 
Focus’ position as a leading player in the fast growing Application 
Modernization market and provided the enlarged Group with further 
opportunities for growth through a more comprehensive and broader 
product portfolio. 
We continue to invest in expanding our solution set as well as 
extending our partnerships with other technology companies, 
system integrators and outsourcers to take advantage of the 
considerable market opportunities. In particular, our deep 
relationships with HP/EDS, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle support 
further enhancement of our extensive product and solution 
portfolio. An important current development focus is our Enterprise 
Application Management offerings to beneﬁ t organisations 
embracing Cloud computing, to further improve cost efﬁ ciencies 
and productivity across their business operations. 
Corporate developments 
During 2009, the management team has been strengthened 
further to support our growth strategy. We have appointed new 
regional Presidents in North America, Asia Paciﬁ c and International 
to further sharpen our focus on sales execution. All individuals are 
highly experienced in the software industry and have all worked for 
international, high growth, successful companies. 
The strengthened sales teams have driven continued improved 
performance in our North American operation as well as strong 
growth across our Europe and Rest of World operations. We have 
seen very strong growth in those markets where we have invested 
in direct operations to meet customer demand, for example in Spain, 
India and Latin America, where recent revenue growth has been 
particularly impressive. 
Micro Focus has also continued to develop its marketing and 
communications strategies to increasingly establish senior level 
contacts within our target customer organisations. With well 
publicised ‘failures’ in package and rewrite IT projects, there is 
signiﬁ cant momentum building around the ‘modernization message’ 
and we have beneﬁ ted from this rush to common sense as boards 
demand rapid returns on investment.

Business review
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s statement (continued)
Business model 
Micro Focus has demonstrated that it can grow and perform 
well in troubled economic times. In this respect, Micro Focus has 
become known as a ‘safe haven’. I believe Micro Focus can perform 
both sides of the economic cycle. The relevance of our customer 
proposition and the resilience of our business model continue to 
encourage us that the outlook is positive. In recessionary times 
Micro Focus provides companies with a low risk option that enables 
existing annual costs to be reduced. In improved economic times, 
Micro Focus allows companies to achieve a signiﬁ cant increase in 
capacity, growth and innovation for a modest additional outlay. 
Micro Focus beneﬁ ts from having a business model with a high 
proportion of predictable and recurring revenue. Of licence 
revenues, which made up 47.6% of Group revenues in the year, 
the majority comes from high volume, low value transactions which 
are supplemented by larger value transactions. Approximately 
a quarter of licence revenues come from royalties from other 
software companies, which again consist of a high volume of 
lower value transactions. 
Our resilient maintenance revenue streams continue to represent 
nearly half our total revenue, at 48.2%. This line of business 
experiences high levels of retention, and we continue to enjoy 
renewal rates of approximately 90%. Maintenance revenue growth 
is driven by the retention of existing customers as well as the 
addition of new maintenance revenue associated with the sale of 
new licences. An encouraging performance in both of these areas 
in the year provides high levels of revenue visibility going forward. 
The smallest proportion of our revenue is derived from our 
consultancy services and it is expected that this revenue will 
remain a similar proportion of total revenue in the coming year. 
Continued future revenue growth is largely dependent on driving 
licence sales. Our major growth opportunity remains around larger 
value licence fee transactions into the Global 2000 companies. It was 
encouraging that we again signed a number of these transactions 
in the year carrying on from our success last year. These larger value 
transactions in turn drive future growth of our run rate high volume 
and low value business, typically through deployment revenues 
as modernised applications are rolled out across organisations. 
Summary and outlook
Our solutions reduce cost, lower risk, and provide clear and compelling 
returns on investment for our customers. While we recognise the 
continuing uncertain macro economic conditions, the defensive 
characteristics of our business model, combined with the relevance 
and compelling nature of our solutions, lead us to view the current 
year with conﬁ dence. 
In the year ahead, we will continue to pursue our successful growth 
strategy. However, as stated the impact of the recent Compuware and 
Borland acquisitions are expected to reduce the overall Group margin. 
Micro Focus’ resilience, relevance and strong cash generation gives 
the board conﬁ dence in the Group’s ability to continue to deliver 
superior total shareholder returns.

Group risk factors
The Group, in common with all businesses could be affected by risks 
not completely within its control which could have a material effect 
on its short- and longer-term ﬁ nancial performance. These risks 
could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasts or 
historic results.
The following are the key risks that are relevant to the Group as a 
provider of enterprise application management solutions. Please 
also refer to the section on internal controls within the corporate 
governance report on page 40.
Employees
The retention and recruitment of highly skilled and motivated 
employees is critical to the success and future growth of the Group 
in all countries in which it currently operates and in which it is likely 
to expand into in the future.
The Group has policies in place to help achieve these objectives 
and ensure that it is able to attract and retain employees with the 
required skills.
Timing of concluding contracts
In common with other software companies, the recognition of 
revenue is dependent upon obtaining signed contracts from 
customers and delivery of product. With a high proportion of costs 
being ﬁ xed, mainly people related, failure to conclude sales contracts 
could result in a material decrease in margin. Failure to conclude at 
any time would have the same impact.
However, the Group has a growing diverse mix of customers with a 
high proportion of predictable and recurring revenue which reduces 
this exposure.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions could provide proﬁ table revenue growth. Concluding 
further acquisitions is dependent on a number of factors such as 
the global economic position, the availability of ﬁ nance and suitable 
target companies. There are also risks associated with successfully 
integrating future acquisitions; for example the loss of key personnel, 
system integration issues and other problems not identiﬁ ed prior 
to acquisition.
The Group has a successful track record to-date in integrating 
acquisitions into the Group’s business model and has strengthened 
its management team to assist in this process. It has also secured 
a three-year revolving $215 million loan facility agreement to fund 
announced acquisitions and associated integration costs. 
Bank loan facility
The $215 million loan facility agreement, to the extent drawn down 
by the Group may limit the operational and ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility of the 
Group and may increase the exposure of the Group to interest rate 
ﬂ uctuations. The loan facility agreement contains covenants which 
may negatively impact the ability of the Group to operate and grow 
its business. To the extent drawn down, the loan facility agreement 
will create an amount of indebtedness for the Group together with 
debt service obligations which may impair the operational and 
ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility of the Group. 
The directors believe that the strength of the business means that 
any funds drawn down to fund acquisitions will be repaid together 
with any accrued interest within the three-year term of the loan 
facility agreement minimising the effect of any restrictive covenants 
contained therein.
Research and development
The Group has expanded its various R&D facilities through organic 
growth and through acquisitions. The success of the R&D function 
in enhancing existing products and developing new products, which 
are relevant to customer requirements is critical to the ongoing 
success of the Group. If new products or enhancements do not meet 
customer requirements, or competitors introduce products which 
better meet the requirements of customers, this may have a material 
impact on revenues and proﬁ ts. 
The successful integration of the R&D functions of acquired 
companies together with the effective management of existing 
facilities is key to mitigating these risks.

International plc
Annual Report and 
Accounts 2009
17 Business review
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s statement (continued)
Foreign exchange and treasury
The Group is not exposed to signiﬁ cant foreign exchange 
transactional exposure as generally its subsidiaries trade in their own 
currency. The Group’s principal exposure to foreign currency is the 
translation of overseas proﬁ ts into US$. Due to its limited exposure, 
the Group does not hold any ﬁ nancial instruments such 
as derivatives.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk 
on the translation of its net investment overseas into US$ where 
the functional currency of those subsidiaries is not the US$. This 
is partially mitigated by the overseas subsidiaries incurring costs 
denominated in their local currency.
Economic risks 
The Group’s business may be subject to inherent risks arising from 
the general and sector speciﬁ c economic conditions in the markets in 
which they operate. The performance of the Group may be affected 
by changes in economic or market conditions. The growth and 
development of the markets in which the Group operates depend 
on numerous factors many of which are beyond their control and 
the exact effect of which cannot accurately be predicted. Such 
factors include general economic and political activities including 
the extent of any governmental regulation, legislation and taxation. 
The Group has demonstrated that it can grow and perform well 
on both sides of the economic cycle. The relevance of the customer 
proposition and resilience of the Group business model continues 
to encourage that the outlook is positive. The Group beneﬁ ts from 
having a business model with a high proportion of predictable and 
recurring revenue. 
Intellectual property
The Group depends on its intellectual property, and rights to such 
intellectual property may be challenged or infringed by others or 
otherwise prove insufﬁ cient to protect its business. The Group 
relies on trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect its 
intellectual property. Failure to protect, maintain and enforce the 
Group’s existing intellectual property or pursue registrations for 
new rights may result in the loss of the Group’s exclusive right 
to use technologies which are included in their respective software 
products or are otherwise used in their respective businesses. 
Most of the Group’s intellectual property is not covered by a patent 
or patent application and includes trade secrets and other know-how 
that is not considered patentable. In addition, some of the Group’s 
intellectual property includes technologies and processes that may 
be similar to the technologies and processes of third parties that are 
protected by patent, copyright or trade secret law.
The Group takes appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual 
property rights particularly in international markets including 
litigation where appropriate. 
Note 3 to the summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies gives 
additional information on additional ﬁ nancial risks that the Group 
could be exposed to.
Corporate and social responsibility 
The board is committed to running the Company in accordance 
with best practice in corporate governance. This commitment 
includes recognition by the Company of the importance of taking 
into account its corporate social responsibilities (‘CSR’) in operating 
the business. In this context, Micro Focus seeks to integrate CSR 
considerations relating particularly to social, ethical and health, 
safety and environment (‘HS&E’) issues in its day-to-day operations. 
The board acknowledges its duty to ensure the Company conducts 
its activities responsibly and with proper regard for all its stakeholders 
including employees, shareholders, business partners, suppliers and 
the local communities. The Company is a member company of the 
FTSE4Good Index Series. This index identiﬁ es companies that meet 
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards. 
In exercising its corporate social responsibility, Micro Focus seeks 
to ensure that:
�  The board takes account of the signiﬁ cance of social, ethical 
and HS&E issues;
�  Business practices are managed ethically;
�  The business is focused on delivering value to stakeholders;
�  Existing legislation, regulations and guidelines are adhered 
to as a minimum;
�  Employees are recognised as key to the business with individual 
skills and experience being valued and developed; and
�  Health, safety and environmental issues are treated as critical 
areas of concern for the business.

Social
The health, welfare and development of the Company’s employees 
are a priority. With the intent of attracting, recruiting, developing 
and retaining key employees, Micro Focus maintains a number 
of policies and procedures for the beneﬁ t of its employees, for 
example an equal opportunities policy approved by ACAS. Employee 
development is encouraged through appropriate training. Regular 
and open communication between management and employees 
is viewed as essential for motivating a highly educated workforce. 
Brieﬁ ngs are held regularly to provide updates on Company 
business and to provide opportunity for questions and feedback. 
Review meetings are also held regularly within each department. 
The Company maintains both an Internet website which is freely 
accessible and an Intranet site accessible to all employees. During 
the year, two additional Sharesave plans and US ESPP plans were 
introduced and the directors actively encourage employee equity 
participation, subject to compliance with the Group’s share dealing 
policy. Details of the current employee share option schemes and 
options granted during the year are given in note 23.
The Company plays an active part in its local communities, 
participating in charitable initiatives and local community support 
projects. Two recent examples took place in Bulgaria and Italy. 
In Shiroka Laka, Bulgaria, the Micro Focus team supported an 
orphanage by building a fully functional computer room and 
conducted training sessions for the children. In Italy, the Company 
has donated ofﬁ ce furniture to schools and public ofﬁ ces in 
the earthquake areas of Abruzzo, Aquila and the surrounding 
communities to effectively contribute to the rebuilding of this 
unfortunate area.
Ethical
The Company manages its resources prudently to ensure appropriate 
investment is made in its research and development programmes 
and its commercialisation activities. Up-to-date security systems 
are utilised to protect the Company’s IT systems. The Company’s 
intellectual property is protected through an appropriate trademark 
registration and patenting programme. Close attention is paid to 
maintaining relationships with key stakeholders including business

Business review
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer’s review  Revenue for the year increased by 20.4% to $274.7 million, adjusted 
operating proﬁ t increased by 33.5% to $115.6 million, adjusted 
proﬁ t before tax increased by 30.8% to $115.9 million and adjusted 
earnings per share increased by 29.4% to 41.51 cents per share. 
In the report below we have provided detail of total revenue at 
actual exchange rates by both geography and revenue category. 
In addition, to facilitate comparison on a like-for-like basis we have 
also shown the impact of exchange rate movements on revenue and 
the impact of acquisitions. Acquisitions before 30 April 2008 include 
HAL Knowledge Solutions and Acucorp and after 1 May 2008, 
NetManage, Liant and Relativity. 
All areas showed solid improvement driven by both organic growth 
and the impact of acquisitions. Revenue by geographic region at 
actual reported $ was as follows:

Total revenue 274.7 100.0 228.2 100.0
Excluding the impact of exchange rate movements on revenue and 
the impact of current and prior year acquisitions, all geographic 
regions achieved solid organic growth as shown in the table below. 
The core Micro Focus organic revenue growth at constant currency 
was 10.1%. 
Revenues from acquisitions added $57.2 million of revenue in the 
year. $25.5 million was generated from acquisitions completed in 
prior years and $31.7 million from current year acquisitions. 
We have been encouraged by the growth in new direct territories 
including Spain, India and Central and Eastern Europe, which 
assisted in helping our Europe and the Middle East geography 
increase by 13.7%.

Organic licence fee revenue growth from the core business at 
constant currency was driven by our low value, high volume run 
rate business combined with improved sales of larger value 
transactions to enterprise customers. We deﬁ ne larger value 
transactions as those in excess of $0.5 million. It is encouraging 
to see both the number and average value of these larger value 
transactions increasing year on year. 
Organic maintenance revenue growth from the core business 
at constant currency was 11.9% reﬂ ecting the impact of solid 
licence fee sales combined with inﬂ ationary price increases and an 
improvement in the renewal rate as compared to the prior period.
Organic consulting revenue growth at constant currency showed 
a small decline against the prior year although the growth rate 
improved in the second half year as compared to the ﬁ rst half year. 
The acquisitions made in the year comprising, NetManage, 
Liant and Relativity added $31.7 million of revenues in the year.

Costs 
All comments below relate to costs at actual reported $. 
Cost of sales for the year fell by 1% to $22.4 million. The costs in 
this category predominantly relate to our consulting and helpline 
support operations. 
Selling and distribution costs increased by 23.6% to $78.1 million. 
We continue to make signiﬁ cant investments in the sales and 
marketing functions to support growth and will continue to do 
so. This cost category represents approximately 27% of revenue 
and is expected to remain at a similar percentage of revenue for 
the year ahead. 
Research and development expenses increased by 15.7% to 
$34.1 million. We expect to maintain this cost category at a 
similar percentage of total revenue as we continue to enhance 
and expand our solution set to take advantage of the considerable 
market opportunity. 
Excluding restructuring charges of $14.9 million (2008: $6.5 million), 
administrative expenses increased by 7.5% to $34.0 million. 
The increase in costs includes costs of the acquired businesses 
as well as expanding the Group’s support functions to facilitate 
current and future growth. We continue to leverage our back ofﬁ ce 
function to drive margin improvements as we expand the Group. 
Currency impact 
An analysis of both revenue and costs as a percentage of the 
total by $ and other currencies is shown below. As the Euro and 
Sterling have weakened against the $ our revenues have been 
negatively impacted by exchange rate movements as compared 
to the prior year. However, with a higher percentage of costs in 
non $ denominated currencies than revenues, our expenses have 
decreased proportionately faster than revenues. As a result, adjusted 
operating proﬁ t as reported in $ was not materially different 
pre-or post-currency adjustments.

Total  100.0 100.0 
Operating proﬁ t 
Operating proﬁ t for the year was $91.2 million (2008: $74.8 million). 
Adjusted operating proﬁ t increased by 34% to $115.6 million 
(2008: $86.6 million), the improvement being driven by increased 
revenue and an improvement in margins. 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 34% to $118.6 million (2008: $88.5 
million) as a result of increased revenue and tightly controlled costs. 
Net ﬁ nance income 
Net ﬁ nance income was signiﬁ cantly lower than for the previous 
year at $0.2 million (2008: $2.0 million) due to lower average cash 
balances and lower interest rates. Cash balances were reduced by 
$78.6 million as a result of the purchases of NetManage, Liant and 
Relativity and associated restructuring charges. We also incurred 
facility fees of $0.7 million on the unused bank facility. 
Taxation 
Tax for the year was $25.4 million (2008: $21.4 million) based 
on increased proﬁ ts. The Group’s effective tax rate is 27.8% 
(2008: 27.9%). Our medium-term effective tax rate is expected 
to be maintained at approximately 28%. 
Proﬁ t after tax 
Proﬁ t after tax increased by 19% to $66.0 million (2008: $55.4 
million), similar to the growth in revenues. 
Cash ﬂ ow 
At 30 April 2009, the Company’s cash balance was $71.6 million 
(2008: $92.4 million). The Group generated a net cash inﬂ ow 
from continuing operating activities of $105.0 million which was 
offset by outﬂ ows of $78.6 million in respect of the acquisition 
and restructuring of NetManage, Liant and Relativity as well 
as corporation tax payments of $20.0 million and dividends 
of $26.1 million.

Dividend 
The board continues to adopt a progressive dividend policy reﬂ ecting 
the long-term earnings and cash ﬂ ow potential of Micro Focus with a 
level of dividend cover for the ﬁ nancial year ending 30 April 2009 of 
approximately 2.5 times on a pre-exceptional earnings basis. In line 
with the above policy, the directors recommend payment of a ﬁ nal 
dividend in respect of the full year to 30 April 2009 of 11.1 cents per 
share providing for total dividends in the year of 15.6 cents per share, 
an increase of 20% over the total dividends of 13.0 cents per share 
for the full year to 30 April 2008. The dividend will be paid on 
28 September 2009 to shareholders on the register on 4 September 
2009. The directors of Micro Focus International plc have concluded 
that the Company has sufﬁ cient reserves to enable the payment of 
the ﬁ nal dividend. 
Dividends will be paid in sterling based on an exchange rate of 
£1 = $1.65, equivalent to 6.73 pence per share, being the rate 
applicable on 24 June 2009, the date of recommendation of the 
dividend by the board. 
Acquisitions made in the year 
During the year, we made three acquisitions, NetManage in June, 
Liant in July and Relativity in December. These three acquisitions 
added $31.7 million of revenues to the current year results at a 
margin broadly similar to that of the total Group. Revenues for 
the year ahead are expected to increase in regard to acquisitions 
as we see the beneﬁ t of a full 12 months of results. 
Acquisitions made post-period end 
On 29 May 2009, we closed the acquisition of Compuware’s Testing 
and ASQ business. The gross purchase price was $80 million. 
On 27 July 2009, we closed the acquisition of the Borland Software 
Corporation for a gross purchase price of approximately $113 million. 
To ﬁ nance these acquisitions, we have arranged a three-year 
revolving credit facility of $215 million through a syndicated loan 
consortium comprising Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS. This facility 
together with the Group’s existing cash balances will be used to 
fund the completed acquisitions and subsequent integration activities.

Employment policy
Equal opportunities
The Group operates an equal opportunities policy. Full consideration 
is given to all job applicants, irrespective of gender, age, marital 
status, disability, sexuality, race, colour, religion, ethnic or national 
origin or any other conditions not relevant to the performance of 
the job, who can demonstrate that they have the necessary skills 
and abilities.
Disabled employees
With regard to existing employees and those who may become 
disabled, the Group’s policy is to examine ways and means to provide 
continuing employment under its existing terms and conditions and 
to provide training and career development, including promotion, 
wherever appropriate. All employees accept the commitment within 
this policy that the Group will not allow discrimination or harassment 
by employees or others acting on the Group’s behalf, in respect of 
sex, age, marital status, race, nationality, disability or religious or 
political beliefs.
Employee involvement
The Group believes it is important that employees are aware of the 
Group’s business strategy and objectives to assist them to focus 
on working towards these goals. Communications at the time of 
key announcements, including presentations by directors to all 
employees, together with brieﬁ ngs throughout the year are part of 
the communication and consultation programme. In addition, regular 
meetings are held with staff and managers, both to raise issues and 
to assist with the two-way ﬂ ow of information.
Further education and training
Continuing education, training and development are important 
to ensure the future success of the Group. The Group supports 
individuals who wish to obtain appropriate further education 
qualiﬁ cations and reimburses tuition fees up to a speciﬁ ed level. 
Training needs of all employees are also analysed during the annual 
appraisal process, at which time a training plan is agreed as part of 
each individual’s ongoing development.
Share option schemes
The directors remain committed to the principle that selected 
employees should be able to participate in the Group’s progress 
through share based compensation schemes. Details of the Group’s 
share based compensation schemes are given in note 23.
Payment of creditors
Micro Focus International plc, which holds the investments in 
the Group’s companies, does not trade itself and does not have 
suppliers as deﬁ ned by the Companies Act 1985. The directors 
believe, however, it would be helpful to give the disclosures on a 
consolidated basis.
The Group seeks the best possible terms from suppliers appropriate 
to their business and in placing orders gives consideration to quality, 
delivery, price and terms of payment. The Group does not follow 
a speciﬁ c payment code but has a policy to pay its suppliers in 
accordance with the speciﬁ c terms agreed with each supplier. The 
average number of days’ purchases outstanding at 30 April 2009 for 
the Group was 28 days (2008: 28 days).
Financial instruments
The exposure of the Group to ﬁ nancial risks, including the use of 
ﬁ nancial instruments and policies for hedging and the exposure to 
price, credit, cash ﬂ ow and liquidity risk, can be found in note 18 to 
the ﬁ nancial statements.

•  On a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall 
have one vote for every share of which he or she is the holder.
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of shares held by him or her if any call or other 
sum then payable by him or her in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid.
Deadlines for voting rights
Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect 
of the resolutions to be considered at the AGM to be held on 
24 September 2009 are set out in the Notice of Meeting which 
accompanies this report.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and the 
Companies Act 2006 (‘the Companies Acts’), the Company may, by 
ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be paid to members, but no 
dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the board. The 
board may pay interim dividends, and also any ﬁ xed rate dividend, 
whenever the proﬁ ts of the Company, in the opinion of the board, 
justiﬁ es its payment. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro 
rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares. Micro Focus

Liquidation
Under the Articles, if the Company is in liquidation, the liquidator 
may, with the authority of an extraordinary resolution of the 
Company:
•  Divide among the members in specie the whole or any part of the 
assets of the Company; or
•  Vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees upon such 
trusts for the beneﬁ t of members as the liquidator, with the like 
authority, shall think ﬁ t.
Transfer of shares
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of his 
or her certiﬁ ed shares in writing by an instrument of transfer in 
any usual form or in any other form which the board may approve. 
The board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any 
reasons, decline to register any instrument of transfer of a certiﬁ ed 
share which is not a fully paid share provided that, where any such 
shares are admitted to the Ofﬁ cial List maintained by the UK Listing 
Authority, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as 
to prevent dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on 
an open and proper basis. The board may decline to recognise any 
instrument of transfer relating to shares in certiﬁ cated form unless it 
is in respect of only one class of share and is lodged (duly stamped 
if required) at the Transfer Ofﬁ ce accompanied by the relevant share 
certiﬁ cate(s) and such other evidence as the board may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transfer or to make the transfer 
(and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person 
on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do). In the case of a 
transfer of shares in certiﬁ cated form by a recognised clearing house 
or a nominee of a recognised clearing house or of a recognised 
investment exchange the lodgement of share certiﬁ cates will only 
be necessary if and to the extent that certiﬁ cates have been issued 
in respect of the shares in question. The directors may also refuse to 
register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully-paid or not) 
in favour of more than four persons jointly. Subject to the Articles 
and the rules (as deﬁ ned in the CREST Regulations), and apart from 
any class of wholly dematerialised security, the board may permit any 
class of shares in the Company to be held in uncertiﬁ cated form and, 
subject to the Articles, title to uncertiﬁ cated shares to be transferred 
by means of a relevant system.
Repurchase of shares
The Company obtained shareholder authority at the last AGM (held 
on 25 September 2008) to buy back up to 20,056,391 ordinary 
shares, which remains outstanding until the conclusion of the next 
AGM on 24 September 2009. The minimum price which must be 
paid for such shares is 10 pence and the maximum price payable is 
the higher of 5% above the average of the mid-market price of the 
ordinary shares of the Company as derived from the London Stock 
Exchange Daily Ofﬁ cial List for the ﬁ ve business days immediately 
before the purchase is made and the amount stipulated by Article 
5(1) of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003 (in each case 
exclusive of expenses).
Amendment to the Articles
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 by way of 
special resolution.
Appointment and replacement of directors
Directors shall be no less than three and no more than 11 in number. 
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution 
or by the board. A director appointed by the board holds ofﬁ ce 
only until the next AGM and is then eligible for election by the 
shareholders and thereafter at least every three years. The board may 
from time to time appoint one or more directors to hold employment 
or executive ofﬁ ce for such period (subject to the Companies Acts) 
and on such terms as they may determine and may revoke or 
terminate any such employment.
The Company may by ordinary resolution of which special notice 
has been given remove and the board by unanimous decision may 
remove any director before the expiration of his term of ofﬁ ce and 
the Company may elect or the board may appoint another person 
in place of a director so removed from ofﬁ ce.
The ofﬁ ce of director shall be vacated if: (i) he or she in writing 
resigns or offers to resign and the directors accept such offer 
(ii) an order is made by any court claiming that he or she is or may 
be suffering from a mental disorder; (iii) he or she is absent without 
permission of the board from meetings for six months and the 
board resolves that his or her ofﬁ ce is vacated; (iv) he or she 
becomes bankrupt or compounds with his or her creditors 
generally; (v) he or she is prohibited by law from being a director; 
or (vi) he or she is removed from ofﬁ ce pursuant to the Articles.
Powers of the directors
The business of the Company will be managed by the board who 
may exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the provisions 
of the Company’s memorandum of association, the Articles, the 
Companies Acts and any ordinary resolution of the Company.
Shares held in the Employee Beneﬁ t Trust
Where the trustee of the Micro Focus Employee Beneﬁ t Trust holds 
shares in the Company and the beneﬁ cial interest in those shares has 
not been transferred to a beneﬁ ciary of the Trust, the Trustee may 
not vote in relation to those shares at any meeting of shareholders 
of the Company.
Signiﬁ cant agreements
The following signiﬁ cant agreement contains provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of 
a change of control of the Company:
On 13 May 2008 the Company entered into a $40 million credit 
facility with HSBC Bank Plc and Lloyds TSB Bank plc for general 
corporate purposes. On a change of control, the bankers may give 
not less than ﬁ ve days notice to the Company and cancel the facility 
and require repayment of any outstanding loans and interest. The 
facility expired on 12 May 2009. 
On 6 May 2009 the Company entered into a $175 million credit 
facility provided through a syndicated loan consortium comprising 
Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc to assist with the funding of acquisitions 
and for general corporate purposes. On 12 June 2009, the Company 
entered into a supplemental agreement for an additional $40 million 
to assist with the acquisition of Borland Software Corporation at an 
increased offer price. On a change of control, all the facilities become 
immediately due and payable.

Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
So far as they are aware, the directors at the date of this report 
conﬁ rm that there is no relevant audit information (that is, 
information needed by the Company’s auditors in connection with 
preparing their report) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware 
and that the directors have taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to 
continue in ofﬁ ce and a resolution that they be reappointed will be 
proposed at the AGM.
Going concern
The directors, having made enquiries, consider that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, and therefore it is appropriate 
to maintain the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial 
statements.

Introduction
The principal corporate governance guidance that applies to 
companies listed with the UK Listing Authority during the year 
reported on is contained in the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Combined Code 2006 (‘the Combined Code’). The Combined Code, 
which operates on a ‘comply or explain’ basis, incorporates, among 
others, recommendations by the Higgs Review regarding the role of 
non-executive directors and the Smith Review, which refers to audit 
committees. Through their commitment to the highest standards of 
corporate governance, the board endorses and supports the essential 
elements of the Combined Code and, apart from a few limited 
exceptions as described below, believes the Group has fully complied 
with the Combined Code during the year reported on. Where it has 
not, an explanation has been provided.
Compliance statement
The directors are committed to ensuring that the Company will work 
towards compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code .
Throughout the year reported on the Company has been in 
compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code on corporate governance, except for the following:
A.3.2 – board of directors – The Combined Code requires that at 
least half the board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise non-
executive directors determined by the board to be independent. 
Following the resignation of non-executive director Prescott Ashe, 
who was not regarded as independent on 8 September 2008, the 
Company is now in compliance. David Dominik, who was also not 
regarded as independent, resigned on 18 February 2009.
A.4.1 – nomination committee – The Combined Code requires 
that a majority of members of the nomination committee should be 
independent non-executive directors. The nomination committee 
comprises the Chairman, David Maloney (non-executive senior 
independent director) and Stephen Kelly (executive director). The 
Company is aware that the Chairman is not regarded as independent 
for purposes of the Combined Code. The Chairman operates in 
a non-executive capacity and is considered by the board to be 
independent of management and free from any business or other 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of his 
independent judgment.
The principles set out in the Combined Code cover four areas:
the board, directors’ remuneration, accountability and audit and 
shareholder relations. With the exception of directors’ remuneration 
(which is dealt with separately in the remuneration report on pages 
42 to 49) the following section sets out how the board has applied 
these principles.
The board
The Group is controlled by the board, which is responsible for the 
Group’s system of corporate governance. As at 30 April 2009, the 
board comprised six directors:
Kevin Loosemore Non-executive Chairman
Stephen Kelly Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
Nick Bray Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer
David Maloney  Non-executive senior independent director
Paul Pester  Non-executive director
Tom Skelton  Non-executive director
The role of the non-executive directors is to ensure that independent 
judgment is brought to board deliberations and decisions.
The non-executive directors possess a wide range of skills and 
experience, relevant to the development of the Company, which 
complement those of the executive directors.
The Chairman operates in a non-executive capacity and is considered 
by the board to be independent of management and free from any 
business or other relationship which could materially interfere with 
the exercise of his independent judgment.
David Maloney, the non-executive senior independent director, Paul 
Pester and Tom Skelton, non-executive directors, are considered by 
the board to be independent. 
In accordance with the Combined Code, all directors will be subject 
to election by the shareholders at the ﬁ rst Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) of the Company after their appointment, and, thereafter, at 
least every three years. Kevin Loosemore, Stephen Kelly and Nick Bray 
will retire by rotation at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible will 
stand for re-election. The non-executive directors are appointed for 
speciﬁ c terms. Full terms of their appointment are to be found in the 
remuneration report.
The board has agreed procedures for directors to follow if they 
believe they require independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties and these procedures allow the directors 
to take such advice at the Company’s expense. In addition, all 
the directors have direct access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is accountable to 
the board through the Chairman on governance matters. It is 
the responsibility of the Company Secretary to ensure that board 
procedures are followed and all rules and regulations are complied 
with. Under the direction of the Chairman, the Company Secretary’s 
responsibilities include facilitating induction and professional 
development and ensuring the smooth ﬂ ow of information within 
the board and its committees, and between non-executive directors 
and senior management. Any new director receives a comprehensive, 
formal and tailored induction into the Company’s operations. 
Appropriate training is provided to new directors and is also available 
to other directors as required.
The terms of reference of the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
have been agreed with the board and, in accordance with best 
practice, their roles remain separate.
As part of its leadership and control of the Company, the 
board has agreed a list of items that are speciﬁ cally reserved 
for its consideration. These include business strategy, ﬁ nancing 
arrangements, material acquisitions and divestments, approval of the 
annual budget, major capital expenditure projects, risk management, 
treasury policies and establishing and monitoring internal controls. 
At each meeting, the board reviews progress of the Group towards 
its objectives, and monitors ﬁ nancial progress against budget.
In the year to 30 April 2010, the board will schedule meetings on 
a regular basis approximately every two months, with additional 
meetings when circumstances and business dictate. In months in 
which the board does not meet update calls are scheduled to review 
progress. A schedule of meetings has been established. All directors 
receive an agenda and board papers in advance of meetings to help 
them make an effective contribution at the meetings. In addition, 
the executive directors ensure regular informal contact is maintained 
Management and governance

with non-executive directors. The board makes full use of appropriate 
technology as a means of updating and informing all its members.
In the year under review, the board met on 13 occasions, 11 such 
meetings being scheduled formal board meetings with a further two 
additional meetings of the board called at short notice and held by 
telephone to consider board issues.
While the board retains overall responsibility for, and control of, the 
Company, day-to-day management of the business is conducted 
by the executive directors. Review of the Group’s principal business 
activities is the responsibility of task teams, comprising the executive 
directors together with executives responsible for the relevant tasks 
who meet regularly.
The board receives papers on key subjects in advance of each board 
meeting. These typically cover:
•  Strategy and budgets;
•  Business and ﬁ nancial performance;
•  Corporate activities;
•  Human resources; and
•  Investor relations.
The board has undertaken a formal and rigorous process for 
the evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees 
and individual directors (including the Chairman), as required 
by Combined Code provision A6.1. This evaluation has been 
conducted by JCA Group Ltd and has taken the form of personal 
interviews with the directors and observations of board and 
committee meetings.
The Chairman holds meetings with non-executive directors without 
the presence of executive directors.
Conﬂ icts of interest
Following the implementation of the relevant provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has put in place procedures 
to deal with conﬂ icts of interests, which have operated effectively.
The board is aware of the other commitments of its directors and 
changes to these commitments are reported to the board.
Board committees
In accordance with best practice, the Company has established audit, 
nomination and remuneration committees, with written terms of 
reference for each that deal with their respective authorities and 
duties. The full terms of reference of all the committees are available 
from the Company Secretary or can be located on the Company’s 
website. The Company is aware that the Chairman is not regarded 
as independent for the purposes of the Combined Code.
Audit committee
The audit committee is comprised entirely of non-executive directors 
of the Company. It is chaired by David Maloney, who the board 
considers has recent and relevant ﬁ nancial experience. The other 
members are Tom Skelton and Paul Pester.
The audit committee has met six times during the ﬁ nancial year and 
will meet at least four times during the coming ﬁ nancial year (and, 
additionally as appropriate). A schedule of meetings for the year has 
been established.
The audit committee is responsible for reviewing the Group’s annual 
accounts and interim reports prior to submission for approval to 
the full board. This committee also monitors the Group’s accounting 
policies, internal ﬁ nancial control systems and ﬁ nancial reporting 
procedures. The audit committee provides a forum through which 
the Group’s external and internal auditors report to the board. 
The auditors are invited to attend meetings of the committee on 
a regular basis and have the opportunity to meet privately with 
committee members in the absence of executive management. 
The audit committee oversees the relationship with the auditor, 
including the independence and objectivity of the auditor (taking 
into account UK professional and regulatory requirements and the 
relationship with the audit ﬁ rm as a whole) and the consideration 
of audit fees and fees for other non-audit work. In addition, the 
audit committee has developed a policy designed to ensure that 
the auditor’s objectivity and independence is not compromised by 
its undertaking inappropriate non-audit work. All signiﬁ cant non-
audit work commissioned from the external auditor requires audit 
committee approval. An outsourced internal audit function continues 
to be provided by KPMG. The Group’s Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer provides 
oversight and co-ordination of internal audit. In order to ensure 
independence internal audit has a direct reporting line to the audit 
committee and its chairman.
The role of internal audit is to advise executive management and the 
board on the extent to which the Group’s systems of internal control 
are effective. The internal audit plan for each year is determined 
through a structured process of risk assessment and is approved by 
the audit committee.
The nature and scope of the internal audits completed during the 
year was reviewed and approved by the audit committee and the 
reports of results of completed audits received and responses of 
executive management considered. The plan set out at the beginning 
of the year was achieved and the outcome of the work was in line 
with expectations.
The audit committee’s terms of reference include a process for 
employees of the Company to raise in conﬁ dence concerns about 
possible impropriety in matters of ﬁ nancial reporting or other matters.
The written terms of reference of the audit committee include, 
among other things, the following responsibilities:
•  To report to the board, identifying any matters in respect of which 
it considers that action or improvement is needed and making 
recommendations as to the steps to be taken;
•  To ensure that the interests of shareholders are properly protected 
in relation to ﬁ nancial reporting and internal control;
•  To monitor the integrity of the ﬁ nancial statements of the 
Company, including its annual and interim reports, preliminary 
results announcements and any other announcement relating 
to its ﬁ nancial performance;
•  To review the consistency of, and changes to, accounting policies;
•  To keep under review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
controls and risk management systems;
•  To review the Company’s arrangements for its employees to raise 
concerns, in conﬁ dence, about possible wrongdoing in ﬁ nancial 
reporting or other matters;
•  To monitor and review the need for, and the effectiveness of, the 
Company’s internal audit function in the context of the Company’s 
overall risk management system; and Micro Focus 
International plc
Annual Report and 
Accounts 2009

•  To oversee the relationship with the Company’s auditors, ensuring 
the independence and objectivity of the auditor and considering 
audit fees and fees for non-audit work; to consider and make 
recommendations to the board in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the Company’s external auditor.
During the year, the committee’s business included consideration of 
the following:
•  The effectiveness of internal control procedures;
•  The annual ﬁ nancial statements, full year results announcement, 
half year results and other stock exchange announcements;
•  The annual review of the performance and effectiveness of both 
the internal and external auditors;
•  Responses to a questionnaire on the audit committee’s 
performance and effectiveness;
•  A strategic risk assessment exercise to identify and assess the 
Group’s key risks and the controls in place to manage and 
mitigate against these risks;
•  Review of the internal audit reports issued during the year and 
the risk based internal audit programme for 2010;
•  Review of the external audit plan;
•  Review of the work integrating the corporate structure of 
acquisitions made during the year;
•  The updated policy on Market Abuse and Insider Dealing;
•  Succession planning strategy for the ﬁ nance function;
•  Consideration of the FRC report on ‘Challenges for Audit 
Committees Arising From Current Economic Conditions’;
•  Appointment of Deloitte as the Group’s tax advisors; and
•  The management of corporate fraud risks. 
Nomination committee
The nomination committee is comprised of Kevin Loosemore (who 
chairs the committee), David Maloney, (the non-executive Senior 
independent director) and Stephen Kelly (Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
of the Company) and has met two times during the ﬁ nancial year. 
The nomination committee will meet at least twice during the 
coming ﬁ nancial year. David Dominik resigned as a director and 
from the committee on 18 February 2009 and Stephen Kelly was 
appointed to the committee on 23 February 2009.
The nomination committee is responsible to the full board for 
proposing candidates to the board, having regard to the balance and 
structure of the board. The nomination committee uses consultants 
to identify suitable candidates where a position is identiﬁ ed.
The terms of reference of the nomination committee include, among 
other things, the following responsibilities:
•  To review the structure, size and composition of the board and 
make recommendations to the board with regard to any changes;
•  To identify and nominate, for the approval of the board, 
candidates to ﬁ ll board vacancies as and when they arise;
•  To give full consideration to succession planning for directors 
and other senior executives; 
•  To keep under review the leadership needs of the Group, both 
executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring the 
continued ability of the organisation to compete effectively in 
the marketplace; and
•  To review annually the time required from non-executives and 
evaluating whether they are spending enough time to fulﬁ l 
their duties.
Remuneration committee
Details of the remuneration committee are described in the 
remuneration report on pages 42 to 47.
Accountability and audit
The board is responsible for the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements 
that present a balanced assessment of the Group’s ﬁ nancial position 
and prospects. This responsibility is administered primarily by the audit 
committee, the terms of reference of which are referred to above.
Internal controls
The board is ultimately responsible for establishing and monitoring 
internal control systems throughout the Group and reviewing their 
effectiveness. It recognises that rigorous systems of internal control 
are critical to the Group’s achievement of its business objectives, that 
those systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and 
that they can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the control system are:
•  The Group operates a structured, objectives-driven approach to 
fulﬁ l its core purpose and goals in respect of sustained proﬁ tability 
and growth;
•  Research and development and capital expenditure programmes 
are subject to formal review and monitoring procedures;
•  All contracts are reviewed. The level of review depends on the size 
and complexity of the contracts and associated risks. There are 
formal limits above which the review level is escalated;
•  Reconciliations are performed on a timely basis for all major 
accounts; and
•  Systems and procedures are in place for all major transaction types 
with appropriate authorisation controls.
There is an ongoing internal process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Company in association 
with the work performed by the outsourced internal audit function. 
This process has been in place throughout the year and up to 
the date of approval of the report and accounts and it is regularly 
reviewed by the board and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
As part of the process that the Company has in place to review the 
effectiveness of the internal control system, there are procedures 
designed to capture and evaluate failings and weaknesses, and in the 
case of those categorised by the board as ‘signiﬁ cant’, procedures 
exist to ensure that necessary action is taken to remedy the failings.

This requirement is set out in the audit committee’s terms of 
reference to report on a regular basis to the board on the Group’s 
internal ﬁ nancial control procedures and to make recommendations 
to the board in this area.
The external auditors provide a supplementary, independent and 
autonomous perspective on those areas of the internal control 
system which they assess in the course of their work. Their ﬁ ndings 
are regularly reported to both the audit committee and the board. 
To ensure auditor objectivity and independence there is a stringent 
process in place to approve non-audit work.
Human resources
The Group endeavours to appoint employees with appropriate skills, 
knowledge and experience for the roles they undertake.
The Group has a range of policies which are aimed at retaining and 
providing incentives for key staff. Objectives are set for departments 
and employees that are derived from the Group’s business objectives 
and performance is formally measured against these objectives twice 
per year. The Group has a clear and well-understood organisational 
structure and each employee knows his or her line of accountability.
Announcements
All major announcements are approved by the Chairman and the 
executive directors and circulated to the board prior to issue.
The Group also has internal and external checks to guard against 
unauthorised release of information.
Financial
A comprehensive budgeting system allows managers to submit 
detailed budgets which are reviewed and amended by executive 
directors prior to submission to the board for approval.
Insurance
The Group keeps under review its portfolio of insurance policies with 
its insurance brokers to ensure that the policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s activities and exposures.
Attendance at meetings
The number of board meetings and committee meetings attended 
by each director in the year to 30 April 2009 was as follows:

Directors are normally provided with the agenda and supporting 
papers for board and committee meetings a week prior to the 
meeting. If unable to attend a meeting a director will provide 
feedback to the Chairman, chairman of the committee or the 
Company Secretary and their comments are then communicated 
at the meeting.
Shareholder relations
The Company values the views of shareholders and recognises their 
interests in the Group’s strategy and performance.
The Company reports formally to shareholders four times a year, 
around June (preliminary announcement of annual results) and 
December (interim statement). The Company also publishes interim 
management statements in or around August and February each 
year. The annual report is expected to be mailed to shareholders 
in August. Separate announcements of all material events are 
made as necessary. Regular communications are maintained with 
institutional shareholders and presentations are given to shareholders 
when the half-year and full-year ﬁ nancial results are announced and 
at other times. In addition to the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer, who have regular contact with investors, Kevin 
Loosemore, Chairman, and David Maloney, Senior Independent 
Director, are available to meet with shareholders as and when 
required. The whole board is kept up to date at its regular meetings 
with the views of shareholders and analysts. External analysts’ reports 
are also circulated to directors.
The Company’s website (www.microfocus.com) provides an overview 
of the business including its strategy, products and objectives.
All Group announcements are available on the website and new 
announcements are published without delay. The terms of reference 
of each of the board’s three committees and other important 
corporate governance documents are available on the website and 
from the Company Secretary. Additionally, the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer 
provides a focal point for shareholders’ enquiries and dialogue 
throughout the year.
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
The Company’s AGM, which will be held on 24 September 2009 
at 3pm (UK time) will provide an opportunity for the board to meet 
with all shareholders and participation of shareholders is encouraged. 
At the meeting, in addition to the statutory business, the board will 
be available for questions from shareholders.
In accordance with the Combined Code recommendations, the 
Company will count all proxy votes and will indicate the level of 
proxies lodged, the number of proxy votes for and against such 
resolution and the number of votes withheld. A resolution will 
be proposed for each substantive issue and the chairs of the 
audit, remuneration and nomination committees will attend to 
answer questions. Micro Focus

Introduction
This is the Company’s remuneration report in respect of the year to 
30 April 2009 and, subject to ongoing review by the remuneration 
committee (the ‘committee’) as to its appropriateness, sets out the 
ongoing policy in respect of the following and subsequent years.
The Company seeks to comply with the relevant conditions of the 
2006 Combined Code on corporate governance relating to directors’ 
remuneration as published by the Financial Reporting Council and 
the Companies Act 2006. The regulations require the auditors to 
report to the Company’s members on the ‘auditable part’ of the 
directors’ remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion 
that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, a resolution to approve 
the remuneration report will be proposed at the Company’s AGM on 
24 September 2009. Details of the resolution may be found in the 
Notice of Meeting accompanying this annual report. The vote will 
be advisory and will be considered carefully by the members of the 
committee in the formulation and approval of the Company’s future 
remuneration policies.
The remuneration committee
The committee has met ﬁ ve times during the ﬁ nancial year. The 
committee is responsible for reviewing remuneration arrangements 
for members of the board and for providing general guidance 
on aspects of remuneration policy throughout the Group. The 
committee will meet at least twice during the coming ﬁ nancial year.
The terms of reference of the committee include, among other 
things, the following responsibilities:
•  To determine and agree with the board the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer, Chairman, the executive directors, the Company Secretary 
and other members of the executive management team (as 
appointed from time to time);
•  To determine the total individual remuneration package of each 
executive director and other senior executives including bonuses, 
incentive payments and share options or other share awards;
•  To determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements 
for each executive director and other senior executives;
•  To approve the framework of salaries for senior managers, 
and determine targets for any performance-related pay 
schemes operated by the Company, and approve the total 
annual payments;
•  To review the design of all share incentive plans for approval 
by the board and shareholders;
•  To oversee any major changes in employee beneﬁ t structures 
throughout the Company or Group; and
•  To review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the 
remuneration policy.
The committee comprises Paul Pester as Chairman with David 
Maloney, Tom Skelton and Kevin Loosemore as its other members. 
Where appropriate the committee invites the views of the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer, the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and the Group Human 
Resources Director, as well as that of external remuneration 
consultants. The Chairman absents himself from any discussion 
relating to his own remuneration.
The committee has been materially assisted by Hewitt Associates 
Limited trading as Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’) (who are the 
principal advisors to the committee), in providing remuneration 
advice, by Steen and Co, solicitors, by Linklaters, solicitors, and by 
Watson Wyatt. Their advice has been taken into account by the 
committee where appropriate. During the year the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer and Group Human Resources Director attended some of 
the meetings by invitation of the committee on speciﬁ c items, 
however they did not participate in discussions relating to their 
own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the committee are available from 
the Company Secretary and are on the Company’s website 
www.microfocus.com under ‘Investors’.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors 
and their direct reports is established by the committee and 
approved by the board. The individual remuneration package 
of each executive director is determined by the committee.
No executive director or employee participates in discussions 
relating to the setting of their own remuneration.
The objective of the Group’s remuneration policies is that all 
employees, including executive directors, should receive appropriate 
remuneration for their performance, responsibility, skills and 
experience. Remuneration packages are designed to enable the 
Group to attract and retain key employees by ensuring they are 
remunerated appropriately and competitively and that they are 
motivated to achieve the highest level of Group performance in 
line with the best interests of shareholders.
It is intended that an appropriate and signiﬁ cant proportion of 
remuneration will continue to be performance related (see details 
below). Performance conditions for performance-related bonuses 
and long-term incentives will represent challenging growth targets 
which are designed to increase shareholder value. The committee 
will review the performance conditions used to ensure that they 
remain demanding and appropriate.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on 
Responsible Investment Disclosure, the committee will ensure 
that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior 
management will not raise environmental, social or governance 
(‘ESG’) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. 
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, 
there is no restriction on the committee which prevents it from 
taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters.
It is the board’s intention to award share incentives to executive 
directors and selected employees as appropriate to reward and 
encourage performance. These share incentives will be granted 
at the discretion of the committee.

Policies on remuneration take account of the pay structure, 
employment conditions and relativities within the Group and also the 
industry sector. To determine the elements and level of remuneration 
appropriate to each executive director, the committee considers 
benchmark remuneration data for selected comparable technology 
companies and seeks to ensure that fixed costs are no higher than 
market median, that an appropriately significant proportion of 
potential pay is performance related and that total pay is consistent 
with appropriately competitive levels of pay for superior performance.
During the year the committee, with the assistance of HNBS and 
Watson Wyatt, conducted a review of all aspects of remuneration, 
with a particular emphasis on long-term incentive provision. Following 
this review the committee has decided to increase the level of annual 
awards of long-term incentives for the executive directors and other 
senior executives. This change is designed to ensure that the package 
of remuneration remains consistent with the policy outlined above.
The committee has also reviewed the performance condition 
used for long-term incentive awards to ensure that these remain 
consistent with the Group’s strategy. It concluded that EPS remains 
an appropriate performance measure for awards of long-term 
incentives. The committee will keep this measure under review to 
ensure it remains sufficiently challenging.
The Micro Focus International plc Incentive Plan 2005 (the ‘Plan’) 
currently has a limit of 5% in 10 years for specific awards within an 
overall plan limit of 10% in 10 years. The Company will be seeking 
shareholder approval at its AGM in September to remove the  
5% in 10 years limit from the Plan, while maintaining the overall 
10% in 10 years dilution limit. 
The 5% in 10 years limit is likely to become a constraint due to  
the following: 
•  The majority of shares issued to date have been granted as 
Market Priced Options. The board believes that Market Priced 
Options better align management and shareholders in a company 
with relatively high potential and growth. These types of awards 
typically require the issue of a greater number of options than zero 
priced options (approx 2.5-3 times greater volume). The board 
believes that moving to zero priced options at this time would 
dilute the link between shareholders and management.
•  Micro Focus has had and will continue to have the opportunity 
to create significant value through acquisition. On acquisition 
we will gain and hire key individuals that are necessary to the 
successful integration, stabilisation and growth of the acquired 
business. Long-term equity awards are an important part of 
retaining and recruiting these high calibre individuals and ensuring 
that the performance of the entire executive team is focused on 
creating long-term shareholder value. To date it has been in the 
best interest of shareholders to buy companies with cash and not 
through the issuance of shares. This has placed greater strain on 
the scheme. 
•  In July 2006, shareholders approved a resolution allowing 
the Company to satisfy option awards via the use of share 
appreciation rights (‘SARs’) and since then, the committee grants 
Market Priced Options in the form of SARs where possible. This 
again aligns the Company and shareholders by limiting dilution. 
Consistent with the ABI Guidelines, all the shares potentially 
subject to an outstanding option will count towards the limits 
  until such time as a smaller number of shares are actually issued 
on exercise. This means that the 5% limit is pushed even when a 
smaller number of shares may actually be issued.
•  When Micro Focus hired Stephen Kelly as the CEO and Nick Bray 
as the CFO in 2006, the Company’s share price was relatively low 
necessitating large grants in terms of numbers of shares for these 
critical hires.
Directors’ service contracts
Executive directors
The Group’s policy in entering into service contracts with executive 
directors is to enable the recruitment of high-quality executives and 
to obtain protection from their sudden departure whether or not to 
competitor companies. In addition, service contracts are an important 
element in maintaining maximum protection for the Group’ s intellectual 
property rights and other commercially sensitive information.
The service contract dated 1 May 2006 with Stephen Kelly requires  
the Company to give 12 months’ notice of termination. Stephen Kelly  
is required to give six months’ notice of the termination of his 
employment should he wish to leave. The service contract dated  
30 November 2005 with Nick Bray requires the Company to give 12 
months’ notice of termination. Nick Bray is required to give six months’ 
notice of the termination of his employment should he wish to leave.
If an executive director is guilty of a material breach of his service 
contract or commits any crime or act of gross misconduct or 
dishonesty, the Company is entitled summarily to terminate the 
service contract without notice and without payment in lieu of notice 
or other compensation. Such a contract term cannot, however, as 
a rule of law, affect the executive director’s statutory rights such as 
rights in respect of unfair dismissal.
Should an executive director be dismissed other than as described 
above, the Company may pay him, in lieu of notice, a sum equal to 
his basic pay over his notice period.
At the discretion of the committee having regard to the Company’s 
performance at the time of dismissal, the committee may in addition 
pay all or a proportion of the bonus which would, but for the 
dismissal, have become payable up to the date of notice being served 
by the Company. The Company’s policy on the duration of such 
contracts with executive directors is explained above.
Stephen Kelly acts in the capacity of a non-executive director at 
Cúram Software Limited, for which he receives remuneration of 
£40,000 per annum. Stephen Kelly is permitted to retain these fees 
as the post entails personal responsibility.
Nick Bray does not serve as a non-executive director for any 
company. The executive directors may not accept non-executive 
appointments without the consent of the board.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed by letter of appointment  
for a fixed term of three years subject to earlier termination by  
either the director or the Company on 90 days notice. Non-executive 
directors receive fees for services as members of the board and its 
committees. The level of fees is determined by the board after taking 
into account appropriate advice.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Group’s share 
incentives or otherwise receive performance related pay. Micro Focus

Kevin Loosemore and David Maloney signed re-appointment letters 
with the Company which became effective on 4 April 2008. Tom 
Skelton signed an appointment letter with effect from 23 October 
2006. Paul Pester signed an appointment letter which took effect 
on 27 June 2007. All appointments are subject to election by 
the shareholders at the ﬁ rst AGM of the Company after their 
appointment, and, thereafter, at least every three years. Tom Skelton 
and Paul Pester were elected at the AGM held on 26 September 
2007. As the remaining non-executive directors were elected to the 
board at the AGM of the Company in September 2005, the directors 
have agreed to offer themselves for re-election on a rotation basis. 
Accordingly, Kevin Loosemore retired voluntarily and was re-elected 
at the Company’s AGM in September 2006, David Maloney retired 
voluntarily and was re-elected at the Company’s AGM in September 
2007. Kevin Loosemore, together with executive directors Stephen 
Kelly and Nick Bray will be retiring voluntarily and submitting 
themselves for re-election by the shareholders at the AGM of the 
Company on 24 September 2009. The board considers it appropriate 
that Mr Loosemore is re-elected at the AGM. Each non-executive 
director still serving at the end of his term will have his appointment 
reviewed by the board and a further term of ofﬁ ce may be agreed. 
Where a non-executive director does not serve until the end of his 
term, the policy is to pay the fees due pro rata to the date of cessation.
Remuneration package
Executive directors’ remuneration currently comprises annual salary, 
a performance-related bonus, a long-term incentive in the form of 
share incentives, pension contributions and other beneﬁ ts.
Annual salary
The board approves the overall budget for employee salary increases 
and the committee agrees the speciﬁ c increases for executive 
directors and certain other senior members of the management 
team. In doing so it seeks to ensure that the approach taken for 
executive directors is consistent with that used for other employees. 
Salaries for executive directors and other senior employees are 
reviewed annually with changes becoming effective from 1 July 
each year. In determining appropriate salary levels for each executive 
director and senior employee, the committee considers both 
the nature and the status of the Company’s operations and the 
responsibilities, skills, experience and performance of the executive 
director or employee. The committee compares the Group’s 
remuneration packages for its directors and employees with 
those for directors and employees of similar seniority in companies 
whose activities are comparable with the Group and with which 
it competes for staff. The committee has used HNBS in making 
these comparisons.
At 30 April 2009, the salaries of the executive directors are as follows:
•  Stephen Kelly £330,000*
•  Nick Bray £220,000*
*  With effect from 1 July 2009, the committee agreed to increase each of the 
executive directors’ salaries by 10% (from £330,000 to £363,000 for Stephen 
Kelly and from £220,000 to £242,000 for Nick Bray) reﬂ ecting both the increased 
scale of the roles in line with the growth of the Company and following signiﬁ cant 
acquisitions this year.
Performance-related bonus
The executive directors and all other employees, except for sales 
staff, participate in a performance-related bonus scheme. The level 
of commission for sales staff is based on a percentage of revenue 
generated, with the percentages increasing as revenue exceeds 
target levels. The level of bonus for non-sales staff is based on 
overall Group performance in meeting its primary ﬁ nancial objectives 
in worldwide earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (‘EBITDA’) and revenue goals. The levels of bonus for 
Stephen Kelly and Nick Bray includes personal objectives.
The committee will continue to place a signiﬁ cant proportion of 
executive pay ‘at risk’, so that it is closely linked to the interests of 
shareholders. The committee will ensure that there is a balance 
between setting targets for executive directors which are challenging 
and clearly-assessable, which will include regard to consensus 
brokers’ forecasts where relevant, ensuring that the performance 
targets do not encourage undue risk-taking. 
Details of bonuses paid to executive directors in the year to 30 April 
2009 are detailed in the remuneration tables on page 46. Bonuses 
are awarded wholly in cash. The performance targets for Stephen 
Kelly resulted in a bonus of 93% of salary (out of 150%) of which 
32% was from personal objectives. £66,000 of this bonus is retained 
and will be paid in FY2010 provided Mr Kelly remains in employment 
with the Company. The performance targets for Nick Bray resulted 
in a bonus of 91% of salary (out of 100%) of which 30% was from 
personal objectives. £44,000 of this bonus is retained and will be paid in 
FY2010 provided Mr Bray remains in employment with the Company.
In respect of the year 2009/2010 the cap on bonuses payable to 
Stephen Kelly remains at 150% of salary and 100% of salary for 
Nick Bray.
Long-term incentives
The board believes that long-term incentive schemes are important 
in retaining and recruiting high-calibre individuals and ensuring 
that the performance of executives is focused on creating long-
term shareholder value. Awards of options or free shares will be 
considered by the committee on an ongoing basis.
The Company adopted the Plan prior to admission to the London 
Stock Exchange in 2005. This is intended to provide a ﬂ exible 
framework to allow the Company to make awards of free shares in 
the form of nil-cost options, conditional awards or forfeitable shares, 
or to grant market value options (‘awards’). Currently, the Company’s 
ongoing policy is to make annual awards of market value options, 
to the executive directors and market value options or nil cost 
options to other senior and key employees. Granting annual 
awards is intended to ensure that executives are not encouraged 
to undertake any undue risks in order to maximise the value of a 
particular award. Market value options are intended to focus the 
executive directors and employees on growing the revenue and 
proﬁ tability of the business.
The targets for market value option awards made to the executive 
directors on 10 July 2009 and during the years ended 30 April 2009 
and 2008 were reviewed by the committee. These require that 
cumulative EPS growth over a three-year vesting period is at least 
equal to RPI + 11% pa (at which point 25% of awards will vest), 
60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI + 13% 
pa and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required 
to be RPI + 15% pa. Straight-line vesting will apply between these 
points. Performance against these objectives is determined by the 
Committee based on the Company’s audited results.
The maximum aggregate value of awards that can normally be 
granted to any individual in any ﬁ nancial year will not exceed two 
times his or her basic salary. For these purposes, the value of the 
awards is deemed to be equal to the market value of free shares 
at the time of the award or, in the case of market value options,

50% of the market value of the shares under option at the time of 
the award (i.e. awards of market value share options with a face 
value up to four times salary can be made each year). This limit may 
be exceeded only where the committee determines that there are 
exceptional circumstances. 
The Company has made awards of market value options with a face 
value that is signiﬁ cantly below the maximum award levels allowed 
under the plan. The awards made in July 2008 had a face value of 
one times salary. This took account of the larger grants made to 
the executive directors on recruitment. As these recruitment awards 
have now vested, the existing award levels would result in overall 
levels of total remuneration that are signiﬁ cantly below the market 
median level. Following the review of remuneration conducted by 
the Committee during the year the Committee has determined that 
for the 2009 and future awards, award levels should be increased to 
3 times salary and 2.5 times salary for the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, respectively.
Medium-term incentives
For the year 2010, the Company has introduced a medium-term 
incentive speciﬁ cally targeted at achieving continued core business 
performance together with the integration of the Compuware and 
Borland acquisitions for a number of key executives. The committee 
believes that successful integration will add signiﬁ cant incremental 
share holder value.
The key measures for the medium-term bonus are; achievement 
of the core business budget in terms of revenues and EBITDA and 
achievement of the planned revenues, EBITDA and key milestones 
from the acquired entities.
The incentive for Mr Kelly and Mr Bray comprises the following 
elements:
•  An incremental bonus of £160,000 to Stephen Kelly and 
£110,000 to Nick Bray that will be paid in Micro Focus shares 
on conﬁ rmation that the targets have been met. These shares 
will vest two years after grant provided that the executive 
remains in employment;
•  A deferred pay rise of £49,500 to Stephen Kelly and £33,000 
to Nick Bray that will be implemented on conﬁ rmation that the 
targets have been met; and
•  That for 2010 the multiple of shares granted to Mr Kelly and 
Mr Bray will be increased by 0.5x salary to 3.5 times salary and 
3.0 times salary respectively.
All-employee share incentives
Executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company 
Sharesave scheme. Under the Sharesave scheme UK employees are 
eligible to acquire shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20% 
of the market value at grant if they agree to enter into a savings 
contract for a period. Consistent with the relevant legislation, no 
performance conditions apply.
Pension contributions
All employees, including executive directors, are invited to participate 
in a Group Personal Pension Plan. All major schemes are money 
purchase in nature and have no deﬁ ned beneﬁ ts. A deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
scheme is operated in Japan, but, given the number of members, 
is insigniﬁ cant for Group purposes. The Group has no obligation 
to the Group Personal Pension Scheme beyond the payment 
of contributions. The Company was not, therefore, impacted 
by the pension’s regime which came into force on 6 April 2006.
The Company contributions for the executive directors are 5% 
of salary. The committee recognises that this contribution is low 
by comparison to the current market, however it does not propose 
to review the contribution rate in view of forthcoming legislation 
on pension contributions.
Pension beneﬁ ts include death in service.
Other beneﬁ ts
Beneﬁ ts in kind for executive directors can include the provision 
of a company car allowance or service, fuel, life insurance and 
medical beneﬁ ts.

1  The performance condition applying to awards made to Nick Bray on 11 January 2006 was based on growth in EPS over a three-year performance period with a minimum 
average annual EPS growth of RPI + 3% (25% of awards vest) and 100% vesting at an average annual EPS growth of RPI + 7%. The market price on the date that Nick Bray 
exercised the share options above was 295p and the total gain on the exercise was £708,000.
2  The performance condition applying to awards granted in the 12 months to 30 April 2007 require that, for any awards to vest, compound annual EPS growth must be at least 
equal to 15% pa. Once this hurdle has been reached, awards may vest, provided revenue growth targets are reached. For 25% of awards to vest, compound annual revenue 
growth must be at least equal to 6%, with awards vesting in full for compound annual revenue growth of 15%. 
3  The performance conditions applying to awards granted in the 12 months to 30 April 2008 and 30 April 2009 require that, for any shares to vest, cumulative EPS growth over 
a three-year vesting period is at least equal to RPI + 11% pa (at which point 25% of awards will vest). 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI + 13% pa and 
for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI + 15% pa. Straight-line vesting will apply between these points. 
On 10 July 2009 market value option awards were granted to Stephen Kelly over 359,660 shares and Nick Bray over 205,520 shares, in each 
case at an exercise price of 353.25 pence. Dates of exercise are from 10 July 2012 to 9 July 2019. The targets for these awards require that 
cumulative EPS growth over a three-year vesting period is at least equal to RPI + 11% pa (at which point 25% of awards will vest). 60% 
of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI + 13% pa and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI + 
15% pa. Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.

The Company uses several key performance indicators internally to monitor the performance of the business against the achievement of 
objectives. A summary of some of the more important KPIs that are used with a brief description on how they are calculated and the results 
for the year are as follows:
Description  Metrics  Performance
Revenue growth  2009  Revenue comprises total revenues including the contribution of acquisitions and is
  20.4% compared with the prior year. 
   
  2008 
  33.0%
 
Adjusted EBITDA margin  2009  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of intangible ﬁ xed assets, 
  43.2% exceptional items and share based compensation charge. The adjusted EBITDA margin
   represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the year. 
  2008 
  38.8%  
Cash generation from  2009  This measure is calculated using the cash ﬂ ows generated from continuing operations
operations 112.9% divided by adjusted EBITDA – the result indicates that the Group is generating cash  
   from its ongoing business which can be used to reinvest in the development 
  2008  of the business including ﬁ nancing acquisitions, fund liabilities and pay dividends 
  97.3%* to shareholders.
   *  amendment made to prior year cash ﬂ ow resulting in a change from last year’s disclosure 108.7%
Adjusted EPS  2009  Adjusted EPS is calculated by taking income for the ﬁ nancial year, prior to exceptional 
  41.51c items, amortisation of purchased intangibles and share based compensation charge, 
   divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
  2008 This measure indicates the ability of the Company to continue to adopt a progressive  
  32.08c dividend policy.
Renewal rates on  2009  Customer retention is an important measure as it supports the maintenance revenue
maintenance contracts 89.5% streams going forward. Renewal rates are calculated as the number of maintenance 
   contracts which were renewed in the period divided by the number of contracts which
  2008 were potentially renewable in the period.

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the 
directors’ remuneration report and the ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements 
for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the directors have elected 
to prepare the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union, and the parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁ nancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the proﬁ t or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
ﬁ nancial statements, the directors are required to:
•   select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•   make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•   state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group 
and parent company ﬁ nancial statements respectively; and
•   prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁ nancial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the ﬁ nancial statements and the directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
annual report conﬁ rm that, to the best of their knowledge:
•   the Group ﬁ nancial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t of the 
Group; and
•   the directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.

We have audited the Group ﬁ nancial statements of Micro Focus 
International plc for the year ended 30 April 2009 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, 
the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, the 
consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement and the related notes. The ﬁ nancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 49, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group ﬁ nancial statements and for being satisﬁ ed that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Sections 
495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements sufﬁ cient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁ cant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁ nancial statements 
In our opinion the Group ﬁ nancial statements: 
•   give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 30 April 2009 and of its proﬁ t and cash ﬂ ows for the year 
then ended; 
•   have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and 
•   have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the 
ﬁ nancial year for which the Group ﬁ nancial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group ﬁ nancial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
•   certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by law are 
not made; or 
•   we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•   the directors’ statement, set out on page 37, in relation to going 
concern; and 
•   the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements of Micro Focus International plc for the year ended 
30 April 2009 and on the information in the directors’ remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
1 Group accounting policies
A Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of Micro Focus International plc have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁ ed by share options measured at fair 
value through the income statement.
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁ cant to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are disclosed 
below in 2, Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
B Consolidation
The ﬁ nancial statements of the Group comprise the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company, its 
subsidiaries, prepared at the balance sheet date. Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating 
policies of the entity so as to obtain beneﬁ ts from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of acquisition is measured 
as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition. Identiﬁ able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁ able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
C Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenues from sales of software licences to end-users or resellers upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery 
of the software and determination that collection of a ﬁ xed or determinable fee is reasonably assured. When the fees for software upgrades 
and enhancements, maintenance, consulting and training are bundled with the licence fee, they are unbundled using the Group’s objective 
evidence of the fair value of the elements represented by the Group’s customary pricing for each element in separate transactions. If evidence 
of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered elements, revenue is ﬁ rst 
allocated to the elements where fair value has been established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements. If evidence of 
fair value for any undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that 
evidence of fair value exists or undelivered elements of the arrangement are delivered.
If the arrangement includes acceptance criteria, revenue is not recognised until the Group can objectively demonstrate that the software or 
service can meet the acceptance criteria, or the acceptance period lapses, whichever is earlier. The Group recognises licence revenue derived 
from sales to resellers upon delivery to resellers, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met, otherwise revenue is deferred 
and recognised upon delivery of the product to the end-user. Maintenance revenue is derived from providing technical support and software 
updates to customers. Maintenance revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, which in most cases is one 
year. Revenue from consulting and training services is recognised as the services are performed. Amounts collected prior to satisfying the 
above revenue recognition criteria are included in deferred income.
D Segmental reporting
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are 
different from those of other business segments. The Group considers there to be only one business segment being the provision of enterprise 
application management and modernization solutions.
E Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those signiﬁ cant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance.
Examples of transactions which may be considered of an exceptional nature include major restructuring programmes or cost of integrating 
acquired businesses.

Consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and notes
Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
for the year ended 30 April 2009 (continued)
F Employee beneﬁ t costs
a) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. All of the major schemes are deﬁ ned contribution plans for which the Group pays 
contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has 
no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee beneﬁ t expense 
when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments 
is available.
b) Share based compensation
The Group operated various equity-settled, share based compensation plans during the year.
For shares or share options granted after 7 November 2002 and vested after 1 January 2005 the fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of the shares or options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about 
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The shares are recognised when the options are exercised and the proceeds received allocated between share capital and share premium.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate for the effects of non transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
G Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars. Items included in the ﬁ nancial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured 
in the functional currency of each entity.
b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
c) Group companies
The results and ﬁ nancial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
i)  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
ii)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the dates of the transactions); and
iii)  all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders’ equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate, with exception for goodwill arising before 1 May 2004 which is treated as an asset of the Company and 
expressed in the Company’s functional currency. Micro Focus 
International plc
Annual Report and 
Accounts 2009

H Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identiﬁ able assets of the acquired subsidiary at the 
date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Each of those cash-generating 
units represents the Group’s investment in each area of operation by each primary reporting segment.
As permitted under IFRS 1, the Group has elected to deem the UK GAAP net book value at 1 May 2004 as the IFRS cost of goodwill 
at transition date.
b) Computer software
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the speciﬁ c software. These costs 
are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to ﬁ ve years.
c) Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects relating to the developing of new 
computer software programmes and signiﬁ cant enhancement of existing computer software programmes are recognised as intangible 
assets when it is probable that the project will be a success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs can be 
measured reliably. Only direct costs are capitalised which are the software development employee costs. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Development costs are amortised from the commencement 
of the commercial production of the product on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected beneﬁ t, typically being three years.
d) Intangible assets – arising on business combinations
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset. Intangible assets are amortised from 
the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives will vary for each category of asset acquired and to date are as follows:
Trade names  Three years
Technology  Seven to ten years
Customer relationships Two to ten years
Non-compete agreements Five years
I Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁ ts associated with the item will ﬂ ow to 
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income 
statement during the ﬁ nancial period in which they are incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the 
cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows:
Leasehold improvements Over the lease term
Furniture and ﬁ xtures  Five to seven years
Computer equipment  One to ﬁ ve years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount 
is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the income 
statement.
J Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
Assets that have an indeﬁ nite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject 
to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiﬁ able cash ﬂ ows – cash-generating units. Micro Focus

Consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and notes
Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
for the year ended 30 April 2009 (continued)
K Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of ﬁ nished goods comprises software for resale and packaging 
materials. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
L Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂ ows, 
discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
M Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance 
sheet.
N Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs incurred in the arrangement of new 
borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted against the capital element of the outstanding borrowing. These costs are then amortised over 
the life of the facility to which the costs relate on the effective interest basis.
O Leases
Leases where the lessor retains a signiﬁ cant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁ ed as operating leases. Payments made 
under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the lease.
P Taxation
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement, except when the tax relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the tax is also dealt with directly in equity.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable proﬁ t or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or 
the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁ t 
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current tax is recognised based on the amounts expected to be paid or recovered under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Q Share capital, share premium and dividend distribution
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
R Financial instruments and hedge accounting
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the 
instrument. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value less the amount of any appropriate provision for 
irrecoverable amounts. Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁ nancial instruments for hedge accounting or trading 
purposes. Micro Focus

All the IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and amendments to existing standards are yet to be adopted by the EU at the date of approval of these 
consolidated statements with the exception of: IFRIC 13, IFRIC 16, IFRS 8, IFRS 3 (revised) and the amendments to IAS 1, IAS 16, IAS 20, 
IAS 23, IAS 27, IAS 32 and IFRS 2. The implementation date for the above will be the annual period beginning on or after the date shown. 
The directors anticipate that the future adoption of these standards, interpretations and amendments listed above will not have a material 
impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by deﬁ nition, seldom equal 
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁ cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are summarised below.
a) Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy 1J. The recoverable 
amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates.
b) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Signiﬁ cant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course 
of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where 
the ﬁ nal tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax 
and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Micro Focus 
International plc

Accounts 2009

Consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and notes
Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
for the year ended 30 April 2009 (continued)
c) Acquisitions
When making acquisitions, the Group has to make judgments and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price. 
Appropriate advice is sought from professional advisors before making such allocations. The valuation of goodwill and other intangibles is 
tested annually or whenever there are changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These tests 
require the use of estimates.
d) Development expenditure
The Group invests in the development of future products in accordance with the accounting policy 1Hc). The assessment as to whether 
this expenditure will achieve a complete product for which the technical feasibility is assured is a matter of judgment, as is the forecasting 
of how the product will generate future economic beneﬁ t. Finally, the period of time over which the economic beneﬁ t associated with the 
expenditure occurred will arise is also a matter of judgment. These judgments are made by evaluating the development plan prepared by the 
research and development department and approved by management, regularly monitoring progress by using an established set of criteria for 
assessing technical feasibility and benchmarking to other products.
3 Financial risk factors
The Group’s multi-national operations expose it to a variety of ﬁ nancial risks that include the effects of changes in credit risks, foreign currency 
exchange rates, liquidity and interest rates.
a) Credit risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Group to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts 
receivable. Cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality ﬁ nancial institutions. The Group provides credit to customers in the normal 
course of business. Collateral is not required for those receivables, but ongoing credit evaluations of customers’ ﬁ nancial conditions are 
performed. The Group maintains a provision for impairment based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable. The Group sells 
products and services to a wide range of customers around the world and, therefore, believes there is no material concentration of credit risk.
b) Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the UK Sterling, the Euro and the Japanese Yen. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and 
liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions, recognised assets and 
liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.
There were no hedging transactions in place at 30 April 2009.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
c) Interest rate risk
The Group’s income and operating cash ﬂ ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk arises from cash deposits. Deposits placed at variable rates expose the Group to cash ﬂ ow interest 
rate risk. Micro Focus

1 Segmental reporting
Primary reporting format – geographical segments
The Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main geographical segments.
�  North America
�  Europe and the Middle East
�  Rest of the World
There are immaterial sales between the geographical segments. The revenue analysis in the table below is based on the location of the 
customers where the order is received which is not materially different from the location of the assets. The operating proﬁ t for each segment 
takes into account the transfer pricing agreements in place between the Group companies.
Segment assets include goodwill, property, plant and equipment, stocks, debtors, operating cash and other intangible assets and exclude 
deferred tax assets. Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and exclude current and deferred tax liabilities. Capital expenditure 
comprises additions to property, plant and equipment.

Details of the acquisitions in the year are shown in note 27.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’) which represent the operations of a country or, in more material 
operations, divisions within a country. It has been determined that the three geographical segments, which form the primary reporting format 
each equate to a CGU. For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined based on 
value-in-use calculations. No impairment charge was required in the year (2008: $Nil) and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to 
date is $Nil (2008: $Nil).
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth 
rate of net operating cash ﬂ ows. These are based on the forecast operating cash ﬂ ows for the next ﬁ ve years based on approved budgets and 
plans. These budgets and plans are based on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU.
�  The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects the market assessment of the time value of money at the balance 
sheet date and the risks speciﬁ c to the CGU. The discount rate applied to each CGU’s operations was 11% (2008: 8.9%).

�  The long-term operating margin assumed for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where 
management believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins. In these instances, expected future 
improvements from sustainable cost savings are also included in management’s assessment of the long-term operating margin. The long-
term operating margin applied to CGUs was 38.6% (2008: 35.6%)
�  Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ﬂ ows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the in the gross 
domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 1.5% (2008: 3%). 
�   Long-term growth and discount rates are applied consistently across all CGUs as:
 – The businesses within the CGUs have similar trading characteristics;
 – Future forecasts are considered to be similar across all CGUs;
 – Business risks are considered to be the same across all CGUs; and
 – The Group has no debt and therefore no gearing across all CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis as at 30 April 2009 has indicated that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment 
model would result in a signiﬁ cant impairment charge being recorded in the ﬁ nancial statements.

13 Trade and other receivables (continued)
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances 
of the individual debtor. Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision 
for doubtful receivables. At 30 April 2009, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature 
of the instrument.
At 30 April 2009, trade receivables of $13.1 million (2008: $7.8 million) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a large number of 
independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default. The amounts are regarded as recoverable. The average age of these 
receivables was 35 days in excess of due date (2008: 32 days).
As at 30 April 2009, trade receivables of $1.6 million (2008: $1.1 million) were either partially or fully impaired. The amount of the provision 
was $1.6 million (2008: $1.2 million). The ageing of these receivables is as follows:
        2009 2008

At 30 April 2009, the carrying amount approximates to the fair value of the instrument due to the instrument bearing interest at market rates 
and/or the short-term nature of the instrument.

18 Financial instruments
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s currency exposures comprise only those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the income statement. 
Such exposures reﬂ ect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of 
the operating unit involved. Note 3 shows the impact of foreign exchange gains in the year.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and beneﬁ ts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided 
by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the consolidated 
balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. T otal capital is calculated as ‘equity’, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.
At 30 April 2009, the Group did not have net debt and therefore no gearing. 
On 13 May 2008, the Company entered into a $40 million credit facility with HSBC Bank Plc and Lloyds TSB Bank plc for general corporate 
purposes. The facility expired on 12 May 2009. 
On 6 May 2009, the Company entered into a $175 million credit facility provided through a syndicated loan consortium comprising Barclays 
Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc to assist with the funding of acquisitions and for general 
corporate purposes. On 12 June 2009, the Company entered into a supplemental agreement for an additional $40 million to assist with the 
acquisition of Borland Software Corporation at an increased offer price.

No deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The 
deferred tax liability above relates mainly to timing differences on acquired intangibles.

The Group has various equity-settled share based compensation plans details of which are provided below.
Share Purchase and Option Plan 2001
The Group had a share based compensation plan (‘the Plan’) under which employees and directors could be granted options to purchase the 
Company’s ordinary shares. On the full listing of the Company to the London Stock Exchange the options were treated as having vested and 
were exchanged for three options in the ordinary shares of the newly listed entity. At this date the Plan was closed for new issues. No options 
were granted under the Plan during the year.

the tax rates at which the deferred tax liabilities in respect of the intangible assets recognised will unwind. The prior year comparatives have 
not been amended as the adjustment is not considered material.
The interim results for the half year to 31 October 2008 included provisional fair values for the acquisitions of NetManage, Inc. and Liant 
Software Corporation. These fair values have been further reviewed as above.

I Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
The basis of preparation and the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial information are set out below.
A Basis of preparation
The Company ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁ ed by the share options at fair value 
through the proﬁ t and loss account and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and all applicable UK accounting standards.
B Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of the Company is United States Dollars. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account.
C Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
D Share capital, share premium and dividend distribution
Ordinary shares are classiﬁ ed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
E Taxation
Corporation tax is payable on taxable proﬁ ts at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes 
and their treatment for tax purposes. A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be a 
suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured 
on a non-discounted basis. 
F Employee beneﬁ t costs
a) Pension obligations
The Company operates a deﬁ ned contribution plan for which it pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been 
paid. The contributions are recognised as employee beneﬁ t expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b) Share based compensation
The Company operated various equity-settled, share based compensation plans during the year.
No expense is recognised in respect of share options granted before 7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2005. For shares or share 
options granted after 7 November 2002 and vested after 1 January 2005 the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for 
the grant of the shares or options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number 
of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the proﬁ t and loss account, 
and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The shares are recognised when the options are exercised and the proceeds received allocated between share capital and share premium.
II Proﬁ t attributable to the Company
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate proﬁ t and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
The proﬁ t for the ﬁ nancial year before dividends for the Company was $46.3 million (2008: proﬁ t $20.7 million).

Certain statements contained in this annual report, including those 
under the captions entitled Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer’s statement, ﬁ nance review, directors’ report, corporate 
governance and remuneration report constitute ‘forward-looking 
statements’. All statements other than statements of historical facts 
included in this annual report, including, without limitation, those 
regarding the Company’s ﬁ nancial condition, business strategy, plans 
and objectives, are forward-looking statements. These forward-
looking statements can be identiﬁ ed by the use of forward-looking 
terminology, including the terms ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘anticipates’, 
‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘may’, ‘will’ or ‘should’ or, in each case, their 
negative or other variations or comparable terminology. Such 
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, 
performance or achievements of the Company, or industry results, 
to be materially different from any future results, performance 
or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking 
statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous 
assumptions regarding the Company’s present and future business 
strategies and the environment in which the Company will operate in 
the future. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among 
others: the level of expenditure committed to development and 
deployment applications by organisations; the level of deployment-
related revenue expected by the Company; the degree to which 
organisations adopt web-enabled services; the rate at which large 
organisations migrate applications from the mainframe environment; 
the continued use and necessity of the mainframe for business critical 
applications; the degree of competition faced by Micro Focus; growth 
in the information technology services market; general economic 
and business conditions, particularly in the United States; changes 
in technology and competition; and the Company’s ability to attract 
and retain qualiﬁ ed personnel. These forward-looking statements 
speak only as at the date of this annual report. Except as required by 
the FSA, or by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation 
to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether 
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

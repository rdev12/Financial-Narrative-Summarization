Strategic report
“ The 2013 results  
show that the Group 
has now firmly 
established itself  
and is now a well-
positioned and 
integrated business.”
Chairman’s 
statement
While TV is core to our business, we believe it is important to diversify 
our business: We have substantially increased marketing and 
customer recruitment from pure online digital marketing initiatives, and 
continue to evaluate complimentary M&A opportunities. At the end of 
the year we purchased the Vernons.com e-gaming business from 
Sportech plc which brought a large database of customers and 
additional product verticals in bingo and sportsbook. We are currently 
applying our proven marketing strategy and I am confident that this 
will provide further opportunities to grow the business.
People
The senior management team has been strengthened for the next 
phase of growth with a number of new roles.
 
Akshay Kumar was appointed as Group Finance Director. Akshay 
served as Group Financial Controller from January 2011 and brings 
considerable strategic and financial input to the Board.
Bjarke Larsen has been made Chief Operating Officer. Bjarke has 
been with the Group since 2007 and is responsible for the day to day 
running of the gaming operations.
The Group also created a new role in 2014 to head up digital marketing 
to further build upon the positive traction gained in 2013, in expanding 
customer recruitment opportunities.
Every member of the NetPlayTV team has contributed to the Group’s 
success during 2013 and I would like to thank them all for their hard 
work and the contribution they have made.
Results overview
NetPlayTV has delivered a record set of 2013 results, with net revenue 
increasing 31% to £28.5m and EBITDA increasing 21% to £5.2m.
The Group has no debt and cash generation continues to be strong 
with the year-end balance increasing £1.6m from £12.3m to £13.9m. 
This is after the dividend payments of £1.2m and the £3.0m acquisition 
of Vernons.com business from existing cash balances.
Looking ahead
The 2013 results show that the Group has now firmly established  
itself and is now a well-positioned and integrated business. 2014 has 
started with a strong increase in the core KPIs that drive the growth  
of the business and I am confident that we will continue to improve 
performance year on year. 
Dividend
During the year the Board announced an interim dividend of  
0.18 pence per share and is proposing a final dividend of 0.32 pence 
per share, subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 29 May 2014, bringing the full year 
dividend to 0.50 pence per share and an increase of 33% on 2013. 
The dividend is payable on 19 June 2014 for shareholders on the 
register on 23 May 2014.
Clive Jones
Non-Executive Chairman
7 April 2014
Dear Fellow Shareholder,
It is a pleasure to report on a very strong set of results for NetPlayTV 
plc for 2013.
Strategy
NetPlayTV’s strategy remained focused on providing our customers 
with the best true multi-channel live gaming experience in the industry 
across mobile, web and TV through acquisition and organic growth. 
The strategy has proved successful and has delivered impressive 
results in 2013 with profit before tax increasing by 33% to £4.2m.
We have continued to develop our relationships with key TV 
broadcasters and signed a new three-year agreement with ITV in  
April to extend the number of nights from four to six per week. In the 
summer of 2013 we entered into our first TV show sponsorship, with 
the SuperCasino brand as headline sponsor for Big Brother and 
Celebrity Big Brother. This was a significant success, and was 
followed up in January 2014 with the sponsorship of Celebrity Big 
Brother, which had the highest viewer numbers since Channel 5  
first produced this show.

Whilst these figures show that NetPlayTV has experienced significant 
growth in these areas with net revenue increasing by a compound 
annual growth rate of 27% since 2010, it illustrates that there is 
considerable market opportunity available to the Group and NetPlayTV 
is well positioned to capitalise on this. The overall UK online gaming 
market (consisting of all online product verticals) and the UK online 
casino market is expected to grow in revenue terms by 12.2% and 
11.8% in 2014 respectively*. Furthermore, the acquisition of Vernons.

Strategic report Overview
Strategic report
Point of Consumption tax
In the March 2013 Budget, the UK Government confirmed its intention 
to apply a ‘Point of Consumption’ (POC) tax to operators providing 
remote gambling into the United Kingdom. As widely reported it is 
currently expected that the POC tax will be applied from December 
2014 and charged as 15% of net revenue.
As a leading operator within the UK gaming market, NetPlayTV will pay 
such POC tax on the majority of its net revenue. We estimate that the 
potential effect of the POC tax on the Group, if the regulation had 
been in place during 2013, would have been a reduction of circa £1.7m 
in profit for the year after incurring a gaming tax charge of £4.2m and 
implementing applicable contractual offsets and cost base 
efficiencies as outlined in points 1 and 2 below.
1. Contractual offsets: NetPlayTV has a number of contractual 
offsets with suppliers, where the revenue generated is directly 
linked to the amount payable to a supplier, and the potential 
additional cost due to the POC tax will consequently reduce the 
amount payable to these suppliers. 
2. Consolidation of locations and cost base efficiencies: 
NetPlayTV currently runs two TV operations: one in the UK and one 
outside the UK. The Group may look to consolidate this into one 
location within the UK and has also already identified further cost 
efficiencies that can be achieved.
In addition to these two factors, the Board believes there are further 
opportunities for the Group to pursue as a result of the POC tax 
charge, including:
3. Opportunity to take market share and consolidation: There will 
be competitors within the UK gaming market who will have very 
low or negative profits after the introduction of the POC tax and 
maybe forced to exit the market
1
. NetPlayTV is well positioned to 
take advantage of a potential increase in market share. This also 
presents further opportunities for NetPlayTV to take part in the 
inevitable consolidation within the industry.
4. Operational gearing: While the POC tax will impact the EBITDA 
margin, the operational gearing in the business means that the 
EBITDA margin will rise again as the business continues to scale.
5. International expansion: Expanding our customer base 
internationally is a longer term objective and will further 
counterbalance the POC tax impact on our business. 
1 A report published by Citi Research “UK Online Gambling: Mitigating the UK Point 
of Consumption Tax” published 23 August 2013 suggests that circa 15% of the 
UK gaming market could be left with low or negative profits post the POC tax and 
maybe forced to exit. They further estimate that 50% of this market share could 
migrate to existing operators giving each a potential 7-11% uplift in revenue.

Strategic 
Priorities
1
Continued focus on core live 
interactive casino
The Group intends to increase UK market share by 
leveraging existing broadcaster relationships and 
expanding commercial advertising to complement the core 
teleshopping airtime. 
It also sees significant growth in the ability to target smartphone and 
tablet customers along with increasing the number of customers from 
pure online acquisition sources.
2
Retention of existing players
Driving player life-time value is key, with 45% of net revenue 
generated from players who have been registered for over 
12 months showing there is significant value in the existing 
customer base.
The Group has very high retention rates and has a dedicated team of 
account managers and retention specialists in place alongside the 
fact that the brand is on terrestrial television every night of the week.
3
Expansion of product offering
The Group is committed to expanding its product portfolio 
and features. For example, in February 2014, the Group 
launched live streaming of the television broadcast direct to 
iPhone and iPad.
The Vernons.com acquisition provides the Group with further product 
differentiation opportunities. For example, it will enable cross 
marketing of the existing live roulette TV product to the Vernons 
customer base as well as pushing the Vernons sportsbook to the 
Group’s largely male dominated SuperCasino database, especially 
with the Football World Cup in the summer of 2014.
4
Consolidation and new markets
Our strategy includes growth both organically and through 
acquisition in both our core UK market and overseas. 
Due consideration will be given to newly regulated markets. Not all 
markets will be attractive dependent on size and tax rates amongst 
other considerations. The Group would look to enter with the right 
media relationship for that particular country. £8.1m

Strategy:  
investment into marketing
On the whole these players are more expensive to acquire 
than untracked customers, however early indications suggest 
that the lifetime value that these players contribute to the 
casino is also significantly higher. Encouragingly the net 
revenue generated by these players has increased by 120% 
between 2012 and 2013.
The graph above shows how pure online digital marketing 
investment has increased by 273% from £1.1m in 2012 to  
£4.1m in 2013.
2013 has been key for diversifying marketing activities, and

Marketing
The Group continued to invest significantly in marketing during 2013 
and this resulted in a 25% increase in new depositing players to 
63,832 and an increase in total depositing players of 30% to 84,833. 
Mobile and tablet is now an integral part of the overall marketing 
strategy and continues to grow well, accounting for 36% of all new 
depositing players, up from 21% in 2012. All TV adverts we produce 
have a strong ‘call to action’ for mobile customers and we expect the 
percentage of new customers from mobile and tablet to continue to 
increase throughout 2014.
In April 2013, a new three year agreement was signed with ITV to 
extend the number of nights the Jackpot247 show is aired on ITV from 
four to six, being Monday to Saturday inclusive. This is testament to 
the success of the format to date and reinforces the proven strategy  
of using TV to target new customers.
In addition, and again in line with the strategy of using TV to target 
new customers the Group entered into its first TV sponsorship deal  
in the summer of 2013 with its SuperCasino brand as the headline 
sponsor of Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother. As part of the overall 
marketing strategy this proved a success and had the desired effect of 
increasing both brand awareness and customer reach leading to the 
decision for the sponsorship again of Celebrity Big Brother in January 
2014. This series of Celebrity Big Brother was the most popular for 
Channel 5 yet with viewing audiences peaking at 4.2 million. 
While player recruitment via TV is still at the heart of the business, 
during the year we increased our investment in pure online digital 
customer recruitment as part of a more diversified marketing strategy. 
This resulted in 27% of new depositing players coming from pure 
online, an increase of 16% since 2012. 
Player retention remains key to the business model and works side by 
side with new player recruitment to ensure the best customer user 
experience, loyalty and in turn player value. In 2013, 45% of net 
revenue came from players who had an account for more than 12 
months, up from 41% in 2012. 
Acquisition
On 31 October 2013, the Group bought Vernons.com, the e-gaming 
division of Sportech plc. Vernons.com operates online casino, bingo 
and sportsbook. The acquisition includes the brand, customer 
database and various other gaming assets. These assets were 
purchased through the Group’s subsidiary NetplayTV Group Limited in 
Alderney for a total consideration of £3 million which was satisfied by 
existing cash balances.
 
This acquisition provides significant synergy opportunities. With 
further product differentiation it will enable cross marketing of the 
existing live roulette TV product to the Vernons’ customer base post 
integration as well as pushing the Vernons’ sportsbook to the Group’s 
largely male dominated SuperCasino database and provide a source 
of new customers, particularly with a view to the Football World Cup 
this year.
Product
The Group’s core product offering throughout 2013 has been interactive 
TV casino via its brands SuperCasino and Jackpot247. With the strong 
interaction between TV and mobile and tablet the Group has been 
continually developing a best in class mobile offering. The success  
of this is illustrated by an increase of 188% in mobile and tablet net 
revenue which in turn accounted for 33% of total net revenue in 2013.
Whilst the primary product vertical for the Group remains casino, with 
the acquisition of Vernons.com brings new opportunities in bingo and 
sports betting. As the acquisition was only at the end of the year, it will 
be 2014 and beyond where the positive effect of these new product 
Delivering against strategy
2013 has seen the Group deliver its third consecutive year of net 
revenue growth in excess of 20% and the first year that gross bets 
exceeded £1 billion. We have continued to focus on our core strategy 
of delivering a cutting edge interactive gaming experience for our 
customers and this has delivered very strong year on year growth with 
net revenue increasing by 31% to £28.5m and EBITDA by 21% to 
£5.2m.
The business has been built on firm footings, is performing well and is 
highly cash generative. With this in mind, the Group is focused on 
diversification both in terms of marketing channels and product 
verticals enabling further customer reach and growth. This is 
illustrated by the strong increase in pure digital marketing, new 
customer numbers and the first acquisition since the business was 
restructured in 2010.
“ The Group continued 
to invest significantly  
in marketing during 
2013 and this resulted 
in a 25% increase  
in new depositing 
players to 63,832.” 11

verticals on the business will really be seen. Sports betting is currently 
only operating online, however we are aiming to launch mobile sports 
betting in Q2 2014, ready for the Football World Cup in Brazil. 
All products are integrated with a single wallet now including bingo 
and sports betting. However in Q2 of 2014 all three brands will be 
moving onto the new state of the art version of the Playtech integrated 
wallet offering. This gives substantial enhancements to CRM and with 
customer retention playing such a key part in the overall offering it 
should bring with it enhanced player loyalty and value.
Results
The Group produced a very strong set of financial results during 2013. 
The core KPIs driving the business are new depositing players and total 
depositing players which increased by 25% and 30% respectively 
compared with 2012. This led to an increase in net revenue of 31%  
to £28.5m and an increase in EBITDA of 21% to £5.2m. 
Whereas marketing expenditure increased by 44% as the Group 
continues to commit to driving strong net revenue growth, operating 
and administrative expenses only increased by 28% and 14% 
respectively in comparison to 2012.
The Group increased cash during 2013 by £1.6m to £13.9m after 
paying £3.0m during the year for the acquisition of Vernons.com from 
existing cash balances.
Trading update & outlook
Q1 2014 was a record quarter for new depositing players and active 
depositing players, up 13% to 19,978 and 23% to 37,467 with net 
revenue increasing by 1% to £7.1m on a very strong Q1 2013 
comparative. The net revenue increase would have been more 
significant if it had not been for SuperCasino’s margin reducing to 
1.5% in February from an average of 2.8% over the prior 12 months  
as a result of several VIP winners. The margin has returned to the 
expected 2.8% in March 2014.
Delivering a truly multi-product interactive gaming experience is still 
an important part of our strategy. Mobile is continuing to show strong 
growth and in February 2014 we launched live, real time TV roulette 
streaming to mobile. Net revenue from mobile contributed 35% of 
overall net revenue in Q1 2014. 
There are substantial product enhancements in the pipeline for 2014 
for both player recruitment and retention. The new version of the 
Playtech single wallet was launched in March for our SuperCasino 
brand and will be rolled out across Jackpot247 and Vernons during 
Q2. This enables enhanced CRM capabilities which in turn should 
further improve player retention and average revenue per user. 
The Group continues to look at potential acquisition opportunities in line 
with the strategy to grow the business to complement organic growth.
NetPlayTV is well positioned in its current markets and has strong 
growth opportunities both in its existing UK market and internationally. 
The Group looks forward to building on the very successful set of 
2013 results.

Financial and

review
“ The Group continues  
to be highly cash 
generative with  
cash generated from 
operations of £6.0m 
(2012: £4.3m).”
Marketing expenses increased by £4.1m to £13.3m (2012: £9.2m). These 
expenses include the cost of the revenue share agreements in respect 
of key broadcast agreements with ITV and Channel 5 as well as TV 
advertising and pure online digital marketing. While clearly an element 
of the marketing expenditure is associated with customer retention and 
loyalty the aggregate marketing expenditure per new depositing player 
has increased by 15%. This is primarily due to an increase in pure online 
digital marketing expenditure. These new player recruitment costs are 
higher than traditional TV player recruitment, however early indications 
suggest that the lifetime contribution of these players should also be 
greater than a traditional TV player.
Operating expenses have increased by £1.4m from £4.9m in 2012 to 
£6.3m in 2013 although have decreased as a percentage of net 
revenue from 23% in 2012 to 22% in 2013. These expenses include 
both variable and fixed costs of the broadcast and gaming operation.
Administrative expenses have increased by £0.4m to £3.7m. This 
increase can be explained by the increase in aggregate staff costs 
which have increased from £2.7m in 2012 to £3.1m in 2013. The 
average headcount has increased by 15% from 78 people in 2012 to 
90 people in 2013 as the Company has expanded some of its 
operations to reflect the increased size of the Group. Administrative 
expenses have reduced from 15 to 13% of net revenue as the 
business starts to scale.
Earnings per share
Reported profit for the year and total comprehensive income was 
£4.1m (2012: £3.6m) resulting in an increase in basic earnings per 
share of 19% to 1.43 pence per share (2012: 1.20 pence per share). 
The Directors have additionally chosen to report an adjusted earnings 
per share as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance 
of the Group. This is calculated on the profit before taxation from 
continuing operations and deducting the cost of amortisation of 
specifically identified intangible assets arising on acquisitions and the 
share based payments.

Overview
NetPlayTV delivered a record set of results in 2013, with a net revenue 
increase of 31% to £28.5m (2012: £21.8m) and profit before taxation 
increase of 33% to £4.1m (2012: £3.1m).
The Group continues to be highly cash generative with cash generated 
from operations of £6.0m (2012: £4.3m) and net cashflow (from the 
online gaming operation) of £4.6m, an increase of £0.6m on 2012. As a 
result the Board has decided to propose that the final dividend per 
share be increased by 42% to 0.32p (2012: 0.225p). The Group’s 
financial position remains strong with cash and cash equivalents at 
the year-end of £13.9m (2012: £12.3m) with no debt.

Adjusted profit for the year was £4.9m (2012: £3.6m) resulting in an 
increase in basic adjusted earnings per share of 32% to 1.68 pence 
per share (2012: 1.27 pence per share). 
Cash balance
The Group’s cash balance increased by £1.6m to £13.9m, which is 
equivalent to 4.7 pence per ordinary share in issue at 31 December 
2013 (2012: 4.3 pence per ordinary share). Of this balance £1.7m is in 
relation to balances which players have in their gaming account on 
deposit with NetPlayTV (offsetting the liability described in Note 19 to 
the financial statements) leaving a corporate cash balance of £12.2m 
(2012: £10.6m), which is equivalent to 4.1 pence per ordinary share 
(2012: 3.7 pence per ordinary share).

During the year the Group has invested additional capital expenditure 
to improve the quality of the on-air broadcast graphics, to upgrade the 
web environment to provide scalability in a new tier-1 hosting facility 
and the purchase of software licenses. All staff costs in relation to 
continual web and other platform development have been expensed 
through the income statement in full during the year.
Dividend
Given the Group’s strong cash generation the Directors propose to 
increase the final dividend by 42% to 0.32 pence per ordinary share.  
If approved at the AGM on 29 May 2014 this dividend will be paid on 
19 June 2014 to shareholders whose names are on the register of 
members at the close of business on 23 May 2014. This payment, 
together with the interim dividend of 0.18 pence per ordinary share 
paid on 11 October 2013, makes a total of 0.50 pence per ordinary 
share (2012: 0.375 pence per ordinary share).
Acquisition of Vernons.com
During the period the Group acquired the assets of Vernons.com from 
Sportech (Alderney) Limited for total cash consideration of £3.0m. 
This transaction was financed from existing cash balances.
The Vernons brand contributed £0.9m to the Group’s net revenue.  
Due to the effective and immediate integration into our existing 
operations we do not prepare a separate contribution statement for 
the Vernons brand.
The Group has incurred no exceptional material expenditure in relation 
to the acquisition of Vernons.com therefore all costs in relation to the 
completion of this transaction have been expensed in the statement of 
comprehensive income through administrative expenses.
Taxation
The Group has £5.9m (2012: £6.7m) of tax losses carried forward 
which equates to a total deferred tax asset of £1.3m (2012: £1.4m).  
Of this the deferred tax asset recognised on the balance sheet is 
£231,000 (2012: £248,000) as this amount is tax benefit is deemed to 
be probable within one financial year and the remaining £1.0m of the 
potential deferred tax asset is unrecognised. The charge through the 
income statement of £17,000 in the year represents the movement in 
the deferred tax asset between 2012 and 2013. The Group works 
closely with its advisers to ensure that its tax position is optimal.

Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties
The risks and uncertainties described below are considered to have the most significant effect on NetPlay’s business and prospects. This list is 
not intended to be exhaustive. NetPlayTV carries out a detailed risk management process to ensure that risks are identified and mitigated where 
possible.
The Board recognises that the nature and scope of the risks can change and so regularly reviews the risks faced by the Group as well as the 
systems and processes in place to mitigate them. 
An explanation of how the Group manages its various financial risks is provided in note 22 to the Financial Statements.
Risk description and potential impact Current mitigation
STRATEGY RISK
Ineffective or non-delivery of the business strategy
The online gaming industry is constantly changing and developing, for 
example the increasing shift in interacting with gaming services with a 
PC or laptop to interacting with a mobile or tablet.
The market for online gaming products and services is characterised 
 by technological developments, new product and service 
introductions and evolving industry standards. Failure by NetPlayTV  
to use leading technologies effectively, develop its technological 
expertise, enhance its products and services and improve the 
performance, features and reliability of its technology and advanced 
information systems, could have a material adverse effect on its 
competitive position.
The Group seeks to identify and anticipate risks regarding our 
assumptions and understanding of the industry and economic 
environment in order to ensure the strategy remains appropriate.
Corporate planning processes are in place to ensure that the strategy 
of the business contributes to the delivery of shareholder value. These 
processes culminate in the setting of an annual budget for the year, 
together with long-range plans for the two following years. Over the 
course of the year these budgets and plans are reconsidered, in the 
light of any market changes, through business reviews and formal 
reforecasts on a quarterly basis.
Acquisition risk
Our strategy includes growth through consolidation in the markets in 
which we operate and through acquisitions in new territories. A poorly 
executed acquisition could lead to lower profitability.
The risks associated with this approach are mitigated through clearly 
defined investment criteria, detailed due diligence by the Group and 
its professional advisers and robust financial and operational 
post-acquisition and integration plans.
During the year, these processes were followed for the acquisition of 
Vernons.com, which was completed in October 2013. 17

Risk description and potential impact Current mitigation
REPUTATIONAL RISK
Under-age and problem gaming
Under-age and problem gaming are inherent risks associated with the 
online gaming industry and the Group is no exception. 
The Group devotes considerable resources to putting in place 
prevention measures coupled with strict internal procedures designed 
to prevent under-aged players from accessing its real money sites. In 
addition, the Group promotes a safe and responsible gaming 
environment to its customers supplemented by its corporate culture.
Information security
NetPlayTV faces external and internal information security risks. 
NetPlayTV receives most of its revenue through debit and credit card 
transactions and operates as an e-commerce business.
A security breach could result in an adverse impact for the business 
and reputational damage.
NetPlayTV focus on the protection of player information. Appropriate 
controls are in place including:
• an effective information security incident management process to 
identify, report and ensure appropriate management of security 
incidents;
• systems which are secured and monitored against unauthorised 
access;
• regular review of the security of internal systems and the brand 
websites through penetration testing;
• pre-employment screening checks performed for all finance 
employees;
• periodic mandatory employee security training to maintain staff 
awareness;
• consideration of information security risks within procurement 
processes; and
• monitoring and control of scanning software for fraudulent 
customer activity by the Fraud & payment processing team.
OPERATIONAL RISK
Gaming/Casino risk and volatility
The Group is exposed to gaming risk in relation to its casino 
operations which could adversely impact its revenue.
The Group’s casinos and other games incorporate a “house edge” 
designed to provide a return to the Group over a large number of bets, 
in the short term the Group’s casinos and other games may 
experience losses.
Wagering limits are in place to mitigate the Group’s exposure to 
individual transactions.
Key personnel
NetPlayTV has operations in various locations throughout the world 
(including Guernsey, Lancaster and Battersea). 
Our success is driven through the development and retention of a 
focused leadership team and a number of skilled specialist employees 
throughout our business.
The performance of the Group is dependent on its ability to attract, 
recruit and retain quality staff in a highly competitive labour market. 
We continue to invest in our people, ensuring that we recruit and retain 
the right calibre of staff with the skills, experience and talent to grow 
the business. We seek to ensure we have appropriate management 
development programmes to assess, manage and develop our 
people’s leadership skills, talents and experiences throughout the 
organisation. 18

OPERATIONAL RISK continued
Dependence on third parties
Due to the nature of live broadcasts, the Group’s business is highly 
dependent on broadcasters, networks, software providers and mobile 
operators, as well as other service providers who, for example, 
provide payment processing and customer age and ID verification. If 
there is any interruption to the products or services provided by other 
third parties or if there are problems in supplying the products or 
services, the Group’s business could be adversely affected.
To mitigate this risk the Group takes care to select third parties that 
are reputable and reliable, and ensures that contractual agreements 
with key third parties offer adequate protection to the Group.
Where commercially viable, NetPlayTV operates with a dual service 
provider. 
Technology risk
As a leading online business, the Group’s technology systems are 
critical to its operation. The Group is reliant on the performance of 
these systems to generate revenue. 
Cutting-edge technologies and procedures are implemented 
throughout the Group’s IT operations which are designed to protect its 
networks from malicious attacks and other such risks. These 
measures include traffic filtering, anti-DDoS (“Distributed Denial of 
Service”) devices, anti-virus protection from leading vendors and 
other such means.
Physical and logical network segmentation is used to isolate and 
protect the Group’s networks and restrict malicious activities. In order 
to ensure systems are protected properly and effectively, external 
security scans and assessments are carried out in a timely manner.
The Group has a high-end storage solution to ensure storage 
availability and performance. All critical data is replicated to another 
storage device for disaster recovery purposes and all data is stored 
off-site on a daily basis. In order to minimise dependencies on 
telecommunication service providers, the Group invests in network 
infrastructure redundancies whilst regularly reviewing its service 
providers.
The Group takes information technology risks seriously and keeps its 
policies under review in order to mitigate these risks.
TAXATION RISK
UK Point of Consumption (POC) tax
The UK Government has confirmed its intention to change the 
licensing regime on remote gambling to a ‘point of consumption’ basis 
on remote gaming operators supplying UK customers. The related 
regulatory and tax legislation is expected to receive Royal Assent in 
the coming months, with the new tax effective from December 2014.
The Group expects to be able to mitigate a portion of this tax by 
contractual offsets, broadcast savings and increased market share. 
More details are available on page 7 of this annual report.
VAT & Corporation Tax
All gaming activities are based in Alderney, where the Group currently 
benefits from a zero corporate tax rate and is outside the scope of UK 
VAT. If there was a change in the rate of corporate tax or VAT in 
Alderney or in UK legislation such that the Alderney subsidiary had a 
place of establishment in the UK for VAT purposes this would have an 
adverse effect on the overall tax rate of the Group.
The Group aims to ensure that each legal entity within the Group is a 
tax resident of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has no 
taxable presence in any other jurisdiction. The Group works closely 
with its tax advisers to make sure that that tax position of the Group  
is optimal.

EXTERNAL RISK
Competition
NetPlayTV operates in competitive market places against both larger 
well established brands and new entrants to the online gaming 
market.
One of NetPlay’s key competitive advantages is its tightly controlled 
cost base. If NetPlayTV lost sight of this or relaxed its stance over cost 
control this could significantly reduce any competitive advantage and 
impact profitability.
Regular monitoring of competitor and consolidation activity.
NetPlayTV seeks to have a rapid response to any such activity that 
may impact NetPlay’s ability to grow the business.
Strong cost control across the Company
Laws, regulations and licensing
During the year, the Group’s gambling activities were operated under a 
licence under the Alderney Gambling Control Commission. The 
regime under which Alderney permits remote gaming operations to be 
operated within its jurisdiction may be altered or restricted through 
legislation in Alderney which renders the Group’s operating base 
unusable or uneconomic. In addition, territories where the Group 
wishes to market its Alderney-based gambling services may impose 
restrictions upon remote gambling services which would restrict the 
Group’s ability to market to potential customers in that territory or to 
service existing customers by, for example, restricting financial 
transactions.
Where such restrictions exist, or come into existence in the future and/
or in each case are actively enforced, the Group would seek to obtain 
gambling and gaming licences local to these territories.
Restrictions on promotion or the operation of remote gambling and 
gaming services in any particular location might also diminish or 
inhibit the Group’s ability to secure distribution in such territories.

Governance
NetPlayTV plc
Corporate 
governance
The following section sets out the key 
governance policies and practices adopted 
by the Group. In common with most other 
companies traded on AIM, NetPlayTV plc is 
not required to follow the guidelines set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the 
Code”) and does not claim to do so. The 
Directors have given consideration to the 
Code and have chosen to provide certain 
information on how the Group has adopted 
various principles of it.
Board
At the date of this report, the Group Board 
was made up of two Executive and four 
Non-Executive Directors. Under the 
Company’s Articles of Association a Director 
shall retire from office at the first Annual 
General Meeting after his or her appointment 
and one-third, but not exceeding one-third, of 
the Directors are required to retire by rotation 
each year.
The Board meets regularly throughout the 
year and all Directors have full and timely 
access to the information necessary to 
enable them to discharge their duties. There 
is a scheduled Board meeting at least every 
month and additional Board meetings are 
held as required.
During the year, the Board met seven times 
and the following attendance occurred:
C Jones CBE 7
C A N Butler 7
G P Stevens 7
A C Lapping  7
T S Mickley 6
A Kumar* 7
* Of the seven meetings attended during 2013, six 
were attended in the role of Company Secretary 
and one as both Company Secretary and Finance 
Director.
The Board is assisted in the discharge of its 
duties by the following Board committees:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which comprises three 
Non-Executive Directors: G P Stevens who 
chairs the Audit Committee; C Jones; and A C 
Lapping. The Audit Committee is responsible 
for ensuring that the financial performance of 
the Group is properly reported on and 
monitored, and for overseeing the operation 
of internal financial controls appropriate to the 
size and operations of the Group. The Audit 
Committee meets twice a year to review the 
results, the findings of the auditors, the 
independence and objectivity of the auditors, 
and the internal controls. It also reviews the 
application and appropriateness of the 
Group’s accounting policies, including any 
changes to financial reporting requirements 
brought about by both external and internal 
requirements and it gives consideration to all 
major financial announcements made by the 
Group including its interim and preliminary 
announcements and annual report and 
accounts.
The external auditors and other Executive 
Directors may be invited to attend the 
meetings.
During the year the Audit Committee met 
twice. G P Stevens and A C Lapping attended 
both meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the 
Committee”), which comprises three 
Non-Executive Directors: G P Stevens who 
chairs the Committee; C Jones; and A C 
Lapping. The Committee has the principal 
function of agreeing with the Board the 
framework and policy for the remuneration of 
the Group’s executive management and 
determining, on behalf of the Board, the 
remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors. The Committee also determines 
the policy on executive appointments.
No member of the Committee has any 
personal financial interest (other than as a 
shareholder), conflict of interest arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day 
involvement in running the business. No 
Director plays a part in any discussion about 
his own remuneration.
The Chief Executive Officer may be invited to 
attend certain discussions of the Committee.
During the year the Remuneration Committee 
met three times. G P Stevens and A C 
Lapping attended all meetings.
Remuneration policy and arrangements
The objective of the remuneration policy is to 
ensure that the Executive Directors and 
managers of the Group are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and 
reasonable manner, rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of the 
Group. Each Director is assessed individually 
so that their remuneration is directly related to 
their performance over time and so that a 
proportion of their remuneration is 
performance related.
There are five main elements of the 
remuneration package for Executive 
Directors:
(i) Basic salary:
An Executive Director’s basic salary is 
determined by the Committee before the start 
of each year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding 
appropriate levels, the Committee seeks to be 
competitive, but fair, using information 
obtained from both internal and external 
sources.
(ii) Performance related bonus:
Performance related bonuses are designed to 
reward contribution and to encourage the 
achievement of targeted levels of 
performance over the short term. The 
maximum cash bonuses are set by the 
Committee and are subject to stretching 
targets linked to the Group’s operating 
performance in the year.
(iii) Long-term incentive arrangements:
The Company’s long-term incentive 
arrangements are intended to encourage 
Directors and other key employees to focus 
on long-term, strategic corporate objectives 
and to further align the interests of 
management and shareholders. These 
arrangements consist of an Enterprise 
Management Incentive Scheme (“EMI”), an 
Inland Revenue approved share option 
scheme and an Inland Revenue unapproved 
share option scheme. Details of these 
schemes are outlined in notes 6 and 25 to the 
financial statements. 23
Governance
NetPlayTV plc
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
(iv) Pension arrangements:
The Group does not operate a pension 
scheme for employees; however it does make 
contributions to personal pension plans.
(v) Other benefits:
Other benefits for Executive Directors include 
a private health care scheme.
Service contracts
C A N Butler has a service agreement, dated 
29 January 2010, which is terminable on six 
months’ notice by either party.
A Kumar has a service agreement, dated 
11 November 2013, which is terminable on 
six months’ notice by either party.
In the event of early termination, the Directors’ 
contracts provide for compensation up to a 
maximum of basic salary plus the fair value of 
benefits to which the Directors are 
contractually entitled for the unexpired 
portion of the notice period. The Company 
seeks to apply the principle of mitigation in 
the payment of compensation on the 
termination of the service contract of any 
Executive Director.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific 
terms of engagement, the dates of which are 
set out below. There are no provisions for 
compensation payable in the event of early 
termination. The Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial period of one year, 
following which the notice period is three 
months.

The determination of the Non-Executive 
Directors’ remuneration has been delegated 
by the Board to the Executive Directors, 
within the limits set by the Articles of 
Association. The fees paid to the Non-
Executive Directors in the year, shown in note 
6 to the financial statements, are inclusive of 
the additional work performed for the Group 
in respect of membership of the Board 
committees. At the 2004 Annual General 
Meeting, shareholder approval was granted to 
allow Non-Executive Directors to participate 
in the Group’s unapproved share option 
scheme.
Relations with shareholders
The Group is committed to ongoing 
communication with its shareholders. At the 
Annual General Meeting, individual 
shareholders are afforded the opportunity to 
question the Board.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
system of internal control established by the 
Group and places considerable importance 
on maintaining a strong control environment. 
However, such a system is designed to 
identify, manage and mitigate rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Key elements of the Group’s system of 
internal control are as follows:
Financial management
Annual budgets are prepared for each 
business division and for the Group. These 
budgets are reviewed and agreed by the 
Board and actual performance is measured 
against these budgets on a regular basis. 
Monthly management accounts are prepared, 
reviewed, analysed and presented to the 
Board. The Group has in place documented 
authority levels for approving purchase 
orders, invoices and all bank transactions.
Company management
The Executive Directors meet regularly to 
monitor and evolve the Group’s strategic 
direction, including product offerings and 
routes to market. In addition, the Chief 
Executive conducts regular management 
meetings to ensure that the strategy is 
cascaded throughout the Group’s operations 
and is being acted upon accordingly.
Risk analysis
The Group maintains a comprehensive risk 
register. The Board approves annual updates 
and appropriate risk mitigating action plans. 24

Directors’  
report
The Directors present their annual report 
together with the audited financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Directors
The Directors who served during the year and 
to the date of this report were:
• C A N Butler  
• C Jones CBE
• A Kumar (appointed 11 November 2013)
• A C Lapping
• T S Mickley
• G P Stevens
Details of Directors’ service contracts are 
contained within the Corporate Governance 
report on page 22. Details of their share 
interests and other details of their 
remuneration by the Company are contained 
in the Directors’ remuneration report in note 6 
of the financial statements.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s financial risk 
management objectives and policies are 
included in note 22 to the financial 
statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business model is set out on 
page 6, Financial and Performance Review  
on page 26, and current trading and outlook 
set out in the Chief Executive’s Review on 
page 15. 
The Group’s budget and forecasts, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group 
should be able to function entirely from its 
cash generated from operations. The Group 
is currently funded entirely through 
shareholders’ funds.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual report and financial statements.
Appointment and replacement of 
Directors
Directors are appointed to, or removed from, 
the Board according to the provisions 
contained in Company’s Articles of 
Association (“Articles”) and the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the 
Articles is available to view on the Company’s 
website www.netplaytvplc.com.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Each of the Directors has been provided with 
a qualifying third-party indemnity from the 
Company. The Company maintains Directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at the Company’s 
registered office: Battersea Studios, 80 
Silverthorne Road, London, SW8 3HE on 
Thursday 29 May 2014 at 14:00.
Directors’ responsibilities in relation to 
the Company’s auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of 
approval of this Directors’ Report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and each 
Director has taken steps that ought to have 
been taken as a Director to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
The auditors, BDO LLP, have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office, and a 
resolution to reappoint them will be proposed 
for the Annual General Meeting in accordance 
with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the Group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. The Directors are also 
required to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with the rules of the London 
Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on the Alternative Investment 
Market.
In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the 
annual report and the financial statements are 
made available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website is the responsibility 
of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
financial statements contained therein. 26

NetPlayTV plc for the year ended 31 
December 2013 which comprise the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the consolidated and company 
statements of financial position, the 
consolidated and company statement of cash 
flows, the consolidated and company 
statement of changes in equity and the 
related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of 
directors’ responsibilities, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (“FRC’s”) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
A description of the scope of an audit of 
financial statements is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditscopeukprivate.com.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 
December 2013 and of the Group’s profit 
for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the 
strategic report and directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters where the Companies Act 
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements 
are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the  
financial statements
All intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
Net revenue comprises gross income less customer incentives 
expensed in the period. Gross income comprises gross gaming win 
and ancillary income.
Gross gaming win represents gross bets and wagers, being amounts 
staked, less player winnings in the financial year. Gross gaming win is 
recognised when the bet or wager is settled.
Customer incentives expensed in the period represent the actual cost 
of customer incentives redeemed as well as an adjustment for the 
movement in the fair value of unredeemed customer incentives.
Ancillary income is predominantly in relation to broadcast airtime and 
is not directly related to the operation of the interactive gaming 
services under its Alderney gaming licence. This income is recognised 
when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and when it is 
probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. 
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) 
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the date of the statement of financial position.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying 
amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of 
financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences 
arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is 
not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and
• investment in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference 
and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances 
where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and 
are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are 
settled/(recovered).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and 
1. Accounting policies
General information
NetPlayTV plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, “the 
Group”) operate a number of interactive gaming services under an 
Alderney gaming licence, including Supercasino.com, Jackpot247.
com and Vernons.com. The Group is focused on the delivery of a 
converged interactive gaming experience allowing its customers to 
interact with its games on a variety of platforms: TV, internet, mobile 
and tablet from a common integrated wallet.
The Company is admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London 
Stock Exchange. It is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The 
address of its registered office is Battersea Studios, 80 Silverthorne 
Road, London, SW8 3HE.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of both 
the company and the consolidated financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting 
Standards and Interpretations (collectively IFRSs) issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“adopted IFRSs”).
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted 
IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the 
Group’s accounting policies. The areas where significant judgements 
and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements 
and their effect are disclosed below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of 
the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 
each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of 
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
credited to profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
The profits or losses of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. The results of those subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. 35

consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit 
or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination 
over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 1 
January 2010, the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of 
business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total 
acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost 
comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity 
instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition. Changes in 
the estimated value of contingent consideration arising on business 
combinations completed by this date are treated as an adjustment to 
cost and, in consequence, result in a change in the carrying value of 
goodwill.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, 
cost comprised the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and 
equity instruments issued. Contingent consideration is included in 
cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent 
consideration classified as a financial liability, re-measured 
subsequently through profit or loss. For business combinations 
completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are 
recognised immediately as an expense.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in 
carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Customer databases
Externally acquired customer databases are capitalised at cost and 
are subject to 50% straight-line amortisation.
Customer databases acquired as part of business combinations are 
valued by estimating discounted cash flows that will be generated by 
the assets over their lifetime and are subject to 50% straight-line 
amortisation.
The carrying value of player databases is reviewed when there is an 
indication of impairment.
Internally generated player databases are not capitalised.
Brands
Brands acquired as part of business combinations are valued by 
applying a royalty rate to the estimated discounted future revenues 
that will be generated and are subject to 10% straight-line 
amortisation.
the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same 
tax authority on either:
• the same taxable Group company; or
• different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which 
significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
expected to be settled or recovered.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the 
case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared 
by the Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved 
by the shareholders at the AGM.
Pension costs
The Group makes contributions to defined contribution plans. The 
Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The 
Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit 
expense when they are due. 
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which they 
operate (their “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling 
when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled 
monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated 
into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the 
transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas 
operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those 
operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. 
Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at 
opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
foreign exchange reserve.
Exchange differences recognised as profit or loss in Group entities’ 
separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary 
items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas 
operation concerned are reclassified to other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange 
differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that 
operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost over their estimated 
useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation, as follows:
Computer equipment  33.3% straight line
Fixtures & fittings 33.3% straight line
Leasehold improvements  Shorter of the unexpired period of the 
lease and the estimated useful economic 
life of the assets
The gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is expensed to profit or loss for the period.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to 
the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial 
assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments.
Financial assets
Financial assets held by the Group consist of loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
arise principally through the provision of services to customers, but 
also incorporate other types of contractual monetary assets. They are 
initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried 
at cost less impairment provisions.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective 
evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group 
will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms 
receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference 
between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. Trade 
receivables are reported net of impairment provisions, with 
impairment losses being recognised within administrative expenses in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On 
confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross 
carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated 
provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other 
receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. Cash and cash equivalents includes 
cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and, 
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of trade payables and 
other short-term monetary liabilities.
Websites and other development costs
Website and other development expenditure relating to the application 
and infrastructure development of websites is capitalised where the 
expenditure leads to substantially improved products or processes, 
the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible 
and the Group has sufficient resources to complete the development. 
All other development expenditure relating to planning, content 
development and other operational activities is charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income in the period it is incurred. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it clearly increases 
the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
Website expenses are capitalised at cost and are subject to 50% 
straight-line amortisation. The carrying value of websites is reviewed 
when there is an indication of impairment.
Domain names
Externally acquired domain names are capitalised at cost and are 
subject to 10% straight-line amortisation.
Domain names acquired as part of business combinations are valued 
by estimating discounted cash flows that will be generated by the 
assets over their lifetime and are subject to 10% straight-line 
amortisation.
The carrying value of domain names is reviewed when there is an 
indication of impairment.
Partner relationships
Partner relationships entered into as part of a business combination 
are valued by estimating discounted cash flows that will be generated 
by the assets over their lifetime and are subject to straight-line 
amortisation over the life of the relationship. Their carrying value is 
reviewed when there is an indication of impairment.
Internally generated partner relationships are not capitalised.
Investments (Company accounts)
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the fair value of 
the consideration paid plus share based payments granted by the 
Company to employees of the subsidiary incurred to date. 
Investments that were acquired prior to the Company’s conversion to 
IFRS are held at cost, where cost is the aggregate of the nominal value 
of the Company’s shares and the fair value of any other consideration 
given to acquire the share capital of the subsidiary undertakings. 
Provision is made where there is an impairment in the value of the 
investment.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated in the statement of 
financial position at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.

Financial statements
NetPlayTV plc
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group 
to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of 
policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
other factors including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Included below are the areas that the Directors consider require 
estimates, judgements and assumptions which have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and 
their values are written-down on the basis of the Group’s expectations 
of future economic benefits expected to be received by the Group.
Any process which attempts to estimate future outcomes is subject to 
uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation uncertainty can 
give rise to material differences in asset carrying values, this will be 
stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, are recognised for temporary 
differences and for tax loss carry-forwards. The valuation of 
temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards, is based on 
management’s estimates of future taxable profits in different tax 
jurisdictions against which the temporary differences and loss 
carry-forwards may be utilised.
At 31 December 2013, the value of deferred tax assets recognised 
amounted to £231,000 (2012: £248,000). The deferred tax assets 
relating to loss carry-forwards are reported as non-current assets.
Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired with 
business combinations
Identified intangible assets and goodwill are capitalised at fair value 
when entering into a business combination. Establishing the fair value 
of the assets generally requires use of a technique such as 
discounting expected future cash flows.
Any process which attempts to estimate future outcomes is subject to 
uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation uncertainty can 
give rise to material differences in asset carrying values, this is stated 
in the relevant notes to the financial statements (note 14). 
Standards and interpretations
None of the new standards, interpretations and amendments, which 
are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2013 are expected 
to have a material effect on the Group’s future financial statements.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of any 
transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument 
and subsequently at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Company’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made. Provisions for onerous contracts are 
recognised when the expected benefits to be derived from contracts 
are less than the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under 
the contracts. Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
amounts that are expected to be paid to settle the obligations.
Share based payments
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair 
value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
Where equity settled share options are awarded to parties other than 
employees in exchange for services performed, the fair value of the 
options at the date of grant is charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income over the expected lifetime of the services 
received by the Group.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the 
number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date 
so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting 
period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. 
Non-vesting conditions and market vesting conditions are considered 
when calculating the fair value of the options granted.
The fair value of share options issued without market-based vesting 
conditions is measured by the application of the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model by reference to the grant date of the options. The fair 
value of share options issued with market-based vesting conditions is 
measured by use of the Monte Carlo method.
Capital management
The Group is funded entirely though shareholders funds. If financing is 
required the Board will consider whether debt or equity financing is 
more appropriate and proceed accordingly. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are based on historical experience, 
expectations of future events, and other factors deemed to be relevant 
in the circumstances.

2. Segmental information
The Board is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments based on the information 
reviewed by the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Group has one reportable segment, being the 
online gaming segment. This division consists of all online products and ancillary income. The brands operated in this division are Supercasino.
com, Jackpot247.com and Vernons.com which are aggregated into one reportable segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The 
Board evaluates performance on the basis of segment EBITDA. This measurement basis excludes head office costs not derived from operations 
of any segment and are only disclosed in total.
The Group holds some domain names as specified in note 15 in the British Virgin Islands.

NetPlayTV Broadcasting Limited in December 2006. £1,050,000 of goodwill, relating to the Jackpot247 (formerly known as Challenge Jackpot) 
cash generating unit, arose on the business combination due to the acquisition of certain assets from Two Way Gaming Limited and the 
simultaneously entering into production and gaming contract with Virgin Media Television to operate the Jackpot247 Service in May 2009.

Limited in October 2013, as described in note 28. The recoverable amount of the SuperCasino, Jackpot247 and Vernons.com cash generating 
units, to which this goodwill has been allocated, has been determined using value in use calculations.
The calculation of value in use is based on several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player behaviour. The key 
assumptions of the forecast were as follows:
• number of new player depositing registrations;
• rate of retention of existing players;
• spending patterns of players;
• cost per acquisition (CPA) from different acquisition sources;
• the growth rate applied to cash flows arising after the end of approved budgets; and
• the discount rate applied to cash flows.
The above assumptions are based on past experience, as considered appropriate for any external influences. For example a planned increase 
of marketing activity or TV airtime would be expected to increase player registrations.
Management forecasts cover a 12-month period and beyond that no growth rate is applied to cash flows. A discount rate of 13.7% has been 
used over five years.
The Directors do not believe that any reasonably possible change in key assumptions would lead to an impairment of the carrying amount of the 
SuperCasino, Jackpot247 or Vernons.com cash generating unit.
£2,000 of goodwill arising on the consolidation of NetPlay IP Limited was disposed of in the year ended 31 December 2012 as this company was 
dissolved.

The Group holds several highly desirable domain names which were acquired as part of the Bingos transaction in 2008, some of which being 
.de, .fr and .it domains, are particularly attractive for use in the German, French and Italian markets respectively. These domain names are held 
by NetPlayTV Marketing BVI Limited, a company resident in the British Virgin Islands. During the year, the Directors of the Group have 
considered any indications of impairment and have come to the conclusion that there are none.
The useful economic life of a domain name will be affected by the demand for the game or product to which it relates (e.g. the relative demand 
of bingo compared, for example, to poker). In recent years, the directors have noted that, whilst customers’ interest in online gaming products in 
general remains robust, their interest in specific games is becoming more transitory and susceptible to prevailing trends. In consequence, the 
directors have revised the useful economic life of the Group’s domain names from 20 to 10 years. This will have the effect of increasing the 
annual amortisation charge by £98,000.
Domain names with a cost of £225,000 and amortisation of £75,000 and therefore a net book value of £150,000 were disposed of during the 
year ended December 2012 as part of the discontinued operations disclosed in note 3.

A contract relating to the provision of software infrastructure services was acquired as part of the Vernons.com business combination during the 
year ended December 2013. The contract, which is for three years, is considered onerous as the level of minimum revenue guarantee did not 
exceed the maximum projected revenues associated with the sportsbook to which it related. The provision is based on the present value of the 
element of the minimum revenue guarantee which is considered onerous.

Treasury management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, along with various items, such as trade receivables and payables.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies 
for managing these risks and the policies adopted have been applied throughout the year and since the year end.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. Customer funds are 
kept in dedicated client accounts, separately from the Group’s operational bank accounts in order to ensure that their liability is met.
The Board receive information of cash balances daily in order to keep the Group’s liquidity under review.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. 
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from cash in transit, though this exposure is relatively small given that the Group’s payment 
processors generally hold only a few days’ transactions at any given time.
Credit risk also arises where cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks or financial institutions. It is the Group’s policy to deposit 
funds only with reputable institutions, and to keep the position under review.

Market risk
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has assets and liabilities denominated in both sterling and euros. The Group’s policy, where 
possible, is to settle liabilities with cash generated from operations denominated in the same currency.
The Directors receive a daily summary of cash balances held in each currency and regularly monitor the foreign currency risk exposure.
Current assets and liabilities denominated in Euros (EUR) and US Dollars (USD), translated into sterling are included within the statement of 
financial position as follows:

A strengthening/weakening of 10c of the Euro against sterling at the reporting date would result in a decrease/increase in net assets of £65,000 
(2012: increase of £44,000). A strengthening/weakening of 10c of the US Dollar against sterling would result in a decrease/increase of £18,000 
(2012: £nil).
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from cash balances it holds. At 31 December 2013, if interest rates on cash deposits had been 10 basis 
points lower/higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and net assets would have been £13,000 lower/higher 
(2012: £12,000).

Market risk
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Company has investments in subsidiaries which have assets and liabilities denominated in euros.
The Company has no direct exposure to foreign currency risk as it has no monetary assets or liabilities denominated in any foreign currencies. 
The only subsidiary with any foreign exchange risk exposure is NetPlayTV Group Limited. The potential exposure has been detailed in note 22.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Company’s interest rate risk arises from cash balances it holds. At 31 December 2013, if interest rates on cash deposits had been 10 basis 
points lower/higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and net assets would have been £7,000 lower/higher 
(2012: £7,000).

25. Share based payments
The Group has four employee share schemes – the 2000 All Employee Share Ownership Plan (“AESOP”), the 2000 Enterprise Management 
Incentive Scheme (“EMI”), the 2000 Approved Executive Share Ownership Scheme (“ASOS”) and the 2000 Unapproved Share Ownership 
Scheme (“USOS”). To date, the Group has granted options under the AESOP and EMI schemes.
AESOP
The AESOP holds shares in trust on behalf of employees. Subject to the satisfaction of any performance condition and the continuous 
employment of the beneficiary, access to shares occurs three years from the date of grant, unless there is a change in control of the Company 
when access may occur earlier.
A summary of activity in shares issued through AESOP is shown below:

The market value of the shares held by the AESOP at 31 December 2013 was £20,236 (2012: £11,492). 56

NetPlayTV plc
EMI
Options to acquire ordinary shares under the EMI may be granted up to a maximum of £3,000,000 (based on the market value of the shares 
placed under option at the date of the grant).
The determination of the number of options granted to employees is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
No consideration is payable for the grant of an option and options are not transferable or assignable. Cash consideration is paid to the Company 
by the employee at the point that the share options are exercised. The price paid for share options by employees is determined at the time of 
grant, and is normally equal to the mid-market share price on the date that the option is granted.
An option is normally exercisable in stages between the 1st and 10th anniversaries of the date of grant. All options normally lapse if the option 
holder ceases to be employed by the Group, though at the discretion of the Company and depending upon the circumstances in which the 
employment has ended, some individuals may be permitted to retain options after they leave employment for six months, or an alternative 
timescale if agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
Options to subscribe under various schemes for ordinary shares of 1p, including those noted in Directors’ interests in note 6, are shown in the 
table below:

28. Acquisitions
On 31 October 2013 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Vernons.com, the e-gaming division of Sportech plc, from Sportech (Alderney) 
Limited. The principal reason for the acquisition is to enhance the Group’s scale and product offering. Details of the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows:
Fair Value 
£ 000s
Intangible assets
Customer database 2,555
Brand 460
Property, plant and equipment 50
Other receivables 416
Other payables (624)
Provisions (note 20) (413)
Total Net Assets acquired 2,444
Consideration 3,000
Goodwill 556
Acquisition costs of £32,000 arose as a result of the transaction. These costs have been recognised within administrative expenses in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Since the date of acquisition, Vernons.com has contributed £902,000 to the Group Net Gaming Revenue. If the acquisition had occurred on  
1 January 2013, the Group net gaming revenue would have been £4,412,000. It is impractical to consider the effects on the Group profit as 
business expense have not been attributed by brand.
